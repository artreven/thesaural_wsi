21st Street–Queensbridge
is a
station
on the
IND 63rd Street Line
of the
New York City Subway . Located at the intersection of 21st Street and 41st Avenue in the
Queens
neighborhood of
Queensbridge, Queens , it is served by the
F
train at all times.
This was the line's northern
terminal
until the 63rd Street Connector to the
IND Queens Boulevard Line
opened in December 2001. The tunnel had gained notoriety as the "tunnel to nowhere," as the line only had one stop in
Queens
before the connection to the Queens Boulevard Line was completed, almost thirty years after construction of the tunnel began.
The station's only mezzanine is towards the east end of station. It has two street stairs at the northeast corner of 21st Street and 41st Avenue. Elevator and escalators are at northwest corner of the same intersection. A tower remains on west end of
Manhattan -bound platform and can be used if necessary. Double crossover switches remain to the west of the station, reflecting its former use as a terminal station. The platform edge does not have the yellow tactile strip with bumps, characteristic of newly renovated stations.
