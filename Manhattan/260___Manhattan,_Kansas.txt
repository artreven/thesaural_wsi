Plot summary
The novel is separated into three parts, "Winter Kitchen", "Summer
Kitchen", and "Oz Circle". The primary focus is put on Jonathan, a
gay
male actor with
AIDS

Manhattan , Kansas and the "real" (but imaginary)
Dorothy
on whom the book's fictional version of L. Frank Baum based the character.
Other characters include Baum, who makes an appearance as a
substitute teacher in Kansas. Millie, a makeup girl on the set of the
original
film version
film narrates an encounter with
Judy Garland , its lead actress.
The above plot summary was taken from
Wikipedia

My review .
I've taken a few days to mull this book over.  I loved the premise for the book as it takes you on a journey of discovery and at times the fiction and factual side of the story become blurred and you're not sure which is truth and which is fiction.  I think most of us will at some point have seen The Wizard of Oz and this book expands on the story rather well.
As it says above the book is written in three parts and has three stories that are interlinked.  We are introduced to the real Dorothy and her family (fictionary characters) who Frank Baum based Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz on for the purpose of this story.  Frank Baum is real and we are introduced to other real people namely Judy Garland through her make up assistant Millie.  Finally we have Jonathan the gay male actor dying of AIDS who is on a journey of discovery and wants to find out the truth behind the fiction.  The three stories are linked all the way through the book and the part based on Frank Baum and the real characters plays a very minor part to the story as a whole.  The story about Dorothy forms the greatest part and to me was the most interesting really.
I really sympathised with Dorothy at the start of the story and felt for her.  Her life living with her Uncle and Aunty was at times very hard but was a reflection I feel of life during the late 1800's for a lot of people.  It is quite a dark story and what happens to Dorothy while she lives with her Uncle and Aunty has far reaching effects on how she turns out as an Adult.
I liked the way that characters out of the Dorothy part formed part of the Jonathan story and linked the book together as one rather than completely separate stories.
I will read more books by this Author and felt the book was quite well written on the whole but that perhaps some of it could have been left out.

Saving most of my thoughts for the 'spoiler' discussion I'll be starting shortly for the reading group.
But I agree that the Dorothy-in-Kansas sections were the most effective.  Although I don't think the novel would have worked so well without the later segment where Dorothy's life intersects with a character who later becomes integral to Jonathan's life, I never really engaged with Jonathan's own story, and felt as though that particular aspect of the 'framework' was a bit over-stretched, really.  On the plus side, it's Dorothy's story that makes up the bulk of the novel, and that is
really
good.
I read it first quite a few years ago then re-read it last month for the reading group, and found I took completely different things away from me on each reading. Definitely an interesting book!

Just finished this, and many thanks, Su, for swapping your copy with me.
I found this book totally involving and I loved it. The Dorothy story was good, though I found it depressing given the grim times, beliefs and location and I found it did go on a bit; in fact I preferred Jonathan's input and the shorter episodes devoted to Judy Garland and her mother. Hallucinations, ghosts, fantasy, call it what you will, this is not a book to be forgotten.

That's what I was referring to when I wrote my bit but didn't want to say too much about who it was so as not to spoil the story for anyone.  If it wasn't for you Su, I'd possibly never have found this story.

To be fair, the historical Kansas sections really are quite bleak...  Maybe that's one of the reasons they are spliced with the other strands of story.  Although I found the sections about Frances Gumm/Judy Garland really quite sad, too...

Should I start the reading group/spoiler thread early, do you think?  Discussion is not due until May 28th, but would it matter if we started a little ahead of time?

My Review
I think it is safe to say this is the first book I have read like this.
We all (or most of us) know the story of the wizard of Oz and this is a
tale with some of the characters and the basic information as a back
drop.
The story splits into 3 main parts, that of Dorothy, Judy Garland
and Jonathan.
The characters and dates split off into different
chapters and go back and forth and will paint you a picture that is very
different to the Oz we know, or make you think of it in a different
way. I must admit, I loved some of this book and I struggled with
some of it.
The bits I liked where fabulous and even after a few days
since finishing it - I am still thinking about it.
The bits I didn't
like were mostly things I was confused on and found some of the time
changing and so many characters a bit much for my brain to comprehend,
at times.
However the story is really good and evokes a host of
emotions as you follow the characters lives. I was captured
mostly with the Dorothy and Jonathan side of the story and if I am
honest there is a few characters I felt I wouldn't have missed had they
been dropped out but that said I am biased because I wanted it to be all
Dorothy & Jonathan.
I think for those coming in with Oz in mind
you need to keep an open mind as this is only some of the characters and
not the story of Oz and some of it is a fair bit darker. I loved
that at the end the author has taken the time out to shed some light on
what parts are real and the where and how he got his information.
This
cleared a lot up for me and I am sure a lot of other readers will
appreciate it too. I would definitely read more by this author
and for a first attempt I am giving a 3/5, it might not be your cup of
tea but then again you might just love it!
