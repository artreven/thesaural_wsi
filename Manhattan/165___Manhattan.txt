Who is Wendi Deng Murdoch (Chinese)?
Jul 19

Personal life
Husband
Rupert Murdoch
and
Wendi
in 2011
here’s another link about
James Murdoch
son of Rupert:
http://www.geni.com/people/James-Murdoch/6000000006580593073  if you look at it the family is intermarried with
Jewish people
and James’ mother is Jewish surname “Mann.”  Wendi is no ninja she’s a pushy Chinese woman with a history of home wrecking…stealing white men from their white wives right under their noses! Read more from wiki:
After entering the
United States , Deng lived with the Cherry family for a while when attending university. Mrs. Cherry suspected her husband was having an affair with Deng (30 years his junior) and demanded she leave the house. Mr. Cherry soon followed and moved in with her. [5]
The two married in 1990. [4]
Deng and Cherry’s marriage lasted 2 years and 7 months before they were legally
divorced , [5]
but he would later explain they only stayed together for 4 or 5 months, [4]
after which he learned of the extramarital relationship Deng had with
David Wolf . [4]
Nonetheless, she had been able to secure a
green card
through being
legally married
to Cherry. [4] [5]
In 1997, Deng met
Rupert Murdoch
at a company party in
Hong Kong . [6]
Deng and Murdoch married in 1999, [10]
less than three weeks after his divorce from
ex-wife
Anna Maria Torv Murdoch Mann was finalized. [10]
They live in
Manhattan
with their two daughters: Grace Helen Murdoch (born 2001) and Chloe Murdoch (born 2005). Deng is pro- vegan . [11]
An opportunist extraordinaire and proven three-time home wrecker.  Who cares if she is pro vegan? I don’t. But like any good
Jewish
man he got himself an
Asian
who pushed out the old wife and replaced her.  Murdoch’s first wife was Jewish.  Why would a non Jew marry a Jew? Don’t think so.  I think we can be pretty sure that his children are both Jewish since their mother was Jewish.  As usual wikipedia and other engines are hiding that these people are intermarried with Jews and are Jewish themselves.  That way no one can say that Jews don’t own or have not taken over the media and the money of the world.  Remember this: you only need say or write the word “Jew” you are anti-semitic too.  Nevermind the fact that I write about all races and ethnic groups identifying them where I can or where it seems needed.  No, I am anti-semitic because I call out Jews does not matter that I talk equally about any an all news stories that  come my way.
