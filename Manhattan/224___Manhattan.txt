There’s No Do-Overs
Posted on
September 29, 2010

Wednesdays usually require some needed relaxation after the day is done in the
advertising
biz (most likely due to the mid-week spike in motivation by everyone and then the realization that there’s only one good solid day of work left to please your clients before a bad case of the “Friday’s” hit). But besides a good kiss from my better half, there’s nothing that puts me in a better place than skipping through hundreds of photos and fiddling in
Photoshop . The cherry on top is that I get to look through photos of a place I’d recently been to, and probably won’t get to see again for a long, long time- if ever again.
Looking through the shots I took in
New York
City makes me realize why I love photography. It’s not about holding onto what was once a good time, but remembering and reminding yourself about how lucky you are in life and how fast it goes by. Each photo is moment captured that shows where you were or who you were with, and you’ll never be there at that moment or at that age ever again. Technically, there’s no do-overs.
That’s also why it’s so important to be appreciative. I try to remind myself of this every day, but it’s easy to get lost in the stress and panic the day-to-day can bring us. Luckily enough for me, I’ve got a couple thousand reminders from this trip, so there’s no excuses.
I hope you enjoyed them and if you’re interested in hanging some up on your walls, take a gander at my
online shop . And of course, there will be more to come!

The Most Photogenic City

Click to enlarge.
Our latest adventure brought us to
New York
for our one year anniversary, and I’m glad the trip ended when it did because I had no space left on my memory cards. It was my first time to the city, and I think I captured enough “postcard” photos of
Manhattan
to send out for the next three years. So, that means you’ll be seeing pics as I trickle them into this blog every now and then.
The photo above was taken from a ferry on our way to the
Statue of Liberty . The sailboat going by tours the city’s harbors, and we got to experience that a few days later. Overall, I thought the city was breathtaking, and I couldn’t get enough of the skyline. It’s one of those cities where it
is
just like the movies, and well, if you love photography, then it’s a small piece of heaven.

Make Your Own Chipotle Rice

I know there are others of you out there who adore
Chipotle’s
food, and especially that rice of there’s they got going on. And some of you are saying Chipotle who? Even better. When you make this recipe it will be a whole new rice experience to enjoy! A common pairing at this restaurant chain is their spicy chicken over rice, which I prefer, so when conjuring up tonight’s dinner I thought about making a spicy breaded chicken to go with it.
Full recipe below.
Chipotle Rice Recipe
(This is not the “official” recipe, but I find this version to be easy to make getting you the same outcome)
4 cups long grain white rice
4 cups water
2 tsp salt
4 tbsp oil (canola/vegetable)
6 tsp fresh cilantro
1 to 2 limes (Depending on your preference; I cut them into 4 pieces making them easier to squeeze)
Boil water and then throw in rice and salt, stir and remove from heat. Keep covered to allow rice to steam and soften. Then put in a large mixing bowl, add the oil, cilantro and lime juice. Toss until mixed. Serve immediately.
Chicken (if you’re curious)
I used Hot n Spicy
Shake and Bake
over boneless skinless chicken breasts. Cooked as instructed on the package.
That’s it!

The Tabby Cat

I recently got to spend some time on a farm and was welcomed by one of the most common farm animals. No, not cows- cats! And in particular, the
tabby cat
which is most commonly known for its tiger-like stripes and displaying an “M” mark on its forehead. The word “tabby” actually refers to their unique coat of hair. I couldn’t get too close to this one though, being an “outsider” on the farm, so it’s a good thing I had my zoom lens to get some good shots.
You can find some of these at my online store!  Click here . Below is a cat “posse” shot (this is probably only half of them). They probably thought I had food.

Photographing My First Engagement Session

I recently shot my first engagement session and I must say I got lucky. I spent the morning with Alyssa and Cody and they made it easy to get some beautiful shots. We started by a small pier on
Random Lake, WI
where they got engaged and later headed into town to get some shots by this brick building with an amazing leafy vine that really complemented Alyssa’s shirt! I was honored they thought of me to take these special photos and I had a lot of fun doing it. We laughed, we trespassed, and then we ate Panera. What could be better?
I wanted to post only a few photos of the morning, but there were so many lovely shots I couldn’t decide! So here’s more than a couple…
