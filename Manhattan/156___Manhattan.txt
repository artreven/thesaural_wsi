Alys Robi, Canadian singer died he was , 88.
Alice Robitaille , from
Quebec City , was a translator (to French) and singer of Latin American songs, who performed under the
stage name
Alys Robi died he was , 88..
(February 3, 1923 – May 28, 2011)
Youth
Born in 1923 in the
Quebec City
neighbourhood of Saint-Sauveur, Robitaille displayed talent for singing and acting at a very young age. She first performed on-stage at the
Capitol Theater
at 7. At the time, she had already sang on-air with the
CHRC
radio station and was a real phenomenon with the whole city. [1]
Career
At 13 she moved to the Théâtre National, on
Montreal ‘s
Saint Catherine Street . [1]
Under the direction of
Rose Ouellette , she learned acting and singing during a 75-week engagement. She continued her career in the Montreal
cabarets , making radio appearances. For a time during the war, she also hosted a French radio show named
Tambour battant
(“Rumbling drum”). Touring Canadian military bases propelled her career across Canada. [1]
During the 1940s, she started producing
78s
and she became renowned way beyond
Canada . She captured popular imagination with
Latin
rhythms like
Besame Mucho
and
Tico tico , after translating herself the Spanish or Brazilian songs into French. [2]
She sang in chic
New York
cabarets by the mid forties and in 1947, she travelled to
England
where she made an appearance on the first regular
BBC
program .
Mental health
In 1948, while traveling by car to
Hollywood , she was injured in an accident, and entered a period of depression. [3]
After a series of unfortunate diagnoses, and a failed romance, she suffered a
mental breakdown
and was interned for several years in a Quebec City asylum. [1]
She was at some point subjected to a
lobotomy
against her will. [4]
She credited the operation with her recovery:
“Je me réveillai guérie et j’ai compris plus tard que j’avais été un des rares cas réussis de lobotomie”
(I woke up better and later understood that I was one of the rare lobotomy success stories). [5]
In 1952, she was released. The same year, she came back on stage at the Casa Loma and the Montmartre, but her efforts were impeded by
taboos
about mental problems and she never regained the same level of popularity.
Later years
In the early 1990s, Alys returned into the public eye after the massive success she had with a song written for her by Alain Morisod (“Laissez-moi encore chanter”). Books,
theses ,
plays
and
television series
were written about her. A movie was released in December 2004:
Alys Robi: Ma vie en cinémascope
(“Alys Robi: My life on Cinemascope”), entitled
Bittersweet Memories
in English.
Robitaille has published two
autobiographies :
Ma Carrière, ma vie
(“My career, my life”, 1980) and
Long Cri dans la nuit: Cinq Années à l’Asile
(“Long cry in the night: five years in the asylum”, 1990).
Several of Robi’s songs have been used for commercial ads. Sico, notably, played on the similarity between its
brand name
and the title of “Tico Tico” to produce a very catchy campaign based on a spoof of the song.
Robitaille died in the
Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont , Montreal, at the age of 88, on May 28, 2011.

Martha Rommelaere, Canadian baseball player (All-American Girls Professional Baseball League) died he was , 88..
Martha Rommelaere [Manning] was a
Canadian
outfielder
who played in the
All-American Girls Professional Baseball League
during the
1950
season. Listed at 5′ 4″, 120 lb., she batted and threw right handed died he was , 88…
(August 30, 1922 – May 28, 2011)
Born in
Deloraine, Manitoba , Martha Rommelaere was one of the 57 players born in Canada to join the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in its twelve years history. But unfortunately, her career in the circuit was cut short due to a severe back injury. [3]
Rommelaere grew up on a farm near
LaFleche , and moved to
Moose Jaw ,
Saskatchewan
at seventeen. She began to play
sandlot ball
with the boys of her neighborhood when she was a little girl, and became a
track and field
star in high school who could outrun any girl in Saskatchewan.
I could run like a deer , she explained in an interview. [4]
At age 22, Rommelaere joined the Moose Jaw Royals
softball
team. She was missed by
scouts
of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League during her first years in softball. Then she gained the Most Valuable Player award while playing for the
Edmonton
team, where she won a trip to
South Bend, Indiana
to try out for the league. [5]
Rommelaere entered the league in 1950, playing for the
Chicago Colleens
and
Springfield Sallies
traveling teams before being promoted to the
Kenosha Comets
halfway through the season. Basically an
infielder
in Canada, she was converted to the outfield because of her flashy speed. [4]
She hurt her back while playing and had problem with it during her AAGPBL career.
It was the sitting on the bus that killed me , she said. At the end of the season, she married John Manning and decided to quit baseball because of her back ailment, which required five surgeries to correct the problem. The couple raised three children, and she worked as a
dressmaker
until her retirement in 1983. [4]
In 1998, Martha gained honorary induction into the
Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame . In addition, she received a Certificate of Merit from the Government of Canada for her contribution to sports and fitness. She is also part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the
Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum
at
Cooperstown, New York , opened in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personality. [5]
Martha was a longtime resident of
Regina, Saskatchewan , where she died at the age of 88. [5]

The 1961

Celebrity Rehab: Jeff Conaway
by
TheDlisted
Grease
and
Taxi
The following year, Conaway appeared in the original cast of the Broadway musical
Grease , as an
understudy
to several roles including that of the lead male character, Danny Zuko, and eventually succeeded role-originator
Barry Bostwick . [4] [9]
He played the role for 2 1/2 years while his friend
John Travolta , with whom he shared a manager, later joined the show, playing Doody in the chorus. [4] [10]
The two would reunite in the 1978 motion picture musical
Grease , in which Travolta played Zuko and Conaway his buddy Kenickie. [4]
After breaking into series television in 1975 with
Happy Days , followed by other sitcom and drama appearances and three more movies including
Grease , Conaway was cast as vain, struggling, but goodhearted actor Bobby Wheeler in the workplace comedy
Taxi , which premiered in fall 1978. He had appeared in an episode of
The Mary Tyler Moore Show
for the same producers, and, he said in 1987, was originally considered for the role of John Burns, which eventually went to
Randall Carver :
But then one day I got the whole script and became real interested in the actor character, then called Bobby Taylor. And [the producers] said they had been thinking along the same lines, so I read again. Later I got a call from [original casting director] Joel Thurm, who says, ‘Well, it’s not good news, but it’s not bad news either.’ He says I’m the only choice for a white actor, but that they’d had a meeting and thought that maybe Bobby should be
black
and that now they’re looking at black actors. … So I went back to read, and it was me,
Cleavon Little , and somebody else…. I ended up reading with [star]
Judd [Hirsch]
and it went really well.” [11]
Conaway left
Taxi
after the third season. Part of the reason was his drug abuse after season one. [4] Taxi
writer
Sam Simon
recalled in 2008 that during production of Simon’s first script for that show, a missing Conaway was found in his dressing room too high on drugs to perform, and that his dialogue for that episode was divided between his co-stars
Danny DeVito
and
Christopher Lloyd
who delivered the jokes well enough so that Conaway’s absence had little negative impact on the actual episode. This caused the show’s producers to realize that he was expendable and contributed to Conaway’s eventual firing. [12]
But Conaway also felt creatively stymied:
I wanted to do things with Bobby, but as the show went on, I could see I wasn’t going to get that chance. … Lemme tell you – I loved Bobby, I identified with Bobby. So, yeah, I kind of took everything personally. I had a lot of meetings with [the producers] because I was unhappy. … Sure, partially it was ego, but let me
do
what I
do
best. It was frustrating. I remember leaving the studio feeling guilty and unhappy. I just couldn’t appreciate it and use it as just a job, as a learning experience. Instead I saw it as, ‘Hey, anybody could do this character.’ Like nobody else could do Louie or Jim, they were such defined characters. But Bobby – anybody could walk in and say, ‘Hi, Alex.'” [13]
Conaway went on to star in the short-lived 1983 fantasy-spoof series,
Wizards and Warriors . He made guest appearances on such shows as
Barnaby Jones ,
George and Leo
and in four episodes of
Murder, She Wrote . He appeared in films such as
Jawbreaker ,
Elvira, Mistress of the Dark
and
Do You Wanna Know a Secret? . From 1994–1999, he played Sergeant
Zack Allan , on
Babylon 5 . From 1989–90, he was cast on
The Bold and the Beautiful , in the role of “Mick Savage”. In 1993, he appeared onstage in
Real Life Photographs . [ citation needed ]
Music career
In addition to acting, Conaway also dabbled in music. In the mid-1960s, he was the lead singer and guitarist for a rock band, The 3 1/2. They recorded four singles for
Cameo Records
in 1966 and 1967:
“Don’t
Cry To Me Babe” / “R & B In C” (Cameo 425, 1966)
“Problem
Child” / “Hey Mom Hey Dad” (Cameo 442, 1966)
“Hey
Gyp” / “Hey Kitty Cool Kitty” (Cameo 451, 1967) (This
single was produced by
Peter Noone
of
Herman’s Hermits , who also wrote the B-side.
The A-side is a song by
Donovan .)
“Angel
Baby (Don’t You Ever Leave Me)” / “You Turned Your Back On
Love” (Cameo 485, 1967)
In 1979, Conaway recorded a self titled debut album for Columbia Records. “City Boy” was released as a single.
Bruce Springsteen ‘s manager,
Mike Appel , produced the album.
The CD
Saints & Sinners , by Vikki and Kenickie, was released independently via the internet in 2008, featuring Conaway singing and rapping with Vikki Lizzi (Spinoza). They promoted the CD on
The Howard Stern Show
on April 2, 2008 and performed live shows in the Los Angeles area.
Personal life
Conaway was married three times. His first short-lived marriage, at 21, to a dancer he had been seeing for two years, was
annulled . [5]
His second marriage, from 1980 until their divorce in 1985, was to Rona Newton-John, elder [14]
sister of his
Grease
co-star
Olivia Newton-John . His third marriage was to Keri Young from 1990 until their divorce. [15]
Health problems
After experiencing a crisis in the mid-1980s, Conaway came to grips with the fact that he had a
substance abuse
problem. He underwent treatment in the late 1980s and often spoke candidly about his addictions. [ citation needed ]
By the mid-2000s however, he had relapsed. Conaway appeared in
VH1 ‘s
Celebrity Fit Club , but was forced to leave and entered rehab. In early 2008, Conaway appeared with other celebrities in the VH1 reality series
Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew . The show revealed that Conaway was addicted to
cocaine , alcohol, and
painkillers , and that he was in a
codependent
relationship with his girlfriend Vikki Lizzi, [16]
also a user of prescription
opiates . Conaway had suffered a back injury earlier in his career on the set of
Grease
while filming the “Greased Lightning” scene, which had been exacerbated more recently as a result of lifting boxes in his home.
Conaway’s appearance on the show’s first and second seasons drew much attention due to his severely crippled state, his constant threats of leaving the facility and his frequent inability to speak clearly. Upon arrival at the Pasadena Recovery Center (which was filmed as part of
Celebrity Rehab’ s first episode) Conaway, using a wheelchair, arrived drunk, mumbling to
Dr. Drew
that the night previous he had binged on
cocaine
and
Jack Daniel’s
whiskey.
During the second episode of
Celebrity Rehab’ s first season, Conaway, fed up with his
dorsalgia , withdrawal symptoms and the humiliation of having to be assisted while using the toilet, told Dr. Pinsky that he was
thinking of killing himself . After Pinsky asked him to elaborate upon how he would
carry out a suicidal act , Conaway glared at the mirror in his room and said “I see myself breaking that mirror and slicing my fucking throat with it.” During group sessions, Conaway revealed “torture” from his childhood, as older boys in his neighborhood would put him into dangerous situations, tying him up and threatening him. When he was seven years old, he was a victim of pedophiles and child pornographers. [17]
Conaway stated that he had been an addict since he was a teenager. [18]
With
John Travolta ‘s support, Conaway took courses and
auditing
from the
Church of Scientology
to cope with his drug problem and depression, [19]
although he did not intend to become a Scientologist. [20] [21] [22]
In June 2009, Conaway and Vikki joined
Celebrity Rehab
cast mate
Mary Carey
at the premier of her spoof flick
Celebrity Pornhab with Dr. Screw . [23]
In August 2009, Conaway was interviewed by
Entertainment Tonight . In the interview, the actor claimed he was much better after a fifth back operation, and that he had yet to use painkillers again. He also discussed unscrupulous doctors and enablers. [24]
In March 2010, shortly after the death of actor
Corey Haim , Conaway told
E! News
that he had warned Haim about dying due to prescription drug abuse. [25]
Death
On May 11, 2011, Conaway was found unconscious from what was initially described as an overdose of substances, believed to be pain medication, and was taken to Encino Tarzana Medical Center in
Encino , California, where he was listed as being in critical condition and in a coma. [26]
After the initial reports, Dr.
Drew Pinsky , who had treated Conaway for substance abuse, said the actor was suffering not from a drug overdose but rather from “ pneumonia
with
sepsis “, for which he was placed into an induced coma. [27] [28]
Though his pneumonia was not directly caused by drugs, his use of them hampered his ability to recognize how ill he was, and prevented him from seeking treatment for pneumonia until it was too late. [29]
On May 26, 2011, Conaway’s family took him off life support after doctors decided there was nothing they could do to revive him. Conaway died the following morning at the age of 60. [1] [29]
Pinsky attributed his death to his addiction, stating, “What happens is, like with most opiate addicts, eventually they take a little too much … and they aspirate, so what’s in their mouth gets into their lungs … That’s what happened with Jeff” – describing
Aspiration pneumonia . [30]
Conaway is survived by his sisters, Michelle and Carla. [31]

Gil Scott-Heron, American poet, musician and author died he was , 62.
Gilbert “Gil” Scott-Heron
was an American
soul
and
jazz poet , musician, and author known primarily for his work as a
spoken word
performer in the 1970s and ’80s, and for his collaborative works with musician
Brian Jackson . His collaborative efforts with Jackson featured a musical fusion of jazz, blues, and soul, as well as lyrical content concerning social and political issues of the time, delivered in both
rapping
and
melismatic
vocal styles by Scott-Heron. His own term for himself was “bluesologist”,which he defined as “a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues”.The music of his albums, most notably
Pieces of a Man
and
Winter in America
in the early 1970s, influenced and helped engender later African-American music genres such as
hip hop
and
neo soul .
(April 1, 1949 – May 27, 2011)
Scott-Heron’s recording work has received much critical acclaim, especially for one of his most well-known compositions “ The Revolution Will Not Be Televised “. His poetic style has been influential upon every generation of hip hop since his popularity began. [7]
In addition to being widely considered an influence in today’s music, Scott-Heron remained active until his death, and in 2010 released his first new album in 16 years, entitled
I’m New Here .
Early years
Gil Scott-Heron was born in
Chicago , Illinois. [4]
His mother, Bobbie Scott-Heron, sang with the New York Oratorio Society. Scott-Heron’s
Jamaican
father,
Gil Heron , nicknamed “The Black Arrow”, was a soccer player who, in the 1950s, became the first black athlete to play for
Glasgow
Celtic Football Club
in Scotland. Gil’s parents separated when he was two [8]
and Gil was sent to live with his maternal grandmother, Lillie Scott, in
Jackson , Tennessee. [9]
When Scott-Heron was 12 years old, his grandmother died and he went to live with his mother in
The Bronx
in New York City, where he enrolled in
DeWitt Clinton High School . [8]
He later transferred to
The Fieldston School [4]
after one of his teachers, a Fieldston graduate, showed one of his writings to the head of the English department at Fieldston and he was granted a full scholarship. [8]
Scott-Heron attended
Lincoln University
in
Pennsylvania , as it was the college chosen by his biggest influence
Langston Hughes . It was here that Scott-Heron met
Brian Jackson
with whom he formed the band Black & Blues. After about two years at Lincoln, Scott-Heron took a year off to write the novels
The Vulture
and
The Nigger Factory . [10]
The Last Poets
performed at Lincoln in 1969 and
Abiodun Oyewole
of that Harlem group said Scott-Heron asked him after the performance, “Listen, can I start a group like you guys?” [8]
Scott-Heron returned to New York City, settling in
Chelsea, Manhattan .
The Vulture
was published in 1970 and well received. Although Scott-Heron never received his
undergraduate degree , he received a Master’s degree in Creative Writing in 1972 from
Johns Hopkins University . His 1972 masters
thesis
was titled
Circle of stone . [11]
Recording career
Scott-Heron began his recording career in 1970 with the
LP
Small Talk at 125th and Lenox .
Bob Thiele
of
Flying Dutchman Records
produced the album, and Scott-Heron was accompanied by Eddie Knowles and Charlie Saunders on
conga
and
David Barnes
on percussion and vocals. The album’s 15 tracks dealt with themes such as the superficiality of television and mass consumerism, the hypocrisy of some would-be Black revolutionaries, and white middle-class ignorance of the difficulties faced by inner-city residents. In the liner notes, Scott-Heron acknowledged as influences
Richie Havens ,
John Coltrane ,
Otis Redding ,
Jose Feliciano ,
Billie Holiday ,
Langston Hughes ,
Malcolm X ,
Huey Newton ,
Nina Simone , and the pianist who would become his long-time collaborator,
Brian Jackson .
Scott-Heron’s 1971 album
Pieces of a Man
used more conventional song structures than the loose,
spoken-word
feel of
Small Talk . He was joined by Johnny Pate (conductor),
Brian Jackson
on keyboards, piano,
Ron Carter
on
bass
and bass guitar, drummer
Bernard “Pretty” Purdie , Burt Jones playing electric guitar, and
Hubert Laws
on
flute
and saxophone, with Thiele producing again. Scott-Heron’s third album,
Free Will , was released in 1972. Jackson, Purdie, Laws, Knowles, and Saunders all returned to play on
Free Will
and were joined by
Jerry Jemmott
playing
bass ,
David Spinozza
on guitar, and Horace Ott (arranger and conductor). Carter later said about Scott-Heron’s voice, “He wasn’t a great singer, but, with that voice, if he had whispered it would have been dynamic. It was a voice like you would have for Shakespeare.” [8]
1974 saw another LP collaboration with Brian Jackson, the critically acclaimed opus
Winter in America , with
Bob Adams
on drums and Danny Bowens on bass. The album contained Scott-Heron’s most cohesive material and featured more of Jackson’s creative input than his previous albums had.
Winter in America
has been regarded by many critics as the two musicians’ most artistic effort. [12] [13]
The following year, Scott-Heron and Jackson also released
Midnight Band: The First Minute of a New Day . A live album,
It’s Your World , followed in 1976 and a recording of spoken poetry,
The Mind of Gil Scott-Heron , was released in 1979. In the July 1976 Bicentennial issue of
Playboy
Scott-Heron was profiled; the accompanying artwork shows Scott-Heron singing or speaking into a microphone as it melts from the heat of his words. [ citation needed ]
Another hit success followed with the hit single “Angel Dust”, which he recorded as a single with producer
Malcolm Cecil . “Angel Dust” peaked at No.15 on the
R&B
charts in 1978.
In 1979, Scott-Heron played at the
No Nukes
concerts at
Madison Square Garden . The concerts were organized by
Musicians United for Safe Energy
to protest the use of
nuclear energy
following the
Three Mile Island accident . Scott-Heron’s song “We Almost Lost Detroit”, written about a previous accident at a
nuclear power plant , was included in the
No Nukes
album of concert highlights. ( We Almost Lost Detroit
is the title of a book about the accident by
John G. Fuller .) Scott-Heron was a frequent critic of President
Ronald Reagan
and his conservative policies. [14]
Scott-Heron recorded and released only four albums during the 1980s;
1980
and
Real Eyes
in 1980,
Reflections
in 1981 and
Moving Target
in 1982.
Ron Holloway
on
tenor saxophone
was added to Gil’s ensemble in February 1982. He toured extensively with Scott-Heron and contributed to his next album,
Moving Target
that same year. His tenor is prominently featured on the songs “Fast Lane” and “Black History/The World”. Holloway continued with Scott-Heron until the summer of 1989, when he left to join
Dizzy Gillespie . Several years later, Scott-Heron would make cameo appearances on two of Ron Holloway’s CD’s;
Scorcher
(1996) and
Groove Update
(1998), both on the Fantasy/Milestone label. [15]
Scott-Heron was dropped by
Arista Records
in 1985 and quit recording, though he continued to tour. The same year he helped compose and sang “Let Me See Your I.D.” on the
Artists United Against Apartheid
album
Sun City , containing the famous line, “The first time I heard there was trouble in the Middle East, I thought they were talking about Pittsburgh.” The song compares racial tensions in the US with those in apartheid-era South Africa, implying that the US was not too far ahead in race relations. In 1993, he signed to
TVT Records
and released
Spirits , an album that included the seminal track “‘Message to the Messengers”. The first track on the album criticized the rap artists of the day. Scott-Heron is known in many circles as “the Godfather of
rap “ [16] [17]
and is widely considered to be one of the genre’s founding fathers. Given the political consciousness that lies at the foundation of his work, he can also be called a founder of
political rap .
Message to the Messengers
was a plea for the new generation of rappers to speak for change rather than perpetuate the current social situation, and to be more articulate and artistic.
Later years
“Gil Scott-Heron released poems as songs, recorded songs that were based on his earliest poems and writings, wrote novels and became a hero to many for his music, activism and his anger. There is always the anger – an often beautiful, passionate anger. An often awkward anger. A very soulful anger. And often it is a very sad anger. But it is the pervasive mood, theme and feeling within his work – and around his work, hovering, piercing, occasionally weighing down; often lifting the work up, helping to place it in your face. And for all the preaching and warning signs in his work, the last two decades of Gil Scott-Heron’s life to date have seen him succumb to the pressures and demons he has so often warned others about.”
In 2001, Scott-Heron was sentenced to one to three years’ imprisonment in New York State for possession of
cocaine . While out of jail in 2002, he appeared on the
Blazing Arrow
album by
Blackalicious . He was released on
parole
in 2003. On July 5, 2006, Scott-Heron was sentenced to two to four years in a
New York State
prison for violating a plea deal on a drug-possession charge by leaving a
drug rehabilitation center . Scott-Heron’s sentence was to run until July 13, 2009. He was paroled on May 23, 2007. [20]
The reason given for the violation of his plea deal was that the clinic refused to supply Scott-Heron with HIV medication. This story led to the presumption that the artist was
HIV positive , subsequently confirmed in a 2008 interview. [21] [22] [23]
After his release, Scott-Heron began performing live again, starting with a show at “SOB’s” restaurant and nightclub in New York on September 13, 2007. On stage, he stated that he and his musicians were working on a new album and that he had resumed writing a book titled
The Last Holiday , previously on long-term hiatus, about
Stevie Wonder
and his successful attempt to have the birthday of
Martin Luther King Jr.
declared a federally recognized holiday in the United States.
On October 10, 2007, the day before a scheduled (but ultimately cancelled) second SOB’s performance, he was arrested on felony possession of cocaine charges. He continued to make live appearances at various US venues during the course of 2008 and 2009, including further appearances at SOBs in New York. He stated in interviews that work was continuing on his new album, which would consist mainly of new versions of some of his classic songs, plus some cover versions of other artists’ work. Having originally planned to publish
The Last Holiday
in 2003, before it was put on hold, Canongate Books now tentatively intend to issue it in January 2011. The book was due to be previewed via a website set to be launched on April 1, 2009, but this did not appear.
Mark T. Watson , a student of Scott-Heron’s work, dedicated a collection of poetry to Scott-Heron titled
Ordinary Guy
that contained a foreword by
Jalal Mansur Nuriddin
of The Last Poets. The book was published in the UK in 2004 by
Fore-Word Press
Ltd. Scott-Heron recorded one of the poems in Watson’s book
Black & Blue
due for release in 2008 as part of the album
Rhythms of the Diaspora
by Malik & the OG’s on the record label CPR Recordings. [ citation needed ]
In April 2009 on
BBC Radio Four , poet
Lemn Sissay
presented a half-hour documentary on Gil Scott-Heron entitled
Pieces of a Man . [24]
Having interviewed Gil Scott-Heron in New York a month earlier,
Pieces of a Man
was the first UK announcement from Gil of his forthcoming album and return to form. In November 2009, the BBC’s
Newsnight
interviewed Gil Scott-Heron for a feature titled
The Legendary Godfather of Rap Returns . [25]
In 2009, a new Gil Scott-Heron website, gilscottheron.net, was launched with a brand new track “Where Did The Night Go” made available as a free download from the site.
Scott-Heron released his new album
I’m New Here
on independent label
XL Recordings
on February 9, 2010. Produced by XL label owner Richard Russell,
I’m New Here
is Scott-Heron’s first studio album in sixteen years. The pair started recording the album in 2007, with the majority of the record being recorded over the last twelve months with engineer Lawson White at Clinton Studios in New York. The album attracted substantial critical acclaim with
The Guardian
newspaper’s Jude Rogers declaring it one of the next decade’s best records. [26]
The first single from the album was “Me And The Devil”, which was released on February 22, 2010. It was debuted by
BBC Radio 1 ‘s
Zane Lowe
as his “Hottest Record In The World”, along with other specialist DJs such as
Gilles Peterson
and
Benji B . The album’s remix,
We’re New Here , was released in 2011, featuring reworking by English music producer
Jamie xx
of material from the original album. [27]
It was also very well-received by music critics. [28]
In 2010 he was due to play a gig in
Tel Aviv , but this attracted criticism from Palestinian groups who stated “Your performance in Israel would be the equivalent to having performed in Sun City during South Africa’s apartheid era… We hope that you will not play apartheid Israel.” In response, he cancelled the gig. [29]
Death
Scott-Heron died on the afternoon of May 27, 2011, at
St. Luke’s Hospital , New York City, after becoming ill upon returning from a European trip. [1] [30]
Scott-Heron had confirmed previous press speculation about his health, when he disclosed in a 2008
New York Magazine
interview, that he had been HIV-positive for several years, and that he had been previously hospitalized for
pneumonia . [23]
The cause of Scott-Heron’s death has yet to be announced.
He is survived by his son Rumal Rackley from his relationship with
Lurma Rackley , [31]
daughter Gia Scott-Heron from his marriage to
Brenda Sykes ; [30]
and daughters Raquiyah Kelly Heron [32]
and Chegianna Newton. [31] [33]
He is also survived by his sister, Gayle and a brother, Denis Heron, who once managed Scott-Heron; [34]
an uncle, Roy Heron; [35]
and by nephew Terrance Kelly, an actor and rapper who performs as
Mr. Cheeks
and who was a member of the
Lost Boyz . [32]
In response,
Public Enemy ‘s
Chuck D
stated “RIP GSH…and we do what we do and how we do because of you.” on his Twitter account. [36]
His UK publisher, Jamie Byng, called him “one of the most inspiring people I’ve ever met”. [30]
On hearing of the death, R&B singer
Usher
stated “I just learned of the loss of a very important poet…R.I.P., Gil Scott-Heron. The revolution will be live!!”. [37]
Richard Russel, who produced Scott-Heron’s final studio album, called him a “father figure of sorts to me”. [38]
Eminem
stated that “He influenced all of hip-hop”. [39]
Lupe Fiasco
wrote a poem about him and posted it on his website. [40]
Scott-Heron’s memorial service was held at
Riverside Church
in New York City on June 2, 2011, where in tribute to Scott-Heron, Kanye West performed “Lost in the World” [41]
and “Who Will Survive in America”, [42]
songs from his last album,
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy . [41]
“Who Will Survive in America” was co-written by Scott-Heron. [43]
Influence
The music of Scott-Heron’s work during the 1970s influenced and helped engender later African-American music genres such as
hip hop
and
neo soul . He has been described by music writers as “the godfather of rap” and “the black
Bob Dylan “. [44]
Chicago Tribune
writer
Greg Kot
comments on Scott-Heron’s collaborative work with Jackson, “Together they crafted jazz-influenced soul and funk that brought new depth and political consciousness to ‘70s music alongside
Marvin Gaye
and
Stevie Wonder . In classic albums such as ‘ Winter in America ‘ and ‘ From South Africa to South Carolina ,’ Scott-Heron took the news of the day and transformed it into social commentary, wicked satire, and
proto-rap
anthems. He updated his dispatches from the front lines of the inner city on tour, improvising lyrics with an improvisational daring that matched the jazz-soul swirl of the music”. [2]
Of Scott-Heron’s influence on hip hop, Kot writes that he “presag[ed] hip-hop and infus[ed] soul and jazz with poetry, humor and pointed political commentary”. [2]
Ben Sisario
of
The New York Times
writes that “He preferred to call himself a “bluesologist,” drawing on the traditions of blues, jazz and Harlem renaissance poetics”. [4]
Tris McCall of
The Star-Ledger
writes that “The arrangements on Gil Scott-Heron’s early recordings were consistent with the conventions of jazz poetry – the movement that sought to bring the spontaneity of live performance to the reading of verse”. [45]
On his influence, a music writer later noted that “Scott-Heron’s unique proto-rap style influenced a generation of hip-hop artists”. [7]
The Washington Post
wrote that “Scott-Heron’s work presaged not only conscious rap and poetry slams, but also acid jazz, particularly during his rewarding collaboration with composer-keyboardist-flutist Brian Jackson in the mid- and late ’70s.” [46]
The Observer ‘s Sean O’Hagan discussed the significance of Scott-Heron’s music with Brian Jackson, stating:
Together throughout the 1970s, Scott-Heron and Jackson made music that reflected the turbulence, uncertainty and increasing pessimism of the times, merging the soul and jazz traditions and drawing on an
oral poetry
tradition that reached back to the blues and forward to hip-hop. The music sounded by turns angry, defiant and regretful while Scott-Heron’s lyrics possessed a satirical edge that set them apart from the militant soul of contemporaries such as
Marvin Gaye
and
Curtis Mayfield . [44]
—Sean O’Hagan
Will Layman of
PopMatters
writes of the significance of Scott-Heron’s early musical work, “In the early 1970s, Gil Scott-Heron popped onto the scene as a soul poet with jazz leanings; not just another
Bill Withers , but a political voice with a poet’s skill. His spoken-voice work had punch and topicality. ‘The Revolution Will Not Be Televised’ and ‘Johannesburg’ were calls to action:
Stokely Carmichael
if he’d had the groove of
Ray Charles . ‘ The Bottle ‘ was a poignant story of the streets:
Richard Wright
as sung by a husky-voiced Marvin Gaye. To paraphrase
Chuck D , Gil Scott-Heron’s music was a kind of
CNN
for black neighborhoods, prefiguring hip-hop by several years. It grew from
the Last Poets , but it also had the funky swing of
Horace Silver
or
Herbie Hancock —or
Otis Redding .
Pieces of a Man
and
Winter in America
(collaborations with Brian Jackson) were classics beyond category”. [47]
Scott-Heron’s influence over hip-hop is primarily exemplified by his definitive single “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,” sentiments from which have been explored by various rappers, including
Aesop Rock ,
Talib Kweli
and
Common . In addition to his vocal style, Scott-Heron’s indirect contributions to rap music extend to his and co-producer Brian Jackson’s compositions, which have been sampled by various hip-hop artists. “We Almost Lost Detroit” has been sampled by
Brand Nubian
member
Grand Puba
(“Keep On”),
Native Tongues
duo
Black Star
(“Brown Skin Lady”), and underground notable
MF DOOM
(“Camphor”). [48]
Scott-Heron’s 1980 song “A Legend in His Own Mind” was sampled on
Mos Def ‘s “Mr. Nigga”. [49]
The opening lyrics from his 1978 recording “Angel Dust” were appropriated by rapper
RBX
on the 1996 song “Blunt Time” by
Dr. Dre . [50]
CeCe Peniston ‘s 2000 song “ My Boo ” samples Scott-Heron’s 1974 recording “ The Bottle “. [51]
Among the most notable is rapper/producer
Kanye West , who has sampled Scott-Heron and Jackson’s “Home is Where the Hatred Is” and “We Almost Lost Detroit” for his song “My Way Home” and the single “The People,” respectively, both of which are collaborative efforts between West and Common. [52]
Scott-Heron, in turn, has acknowledged West’s contributions, sampling the latter’s 2007 single “Flashing Lights” on his latest album, 2010’s
I’m New Here . [53]
Scott-Heron admitted ambivalence about his association with rap, remarking in 2010 in an interview for the
Daily Swarm , “I don’t know if I can take the blame for it”, referring to rap music. He preferred the moniker of “bluesologist”. Referring to reviews of his last album and references to him as the “godfather of rap”, he said, “It’s something that’s aimed at the kids.” He added, “I have kids, so I listen to it. But I would not say it’s aimed at me. I listen to the jazz station.” [4]
