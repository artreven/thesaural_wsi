The occupants stand on the wings after the crash
Salvage crews have dragged
US Airways Flight 1549
out of the
Hudson River
in
New York City . The
Airbus A320
performed a successful
emergency landing on water
on Thursday after losing power shortly after departing
La Guardia Airport .
The aircraft was tied up at Nelson A. Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City for the last two days before the overnight lift. Efforts were complicated by strong currents and freezing temperatures, but the aircraft was successfully retrieved by a large crane from its
Manhattan
dock.
The lift was completed slowly to allow the flooded cabin to drain as it was raised. The waterlogged
cockpit voice recorder
and
flight data recorder
have been removed and sent to
Washington .
When the plane was lifted, extensive damage to its underside was revealed. The aircraft's right engine remains attached and was retrieved with the aircraft, but the left separated. Sonar has located what is thought to be the engine on the riverbed.
The jet was landed on the Hudson by Captain
Chesley Sullenberger , who is credited with saving the 155 passengers and crew on board. He testified that it was almost certainly
birds ingested
on both engines that brought down the jet.
