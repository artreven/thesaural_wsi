Walk #2 – Roosevelt Island - The Rambling Mason
The Rambling Mason
Manhattan has a land area of 22.96 square miles, has 351 miles of road and a population of more than one and a half million. I plan on walking on every single street in the borough of Manhattan, learn new things, meet new people, do cool stuff and raise money for the Shriners.

Walk #2 – Roosevelt Island
Walk 2 – Roosevelt Island
Last night I did Roosevelt Island. Here is what Wikipedia says about it. Yes, I know Wikipedia blows, but it just happens to be correct on this.
Roosevelt Island , formerly known as
Welfare Island
(from
1921 to 1973), and before that
Blackwell’s Island , is a narrow island in the
East
River
of
New York City . It lies between the island of
Manhattan
to its west and the borough of
Queens
to
its east. Running from Manhattan’s East 46th to East 85th streets, it is
about two miles long, with a maximum width of 800 feet (240 m), and a
total area of 147 acres. The island is part of the Borough of Manhattan
and New York County. Together with
Mill
Rock , Roosevelt Island constitutes
New York County ‘s
Census
Tract
238, which has a land area of 0.279 sq mi.
and had a population of 9,520 in 2000 according to the US Census.
Roosevelt Island is a weird place. A lot of it looks like what everybody thought the future was going to look like back in the 70’s. It always makes me think that everyone who lives there has furniture from Conrans.
Never the less it was a glorious night for a walk. There was a wonderful breeze and it smelled of the sea. Thankfully the East River has been getting cleaner over the past few decades. You will notice in these pictures that the tram is not working. It is being upgraded I believe. Also, the 59th street Bridge crosses over it, making for some cool shots.
