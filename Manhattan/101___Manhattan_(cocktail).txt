Beer Before Liquor, Get Drunk Quicker - Liquor Before Beer, You Like Pam Greer!
So yeah,
Undergrads
quote.
Anyways, since t's American Turkey Day, and since the rest of us are, well, Canadian, let's talk about booze.
Now, I like [sparkle]whiskey[/sparkle], but don't really know how to make anything with it aside from shots and whiskey and Coke.
And whiskey and coffee.
And whiskey and whiskey.
Anyone have any recipes?
Or the number for AA?

Me? I'm a scotch guy. However, in party situations I've started shifting to beer because it's easier to control intake over an extended period of time. Due to geography I am obligated by law to enjoy Pilsner, but the two beers I like the most are Miller Chill and Brahma.
Also, wow, Pabst Blue Ribbon is shit. Why is it so popular again?

Well if you're looking for whiskey drinks I always recommend the
Manhattan . But there's always any of
these . But I am American...you know if this is a Canadian only party we're talking here.
In which case though I've always enjoyed these
beers .

I can buy PBR for about 55˘ a can. If I'm drinking to get drunk (and that's usually why I'm drinking), then why would I buy anything else? That's cheaper than soda.
Now, if I'm drinking to enjoy some alcohol, I enjoy some spiced rum cut with water. Sailor Jerry's, specifically. I have simple tastes. Simple tastes that take to over-proof rum.
Oh, and SoCo is whiskey, right? SoCo and lime is nice, if a little bit hard to taste the alcohol in.

caesars! I
will
be drunk after 3 drinks, but I will also drink your ass into the floor and then dig you a hole so that you can crawl into it and
die!
I'm sorry... That was the bad man inside of me talking. He doesn't get out very often, but when he does, well, he will fuck you up...

Rum and Coke is my poison of choice on most occasions.
There are very few beers I'll actually drink and I refuse to drink something I hate for the sake of getting drunk so I don't do the cheap beer thing.
For wine I really like Sangria or peach.

Rum
is usually my third choice on the list of shot liquors, before Whiskey and bourbon.
Though I can't remember when I had it last, and it was probably because I didn't like spiced rum.
Or regular rum.
Or something, it's been a long time since I've had it.

Vanilla rum and coke is amazing.
I'm not one for shots (I'll do them but I tend to drink in a quiet social atmosphere rather than party) so I look to mixed drinks I can have all night.

Ooh, another good one is to get Vanilla Smirnoff and mix with Coke/Pepsi/Cola. Y'see, in Canada they don't sell Vanilla Coke anymore, but this makes a mighty fine substitute.
