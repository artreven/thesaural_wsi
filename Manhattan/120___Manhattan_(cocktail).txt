Bad Apple!
Is 101% pure creativity. A
stop-motion
animation created from photographic prints of 6566 bitmaps. What's impressive is that there is no editing in Photoshop or other editor. The images were captured with a webcam, and the effects are achieved by changing the camera position and adjusting the focus, brightness, zoom and exposure.

One of the things I want to do this year 2010 is
to become an expert preparing a drink or two.
It's not a fan of get drunk at bars or parties, I rather take a little and usually with good friends talking about how to fix the world.
It seems to me an excellent opportunity to enjoy a pleasant time with people who want the power to prepare a draft of a form so good that your friends leave the house saying that this drink that I cook amazing Inti: D. But the present state of things is almost pathetic, do not prepare well beyond any of eternal rum and Coke.
One of the shots I want to learn how to prepare the
Manhattan

Mini guide for newcomers to Venezuelans Twitter
Entertainment											 -

Wednesday, 03 February 2010 23:53
In recent weeks, the social network Twitter has been the talk of many Venezuelans who have a lot of figuration in the traditional media of our country, mostly politicians, TV-related people and journalists. Each, from his own conception of the world, has completely different ideas about
what is Twitter, how it is used and what their purposes.
This is very confusing for those who arrive first to the network of bird. In general the different views we have of Twitter is because each person on Twitter weapon he wants, which ultimately results in a tool highly adaptable to your needs, lifestyle, hobbies, paranoia and feelings. Of course I also have said some crazy things so they can not stand the slightest discussion of argument, it's like when you defend your ideas cursing and shouting, are simply thrown to the wind noise orcs.
So the first thing you do when you register at Twitter just is forget what you heard on television. With Twitter you will not save the world, to perpetuate or end a revolution, win or lose virtual wars.
With Twitter you'll be able to communicate efficiently
(if you wish), increasing the number of people we can get your message if and only if you have something interesting to say and want to say.
At the same time on Twitter you'll be able to follow the ideas, thoughts, messages and news that others share in the social network. You decide who can one do it for you. If you follow pure lovers of the South Pacific whales, probably you're a whale. If you follow pure obsessed nerds who spend their whole day talking about Apple, Google and the Kindle, probably will be a nerdcista. If you follow writers probably teenage vampire books're a twilightcista. But as human beings are people with many diverse interests, is likely to follow many different users that Twitter and finish assembling your case, where only read what you read,
you are the tailor of your Twitter.
And therein lies the power of the tool and its freedom. While some ghosts fighting wars,
you build your own social network and communication.
No one can invade your timeline (received messages) unless you let him.
In short,
with Twitter you follow others and others will follow you.
You can only write and read messages in
140 characters
or less. You decide what to read, who read, who to meet, what caused the fight (if one is available) and write. You're in control. So you can build a solid or a weak Stonehenge paper boat that will make water everywhere. Nobody can do for you. In the process learn many things safe, fun and you better understand the world and ideas of those around you. That's cool Twitter, you're the architect.
