Transistor
Through
hole transistors (tape measure marked in centimeters) The
transistor
is a
solid state
semiconductor device
which can be used for
amplification ,
switching , voltage
stabilization, signal modulation and many other functions. It acts as a variable
valve which, based on its input current ( BJT ) or input voltage ( FET ),
allows
a precise amount of current to flow through it from the circuit's voltage supply. In
essence, a transistor has three
terminals . A
current
or
voltage
applied
through/across two terminals controls a larger current through the other terminal
and the common terminal. In
analog circuits , transistors
are used in
amplifiers . Analog
circuits include audio amplifiers, stabilised power supplies and radio frequency
amplifiers. In
digital circuits , transistors
function essentially as electrical switches. Digital circuits include
logic gates ,
RAM
(random access
memory) and microprocessors. Transistor
was also the common name in the
sixties
for a
transistor radio ,
a portable radio that used transistors (rather than
vacuum tubes ) as its active
electronic components. This is still one of the dictionary definitions of
transistor . Invention The
transistor was invented at
Bell Telephone
Laboratories
in December
1947
(first demonstrated on
December 23 )
by
John Bardeen ,
Walter Houser Brattain ,
and
William Bradford
Shockley , who were awarded the
Nobel Prize in physics
in
1956 . Ironically,
they had set out to manufacture a
field-effect transistor
( FET ) predicted by
Julius Edgar Lilienfeld
as early as 1925 but eventually discovered current amplification in the point-contact
transistor that subsequently evolved to become the
bipolar junction
transistor
( BJT ). Origin
of name Bell Telephone
Laboratories
needed a generic name for their new invention: "Semiconductor
Triode ", "Solid
Triode", "Surface States Triode" [sic], "Crystal Triode" and "Iotatron" were all
considered, but "transistor", coined by
John R. Pierce , won an
internal ballot. The rationale for the name is described in the following extract
from the company's Technical Memoranda (May 28, 1948)
[1]
calling for votes: " Transistor .
This is an abbreviated combination of the words " transconductance " or
"transfer", and " varistor ". The device logically
belongs in the varistor family, and has the transconductance or transfer
impedance
of
a device having
gain ,
so that this combination is descriptive." Importance The
transistor, considered by many to be one of the greatest inventions in modern
history, ranks with the
printing press
and the
telephone . It
is the key active component in practically all modern
electronics . Its importance
in today's society rests on its ability to be mass produced using a highly automated
process (fabrication) that achieves vanishingly low per-transistor costs. Although
millions of individual ( discrete ) transistors are still used, the vast
majority are fabricated in chips along with diodes, resistors, capacitors and
inductors to produce complete electronic functions, either analog or digital.
Often both types of function are integrated on the same chip. The cost of designing
and developing a complex chip is astronomical, but when spread across millions
of production units the individual chip cost is minimized. A logic gate comprises
about 20 transistors whereas an advanced processor, as of early 2005, can use
as many as 289 million transistors. The
word "chip" is now used rather loosely: originally it referred to the actual piece
of semiconductor before packaging. Once the chip had been packaged it was called
an " integrated circuit ",
or just "IC", and sometimes a "bug".
Chip ,
integrated circuit
and
IC
are now used interchangeably while
bug
has gone out of fashion.
The term " solid state " is used to describe a device which does not control
charge flow through a vacuum ( vacuum tube ) or a gas and
which does not use moving parts ( relay ) to control charge flow. In
the same vein, a circuit or item of equipment may be described as "solid state". The
transistor's low cost, flexibility and reliability have made it an almost universal
device for non-mechanical tasks. Whereas a common item, say a
refrigerator , would have
used
electromechanical
devices
for control, today it is often less expensive and more effective to simply use
a standard integrated circuit (containing a few million transistors) and write
a
computer program
to carry
out the same task through logic. Transistors have replaced almost all electromechanical
devices, are used in most simple feedback control systems, and appear in huge
numbers in everything from traffic lights to washing machines. Hand-in-hand
with low cost has come the trend to
digitize
information. With transistor-utilizing
computers offering the ability to quickly find, sort and process
digital
information, more and
more effort has been put into making information digital. Almost all media today
is delivered in digital form, finally being converted and presented in
analog
form by computers. Familiar areas influenced by the drive to digitize are
television ,
radio
and
newspapers . Types

Transistor
symbols of different types Broadly
speaking, transistors are categorised as follows:
Semiconductor

power rating: low, medium, high
Maximum

Application:
amplifier, switch, general purpose, audio, high voltage
Thus,
a particular transistor may be described as:
silicon, surface mount, BJT, NPN,
low power, high frequency switch . FET
Families FETs
are divided into two families:
junction FET
( JFET ) and
insulated gate FET
( IGFET ) also known as
metal oxide silicon
(or
semiconductor )
FET
( MOSFET ). Unlike IGFETs, the JFET
gate terminal forms a
diode
with the
channel
(semiconductor
material between source and drain). Functionally, this makes the N channel JFET
the solid state equivalent of the vacuum tube
triode
which, similarly, forms
a diode between its
grid
and
cathode . Also, both devices operate
in the "depletion mode", they both have a high input impedance, and they both
conduct current under the control of an input voltage. FETs
are further divided into
enhancement mode
and
depletion mode
types.
Mode refers to the polarity of the gate voltage with respect to the source when
the device is conducting. Taking N channel FETs: in depletion mode the gate is
negative with respect to the source while in enhancement mode the gate is positive.
For both modes, if the gate voltage is made more positive the source/drain current
will increase. For P channel devices the polarities are reversed. Most IGFETs
are enhancement mode types and nearly all JFETS are depletion mode types. Other
types
Unijunction transistors
can be used as simple pulse generators. They comprise a main body of either P
or N type semiconductor with ohmic contacts at each end (terminals B1 and B2).
A junction with the opposite semiconductor type is formed at a point along the
length of the body for the third terminal (E).
Dual
gate FETs
have a single channel with two gates in
cascode ; a configuration
that is optimised for
high frequency amplifiers ,
mixers , and
oscillators .
Transistor
arrays
are used for general purpose applications,
function generation
and low-level,
low-noise amplifiers . They include two or more transistors
on a common
substrate
to ensure close parameter matching and thermal tracking,
characteristics that are especially important for
long tailed pair
amplifiers.
Darlington transistors
comprise a medium power BJT connected to a power BJT. This provides a high current
gain equal to the product of the current gains of the two transistors. Power diodes
are often connected between certain terminals depending on specific use.
Insulated gate bipolar transistors
( IGBTs ) use a medium
power IGFET, similarly connected to a power BJT, to give a high input impedance.
Power diodes are often connected between certain terminals depending on specific
use. IGBTs are particularly suitable for heavy-duty industrial applications. The
Asea Brown Boveri
( ABB )
5SNA2400E170100
[2]
illustrates just how far power semiconductor technology has advanced. Intended
for three-phase power supplies, this awesome device houses three NPN IGBTs in
a case measuring 38 by 140 by 190 mm. Each IGBT is rated at 1,700 volts and can
handle 2,400 amperes.
Semiconductor
material Initially,
BJTs were made from
germanium
(Ge) and some high
power types still are.
Silicon
( Si ) types currently predominate but
certain advanced microwave and high performance versions now employ the
compound
semiconductor
material
gallium arsenide
( GaAs ). Single element
semiconductor material (Ge and Si) is described as
elemental . The characteristics
for the most common semiconductor materials used to make transistors are given
in the table below:
Semiconductor
material characteristics
Semiconductor material Junction
forward voltage V @ 25 Â°C Electron mobility m/s @ 25 Â°C Hole
mobility m/s @ 25 Â°C Max junction temp. Â°C
Ge 0.27 0.39 0.19 70
to 100
Si 0.71 0.14 0.05 150
to 200
GaAs 1.03 0.85 0.05 150
to 200
Al/Si junction 0.3 - - 150
to 200 The
Junction forward voltage
is the voltage necessary to make the emitter/base
junction of a BJT conduct a specified current. The values given in the table are
typical for a current of 1 mA (the same values apply to semiconductor diodes).
The lower the junction forward voltage the better, as this means that less power
is required to "drive" the transistor. For normal doping levels the junction forward
voltage is typically 0.4 V less than the
band gap . Band
gap is the voltage difference between the
valence energy band
and the
conduction
energy band
for a given material. The junction forward voltage for a given
current decreases with temperature. For a typical silicon junction the change
is around - 2 mV/Â°C. Electron
mobility
and
Hole mobility
columns show the average speed that electrons
and holes defuse through the semiconductor material with 1 volt per meter applied
across the material. In general, the higher the electron mobility the faster the
transistor. The table indicates that Ge is a better material than Si in this respect,
and so it is. But, Ge has four major shortcomings compared to silicon and gallium
arsenide: its maximum temperature is limited, it has relatively high leakage current,
it can not withstand such high voltages and it is less suitable for fabricating
chips. As the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor
materials, a given NPN BJT tends to be faster than an equivalent PNP BJT type.
GaAs has the fastest electron mobility of the three semiconductors. It is for
this reason that GaAs is used in high frequency applications. A relatively recent
FET development, the
high electron mobility transistor
( HEMT ), has a hetro-structure (junction
between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)/gallium
arsenide (GaAs) which has double the electron mobility of a GaAs/metal barrier
junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in satellite
receivers working at a frequency around 12 GHz. Max
junction temperature
values represent a cross section taken from various manufacturer's
data sheets. This temperature should not be exceeded or the transistor may be
destroyed. Al/Si
junction
refers to the aluminium/silicon high-speed semiconductor/metal barrier
diode, commonly known as a
schottky diode . This is
included in the table because most silicon power IGFETs have a
parasitic
reverse schottky diode formed between the source and drain as part of the fabrication
process. Packaging
Surface
Mount Transistor (typical dimensions L 3.0, W 2.6, H 1.1mm including contacts) Transistors
come in many different packages (see images), both
through hole
(or
leaded )
and
surface mount , also known as
surface mount device
( SMD ).
Often you have a choice of package for a given transistor chip. The
ball grid
array
( BGA ) is the leading-edge surface mount package (currently only
for large
transistor arrays
and digital functions). It has solder 'balls'
on the underside which are fused to pads on the host
printed circuit board
( PCB ) by heating the whole board, normally by
infrared
radiation.
Being hidden, the joint is then checked for quality by
x-ray imaging . Because
they are smaller and have shorter interconnections, SMDs have better frequency
characteristics but lower power rating. Transistor packages are normally made
of glass, metal, ceramic or plastic. For enhanced cooling, power transistors have
large packages that can be clamped to heat sinks, but at the other extreme some
surface-mount
microwave
transistors resemble specks of dust. Also to aid
cooling, most power types have the collector/drain internally connected to the
metal can /metal plate (in "non-conductive" power packages the non-conductive
package material is moulded on to a metal plate for heatsink interfacing). Gallery A
bewildering range of transistors is already available and manufacturers continually
introduce improved types. A few examples from the main families are featured below.

Advantages
of transistors over vacuum tubes Before
the development of transistors
vacuum tubes
(or in the UK
thermionic valves
or just
valves ) were the main active components
in electronic equipment. The key advantages that have allowed transistors to replace
their vacuum tube predecessors in most applications are:
Smaller
size (despite continuing miniaturization of vacuum tubes)
Highly
automated manufacture
Lower
cost (in volume production)
Lower
possible operating voltages
Operate
"immediately" (most vacuum tubes need 10 to 60 seconds to "warm up")
Lower
power dissipation (no heater power, very low saturation voltage)
Higher
reliability and greater endurance (but vacuum tubes are more resistant to
nuclear
electromagnetic pulses
( NEMP ) and
electrostatic discharge
( ESD ) )
Much
longer possible lifetime (vacuum tube cathodes are eventually exhausted)
Complementary
devices available (allowing circuits with complementary symmetry: complementary
vacuum tubes are not available)
Ability
to control large currents (power transistors are available to control hundreds
of amperes: vacuum tubes to control even one ampere are large and costly)
Non-microphonic
(vibration can modulate vacuum tube characteristics)

Nature abhors a vacuum tube

John R. Pierce ,
Bell Telephone
Laboratories , circa 1948. Use
in audio amplifiers From
mobile phones to televisions, vast numbers of products include audio power amplifiers.
The first discrete transistor types struggled to generate a few hundred milliwatts,
but power and audio fidelity gradually increased as better transistors became
available and amplifier architecture evolved ( single-ended transformer coupled
to
push-pull transformer coupled
to
push-pull capacitor coupled
to
push-pull direct coupled ). In
all but the most esoteric applications, chip audio power amplifiers have completely
ousted discrete types. Initially these chips were temperamental and they too,
could only deliver a few hundred milliwatts. But today, for around $10 U.S, you
can make a pretty good 50 watt audio power amplifier with a few passive components
and an
LM3886 [26]
chip for example. HiFi
amplifiers Some
high fidelity
( HiFi ) audio
amplifiers
still
use vacuum tubes with their
enthusiasts
claiming that their
sound is superior. In
particular, some argue that the larger number of electrons in a vacuum tube behave
with greater statistical accuracy, although this ignores the facts that vacuum
tubes generally have a high-impedance control terminal (grid), and that discrete-transistor
(as opposed to, say, op-amp) circuits can also be designed to use large currents
(to put this in perspective, even 1 milliampere of current carries about 6,240
million million electrons per second). Others
detect a distinctive "warmth" to the sound. The "warmth" is actually distortion
caused by the vacuum tubes, but some audiophiles find this pleasing. This is "soft-saturation"
and occurs when vacuum tubes are
overdriven , causing poorly
designed vacuum tube amplifiers to sound better than poorly designed transistor
amplifiers. Tube amplifiers are also less prone to slew-rate limiting, which was
a problem with early semiconductors and is still observed in low-cost transistor
audio amplifiers. Above
speculative opinion gives no correlation between characteristics or measurements
and perceived sound quality. See
Tubes vs.
Transistors - Is There An Audible Difference?
and
Transistors vs. Tubes - Brief Feature
Comparison . Guitar
amplifiers Vacuum
tubes are also preferred in
guitar amplifiers
which are designed to be overdriven, because they have a different non-linear
transfer characteristic than transistors, and create a different, more pleasing
spectrum of harmonic distortion or "fuzz".
Digital signal processing
(DSP) can be used to achieve similar effects in the digital domain. It
is possible to mix transistors and vacuum tubes in the same circuit. Simple
transistor amplifiers use
emitter degeneration
to achieve
negative feedback , which
gives a relatively predictable gain compared to the gain of the transistor itself,
which varies widely. Use
in computers
High-power
transistors used in a switching power supply. Mounted on an
aluminium
heat sink for enhanced
cooling. The
"second generation" of computers through the late
1950s
and
1960s
featured boards filled with
individual transistors, and magnetic cores. Subsequently, transistors, other components
(capacitors, but not high-value inductors or transformers), and the necessary
wiring were integrated into a single, mass-manufactured component: the
integrated circuit .
In modern digital electronics, single transistors are very rare, though they remain
common in power and analog applications. Recently, inroads have been made in the
integration of analog circuits, also, with the advent of "programmable analog"
circuits,
Systems-on-Chips , and
Digital signal processing .
DSP is a technique that can (among other things) be used with A/D and D/A converters
to simulate analog circuits. Linear integrated circuits got a bad reputation early
on because of the difficulty of creating (high-quality) PNP transistors, but are
much better today. Transistors
are also used in
power regulation
and
in computer
PSUs , especially in
switching power
supplies . How
transistors work There
are two basic types of transistors, the
bipolar junction
transistor
(BJT) and the
field-effect transistor
(FET), which work differently. Bipolar transistors are so named because the main
conduction channel uses both
electrons
and
holes
to carry the main
electric current. In BJTs the main current must cross a very thin insulating layer
called the
Depletion zone , and the
width of this layer can be electrically varied at very high rates in order to
control the main current. Field-effect transistors (also called unipolar transistors)
use only one of the two types of carrier (either electrons or holes, depending
on the subtype of the FET). In FETs the main current appears in a narrow conducting
channel with an insulating Depletion zone at the side, and the width of this insulating
zone can be altered by varying its applied voltage, in order to control the width
of the conducting channel and therefore control the main current. See the articles
on each type of device for more information. How
semiconductors work Operationally,
transistors and vacuum tubes have similar functions; they both control the flow
of current. In
order to understand how a
semiconductor
operates,
consider a glass container filled with pure water. If a pair of conductive probes
are immersed in the water and a DC voltage (below the electrolysis point i.e.
breakdown point for water) is applied between them, no current would flow because
the water has no charge carriers. Thus, pure water is an insulator. Dissolve a
pinch of table salt in the water and conduction begins, because mobile carriers
( ions ) have been released.
Increasing the salt concentration increases the conduction, but not very much.
A dry lump of salt is non-conductive, because the charge carriers are immobile. An
absolutely pure silicon crystal is also an insulator, but when an impurity e.g.
arsenic
is added
(called doping) in quantities minute enough not to completely disrupt the regularity
of the crystal lattice, it donates free electrons and enables conduction. This
is because arsenic atoms have five electrons in their outer shells while silicon
atoms have only four. Conduction is possible because a mobile carrier of charge
has been introduced, in this case creating n-type silicon ("n" for negative. The
electron has a negative charge). Alternatively,
silicon can be doped with
boron
to make p-type silicon which
also conducts. Because boron has only three electrons in its outer shell another
kind of charge carrier, called a "hole", is formed in the silicon crystal lattice. In
a vacuum tube, on the other hand, the charge carriers (electrons) are emitted
by
thermionic emission
from a cathode heated by a wire filament. Therefore, vacuum tubes cannot generate
holes (positive charge carriers). Note
that charge carriers of the same polarity repel one another so that, in the absence
of any force, they are distributed evenly throughout the semiconductor material.
However, in an unpowered bipolar transistor (or junction diode) the charge carriers
tend to migrate towards a P/N junction, being attracted by their opposite charge
carriers on the other side of the junction. Increasing
the doping level increases the semiconductor conductivity, providing that the
crystal lattice, overall, remains intact. In a bipolar transistor the emitter
has a higher doping level than the base. The ratio of emitter/base doping levels
is one of the main factors that dictates the junction transistor's current gain. The
level of doping is extremely low: in the order of parts per one hundred million,
and this is the key to semiconductor operation. In metals, the carrier population
is extremely high; one charge-carrier per atom. In metals, in order to convert
a significant volume of the material into an insulator, the charge carriers must
be swept out by applying a voltage. In metals this value of voltage is astronomical;
more than enough to destroy the metal before it converts to an insulator. But
in lightly-doped semiconductors there is only one mobile charge carrier per millions
or more atoms. The level of voltage required to sweep so few charge-carriers out
of a significant volume of the material is easily reached. In other words, the
electricity
in metals is incompressible,
like a fluid, while in semiconductors behaves as a compressible gas. Doped semiconductors
can be rapidly changed into insulators, while metals cannot. The
above explains conduction in a semiconductor by charge carriers, either electrons
or holes, but the essence of bipolar transistor action is the way that electrons/holes
seemingly make a prohibited leap across the insulating
depletion zone
in the reverse-biased
base/collector junction under control of the base/emitter voltage. Although a
transistor may seem like two interconnected diodes, a bipolar transistor cannot
be made simply by connecting two discrete junction diodes together. To produce
bipolar transistor action they need to be fabricated on the same crystal, and
physically sharing a common and extremely thin base region. Electrical
characteristics Note
that in the following example I am using the convention that current flows "from"
the positive "to" the negative. In actuality, the moving charge carrier, the electron,
is negatively charged and moves in the opposite direction. When
analyzing how current will flow through a circuit, a bipolar transistor can be
thought of as effectively three diodes, two of which always conduct, and one of
which will conduct depending on the current flowing through the other two. In
an NPN transistor, for example, the base will conduct to either the collector
or emitter without any resistance other than a fixed forward voltage drop, so
long as the voltage at the base is higher than at the emitter or collector. In
addition, if current is flowing through the base-emitter junction, a much larger
current will be allowed to flow from the collector to the emitter. The multiple
that the allowed emitter-collector current is larger than the base-emitter current
is called gain or
h FE . An
h FE
value of 100 is typical for
small bipolar transistors. In
a typical configuration, a very small signal current flows through the base-emitter
junction to control the emitter-collector current. However, bipolar transistors
are approximately symmetrical (sans doping differences), and you can use a base-collector
current to control the emitter-collector current. Generally the gain in this mode
is much smaller (i.e., 2 instead of 100), and it is not a value that is controlled
by manufacturers so it can vary wildly. Light
sensitivity Bipolar
transistors can be turned on with light as well as electricity. Devices designed
for this purpose are called
phototransistors , but
these can be standard transistors in a transparent package. History All
transistors rely on the ability of certain materials, known as
semiconductors , to change
their conduction under the control of an electric field. In bipolar transistors,
the semiconductor is formed into structures called
p-n junctions
that allow
electricity to flow in only one direction through them â€“ that is, they are a
conductor
when voltage
is applied in one direction, and an
insulator
when it is applied
in the other direction. 1900s Semiconductors
had been used in the electronics field for some time before the invention of the
transistor. Around the turn of the
20th century
they were quite
common as detectors in radios, used in a device called a "cat's whisker". These
detectors were somewhat troublesome, however, requiring the operator to move a
small
tungsten
filament (the whisker)
around the surface of a crystal until it suddenly started working. Then, over
a period of a few hours or days, the crystal would slowly stop working and the
process would have to be repeated. At the time their operation was completely
mysterious. After the introduction of the more reliable and amplified
vacuum tube
based radios, the cat's whisker systems quickly disappeared. The "cat's whisker"
is a primitive example of a special type of diode still popular today, called
a
Schottky diode . World
War II In
WWII ,
radar
research quickly
pushed the frequencies of the radio receivers inside them into the area where
traditional tube based radio receivers no longer worked well. On a whim,
Russell Ohl
of
Bell Laboratories
decided
to try a cat's whisker. After hunting one down at a used radio store in
Manhattan ,
he found that it worked much better than tube-based systems. Ohl
investigated why the cat's whisker functioned so well. He spent most of
1939
trying to grow more pure versions of the crystals. He soon found that with higher
quality crystals the "oddness" went away, but so did their ability to operate
as a radio detector. One day he found one of his purest crystals nevertheless
worked well, and interestingly, it had a clearly visible crack near the middle.
However as he moved about the room trying to test it, the detector would mysteriously
work, and then stop again. After some study he found that the behaviour was controlled
by the light in the room â€“ more light, more conductance. He invited several
other people to see this crystal, and Brattain immediately realized there was
some sort of junction at the crack. Further
research cleared up the remaining mystery. The crystal had cracked because either
side contained very slightly different amounts of the impurities Ohl could not
remove â€“ about 0.2%. One side of the crystal had impurities that added extra
electrons (the carriers of electrical current) and made it a conductor. The other
had impurities that wanted to bind to these electrons, making it an insulator.
When the two were placed side by side the electrons could be pushed out of the
side with extra electrons (soon to be known as the
emitter ) and replaced
by new ones being provided (say from a
battery ) where they
would flow into the insulating portion and be collected by the filament (the
collector ).
However, when the voltage was reversed the electrons being pushed into the collector
would quickly fill up the "holes", and conduction would stop almost instantly.
This junction of the two crystals (or parts of one crystal) created a
solid-state
diode, and the concept soon became known as semiconduction. 'Anode' and 'Cathode'
are the terms used to denote the two terminals of a diode. The mechanism of action
when the diode is off has to do with the separation of charge carriers around
the junction. This is called a 'depletion region.' Development Armed
with the knowledge of how these new diodes worked, a crash effort started to learn
how to build them on demand. Teams at
Purdue University ,
Bell Labs ,
MIT ,
and the
University of Chicago
all joined forces to build better crystals. Within a year
germanium
production
had been perfected to the point where military-grade diodes were being used in
most radar sets. The
key to the development of the transistor was the further understanding of the
process of the electron mobility in a semiconductor. It was realized that if there
was some way to control the flow of the electrons from the emitter to the collector,
one could build an amplifier. For instance, if you placed contacts on either side
of a single type of crystal the current would not flow through it. However if
a third contact could then "inject" electrons or holes into the material, the
current would flow. Actually
doing this appeared to be very difficult. If the crystal were of any reasonable
size, the amount of electrons (or holes) supplied would have to be very large
â€” making it less than useful as an amplifier because it would require a large
current to start with. That said, the whole idea of the crystal diode was that
the crystal itself could provide the electrons over a very small distance. The
key appeared to be to place the input and output contacts very close together
on the surface of the crystal. Brattain
started working on building such a device, and tantalizing hints of amplification
continued to appear as the team worked on the problem. One day the system would
work and the next it wouldn't. In one instance a non-working system started working
when placed in water. The two eventually developed a new branch of
quantum mechanics
known
as
surface physics
to account
for the behaviour. Essentially,
the electrons in any one piece of the crystal would migrate about due to nearby
charges. Electrons in the emitters, or the "holes" in the collectors, would cluster
at the surface of the crystal where they could find their opposite charge "floating
around" in the air (or water). Yet they could be pushed away from the surface
from any other location with the application of a small amount of charge. So instead
of needing a large supply of electrons, a very small number in the right place
would do the trick. Their
understanding solved the problem of needing a very small control area to some
degree. Instead of needing two separate semiconductors connected by a common,
but tiny, region, a single larger surface would serve. The emitter and collector
would both be placed very close together on one side, with the control lead on
the other. When current was applied to the control lead, the electrons or holes
would be pushed out, right across the entire block of semiconductor, and collect
on the far surface. As long as the emitter and collector were very close together,
this should allow enough electrons or holes between them to allow conduction to
start. First
transistor They
made many attempts to build such a system with various tools, but generally failed.
Setups where the contacts were close enough were invariably as fragile as the
original cat's whisker detectors had been, and would work briefly, if at all. Eventually
they had a practical breakthrough. A piece of
gold
foil was glued to the edge of
a plastic wedge, and then the foil was sliced with a razor at the tip of the triangle.
The result was two very closely spaced contacts of gold. When the plastic was
pushed down onto the surface of a crystal and voltage applied to the other side
(on the
base
of the crystal), current started to flow from one contact
to the other as the base voltage pushed the electrons away from the base towards
the other side near the contacts. The point-contact transistor had been invented,
a primitive variation of the BJT. While
the device was constructed a week earlier, Brattain's notes describe the first
demonstration to higher-ups at Bell Labs on the afternoon of
December 23 ,
1947 , often given as
the birthdate of the transistor. The PNP point-contact germanium transistor operated
as a speech amplifier with a power gain of 18 in that trial. Problems
with fragility and impurities Shockley
was upset about the device being credited to Brattain and Bardeen, who he felt
had built it "behind his back" to take the glory. Matters became worse when Bell
Labs lawyers found that some of Shockley's own writings on the transistor were
close enough to those of an earlier patent that they thought it best that his
name be left off the patent application. Shockley
was incensed, and decided to demonstrate who was the brains of the operation.
Only a few months later he invented an entirely new type of transistor one day
while sitting in his hotel room waiting to give a speech. This new form, the layer
transistor, was considerably more robust than the fragile point-contact system,
and would go on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the 1960s. With
the fragility problems solved, a remaining problem was purity. Making germanium
of the required purity was proving to be a serious problem, and limited the number
of transistors that actually worked from a given batch of material. One then-small
company,
Texas Instruments , decided
that the solution to this problem was to use silicon rather than germanium, which
should be easier to work with. They were right, and germanium disappeared from
most transistors by the late 1960s. Now
everything was in place, and within a few years, transistor-based products, most
notably radios, were appearing on the market. A major improvement in yield came
when a chemist advised the companies fabricating semiconductors to use distilled
water rather than tap water: calcium ions were the cause of the problem. ' Zone melting ', also known
as 'zone refining', a technique using a moving band of molten material through
the crystal, makes this whole endeavour possible. Early
consumer and hobbyist applications Contrary
to popular belief, the portable radio was not the first 'mainstream' transistor
application. Even in the
1940s , consumer radios were rather
sophisticated; with several vacuum tubes they used
Armstrong 's brilliantly
ingenious
superheterodyne
architecture.
To meet the public's expectations, it would have been necessary for transistor
radios to use similar circuitry but early transistors could not operate as amplifiers
and oscillators at
radio frequencies , even
the relatively low 540 to 1700 "kilocycle"
AM
broadcast band . Also, miniature
passive components, such as
intermediate frequency
transformers
and multigang
tuning
capacitors,
were not readily available. Instead,
the first major consumer application was the
hearing aid , which only required
audio amplification, and retailed in a market where miniaturization was important
but low cost not essential.
Raytheon , who had also developed
ruggedized, minature vacuum tubes for the military, introduced the first transistorized
hearing aid. Texas Instruments '
Regency
TR-1
[27] , the first transistor radio
for the general public, wasn't marketed until 1954. But transistor radio sales
only really took-off in 1958 with the launch of
Sony 's model
TR-55 . Costing
$12 U.S, the PNP
CK722
[28]
hit the market in early 1953. It was
practically the only transistor available to hobbyists for almost a decade and
innumerable homebrew projects were built using it. The retail versions had failed
quality control
( QC ) and were not suitable
for Raytheon's new hearing aid. They had low current gain, high leakage current,
especially at elevated temperature, and the characteristics varied between individual
parts. They were also a bit fragile and easily "blown up". This made designing
practical circuits with the CK722 challenging. In spite of these shortcomings,
many hobbyists of the
fifties
still have a warm place
in their hearts for this early
germanium
transistor. Miniaturization With
the introduction of transistors, electronic equipment shrank. Another leap in
miniaturisation came when complete circuits were integrated on to tiny
silicon
chips. The invention
of metal oxide silicon ( MOS ) transistors by the
Radio Corporation
of America
( RCA ) in 1960, led to the development
of
PMOS
and
NMOS
chips that integrated
more functions, used less power and were cheaper, but were slower than BJT types.
They followed this in 1967 by producing
complementary metal oxide silicon
CMOS
chips that were faster than
the previous MOS families and used even less power. With their high level of integration,
low cost and minuscule power consumption MOS chips spawned a new generation of
battery powered products such as
pocket calculators
and
digital watches . Advances
in packaging have also shrunk components: currently the
Ball Grid Array
( BGA ) package is the most compact. This was preceded by the standard surface
mount device (SMD) packages for chips, transistors, diodes, transformers, inductors,
capacitors and resistors. Compared
to the massive expenditure of launching items into space on-board liquid-fuelled
rockets, the individual electronic component costs were insignificant. More important
was the advantages of reliability and small size. This is why the
National
Aeronautics and Space Administration
( NASA ) could justify paying
the equivalent of $4,000 U.S. in today's values, for an early quad two-input
NAND
gate. Now, an equivalent chip, but with vastly improved characteristics, would
cost a few cents U.S. while the marginal cost of integrating an additional nand
gate into a
very large scale integration
( VLSI ) chip would be essentially zero. See
