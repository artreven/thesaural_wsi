BOKA’s “The Mix List” – Sip Up & Vote!

It’s amazing how interconnected we are to our environment. Take palates, for example. Personal palates are often heavily influenced by the seasons, which in turn are largely dictated by what foods are available fresh and local. For example, summer heralds a craving for lighter fare, such as luscious fresh fruits, barbecue, and light, cool refreshing beverages. As autumn takes the center stage, warmer dishes laden with pumpkin, squash, mushrooms, meats, grains, and late harvest fruit and vegetables take center stage.
Now, think cocktails, dear hedonists.
For BOKA (Bold Original Kitchen Artistry) KITCHEN + BAR launched their Mix List about two weeks ago. (Your
Hedonista
recently was invited in for a media tasting with BOKA Bar Manager Mi-Suk Ahn and BOKA General Manager Cara [pronounced [Kair'-a] Castrale.) “The Mix List” is a new cocktail contest program that involves six handcrafted cocktails made by by six of BOKA’s best and brightest bartenders. A promotion conceived and developed by BOKA’s Bar Manager and Seattle Mixologist, the well-known, totally awesome, and oh-so-approachable Mi-Suk Ahn, The Mix List’s goal is to put the “BAR” back in BOKA KITCHEN + BAR by reinventing classic cocktails with seasonal, culinary influences. What’s more, the contest encourages you to explore all six concoctions: the bar menu of the six drinks is like a frequent patron’s passport program; simply pick up a card at BOKA – The Mix List cards will be kept on file at BOKA – and get stamped whenever one of the six offerings is ordered and tasted. Try all six, get all six stamps, and be entered in the contest for
a chance to win dinner for two and an overnight at Hotel 1000. This grand prize drawing will take place on December 1, 2011. Descriptions of each cocktail as well as a photo of the six bartenders are featured on the card, so bar patrons have the opportunity to get to know the staff:

Le Forêt
($10) by Mike:
Thyme-infused vodka (Pinnacle) and porcini stock, shaken up and poured into a martini glass with truffle salt along rim, and garnished with wedge of Manchego cheese. This one – by far the most unusual of the six, for it’s savory – was inspired by one of Mike’s personally fav fall food dishes: porcini-thyme polenta. It’s the color of beef or mushroom broth, and smells super herbaceaous. The thyme and porcini are crystal clear on the palate, and the Manchego cheese is a nice chaser. Of the six, this one is the most unique cocktail by far; we’re talking waaay out of the box here. Like a liquid antipasto in a glass. All that’s missing is a speared cherry tomato floating in the glass….
Leaf Erickson ($10) by Michael:
Ketel One/Pinnacle Vodka, Campari, Grand Marnier, shaken and poured into a flute, topped with sparkling wine/Prosecco, and garnished with an orange/lemon twist. This one is a twist on a Viking cocktail, with a Negroni-like quality; it adds sparkling wine/Prosecco. In this drink, the luscious sweetness of the orange-laden Grand Marnier balances out the earthy tart cranberry bitterness of the Campari, while the sparkling wine/Prosecco lifts the drink up. It also has a smoky component: this one reminds me of an autumn stroll on a sunny afternoon complete with the scent of burning autumn leaves.
The Grand Luxe ($12) by Brittany:
Anniversario rum, Luxardo, Aperol, cherry bitters, shaken and strained into a martini glass, and then garnished with cherries. Named after Hotel 1000′s 530-square-foot
Grand Luxe Parlor Suite , this cocktail is cherry-forward with a balanced, muted sweetness (think of a twist on the
Manhattan , here).
D-Licious ($10) by Dustin:
Gordon’s/Beefeater Gin,
Dubonnet , orange juice, stirred and strained into a martini glass and garnished with an orange twist. This one tickles then dries the mouth. It’s an elegant, mature drink with mead-like notes … makes a nice
apéritif .
Brooke's Winter Rye topped my list. It did leave me craving Belgian waffles, however.
Winter Rye ($9) by Brooke:
Rittenhouse Rye Whiskey, spiced maple syrup, poured in a rock glass, topped with apple cider, and then garnished with a cinnamon stick. This one is as sweet as the
Le Forêt
is savory, and just may be my absolute fav. When I drank this one, all I wanted was a Belgian waffle or some mini pancakes to go with it. It’s the perfect quintessential Great Canadian Cocktail.
The Benchmark ($10) by Taylor:
Calvados Brandy, Cointreau, Maraschino Liqueur, citrus juice (fresh grapefruit/lime), stirred and strained into a martini glass, topped with Prosecco/Champagne, dashed up with Paychaud’s bitters, and garnished with an orange or grapefruit twist. This beverage is a nod to their new parent company ( Benchmark Hospitality International ). It has a dark and warming timbre and reminds me of a
Dark ‘n’ Stormy .
BOKA's Bar Manager & Mixologist Mi-Suk Ahn displaying all six of the cocktails, plus her own concoction: The Re-Vamp $11: barrel-aged Vampire Vodka, Warre’s Ruby Port, and Woodford Reserve (Cherry) Bourbon lightly stirred in a shaker and served up chilled in a martini glass with a Bourbon-infused cherry.
“We created The Mix List to showcase the amazing talent behind the bar at BOKA. From Michael’s sparkling Leaf Erikson cocktail to Mike’s thyme-infused
Le Forêt
martini, each cocktail has a personality of its own just like our bartenders and the guests they serve,” said Mi-Suk. She added: “We hope guests have as much fun getting to know our staff through The Mix List as we have making the menu.”
During our tasting session, I asked Mi-Suk how the bartenders were instructed in order to come up with the concoctions they did. Here was her reply: “I basically said, ‘Think outside of your box.’ I want you to think fall. I want you to think Seattle fall. What is Seattle fall to you? It rains.”
The result are a fall line-up of cocktails that promises to warms the bodies and bones of its patrons and put them in the autumn mood. They’re even working on a barrel-aged line of cocktails, including Mi-Suk’s Re-Vamp ($11), which is a re-make of her signature Gothic cocktail
The Vamp , which she created and named
some 15-17 years ago in November, the Re-Vamp is a mature version: it lacks the home-made
crème de cassis
and barrel-ages the spirits for about two weeks. The oak amends the flavor, upping the smoky taste and adding a buttery mouthfeel. This cocktail made it to the
BOKA Signature Cocktails Menu
earlier this month. Have it with a turkey sammy and you can skip the cranberry sauce, let me tell you.
So if vetting new cocktails while entering a contest appeals, think about heading over to BOKA, giving some new cocktails a try, and getting to know some of the creative bartenders behind the BOKA bar.
(P.S. – Their 2011-2012 Seattle Art Museum’s SAM In the Studio Curator Series is starting up again at Hotel 1000; the next session is presented by the SAM Interim Assistant Curator of Asian Art, Catherine Roche, who will discuss “Luminous: The Art of Asia” on Wednesday, October 19th, 2011 (5:00 p.m. reception, 5:30 p.m. lecture). Hosted at STUDIO 1000 at
Hotel 1000 , complimentary BOKA
hors d’oeuvres
will be served and with $3 wines by the glass available for purchase, the proceeds of which will benefit SAM. This event will take place the third Wednesday of every month from October through February, with the exception of January and March, during which the event will take place the second Wednesday of the month, and December, in which no such event will take place.)
