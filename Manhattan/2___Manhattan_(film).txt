Early Life
Streep was born Mary Louise Streep in
Summit, New Jersey , the daughter of Mary Wolf (née Wilkinson), a
commercial artist and former art editor, and Harry William Streep, Jr., a
pharmaceutical executive. [4] [5] [6]
She has two younger brothers, Dana and Harry. [7]
Streep is of German,
Swiss ,
Irish ,
and
English
ancestry, and is descended from one of the founding fathers of
Rhode
Island , as well as from a mayor of
Loffenau
in
Germany . [8] [9]
She was raised a
Presbyterian , [10] [11] [12]
and grew up in
Bernardsville, New Jersey , where she attended and graduated as
valedictorian from
Bernards High School . [13]
She received her
B.A.
in
Drama
at
Vassar College
in 1971 (where she briefly received instruction from
Jean
Arthur ), but also enrolled as an exchange student at
Dartmouth College
for a semester before that school had become
coeducational. She subsequently earned an
M.F.A.
from
Yale School of Drama . While at Yale she played a variety of roles onstage, [14]
from the glamorous
Helena
in
A Midsummer Night's Dream
to an eighty-year old woman in a wheelchair in a
comedy written by then-unknown playwrights
Christopher Durang
and
Albert Innaurato . [15] [16]
"It was immediately apparent," said then-dean
Robert Brustein , "that she was destined for greatness." [17]
Early Career
Streep performed in several theater productions in New York after
graduating from
Yale School of Drama , including the
New York Shakespeare Festival
productions of
Henry V ,
The Taming
of the Shrew
with
Raúl
Juliá , and
Measure for Measure
opposite
Sam
Waterston
and
John
Cazale , who became her fiancé. She starred on Broadway in the Brecht/Weill
musical
Happy End , and won an
Obie
for her performance in the all-sung off-Broadway production of
Alice at the
Palace .
Streep began auditioning for film roles, and later recalled an unsuccessful
audition for
Dino De Laurentiis
for the leading role in
King Kong . De Laurentiis commented to his son in Italian, "She's ugly.
Why did you bring me this thing?" and was shocked when Streep replied in
fluent Italian. [18]
Streep's first feature film was
Julia
(1976), in which she played a small but pivotal role during a
flashback scene. Streep was living in
New
York City
with her fiancé, Cazale, who had been diagnosed with
bone cancer . He was cast in
The Deer Hunter
(1978), and Streep was delighted to secure a small
role because it allowed her to remain with Cazale for the duration of filming.
She was not specifically interested in the part, commenting, "They needed a
girl between the two guys and I was it." [19]
She played a leading role in the television
miniseries
Holocaust
(1978) as an
Aryan
woman married to a
Jewish
artist in
Nazi era
Germany. She later explained that she had considered the material
to be "unrelentingly noble", [19]
and had taken the role only because she had needed money. [20]
Streep travelled to Germany and Austria for filming while Cazale remained in
New York. Upon her return, Streep found that Cazale's illness had progressed,
and she nursed him until his death on March 12, 1978. She spoke of her grief
and her hope that work would provide a diversion; she accepted a role in
The Seduction of Joe Tynan
(1979) with
Alan Alda ,
later commenting that she played it on "automatic pilot", [19]
and performed the role of
Kate
in
The Taming of the Shrew
for
Shakespeare in the Park . [21]
With an estimated audience of 109 million,
Holocaust
brought a degree
of public recognition to Streep, who was described in August 1978 as "on the
verge of national visibility". [20]
She won the
Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress – Miniseries or a Movie
for her performance.
The Deer Hunter
(1978) was released a month later, and Streep was
nominated for the
Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress
for her performance. In
September 1978, she married sculptor
Don
Gummer .
Streep played a supporting role in
Manhattan
(1979) for
Woody
Allen , later stating that she had not seen a complete script and was given
only the six pages of her own scenes, [22]
and that she had not been permitted to improvise a word of her dialogue. [23]
Asked to comment on the script for
Kramer vs. Kramer
(1979), in a meeting with the producer Stan Jaffee,
director
Robert Benton
and star
Dustin Hoffman , Streep insisted that the female character was not
representative of many real women who faced marriage breakdown and child
custody battles, and was written as "too evil". [19]
Jaffee, Benton and Hoffman agreed with Streep, and the script was revised. [19]
In preparing for the part, Streep spoke to her own mother about her life as a
mother and housewife with a career, [24]
and frequented the
Upper East Side
neighborhood in which the film was set. [19]
Benton allowed Streep to write her dialogue in two of her key scenes, despite
some objection from Hoffman. [25]
Jaffee and Hoffman later spoke of Streep's tirelessness, with Hoffman
commenting, "She's extraordinarily hardworking, to the extent that she's
obsessive. I think that she thinks about nothing else but what she's doing." [26]
Streep drew critical acclaim for her performance in each of her three films
released in 1979: the
romantic comedy
Manhattan , the political drama,
The Seduction of
Joe Tynan
and the
courtroom drama ,
Kramer vs. Kramer . She was awarded the
Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress ,
National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress
and
National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress
for her
collective work in the three films. Among the awards won for
Kramer vs.
Kramer
were the Academy Award and
Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress .
1980s
Streep at the Academy Awards, 1988
After prominent supporting roles in two of the 1970s most successful films,
the consecutive winners of the
Academy Award for Best Picture ,
The Deer Hunter
and
Kramer vs.
Kramer , and praise for her versatility in several supporting roles, Streep
progressed to leading roles. Her first was
The French Lieutenant's Woman
(1981). A
story within a story
drama, the film paired Streep with
Jeremy Irons
as contemporary actors, telling their modern story as well as
the
Victorian era
drama they were performing. A
New York Magazine
article commented that while many female stars of
the past had cultivated a singular identity in their films, Streep was a " chameleon ",
willing to play any type of role. [27]
Streep was awarded her first
BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role
for her work.
Her next film, the
psychological thriller ,
Still of the Night
(1982) reunited her with
Robert Benton , the director of
Kramer vs. Kramer , and co-starred
Roy
Scheider
and
Jessica Tandy .
Vincent Canby , writing for the
New York Times
noted that the film was an homage to the works of
Alfred Hitchcock , but that one of its main weaknesses was a lack of
chemistry between Streep and Scheider, concluding that Streep "is stunning,
but she's not on screen anywhere near long enough". [28]
As the
Polish
holocaust survivor
in
Sophie's Choice
(1982), Streep's emotional dramatic performance and
her apparent mastery of a Polish accent drew praise.
William Styron
wrote the novel with
Ursula Andress
in mind for the part of Sophie, but Streep was very
determined to get the role. After she obtained a pirated copy of the script,
she went to
Alan J. Pakula
and threw herself on the ground begging him to give her the
part. Streep filmed the "choice" scene in one take and refused to do it again,
as she found shooting the scene extremely painful and emotionally draining. [29]
Among several notable acting awards, Streep won the
Academy Award for Best Actress
for her performance. She followed this
success with a biographical film,
Silkwood
(1983), in which she played her first real-life character, the
union activist
Karen Silkwood . She discussed her preparation for the role in an interview
with
Roger Ebert
and said that she had met with people close to Silkwood to
learn more about her, and in doing so realized that each person saw a
different aspect of Silkwood. [30]
Streep concentrated on the events of Silkwood's life and concluded, "I didn't
try to turn myself into Karen. I just tried to look at what she did. I put
together every piece of information I could find about her... What I finally
did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the
inside." [30]
Her next films were a
romantic comedy ,
Falling in Love
(1984) opposite
Robert De Niro , and a British drama,
Plenty
(1985). Roger Ebert said of Streep's performance in
Plenty
that she conveyed "great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic,
self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm... Streep
creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a
catalogue of symptoms." [31]
Out of Africa
(1985) starred Streep as the Danish writer
Karen
Blixen
and co-starred
Robert Redford . A significant critical success, the film received a 63% "fresh"
rating from Rotten Tomatoes. [32]
Streep co-starred with
Jack Nicholson
in her next two films, the dramas
Heartburn
(1986) and
Ironweed
(1987), in which she sang onscreen for the first time. In
A Cry in the Dark
(1988), she played the biographical role of
Lindy Chamberlain , an Australian woman who had been convicted of the
murder of her infant daughter in which Chamberlain claimed her baby had been
taken by a
dingo .
Filmed in Australia, Streep won the
Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role , a
Best Actress
at the
Cannes Film Festival
and the
New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress , and was nominated for
several other awards.
In
She-Devil
(1989), Streep played her first comedic role, opposite
Roseanne Barr . Richard Corliss, writing for
Time,
commented that
Streep was the "one reason" to see the film and observed that it marked a
departure from the type of role for which she had been known, saying, "Surprise!
Inside the
Greer
Garson
roles Streep usually plays, a vixenish
Carole Lombard
is screaming to be cut loose." [33]
1990s and
2000s
From 1984 to 1990, Streep won six
People's Choice Awards
for Favorite Motion Picture Actress and, in 1990,
was named World Favorite.
In the 1990s, Streep took a greater variety of roles, including a
strung-out movie actress in a screen adaptation of
Carrie Fisher 's novel
Postcards from the Edge , with
Dennis Quaid
and
Shirley MacLaine . Streep and
Goldie
Hawn
had established a friendship and were interested in making a film
together. After considering various projects, they decided upon
Thelma and Louise , until Streep's pregnancy coincided with the filming
schedule, and the producers decided to proceed with
Susan Sarandon
and
Geena
Davis . [18]
They subsequently filmed the farcical black comedy,
Death Becomes Her , with
Bruce
Willis
as their co-star.
Time' s Richard Corliss wrote approvingly
of Streep's "wicked-witch routine" but dismissed the film as " She-Devil
with a make-over". [34]
Biographer Karen Hollinger describes this period as a downturn in the
popularity of Streep's films, which reached its nadir with the failure of
Death Becomes Her , attributing this partly to a critical perception that
her comedies had been an attempt to convey a lighter image following several
serious but commercially unsuccessful dramas, and more significantly to the
lack of options available to an actress in her forties. [35]
Streep commented that she had limited her options by her preference to work in
Los Angeles, close to her family, [35]
a situation that she had anticipated in a 1981 interview when she commented, "By
the time an actress hits her mid-forties, no one's interested in her anymore.
And if you want to fit a couple of babies into that schedule as well, you've
got to pick your parts with great care." [27]
Streep appeared with
Glenn
Close
in the movie version of
Isabel Allende 's
The House of the Spirits , the screen adaptation of
The Bridges of Madison County
with
Clint Eastwood ,
The River Wild ,
Marvin's Room
(with
Diane
Keaton
and
Leonardo DiCaprio ),
One True Thing , and
Music of the Heart , in a role that required her to learn to play the
violin .
Streep is adept with foreign accents and some of her best known roles have
called for them. In
The Bridges of Madison County , she played a woman from
Bari ,
Italy , while in
Sophie's Choice
she adopted a Polish accent. She was a
voice actor
for the animated series
The
Simpsons ,
King of the Hill
and voiced the Blue Fairy character in the
Steven Spielberg
film
A.I. Artificial Intelligence .
In 2002, she costarred with
Nicolas Cage
in
Spike
Jonze 's
Adaptation.
as real-life author
Susan
Orlean , and with
Nicole Kidman
and
Julianne Moore
in
The Hours . She also appeared with
Al Pacino
and
Emma Thompson
in the
HBO
adaptation of
Tony
Kushner 's six-hour play,
Angels in America , in which she had four roles. She received her
second
Emmy Award
for
Angels in America , which reunited her with director
Mike
Nichols
(who directed her in
Silkwood ,
Heartburn , and
Postcards from the Edge ). She also played
Aunt Josephine
in
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events
with
Jim
Carrey .
Streep in 2004
In addition, she appeared in
Jonathan Demme 's remake of
The Manchurian Candidate , costarring
Denzel Washington , in which she played a role first performed by
Angela Lansbury . Since 2002, Streep has hosted the annual event Poetry &
the Creative Mind, a benefit in support of
National Poetry Month
and a program of the
Academy of American Poets . Streep co-hosted the annual
Nobel Peace Prize
Concert with
Liam
Neeson
in Oslo, Norway, in 2001.
In 2004, Streep was awarded the
