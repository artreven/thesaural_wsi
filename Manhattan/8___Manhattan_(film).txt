Frank Lloyd Wright
(born Frank Lincoln Wright, June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) was an
American Architect , interior designer, writer and educator, who designed more than 1,000 structures and completed 532 works. Wright believed in designing structures which were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was best exemplified by his design for
Fallingwater
(1935) featured in the photo above, which has been called “the best all-time work of
American Architecture “. Wright was a leader of the Prairie School movement of architecture and developed the concept of the Usonian home, his unique vision for urban planning in the United States.
Wright’s portfolio includes original and innovative examples of many different building types, including offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, and museums. Wright also designed many of the interior elements of his buildings, such as the furniture and stained glass. Wright authored 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. His colorful personal life often made headlines, most notably for the 1914 fire and murders at his Taliesin studio. Already well known during his lifetime, Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as “the greatest American architect of all time.”
Wright’s most famous private residences — Fallingwater — was built from 1934 to 1937 for Mr. and Mrs. Edgar J. Kaufmann Sr., at Mill Run, Pennsylvania, not too far from Pittsburgh. It was designed according to Wright’s desire to place the occupants close to the natural surroundings, with a stream and waterfall running under part of the building. Wright wanted the new residences to live with the waterfalls, to make them part of their everyday lives. He didn’t want them to just look at them every now and again. Constructed over a 30-foot waterfall, the house may look very big on the outside but on the inside it is quite small, which surprises some visitors. It was made with three bedrooms, a massive living room and a dining room. The house was more of a design for a family getaway not for a live-in family. The construction is a series of
cantilevered balconies
and terraces, using limestone for all verticals and concrete for the horizontals. The house cost $155,000, including the architect’s fee of $8,000. It was one of Wright’s most expensive pieces. Kaufmann’s own engineers argued that the design was not sound. They were overruled by Wright, but the contractor secretly added extra steel to the horizontal concrete elements. In 1994, Robert Silman and Associates examined the building and developed a plan to restore the structure. In the late 1990s, steel supports were added under the lowest cantilever until a detailed structural analysis could be done. In March 2002, post-tensioning of the lowest terrace was completed.
The iconic “ Guggenheim Museum ” (also featured in the photo above) is located in New York City. This project kept Wright occupied for 16 years (1943–1959) and is probably his most recognized masterpiece. The building rises as a warm beige spiral from its site on Fifth Avenue; its interior is similar to the inside of a seashell. Its unique central geometry was meant to allow visitors to easily experience Guggenheim’s collection of nonobjective geometric paintings by taking an elevator to the top level and then viewing artworks by walking down the slowly descending, central spiral ramp, the floor of which is embedded with circular shapes and triangular light fixtures to complement the geometric nature of the structure. However, when the museum was completed, a number of details of Wright’s design were ignored, such as his desire for the interior to be painted off-white. Further, the Museum currently designs exhibits to be viewed by walking up the curved walkway rather than walking down from the top level.

The New York City practice  Thomas Phifer and Partners  have unveiled their design for the new 100,000 square foot North Wing expansion at the
Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, New York . The state of the art, “energy smart” building will provide the ideal interior environment for preserving the
Museum’s
unparalleled collection of glass art through natural lighting, an intelligent building envelope and sophisticated temperature and air quality controls. The $64 million North Wing is scheduled for completion in 2014.
Included in the expansion will be a 26,000 square feet of gallery space. This is the largest space anywhere dedicated to the presentation of contemporary art in glass.
Environmentally Sustainable Design Elements:
Insulated double glazed windows with high performance, low-E coating to reduce heat gain
Daytime illumination provided by natural light
Daylight harvesting system
Carbon dioxide monitors control volume of outside air intake
Enthalpy wheel recovers heat from building exhaust
VAV controls track occupancy and system performance to reduce energy consumption
Water economizer uses cooling towers instead of chillers to produce cooling in winter for pumps
Multiple valves on cooling coils reduce energy required for dehumidification
Commissioning of building systems maximizes equipment efficiency
Facility personnel training improves long-term maintenance and operation
Design of storm water retention reduces run-off and erosion
Site lighting is designed to meet Dark Sky standards

The  Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum  (often referred to as “The Guggenheim”) is a well-known museum located on the  Upper East Side  of  Manhattan  in  New York City ,  United States . It is the permanent home to a renowned collection of Impressionist ,  Post-Impressionist , early  Modern , and  contemporary art  and also features special exhibitions throughout the year. Designed by  Frank Lloyd Wright , it is one of the 20th century’s most important architectural landmarks. [ citation needed ]
The museum opened on October 21, 1959, and was the second museum opened by the  Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation ; from 2005 to 2008 it underwent an extensive renovation.
The building has become a cultural icon and can be seen widely throughout popular culture. It is featured in  Matthew Barney ‘s  The Cremaster Cycle ,  Bye Bye Birdie ,  Men in Black , When in Rome ,  Downtown 81 , Ugly Betty  and prominently in  The International , where a major shootout occurs in the museum. (In fact, a life-size replica of the museum was built for this scene.)
In the film,  Manhattan ,  Woody Allen  meets  Diane Keaton  at the museum. In  Someone to Watch Over Me  there’s a scene in the museum where the killer confronts the woman who witnessed him murdering her friend.  Mr. Popper’s Penguins  has a scene where the penguins surf on ice water spilled on the floor, during a social event being held in the museum.  The New Yorker  has included the museum multiple times on its cover and cartoons.

Written by David Cohn
Francisco “Patxi” Mangado, the 54-year-old Spanish architect, compares his bronze-clad Archaeological Museum of Álava in Vitoria, Spain, to a “coffer guarding a treasure.” He has developed this apparently simple conceit at a number of different levels in the work, so that it acquires a sensual resonance that reaches beyond words to convey his poetic intent.

The architect uses the contrast between the building’s bronze and glass skin and its setting within Vitoria’s medieval core to further develop his evocation of archaeological layering. A quiet city of 230,000, Vitoria is the capital of the Basque region, with a rich history dating back to the sixth century AD. The museum, a mixed concrete-and-steel-frame structure, is part of an ongoing effort by local authorities to rehabilitate the medieval center, which has been in decline through most of the 20th century. Located on one of its livelier streets lined with bars, old shops, and a few monumental buildings, the museum adjoins the 16th-century Bendaña Palace. In 1994 the palace was renovated to house the Fournier Museum of Playing Cards as the town’s homage to a well-known local industry. The two museums now share a common entry court.

Sketch by Gertler & Wente
written by  Molly Heintz
On September 11
all eyes will be on the World Trade Center site, where the 9/11 Memorial and Museum will open with ceremonies commemorating the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on New York City. In addition to a subterranean museum and memorial space, the much-anticipated complex includes an aboveground museum pavilion and a landscaped plaza with reflecting pools in the footprints of the Twin Towers.  However, due to extensive crowd control and security concerns, visitors who make a spontaneous trip to the site may find themselves not standing in these new public spaces but stuck at the site’s perimeter looking at photographs of them stretched across a chain-link construction fence instead.
