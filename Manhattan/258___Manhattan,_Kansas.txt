Viruses: A Very Short Introduction – review
In the wake of outbreaks of "bird 'flu", HIV, SARS, and Ebola, Hollywood just released the thriller,
Contagion , a film centered on the threat posed by a lethal airborne virus that kills within days. But even though viruses are big news, these tiniest of killers remain poorly known by most of the public. For example, many people – including some medical doctors! – are unaware that viruses and bacteria are very different things. This might appear trivial, but this seemingly small difference means a world of difference when it comes to dealing with and medically treating viral infections.

Viruses: A Very Short Introduction
[ Amazon UK ;
