An Englishman Solves American Puzzles
A cryptic crossword expert is uprooted from suburban England to rural Pennsylvania. How will he fare in the land of Aleros, ERAs and Oreos?

NYT Friday 1/1/10 - First Footing
A very happy new year - I hope you all have a wonderful solving year in 2010! I was half-expecting a thematic puzzle for 01/01/10, but this
New York Times
crossword seemed regular Friday fare. I got off to a great start guessing
withers
for 1-Across, which helped me land the whole NW corner in three minutes or so.
This helpful picture on flickr labels 25 of the horse parts for you .
That stroke of luck didn't last: seeing that the NE corner was going to be a minefield, I worked my way steadily clockwise, getting a leg-up every time I cracked one of the long down answers in the middle section. After 27 minutes, I just had the top right bit to do and was very apprehensive about it all until I managed to guess
Perot
and then
Pfizer .
With all those new initial letters, I was able to get the problem down to just what to do with 9-Down
F-AN- , specifically the crossings with 15-Across
PE-RINE
and 23-Across
AL RIT- . Not knowing any of these three, I simply had to make calculated guesses and eventually concluded
Franz
was most likely, and if there was any justice in the world I'd have got the puzzle right. I was relieved to check Wikipedia and confirm my hunches were A-OK this time.

New To Me
15a
Perrine
{Valerie of "The Electric Horseman"}. There was some blind guesswork here, as
Hans and Franz
were unfamiliar.
Valerie Perrine
is an actress and model notable as the first person to display herself nude on American television by completely baring her breasts during the May 4, 1973 broadcast of
Bruce Jay Friedman 's
Steambath . In
The Electric Horseman
(1979), she plays the minor role of Charlotta Steele, ex-wife of the rodeo champion played by
Robert Redford .
21a
Nat
{Basketball Hall-of-Famer Holman}.
Nat Holman
(1896–1995) was an early pro basketball player and one of its great innovators. After retiring in 1930, he took over the head coaching position at the
City College of New York
in 1920. Known as "Mr. Basketball", Holman guided CCNY to the so-called grand slam of college basketball, winning
both
the
NCAA
and
NIT
titles in 1950, a feat that has never been achieved since.
22a
Erno
{Resistance leader in Woody Allen's "Sleeper"}. Well
Sleeper
(1973) is one of my favorite early
Woody Allen
movies, but there's no way I'd remember
Erno
unless I'd rewatched the film in the preceding week ...
Erno
shmerno.
23a
Al Ritz
{Eldest of a trio of comic brothers in 1930s-'40s films}. Until considering 9-Down, I had
Al Ritt
here, but was convinced to go with the Z ending to make the
SNL
character a more likely one. The
Ritz Brothers
have parallels with the
Marx Brothers , not least in the shape of their surname: there were four brothers, sons of an Austrian-born haberdasher, but only
Al ,
Jimmy
and
Harry
performed, the fourth brother
George
becoming their manager. Here they are in
The Goldwyn Follies
(1938).
24a
I Go
{Neil Sedaka's "___ Ape"}.
I Go Ape
was a hit for
Neil Sedaka
in 1959, the year I was born. A clip says it all.
25a
Nicol
{Williamson who played Hamlet and Macbeth on Broadway}. I've a feeling I'll recognize
Nicol Williamson
when I see a clip of him, as he's the British actor that
John Osborne
described as "the greatest actor since
Marlon Brando ". Ah yes, I know the face from such movies as
The Seven-Per-Cent Solution
(1976), the
Sherlock Holmes
pastiche in which
Nicol
plays the Great Detective. This shows the swashbuckling Holmes didn't start with
Robert Downey, Jr. .
60a
Neptune
{Great Dark Spot locale}. Stupidly had
Jupiter
here for a while: stupid not least because there's no way a 14-letter answer would have a
J
in the penultimate position (well I suppose it could have been somebody
Jr.
but that is highly unlikely). Like Jupiter's
Great Red Spot , a
Great Dark Spot
on
Neptune
is a massive
anticyclonic storm . However, the Great Dark Spots are comparatively short-lived, dissipating once every few years. Jupiter's Red Spot has lasted several hundred years.
7d
Steel Magnolias
{Play set entirely in a beauty parlor}. I was happy to get this from about half the crossings: although I know absolutely zilch about the play, the title is so striking that it has stuck in the mind.
Steel Magnolias
is probably better known as a 1989 movie, originally a 1987
Robert Harling
play. The drama concerns a group of Southern women in northwest
Louisiana
and is based on the playwright's experience with the death of his sister. The movie action seems to have been moved out of the beauty parlor to a large extent.
9d
Franz
{Half of a recurring "Saturday Night Live" duo}.
SNL
history is really tough for me and I'm not sure what I'm going to be able to do about that. Watching the performances is so much better than reading about them, so maybe I should dig out a "best of SNL" collection to view? Anyway,
Hans and Franz
appeared in a recurring sketch called " Pumping Up with Hans & Franz " and were played by
Dana Carvey
and
Kevin Nealon , respectively. YouTube is remarkably deficient in the original
Hans and Franz : however, do you really want to see a
Hans and Franz
tribute made by high school students? No I thought not.
Noteworthy
14a
One o' Cat
{Quaint game with a giver and a striker}. I'd luckily met this "quaint" game before somewhere - almost certainly another crossword. I gather
One o' Cat , short for
One Old Cat , is one of the forerunners of
baseball . The "one" refers to the number of batters in the game; if you have enough players for two batters you can play
Two o' Cat ; even more players and you have the option of
town ball .
52a
fun
{First Across word in the world's first crossword}. A gimme at last! Strangely, the first across word in the world's first crossword was also filled in for you.
Englishman
Arthur Wynne 's first crossword appeared on December 21, 1913 in the
New York World . This is the first time I've seen its original appearance and I'm amazed at the size of the numbers ... you're supposed to write letters over those? ... I wonder how long it was before the now standard presentation (single small number marking the start of across or down) was adopted?
55a
Ali Baba
{His opening statement is famous}. Got this once I had the first few letters:
Ali Baba 's famous opening statement is of course "Open Sesame".
5d
écu
{Coin depicting Louis XVI}. The
ECU
(European Currency Unit) was briefly the name of the basket of the currencies of the
European Community
member states, prior to it being replaced by the
euro
on January 1, 1999. It is presumably just a coincidence that
écu
is also the name of several obsolete French coins. I'll see if I can find a picture of a
Louis XVI
écu . No dice, let's go with
Louis XIII .
20d
fright wig
{Clown's over-the-top topper}. Don't know how, but I've actually come across
fright wig
references before. Maybe through reading about
Harpo Marx
... a fright wig has hair that sticks out dramatically, like quills upon the fretful porpentine, as the
Bard
puts it.

NPR Puzzle: 12/27/09 -- Happy New Year!
Here's the puzzle for this week:
Take the phrase "pray when." Double four of these letters. Using these letters plus the four singles, rearrange all 12 letters to spell a familiar phrase. What phrase is it?
Um, the answer is pretty obvious:
H A P P Y
N E W
Y E A R
!
And here's the Times Square Ball for good measure:
Everyone have a safe & joyous New Year's celebration, and we'll see you next year!

NYT Thursday 12/31/09 - Piglet Trio
This Thursday
New York Times
crossword went fairly well, even though there's a lot of stuff in the
New to Me
section today. When progressing down the grid, I got stuck in the vicinity of each rebus square, so my first insight into the theme came when I solved 60a
Three Little Pigs
after 10 minutes or so.
I initially thought the pigs might be diagonally hidden, but eventually spotted the first rebus square in the northeast and then was able to finish off the grid reasonably quickly. I was lucky to have met
Hogan's Heroes
in
a puzzle in March .
I'm used to seeing a few more than three theme squares in rebus puzzles and then often in a specific arrangement. So I wondered for a while why this idea merited its appearance ... until I noticed the extra significance of the "little" in suggesting the pigs should occupy a single square (and hence appear very small) - neat idea! If you were artistically inclined, you could even draw little pigs in the squares instead of trying to write in
boar ,
sow
and
hog .
Solving time: 19 mins ( solo, no solving aids )
Clue of the puzz: 71a

Theme
60a
Three Little Pigs
{Storybook group residing in this puzzle?}. The three "little" pigs -
boar ,
sow
and

- appear in rebus squares (hence necessarily in a smaller font), affecting the following answers:
17a
chairman of the
boar d
{Person making firm decisions}
12d

22a

New To Me
5a
Hamlin
{Vice president after Breckinridge}. My knowledge of US political history hasn't yet extended to veeps, so I struggled here, needing all the crossings to be sure of
Hannibal Hamlin
(1809–1891). When I saw that
Hamlin
had been vice president under
Abe , I wondered how come he didn't become prez #17 after the assassination. Apparently
Hamlin
- a Mainer - was so unsuccessful in the job that he wasn't nominated for a second term,
Andrew Johnson
being chosen instead.
29a
Sasha
{Vujacic of the Los Angeles Lakers, who's nicknamed "The Machine"}. The
Los Angeles Lakers
came up in a trivia question over Christmas: "where are the lakes in the team name?". I gather Minnesota, "Land of 10,000 Lakes", as the basketball team made
Minneapolis
its home from 1947–1960.
Sasha Vujačić
is a Slovenian who currently plays for the team, at the
shooting guard
spot in the Lakers'
triangle offense .
47a
Jean
{Pirate Lafitte}. I thought this was probably to do with baseball, as I now know all about the
Pittsburgh Pirates . Today, however, a Pirate is just a pirate:
Jean Lafitte
(ca. 1776 – ca. 1823) filibustered around the
Gulf of Mexico
in the early 19th century. He briefly helped General
Andrew Jackson
defend New Orleans against the British in 1815, but subsequently became a Spanish spy, moving to
Galveston Island
to help develop the colony there.
54a
USMC
{Parris Isl. outfit}. This time I successfully guessed the
US Marine Corps
based on just the last two crossings.
Parris Island
is near
Beaufort, South Carolina
and is used for the training of enlisted Marines. Male recruits living east of the
Mississippi River
and female recruits from all over the United States report here to receive their initial training (male recruits living west of the Mississippi River receive their training at
Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego , but may train at Parris Island by special request).
67a
Monroe
{"Niagara" star, 1953}. Niagara is a
film noir
thriller directed by
Henry Hathaway . A big hit at the time, it features
Marilyn Monroe ,
Joseph Cotten
and
Jean Peters . Given the title, it's no surprise that
Niagara Falls
is an important setting in the drama.
70a
Incans
{Pachacuti's people}.
Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui
was the ninth
Sapa Inca
(1438-1471/1472) of the
Kingdom of Cusco , which he transformed into the empire
Tawantinsuyu , or the
Inca Empire . In
Quechua ,
Pachakutiq
means "He who remakes the world". During his reign, Cuzco grew from a hamlet into an empire that could compete with, and eventually overtake, the
Chimu .
4d
soilage
{Green crops cultivated for fodder}. A new one on me, although my first guess of
silage
came close.
Soilage
seems to derive from an etymologically distinct meaning of soil, viz to fatten livestock with green food:
soil
vt
to feed (livestock) on fresh-cut green food; to purge by so doing; to fatten.
soilage
n
green fodder for livestock.
From
The Chambers Dictionary
23d
O God
{Psalm start}. This made me think more of a hymn, viz
O God, Our Help in Ages Past , and that turns out to be a paraphrase of Psalm 90. But this is probably not what the clue is getting at. How about Psalm 63, which starts:
O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul
thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
thirsty land, where no water is;
From
The King James Bible
38d
Sara
{Tony-winning "Spamalot" actress Ramirez}.
Sara Ramirez , known for her appearances in
The OR
(official name
Grey's Anatomy ) won the Tony for playing The
Lady of the Lake
in  Spamalot . Her role is described as "An aquatic diva. Part fairy, part diva and all woman.". Here she is singing
Find Your Grail
at the awards show.
44d
Len
{"Live Free or Die Hard" director Wiseman}.
Live Free or Die Hard
(2007) is the fourth installment of the
Die Hard
series . The producers must have doubted certain audiences would get this, as the film was released as "Die Hard 4.0" outside of North America.
61d
Lon
{Hoops coach Kruger}. "Hoops" means
basketball
... maybe that should go into
Pavlov's Guide to Crosswords ?
Lon Kruger
is head coach at
UNLV , and took the
Runnin' Rebels
to the NCAA
Sweet 16
in 2007.
Noteworthy
71a
were
{Be in a certain mood?}. Nicely misleading use of
mood in the grammatical sense ,
were
being the verb "(to) be" in the
subjunctive
mood (hope I got that right).
51d
Ashton
{"Punk'd" host Kutcher}; 58d,1d
demi
sec
{Moderately sweet, to a vintner}. I covered the
Punk'd
show
back in October , so I wasn't going to comment on this until my eye lighted on
Demi , ie
Mrs Kutcher , at 58-Down. Strange to see these answers so close in the grid and yet not linked through the cluing.

NYT Wednesday 12/30/09 - My Misfortune
Based on my solving time, I did fairly well with this Wednesday
New York Times
crossword, but what is that if you can't actually get the letters right? The theme seemed straightforward enough, but - as if to compensate - the rest of the puzzle was unusually thorny.
I skated on thin ice at the intersection of 22d
O'Day
and 36a
My Love . Not knowing either of these, I was grateful to be informed of
Anita O'Day 's
pig Latin
etymology in the clue ... that pointed to an
-ay
ending. A close call, but I escaped this particular trouble spot.
Woe is me, there were much worse dangers at the bottom middle of the grid. I had no clue about either 57d
Vaca
or 64a
The O.C.
and did my usual thing of assessing which of the two answers narrowed down the possibilities better. In this case I thought 64-Across would repay close attention and reasoned there must have been a medical show called
The OR .
Vara
looked about as likely a name for an explorer as
Vaca , so I went with it. I'm not sure I could have done any better here in the absence of the required knowledge of either answer.
A couple of readers have emailed me to point out that
The New York Times Crossword Puzzle
was featured on yesterday's
Wheel of Fortune , being the answer to the question "what are you doing?". This has been a good year for the profile of the NYT puzzle in the popular media, as it was also the category an episode of
Jeopardy! , which I commented on in
my post for the April 2 puzzle .

18a
Shawn
{Wallace ___ of "Manhattan "}. There seems to be an uncharacteristic focus on
Woody Allen
movies today: not a problem for this fan ... it's just unusual to see repetitiveness rather than variety in such references. Although I recall
Wallace Shawn 's face and his role in
Manhattan
as the "homunculus" of an ex-husband, I couldn't easily cough up his name. I gather
Shawn
is also a notable playwright in an
absurdist
style, and co-wrote
My Dinner with Andre
(1981), based on his conversations with
Andre Gregory .
50a
Elks
{Order whose members have included five U.S. presidents}. Have come across the
Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks
(sometimes a crossword answer as
BPOE ), but wasn't previously aware of its presidential history. Since the BPOE was only founded in 1868 (when it was a social club called the "Jolly Cork") that rules out presidents up to #18. I'm reliably informed that the Elk presidents were:
Warren G. Harding
Franklin D. Roosevelt
Harry S Truman
John F. Kennedy
Gerald R. Ford
52a
Ali
{Rubina ___ of "Slumdog Millionaire "}. We still haven't seen
Slumdog Millionaire
(2008) despite its success at the awards ceremonies.
Rubina Ali
is the child actress who plays the youngest version of Jamal's one true love, Latika, in the movie.
64a
The O.C.
{Former Fox series set in Newport Beach}. I had big problems here and still can't quite believe that a show based in
Orange County, CA
would be called
The O.C. : why the definite article?!? ... it doesn't make sense. Anyway, not knowing the show, nor
Cabeza de Vaca , I just had to guess at the most likely name for a Fox series and went for
The OR
... well, there seem to be as many medical series on TV as stars in the sky. But Magdalen points out the show that would be called
The OR
is actually
Gray's Anatomy . Boo (hoo).
65a
Alen
{Art Deco architect William Van ___}.
William Van Alen
(1883–1954) was an American architect, best known for being the lead designer of New York City's
Chrysler Building
(1929-30), which earned him the title "Doctor of Altitude". Unfortunately,
Van Alen
doesn't seem to have been fond of paperwork and neglected to enter into a contract with  Walter Chrysler
to design the famous skyscraper; after Chrysler refused to pay the standard fee of 6% of the building costs,
Van Alen
sued and won; but the court case damaged his reputation and effectively brought an end to his career.
2d
Lila
{Oscar winner Kedrova}. Never heard of
Lila Kedrova
(1918–2000), a Russian-born French actress who got her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for playing "Madame Hortense", proprietress of the "Hotel Ritz", in
Zorba the Greek
(1964).
22d
O'Day
{Jazz singer who took her surname from pig Latin}. Strange but true:
Anita O'Day
(1919–2006), born
Anita Belle Colton , based her name on "dough" as in money, which in
pig Latin
becomes
O'Day . Here's her
Stella by Starlight
in a 1963 live performance.
45d
Ojai
{Ventura County's ___ Valley}. Had to get this largely from crossings, as I'm not sure I've met the
Ojai Valley
(pronounced "oh-high") before.
Ojai
means "Valley of the Moon" in the language of the
Chumash
Indians. It is apparently the venue for a famous music festival: the
Ojai Music Festival
was founded in 1947, features some of the world's top musicians and composers, and occurs on the first weekend after
Memorial Day .
57d
Vaca
{Explorer Cabeza de ___}. As far as I could see, the third letter of this answer could be just about any consonant. I decided to choose it on the basis of what would make a sensible TV show name at 64-Across and went for
Vara . But
Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca
(ca. 1490/1507–1557/1559) is the man I was expected to know: he was a Spanish explorer, one of four survivors of the
Narváez expedition , which attempted to
install
Pánfilo de Narváez
as governor of
Spanish Florida
during the years 1527–1528.
Cabeza de Vaca
recorded his experiences of the Native Americans in the 1542 work
La Relacion
(The Report), later known as
Naufragios
(Shipwrecks).
Noteworthy
35a
Seth
{Green of "Radio Days"}; 4d
Dianne
{Wiest of "Radio Days"}. Here are the other two
Woody Allen
references - actors in the 1987 movie
Radio Days , which introduced me to
Coney Island
years before I even thought about coming to the USA. The young radio addict Joe is played by
Seth Green
as a child actor.
Dianne Wiest
is his aunt Bea, whose search for love is a significant part of the plot. Since
Wallace Shawn
is also in this movie as the diminutive performer of the "Masked Avenger" on radio, I'm surprised we didn't get {Wallace of "Radio Days"} for 18-Across which would definitely have made a feature of the coincidence of getting all three into the same grid. I guess it might have something to do with
Shawn
being a surname, while these two are forenames.
36d
Myra
{Vidal's "___ Breckinridge"}. I knew the title of this
Gore Vidal
novel, maybe via
the 1970 movie adaptation , though I know I've never seen it.
Myra Breckinridge
(1968) is a campy satirical novel set in the Hollywood of the 1960s. Despite its stellar cast, the movie is apparently famously bad and often cited as one of the
worst films ever made .
58d
oyer
{___ and terminer}. Nice gimme, which I knew from
The Chambers Dictionary .
oyer and terminer
(literally "hear and determine") is an obsolete term in English law, being a royal commission with the power to hear and determine criminal causes.

NYT Tuesday 12/29/09 - Getting the Bird
This is an abbreviated form of my usual crossword post, as I'm in vacation mode for a few days. It took me two attempts to figure out the theme of this Tuesday
New York Times
crossword. I saw
Dover
in 16-Across and then
Nice
in 22-Across and (not considering the unlikelihood of the latter as something "hidden") wrote in
ports
for 46-Down. Of course that answer didn't hold up and I very quickly realized
birds
would do much better.
The only significant problems for me were around the intersection of 31a
Aussie
and 31d
ancon . Although I knew the latter existed as a word, I had to check its meanings in the dictionary to be sure I'd got the answer right.
ancon
n (pl
ancones ) the elbow; a console to support a door cornice; a breed of sheep with very short legs.
Recognition of
Aussie
for 31-Across was hampered by my having
rpm
(rather than the less common
rps ) for 24-Down. When I realize the reference, I was a little surprised that it should appear in an American puzzle and wondered how well it would be understood. I see from Wikipedia's
shrimp on the barbie
page that the expression featured in
Paul Hogan
ads aired in the USA, so I may be worrying unduly.
From a barbie to
Betsy Wetsy , referenced in 12-Down. I'd heard of this toy before, but never seen one in the not-so-inviting flesh: the doll's unique selling point was its ability to urinate, hence the name presumably. In 2003, the
Toy Industry Association
named
Betsy Wetsy
as one of the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the 20th century.

NYT Monday 12/28/09 - Missing Links
This is an abbreviated form of my usual crossword post, as I'm in vacation mode for a few days. The theme of this Monday
New York Times
crossword is beautifully simple, but I can't recall seeing anything like it before.
Only one thematic aspect caused any problems for me: I hadn't heard of a
hard roll
before, which I believe is a variant term for "Kaiser roll". If "bed" had been used as the linking word here, the clue would have worked better for me.
Overall, the puzzle was maybe slightly harder than average, but the extra minute or so that it took me to finish the grid may just come down to seasonal haziness. It was nice to be reminded of
Roz Chast
- both Magdalen and I love her work in
The New Yorker . Here's a short documentary special about her.

NPR Puzzle -- The Last Puzzle of 2009!
Here's the puzzle for this week:
Take the phrase "pray when." Double four of these letters. Using these letters plus the four singles, rearrange all 12 letters to spell a familiar phrase. What phrase is it?
Ross got it immediately.  I'll admit I was Twittering ( bad Magdalen ) and so focused on it a bit late, but I got it pretty quickly as well.  In fact, I just blurted it out, which mean Henry got it whether he wanted it or not!
I won't hint (I rather think you've all got it as well -- not precisely the hardest puzzle evah) but on Thursday I'll pass along Ross's reasons why this is actually an even cleverer puzzle than it seems at first glance.
Meanwhile, Christmas is past us.  Boxing Day (aka St. Stephen's Day) is past us.  We're in the home stretch on the end of 2009.  There are going to be some subtle changes
chez
Crossword Man in 2010, but it could be there won't be anything specific to report for a year or so -- if ever.
Don't worry, though:  we'll still be solving puzzles.  Some things never change!
And, as a last image of the old year:  here's the 2009 Christmas Cake:
This is an annual tradition, adapted from Henry's childhood.  On Stir-Up Sunday (no, I'm not making this up) you make a large round fruitcake.  That's the last Sunday in November, so roughly four weeks before Christmas.  For those four weeks, the cake is wrapped in cheesecloth and tin foil and is regularly drizzled with alcohol.  (Bourbon is good; brandy is traditional, and this year we used dark rum.)  The cake is pleasantly moist by the time this process is complete.
On Christmas Eve, unwrap the cake and coat it with a layer of almond paste, and then frost it.  The traditional approach is to use a fondant icing (looks great, tastes stupid) but I use a cream cheese frosting because why not and it tastes better.  Then we decorate it.  We found these little figures and props on sale at the CVS in South Philly -- but they're just about the right size!  We have a lot more, so there's always a selection to pick from.  Ross got to decorate this year's cake and decided the call box had to go in the middle.  The rest, as they say, is history.  (Oh, and if you're wondering, the white cord runs to a battery case that lights up the "fire" in the trash can where the guys are warming their hands.)
I'd include a picture of the cake taken today, but it's sadly a fraction of its original girth.  Trust me: this cake is good.
See you all in 2010!

NYT Sunday 12/27/09 - Countdown to 2010
This is an abbreviated form of my usual crossword post, as I'm in vacation mode for a few days. The appearance of the grid and title gave much away about the subject of this Sunday
New York Times
crossword, although we didn't expect so much attention to be given to  Dom Pérignon
when we started solving. The long answers relating to his "discovery" of champagne were among the toughest in the puzzle.
Dom Pérignon (c. 1638–1715) made important contributions to the production and quality of champagne, but definitely wasn't its inventor, nor did he make the quote attributed to him, but (to be fair) the crossword acknowledges all this in its use of "purported" in 25-Across. The evidence is that sparkling wine was first intentionally produced by the Englishman (!)
Christopher Merret
(1614/5–1695).
As usual, I solved this as a joint effort - today with my wife Magdalen and friend Henry. Many hands don't make light work when it comes to Sunday puzzles and we were also hampered by trying to eat cheese quesadillas while solving. Our time as a threesome was about the same as our usual Sunday time as a pair.
There was one particular crossing that gave trouble: none of us knew Russian figure skater
Ilia Kulik
for 14-Down; we didn't know the
Hollis
neighborhood of
Queens
for 20-Across either. Fortunately, only one letter looked at all likely at the crossing.
It seems a little early to be celebrating the new year, but I guess that running this puzzle on Sunday January 3rd would have seemed a bit late.What's your favorite movie with a new year theme? Mine is the
Billy Wilder -directed film
The Apartment
(1960), which deservedly won five Oscars.
Solving time: 32 mins ( with Magdalen and Henry, no solving aids )
Clue of the puzz: 69a
narc
{Person on the alert for snow?}
Solution

Theme
"Toasting the New Year". Some thematic answers relate closely to
Dom Pérignon 's supposed discovery of
champagne ; other symmetrical answers relate peripherally to this theme and its connection with
New Year celebrations . The central part of the grid is shaped like a glass with
champagne
in the bottom and
bubbles
floating up (see circled letters).

NYT Saturday 12/26/09 - A Night Mare
This is an abbreviated form of my usual crossword post, as I'm in vacation mode for a few days. As I suspected might happen, the editorial gloves were off for this first post-holiday
New York Times
crossword. I made reasonable progress at the start, getting the SW corner first, then working up and completing the NW and much of the middle.
Unfortunately, the right hand side proved much tougher: I suspected all along that the NE would stump me, but I had hopes of completing the SE area without help. This wasn't to be, however, and after an hour had gone by, with little hope of further progress, I called in the cavalry.
Henry hadn't progressed much beyond what I'd done, so it was up to Magdalen to help finish up the grid. She got critical answers like
M. Night Shyamalan ,
Tony Dow
and
Elmo , and the grid was completed very quickly with her complementary knowledge.
I gather that the central figure in the grid,
M. Night Shyamalan , has strong associations with
Philadelphia , where Henry lives and where Magdalen lived until recently. Magdalen in fact remembers seeing some of the filming of
The Village
(2004). If I'd know this critical long answer, I might have done a
bit
better; but that top right hand corner was always going to be tricky, especially as I persisted in thinking 39-Across was likely to be
aloes
(as well it might have been, but I should have rethought it sooner).
Solving time: 66 mins ( with Magdalen and Henry, no solving aids )
Clue of the puzz: 26d
E-I-E-I-O
{Letters after many animal names}
