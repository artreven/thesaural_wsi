Friday Funny
I'm guessing most of you have seen these
Ryan Gosling memes
but had to share them just in case.
I ran across them yesterday and haven't stopped smiling since.
Here are a few of the quilting related ones.
This one
kiiiilllss me.
Seems now is not the time for a Pinterest Challenge.  That's cool.  I'm still committed to my 2 dishes.  One down.  One more to go.  A report next week.  Have a great weekend!

Pinterest Challenge

So we all love pinning things, yes?  But how many of us actually make or do any of our pins?  That's what I thought.  I do think there is benefit in simply pinning - it can set off a creative spark, provide an escape or form of relaxation or help you define parts of yourself.  However, I think most of us pin with the intention of actually using our pins.  Right?
To gently push us to go beyond simply pinning I thought a little challenge among friends  was in order.
Here is the challenge:
Pick 2 things from your Pinterest Boards to make or do this week.  Try that organizational system you pinned or polish your nails with that great color you saw.   Pick 2 simple things, make it easy on yourself.  This is not a Pinterest boot camp.  This is a gentle encouragement to move on something that interests you.
I'm going to cook 2 recipes from my
Savory Board
- Grilled Asparagus ( my fav veggie )  and Chicken Kale Casserole.  I'm definitely in a dinner funk where everything feels old and boring and yucky.  Perhaps a few new recipes will lighten my cooking mood.  It is worth a try.
Join in!
If you have a blog link up below.  If not, leave a comment and tell us what 2 things you are going to try.  Give us a link to your Pinterest Boards.  If you're a friend on Facebook, leave a comment there.
We'll share our results next Wednesday with another chance to link-up.  Yay.
Good luck!

Soaking it up
There is another weather condition that causes
Seattlites to freak out
and that is springtime sunshine.  This, of course, is a completely natural response after being deprived of light and warmth for so long.  We can only take so much gray.  So we joined the rest of the city outside this weekend and basked in the warmth.
When the sun comes out I'm always reminded of what an amazingly beautiful area the Pacific Northwest is.  It almost makes up for the days and days of gray drizzle.  Almost.  From the beach where we stationed ourselves on Sunday we could see the Olympics in the distance, boats out on the Puget Sound and sea lions (possibly seals?) barking at us as they swam by.  Ah, a glorious day to be in Seattle.  We know enough to get out in it while we can.  After all it is only April and the gray will return.

Taking a Break
The girls are on spring break this week and they are enjoying some much needed down time.  They're lounging, reading, playing outside and relishing in the unstructured time.  They even complained of boredom - lucky girls!
Surprised and honored that one of my hipstamatic photos was included in
Pioneer Woman's Phone Photo Challenge (group 3)
FIXED THE LINK!  This time I really mean it.

A Stately Dinner
Last night we had our dinner inspired by a few American States.  If you remember, we came up with this idea during the
International dinner with had with our neighbors
a few months ago.  Each couple drew a U.S. State and a course. Each course had to have a drink to go with it.  Bryce and I drew appetizer and New York.
With all the children having fun with a babysitter next door we were free to relax and enjoy.  The night was super fun, the conversation lively and inappropriate and the courses tasty and inspired.  Here is the run down ~
Appetizer from New York
Bagels with a schmear of cream cheese, topped with
lox
and capers served with a
Manhattan .
~~~~~~~~
Side, salad or soup from Minnesota
Swedish meatballs,
lefse , and picked cabbage served with the Champagne of beers,
Miller High life .
~~~~~
Main Course from Alaska
Gorgeous
Coho salmon
served with
Alaskan Amber beer.
~~~~~
Dessert from California
Nut squares (a family recipe) with homemade vanilla and
Ghirardelli Chocolate
ice cream  served with wine.
As you can imagine we're all still digesting . . .

Tilt your head
when you look at these photos.  Flickr has switched
photo editing software
and there is no longer a straightening tool!  Argh!!  The only time I haven't had to straighten my photos was at the
leaning tower of Pisa .  With those photos I figured the tilt-ier the better.  Needless to say, that tool is essential to my photo editing process.  From what I've read a straightening tool is in the works.  Hope it is implemented soon.
Anyhoo, the real topic of this post is not my cockeyed view of the world but my blank dining room wall.  I taped up some paper the same size as the
IKEA frames
I purchased and taped my inkblots onto them.  This was AFTER I panicked and decided the original ink blots were too small, faint and yellowed to work well in the dining room.  During the panic I quickly cut white squares of fabric and, with black watered down acrylic paint, attempted to make my own ink blots.  Then I compared my inkblots to the originals and hated them and realized I'd just wasted 1.5 hours of my time.  Typical Katy.  Must make things so much more complicated than they are.
I taped up the originals (seen below) and decided they were great.  The antiquing worked really well with our creamy curtains and trim paint.  They were small and looked almost elegant.
I also taped up some that I made - I actually liked 2 of my inkblots (the top 2.)  However, they looked too contrived. Too contrast-y and too obvious. I like some of them but not for the walls.  Pillows?  Who knows.
Making the inkblots was kinda fun.  I was guided by this
tutorial.
I threw in some metallic gold paint for fun.
I know it is hard to tell from the photos, but what set of inkblots do you like?  If you could see the curtains I know you'd like the originals.
Well, maybe you would. Now to get mats cut.
Think I'll go for a soft white to ease the contrast between the art and frame.
I'll share the wall when it is finished.

Ink Blots
Source:

Pinterest
I've been drawn to ink blots for over a year now.  They appeal to the psychology major in me as well as to the abstract art enthusiast.  I bought a set of original Rorschach ink blots from 1948 off of ebay.  This was over a year ago.  I have yet to get them framed and up on the wall.  I thought, as well as looking great, they'd be a good conversation piece.
I'm going to frame 6 of them; the black and white cards and 2 of the colored ones.  Not sure about frame color - black or white.  White may be tricky as the cards have yellowed slightly due to age.  Sounds like a trip to IKEA is in my future.  I'll likely buy both black and white frames and return what I don't use.
I've been seeing ink blot inspired items here and there.  Here are a few I've pinned.

The Weekend in Review
We got so lucky here in Seattle this Easter.
We had sun!
Easter is notoriously rainy here, almost like a given.
This made our egg hunt all the much better.
Afterwards we enjoyed our cake out on the front porch and soaked up as much vitamin D as humanly possible.
Before Sunday the girls dyed eggs.
We tried using
stickers on our eggs
before dying.
It didn't really work that well.
The stickers didn't peel off all the way and left a fuzzy, sticky mark.
I don't think the girls minded though.
I made an Easter cake and had the ridiculous idea of making a bunny to peek out of the bundt cake hole.
Using Twinkies and candy melts proved to be quite challenging.
The ears were formed with wafer cookies.
In hindsight what I should have done was buy a cute chocolate bunny from the drug store.
Would have saved A LOT of time and
A Lot of mess .  Oh well, it turned out cute.
On Sunday we had cousins big and small come over.  We enjoyed an early dinner and then sent the kiddos out to hunt for eggs.  It was an enjoyable day!  How was yours?

A variation
This year I attempted to make my
nest cookies
look more nest-y.  Mission accomplished, I do believe.  I used crunchy chow mein noodles for some and toasted coconut for the rest.  The chow mein noodles were a pain to "glue" on (I mixed powdered sugar and milk to make a glue.) They were pretty much assembled one noodle at a time.  I did it in front of the TV.  Bryce and I are back to Breaking Bad again.  That Walt, can't seem to stay out of trouble. The girls glued the eggs in the next day.
Anyhoo, the toasted coconut was much faster, better tasting and easier to eat.  The girls prefer the chow mein noodles.  For the eggs I used M&M chocolate candy eggs.  I wish they were smaller.
We're taking these to a flashlight egg hunt tonight.  Doesn't that sound fun?  This is the first time I've heard of such a thing.  I think the girls will love it!
Here are the directions to make these more nest-y cookies -
1) Bake a batch of
Thumbprint Cookies .  These are the same ones
I make every Christmas ; minus the chocolate filling, of course.
2) Stir together about 1/2 cup powdered sugar with a teaspoon milk.  Add 1 drop at a time until a glue like consistency is reached.
3) Frost the out side of the cookies with your "glue."
4) Quickly place chow mein noodles or toasted coconut on the "glue."
5) Spoon a little "glue" in the nest and place mini eggs, jelly beans or the like.
6) Let harden in the air then place in a container.
Hope you have a Happy Easter!

Finger Licking Good
Whoever said ambrosia is the food of the Gods had obviously never tried almond butter.  I think it may be the perfect food.  I'm serious.  Have you tried it?
In my attempt to eat more protein nut butters kept being suggested.  I love peanut butter so I felt no real need to try any other nut butter varieties.  I'm not sure what made me purchase my first jar of almond but, let me tell you, I haven't looked back since.  I mostly eat it with sliced apples or pears.  This is often times my breakfast or snack, if I'm especially hungry.  I halfheartedly try to keep myself to the serving size suggested on the label but after a generous dollop has been placed in my bowl and my fingers and spoon have been sufficiently licked, well,  it may creep up to be a wee more than a serving.  My apple of choice is Honey Crisp but they are ridiculously expensive right now so I usually eat Pink Ladies.   Since I've discovered this stuff I've never eaten so many apples in my whole life.
I've recently switched from the
Kettle
brand to the Trader Joe's variety.  TJ's adds flax seeds into the mix.  It doesn't change the taste but does give a nice crunch.  The main reason I've switched is cost.
If you're an almond butter eater tell me how you like it.
I'm also wondering if anyone has a good method for stirring the oil and nut paste together.   I don't like this part of the process.  I've found a butter knife works best for stirring.  Other than the bits of almond skin that get stuck in my teeth, this is my only complaint.

Let the Pinning Begin!
After hearing people talk about
Pinterest
for months and months I finally gave it a real go.  I can see why it is described as addicting.  It is like surfing thousands of blogs all at one time. Talk about information overload!
Question - Why do I see pins from people I'm not following?
Anyone?
I can tell with Pinterest that one of the keys for me is to make sure I don't spend all my time pinning and forget the actual doing part.  It is a slippery slope.
Last night I geeked out on throw pillows for the living room.  Now to chose one or two.

And, as my sister pointed out, I've accumulated quite a few quinoa pins.  Protein, protein, protein.
