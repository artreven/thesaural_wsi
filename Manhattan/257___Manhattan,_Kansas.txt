Sabine's gull,
Xema sabini
(formerly,
Xema sabinii ; synonym and protonym,
Larus sabini ), also known as the fork-tailed gull, photographed in a feedlot pond north of
Manhattan
(Riley County), Kansas (USA). NOTE: this image has been altered. It has been cropped from the original so it has the correct dimensions for display on mobile media -- although I've been informed that these images don't (yet) show up on android phones.

Question:
This North American mystery bird has mystified both ornithologists as well as bird watchers for a number of reasons. What makes this small bird so mysterious to so many experts? Can you name this bird's taxonomic family and the species?
Response:
This is an immature Sabine's gull,
Xema sabini , a small gull that nests on low marshy areas of the Arctic tundra, primarily near the coast. They winter on tropical oceans in the southern hemisphere several miles offshore, where they are attracted to upwellings of cold nutrient-rich marine water filled with small crustaceans, mollusks, small fish, and marine worms that these birds feed on. The Sabine's gull's feeding behaviours closely resemble terns; unlike most gull species, Sabine's gulls feed on surface of the water, typically whilst flying.
Sabine's gulls usually migrate at sea or along the coasts and can be seen on pelagic birding trips off the west coast of the USA. A few birds migrate directly over North America and immature birds sometimes pop up in the midwestern USA, as this bird has done.
This lovely species is a "two year gull", meaning that it takes two years before a young bird attains adult plumage. Nevertheless, this species is a striking gull in all plumages with its bold upper wing pattern, long pointed wings, notched tail, and short black bill with a yellow tip. Yearling Sabine's gulls rarely attempt to breed and do not return to the breeding grounds but their summer home is still unknown.
Even though this species is clearly a member of the Laridae (gulls) family, the generic placement of Sabine's gull is controversial: some authorities place it in the monotypic genus
Xema
whilst others retain it in the genus
Larus . Based on its notched tail and black bill, it was once thought to be a sister species to the swallow-tailed gull,
Creagrus furcatus , which shares these two characters. However, mitochondrial DNA studies indicate this is in error. Instead, the ivory gull,
Pagophila eburnea , another Arctic species may instead be the closest relative to Sabine's gull, although the DNA indicate that these two species diverged around 2 million years ago -- a very long time ago [doi: 10.1046/j.1420-9101.2000.00135.x ].
There are five species of "hooded" gulls in North America. The Sabine's gull can be distinguished from them based on these characters:
the wing pattern is diagnostic of the species, with a bold black triangle on the outer primaries, and strong white triangle on the trailing edge of the wings, giving the bird a distinctive "M" pattern across its wings when in flight. The black primaries also have bold white spots near the tips that are easily visible when the bird is resting. Immature birds show the same pattern but in black, white and brown rather than the adult's black, white and grey (and their white primary spots are not as visible).
the forked tail tipped in black is also unique among North American gulls and is diagnostic of this species, regardless of age.
the bill is small and black with a yellow tip -- diagnostic for this species in all but first-year birds. In the above photo, the bird's bill is all black, indicating this is a first-year bird.
in breeding adults, the dark gray hood edged with a black neck band is also distinctive. Juveniles and non-breeding adults lack this hood, but have a mostly white face with smoky-gray on the back of head.
legs are pale pink in juveniles, dark (blackish) for adults.
