Fort Riley
is a
United States Army
installation
located in Northeast
Kansas , on the
Kansas River , between
Junction City
and
Manhattan . The Fort Riley Military Reservation covers 100,656 acres
(407 km˛) in
Geary
and
Riley
counties and includes two
census-designated places :
Fort Riley North
and
Fort Riley-Camp Whiteside .
The site of Fort Riley was chosen by surveyors in the fall of 1852 and was first
called Camp Center, due to its proximity to the geographical center of the
United States. The following spring, three companies of the 6th infantry began
the construction of temporary quarters at the camp. On June 27, 1853, the camp's
name was changed to Fort Riley in honor of Major General Bennett C. Riley, who
had led the first military escort along the
Santa Fe Trail
and had died earlier in the month.
The fort's initial purpose was to protect the many pioneers and traders who were
moving along the
Oregon-California
and
Santa Fe Trails .
Many of the buildings at the fort were built with the native
limestone of the area, several of which continue to stand today. By 1855, the
post was well-established and as more and more people moved westward, additional
quarters, stables and administrative buildings were authorized to be built. In
the July, 56 mule teams arrived at the fort, loaded with materials and soldiers
to expand the fort.
At Fort Riley
