Gantry Plaza State Park
is a state park on the East River in the Hunters Point section of
Long Island City , in the
New York City
borough of
Queens .
The 10acre park first opened in May 1998 and was expanded in July 2009. The southern portion of the park is a former dock facility and includes restored "contained apron" transfer bridges of the James B. French patent, and built in 1925, to load and unload rail car floats that served industries on
Long Island
via the Long Island Rail Road tracks that used to run along 48th Avenue (now part of
Hunter's Point Park ). The northern portion of Gantry Plaza State Park was a former Pepsi bottling plant.
To one side of the Gantries, is a Combined Sewer Overflow warning sign (Wet Weather Discharge Point) alerting the public to avoid swimming, boating or fishing during wet weather as raw, untreated sewage is routinely discharged from the pipes beneath the walkway.
The park offers picnic tables, a playground, a fishing and crabbing pier limited only to pier #4 and subject to NYS DEC rules, playing fields, and a waterfront promenade with a view of
United Nations Headquarters
and the
midtown
Manhattan
skyline.
Constructed in 1936 by Artkraft Strauss, the 120ft long and 60ft high neon Pepsi-Cola sign was located on top of the bottling plant before it was preserved and moved into a permanent location within the park.
The park is being developed in stages by the Queens West Development Corporation. The original section of Gantry Plaza State Park was designed by Thomas Balsley with Lee Weintraub, both
New York City
landscape architects, and Richard Sullivan, an architect. Stage 2, the new six-acre section of the park, was designed by
New York City
landscape architecture firm Abel Bainnson Butz and the first phase of Stage 2 opened to the public in July 2009. When complete, the Gantry Plaza State Park is expected to total 40acre in size.
In film
The film
Munich
took advantage of this view in its final scene, shot in 2005. The pier and the Pepsi-Cola sign to its north are visible in this scene.
The same location was used in
The Interpreter
(starring
Sean Penn
and
Nicole Kidman ). It is the final scene where Nicole's character says goodbye to Sean Penn's character, who is sitting on a fence by Gantry Park. The Pepsi-Cola sign at the former bottling plant is visible in the scene as well.
