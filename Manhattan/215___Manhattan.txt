Little Bohemia
is a borough of
Metropolis
separated from the city's main island by the
West River .
Known as the Arts Capital of Metropolis, the borough possesses many of the city's recreational locations like the
Queensland Boardwalk and Beach
and the
Metropolis Metrodome . It also hosts the campus of the
University of Metropolis
along its northern shoreline.

In-Game History Edit
A quiet district in comparison to the likes of the Tomorrow District and Downtown, Little Bohemia has non-the-less found itself being used as the beachhead for
Gorilla Grodd 's attempted invasion of Metropolis from the north while the
H.I.V.E.
has converted and bunkered itself within the
Metropolis Metrodome
to acquire and steal
Exobytes
for
Brainiac
Meanwhile,
Lex Luthor
has begun experimenting with the exobytes he has acquired, creating a specific hospital wing at the
Metropolis General Hospital
and employing
Doctor Psycho
to "observe" metahuman patients infected by Exobytes while testing his own Exobytes on the students of the
University of Metropolis , using the DNA of
Parasite
to turn them into "Parasite-like" monsters.
