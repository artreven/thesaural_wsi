Nonviolent resistance (or nonviolent action)
Nonviolent resistance
(or
nonviolent action ) is the practice of achieving goals through
symbolic
protests ,
civil disobedience , economic or political noncooperation, and other methods, without using
violence . It is largely synonymous with
civil resistance .
Each of these terms ("nonviolent resistance" and "civil resistance")
has its distinct merits and also slightly different connotations, which
are briefly explored in the entry on
civil resistance . The modern form of non-violent resistance was popularised and proven to be effective by the Indian leader
Mahatma Gandhi
in his efforts to gain independence from the British. [ citation needed ]
The
Salt March
on March 12, 1930
Nonviolent resistance advocates include
Leo Tolstoy ,
Mohandas Gandhi ,
Andrei Sakharov ,
Martin Luther King, Jr ,
Václav Havel ,
Gene Sharp , and
Lech Wałęsa . In 2006 peace ethologist
Judith Hand
presented a strategy for abolishing war premised on using nonviolent resistance ( A Future Without War: the Strategy of a Warfare Transition ).
From 1966 to 1999 nonviolent civic resistance has played a critical role in 50 of 67 transitions from
authoritarianism . [ 1 ]
Recently, nonviolent resistance has led to the
Rose Revolution
in
Georgia
and the
Orange Revolution
in
Ukraine . Current nonviolent resistance includes the
Jeans Revolution
in Belarus, the
"Jasmine" Revolution in Tunisia , and the fight of the
Cuban dissidents .

Many movements which promote philosophies of
nonviolence
or
pacifism
have pragmatically adopted the methods of nonviolent action as an effective way to achieve social or
political
goals. They employ nonviolent resistance tactics such as:
information warfare ,
picketing ,
vigils , leafletting,
samizdat ,
magnitizdat ,
satyagraha ,
protest art ,
protest music
and poetry, community education and
consciousness raising ,
lobbying ,
tax resistance ,
civil disobedience ,
boycotts
or
sanctions , legal/diplomatic wrestling,
sabotage ,
underground railroads , principled refusal of awards/honours, and
general strikes . Nonviolent action differs from pacifism by potentially being proactive and interventionist. History of nonviolent resistance

philosophical school disapproved of war. However, since they lived in a
time of warring polities, they cultivated the science of
fortification .

Judea
Pontius Pilate
Jews
demonstrated in
Caesarea
to try to convince
Pontius Pilate
not to set up
Roman
standards, with images of the
Roman emperor
and the eagle of
Jupiter , in
Jerusalem
(both images were considered
idolatrous
by religious Jews). Pilate surrounded the Jewish protesters with
soldiers and threatened them with death, to which they replied that they
were willing to die rather than see the
laws of the Torah
violated.

Chatham Islands ,
New Zealand
Moriori
The
Moriori
were a branch of the
New Zealand
Māori
that colonized the
Chatham Islands
and eventually became
hunter-gatherers . Their lack of resources and small population made
conventional war
unsustainable, so it became customary to resolve disputes nonviolently or
ritually .
Due to this tradition of nonviolence, the entire population of 2000
people was enslaved, killed or cannibalized when 900 Māori invaded the
island in 1835.

England
Peterloo massacre
Famine and chronic unemployment, coupled with the lack of
suffrage
in
northern England ,
led to a peaceful demonstration of 60,000–80,000 persons, including
women and children. The demonstration was organized and rehearsed, with a
"prohibition of all weapons of offence or defence" and exhortations to
come "armed with no other weapon but that of a self-approving
conscience".
Cavalry
charged into the crowd, with
sabres
drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 15 people were killed and 400–700 were injured. Newspapers expressed horror, and
Percy Shelley
glorified nonviolent resistance in the poem
The Masque of Anarchy . However, the
British government
cracked down on
reform , with the passing of what became known as the
Six Acts .
1834–38
Trinidad
End of Slavery in Trinidad
The
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , then the colonial power in Trinidad, first announced in 1833 the impending total
liberation of slaves
by 1840. In 1834 at an address by the Governor at Government House
about the new laws, an unarmed group of mainly elderly Negroes began
chanting: Pas de six ans. Point de six ans ("Not six years. No six
years"), drowning out the voice of the Governor. Peaceful protests
continued until the passing of a resolution to abolish apprenticeship
and the achievement of de facto freedom.

Cherokee removal
The
Cherokee
refused to recognize the fraudulent
Treaty of New Echota
and therefore did not sell their livestock or goods, and did not pack
anything to travel to the west before the soldiers came and forcibly
removed them. That ended tragically in the
Cherokee trail of tears .

New Zealand
Tainui-Waikato
Māori King
Tāwhiao
forbade
Waikato
Māori using violence in the face of British
colonisation ,
saying in 1881 "The killing of men must stop; the destruction of land
must stop. I shall bury my patu in the earth and it shall not rise again
... Waikato, lie down. Do not allow blood to flow from this time on."
This was inspirational to Waikato Māori who refused to fight in
World War I . In response, the
government
brought in
conscription
for the Tainui-Waikato people (other Māori
iwi
were exempt), but they continued to resist, the majority of conscripts
choosing to suffer harsh military punishments rather than join the army.
For the duration of the war, no Tainui soldiers were sent overseas.

Parihaka
The Māori village of
Parihaka
became the center of passive resistance campaigns against Europeans
occupying confiscated land in the area. More than 400 followers of the
prophet
Te Whiti o Rongomai
were arrested and jailed, most without trial. Sentences as long as 16
months were handed out for the acts of ploughing land and erecting
fences on their property. More than 2000 inhabitants remained seated
when 1600 armed soldiers raided and destroyed the village.

Los Angeles
Black Cat Protest(1), Homosexual Bar and Site of Civil Resistance to Heightened
Los Angeles Police Department
(LAPD) Raids against Homosexual Establishments throughout the City, especially in the Homosexual Quarter known as
Sunset Junction (2) District/ East Hollywood
An
Historic Cultural Monument ,
City of Los Angeles , recognized as a site of
Peaceful Civil Resistance
in the struggle for
Homosexual Civil Rights
in the
United States . The standoff is significant in that it occurred a year prior to the 1968
Stonewall Riots
in
New York . The
Stonewall Bar
in the
Greenwich Village
section of
Manhattan
was listed to the
National Register of Historic Places
in 2001.
A tense standoff and potential riot between Hundreds of LAPD Riot
Gear laden Police Officers, who were determined to quell the swelling
crowds that exceeded four hundred Homosexual citizens, was averted after
a last minute plea from then new Governor
Ronald Reagan ,
via an openly Gay Republican Judicial Appointee who acted as a personal
envoy of the Governor to LAPD Commanders at the site of the Standoff,
was accepted, and a stand down order given which ordered the Hundreds of
LAPD
Officers Present to Cease and Desist from further unprovoked harassment of Homosexuals in
Los Angeles
for decades. The plea was successfully communicated and accepted by the
LAPD hierarchy, and represented the first time that a stand down order
was given by the LAPD, and was the last time until 2001, that the
Los Angeles Police Department
would engage in raiding an establishment, or public assembly of
Homosexuals in America's 2nd largest City, for decades. The Hundreds who
gathered to peacefully protest unwarranted raids, often violent,
against Gay and Lesbian meeting sites in Los Angeles, observed a rare
experience of success in the struggle for
Homosexual
Civil Rights . Sadly,
Civil Rights
still not allowed under Federal and State Laws of the
United States
to this date.

Worldwide
Protests of 1968
The protests that raged throughout 1968 were for the most part
student-led. Worldwide, campuses became the front-line battle grounds
for social change. While
opposition to the Vietnam War
dominated the protests, students also protested for civil liberties, against
racism , for
feminism , and the beginnings of the
Ecology movement
can be traced to the protests against nuclear and
biological weapons
during this year.

Soviet occupation of the Baltic States , as local rock musicians played. In later years, people acted as
human shields
to protect radio and TV stations from the
Soviet
tanks, eventually regaining
Lithuania's, Latvia's, and Estonia's independence
without any bloodshed.

existed as such from 1998 until 2003 in Serbia (then a federal unit
within FR Yugoslavia), employing nonviolent struggle against the regime
of
Slobodan Milošević
as their course of action. In the course of two-year nonviolent
struggle against Milosevic, Otpor spread across Serbia and attracted
more than 70,000 supporters. They were credited for their role in the
successful overthrow of Slobodan Milošević on 5 October 2000.

Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004
Protesters opposing
Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004
nonviolently resisted impending evacuations of
Jewish settlements
in the
Gaza Strip
and the
West Bank . Protesters blocked several traffic intersections, resulting in massive gridlock and delays throughout
Israel . While
Israeli police
had received advance notice of the action, opening traffic
intersections proved extremely difficult. Eventually, over 400
demonstrators were arrested, including many juveniles. Further large
demonstrations planned to commence when Israeli authorities, preparing
for disengagement, cut off access to the Gaza Strip. During the
confrontation, mass civil disobedience failed to emerge in Israel
proper. However, some settlers and their supporters resisted evacuation
non-violently.
2004–2005

2011 Syrian uprising
started on March 15, 2011 as a collaborative effort between online
websites such as Liberty For The People of Syria {الحرية لشعب سوريا},
The Syrian Revolution 2011, The Syrian Days of Rage {يوم الغضب السوري},
and some other media websites that facilitated the coordination and
communication of Syrians on the grounds who were deprived from any local
organizing bodies due to the country's 48-year old state of emergency
that was instated in 1963 upon the takeover of power by Al-Ba'ath Arab
Socialist Party and that was later taken over by the Assad regime in
November 16, 1970. Since then, Syrians have experienced minimal
political life and virtually no exercise of freedom of expression until
the Syrian revolution erupted, launching the most significant
coordinated campaign of civil disobedience and peaceful protests in
various Syrian cities. The response by the regime was and continue to be
very brutal and has caused the death of hundreds of Syrian citizens and
more than a thousand wounded in addition to thousands of people
arbitrarily detained in a government campaign to quell the rebellion but
it is only growing stronger by the day. The future of the Syrian
revolution remains uncertain but one thing that has been certain thus
far is its civil nature despite the elaborate media campaign by the
ruling Assad regime to defame and attack the rebellion.
