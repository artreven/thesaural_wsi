Alma Thomas
1891-1978 Born in Columbus, Georgia, Thomas was the eldest of four daughters. When she was fifteen, her family moved to Washington, D.C. In 1925 she began a thirty-five-year career teaching art at Shaw Junior High in Washington. So great was Thomas’ sense of professional dedication that she devoted most of her energy to her students; her painting career was effectively put on hold until the 1960s. In the exhibitions of those years, Thomas drew upon all her sensory, childhood memories of rich vegetation, her own garden, the formal plantings of the capital city, and the musical sounds of nature to develop a painting style that gained her mainstream attention.
In
Red Rose Cantata,
Alma Thomas set up a lyrical repetition of color and shape through a series of vertical splashes of red punctuated by white intervals. The rhythmic arrangement of brushstrokes suggests musical intervals, and Thomas confirms that in the title. A cantata is a musical composition for one or more voices sung to an instrumental accompaniment. The dynamic harmony and excitement of both nature and music are combined in this piece.

Symbolist poetry ,
mythology , history and medical texts, particularly
Gray’s Anatomy [ 1 ]
At an early age, Basquiat displayed an aptitude for art and was encouraged by his mother to draw, paint, and to participate in other art-related activities. In 1977, when he was 17, Basquiat and his friend Al Diaz started spray-painting
graffiti
art on slum buildings in lower

Watts: The Hub of the Universe Art and Social Change
The Haggerty Exhibition
The Haggerty
dedicated to the art and artist that emerged during and after the Watts Riots in California, it is sometime called
“The art of social change.”
Website Link
Philosophy of Community Arts
Curtis L. Carter
“In contrast to the aims of the American Negro Academy, the African American artists in exile, and the Harlem Renaissance respectively, the arts projects in Watts were primarily directed toward social change and community development through the arts.
Two principal objectives underlie these programs: to develop opportunities for the artists and to use art to make a difference in the lives of community residents.
As artist John Outterbridge has observed, “The period of the sixties was one of enhanced vision of how art and culture could effectively participate to help build a community, break existing moulds and create an interest in social change.
At the time, it was an unconventional way to use the arts.
Artists were challenged to think among themselves in new ways.
The artists working in the Watts community were not influenced by social activists whose methods involved violence and social disruption.”
In this context artists assumed roles intended to make a difference in the environment. ……….”
The visual artists and writers represented in the Haggerty exhibition — Noah Purifoy, John Outterbridge, Charles Dickson, Dale Davis, Jayne Cortez, Elliott Pinkney, Eric Priestley, and Johnie Scott
all participated in community-based arts organizations in Watts during the period from 1965 to the present. Their work drew support from a wide range of sponsorship: churches, civic groups, sororities and fraternities, libraries, and city and federally sponsored projects.

Noah Purifoy
– From his days as an art student at Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles (1951-54), Noah Purifoy resisted the traditional approach to art based on drawing and painting.
Instead he chose to “find his own way,” inspired in part by the Dada artist Marcel Duchamp, who challenged the boundaries of art and explored the connections between every day objects and art. The Brockman Gallery director Dale Davis remembers Purifoy as an artist who challenged the community with his art. “He was controversial, not well understood but interesting to those who gathered around the Brockman Gallery.” Purifoyís background as a social worker made him conscious of the needs of at risk members of society, and he determined to use his art to advance social change…..

John Outterbridge
– After a tour of U.S. military duty in Europe, John Outterbridge studied at the American Academy of Art in Chicago from 1956 to 1959 and arrived in California in 1963, just before the Watts rebellion.
His stature as an artist of national standing is paralleled by a distinguished career as the director of two important community arts centers in Watts and Compton, California and as an active member of the Los Angeles arts community. 36
Like Purifoy, Outterbridge appropriated his themes and materials from discarded objects, trash, junk, and objects he found.
The theme of discarded materials was used to symbolize the plight of persons living in a damaged environment where they felt as if they were treated as discarded human beings.
The use of available materials was also a matter of necessity as well as choice for Purifoy and Outterbridge, as the artists could not afford conventional art materials.
Both artists would agree that their work as artists was tempered by a need to satisfy the social demands of their work in community arts. Purifoy once remarked to Outterbridge, “This work we do has more to do with creating tools for social change than it has to do with making art.”……… More

Charles Dickson studied at Studio Watts Workshop and also taught at the Compton Art Center and the Watts Towers Arts Center with John Outterbridge.
Similar to the previous artists, he has been active in the Watts community arts and professionally in galleries throughout Los Angeles and elsewhere.
His work includes public sculpture as well as gallery pieces.
Dickson’s sculpture draws upon African tribal cultures and the African-American experience. His work also reflects an interest in science and technology.
Like Purifoy and Outterbridge, Dickson’s sculpture includes assemblage and is constructed of carved wood, as well as discarded materials. However, he also works in bronze, as is evident from a recent commissioned bust of the former United Nations Secretary General Ralph Bunche.
The titles of his pieces in the Haggerty exhibition:
I Feel the Spirit , and
Spirit Dance , (both from 1988), and
Bongo Congo:
Mobilization of the Spirit , (1989) all reflect their connections to African culture…….. More
