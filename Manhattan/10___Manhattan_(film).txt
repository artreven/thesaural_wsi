for the love of August

Tweet August in Paris. It’s the time of year that those who live in this vibrant city come to love, or more commonly, leave. If you are one of the lucky few to experience this annual (and literal) ‘closing shop’ of Paris, give in to the stillness and enjoy. How exactly? Here are a few ideas.
1. Travel by bike.
Velibing
is one of my favorite modes of transport along Paris’ winding paths. With fewer cars on the roads, have no fear!
2. Now is the perfect time to indulge in a fine dining experience. (Given that your restaurant of choice is open). Here’s a
reputable list
to try.
3. The famous
Paris Plage . (Who needs St Tropez?) Worth at least a stop for a game of
Pétanque .
4. If you crave some quality alone time, visit the
hidden gardens
scattered all around Paris. An ideal place to escape with a good book.
5. August is a perfect time to play the role of tourist, regardless if you live in Paris or not. Hop on the
batobus
and let the fun begin! You can
almost
see
Paris in a day .
6. Fancy an art fix? You’re in the right city, with over 140 museums. Here’s a
list by arrondissement . To avoid long lines, the
museum pass
is not a bad idea.
7. Have you been craving to explore another neighborhood? Now is the time. (I recommend ‘ Little Africa ‘ in the 18eme.)
8. For those faced with the challenge of learning French, the city is your school. Particularly in August. Find an open cafe, sit at the bar and the lessons begin!
9. To escape those seldom hot but often overcast nights, the cinema, particularly in mid-August is filled with many a ‘must-see’. If weather permits, the
Open Air Cinema
at Parc de la Villette is even better. (I plan to be there on the 18th for Woody Allen’s
Manhattan .)
10. If you have done all of the above and still crave a little adventure, the
TGV trains
will not disappoint. For a scenic getaway, take a trip to
Honfleur
or even closer, the gardens of
Giverny . Let’s not forget wine tasting in the
Loire Valley
(my upcoming August adventure).
Am I missing anything?

I meant to tell you…my absolute favorite place in the Loire is Sancerre (and my fav wine). It is a gorgeous hilltop vineyard town…you would love it. The Loire will not disappoint, wherever you choose to go. Thank you for the secret garden list…love it!

I’m so excited to finally experience Paris in August! I’ve always been on the receiving end of this annual expunge from the City of Lights (ie the south of France).
This list looks great and I’m exciting to finally try Velib as well as try some of the restaurants on that amazing list! Thanks for the inspiration, Kasia!
