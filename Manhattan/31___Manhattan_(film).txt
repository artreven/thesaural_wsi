Goldie and stripes..
A few months ago I bought
this
bag from
EmersonMade . It's a reversible bag with a gold linen on one side and stripes on the other.. It goes with everything!
I love it!

270 DAYS
I have just found out that the next time I fall pregnant I will have to have a stitch put in my cervix to keep it closed and then be on full time bed rest for 9 months! That's 270 days, flat-on-my-back in bed!
HOley MOley! It would be okay if my bedroom looked like this.. (Image via

Two.
"How many children do you have?" Almost everyday I get asked this question and every time I pause for a long time before answering "Two. Sophie is my oldest and I had a little girl in January who was stillborn. Her name was Grace." I wish that I could answer differently, but I can't. I have two children. I have given birth twice. And as difficult as it is to tell someone that I had a stillborn baby within moments of meeting them, I can't answer any differently. 2.

Baked Camembert..
A few weeks ago I made
baked Camembert
as an entree before dinner.. It was one of those frosty winter nights and I baked it on top of the pot belly stove..
Served with olive bread and the quince paste that Tom made me for mothers day.. Absolutely delicious!

Wine and Horses
One of the nicest things about living in Perth is that every weekend we head up to Tom's mum's place in the Swan Valley, about 40 minutes drive from the city. A few years ago, Tom's mum
and step-dad bought half a vineyard and because Tom's little sister rides horses, they built a huge stable block and there are 12 horses on the property. They also built a little 2 bedroom cottage that overlooks the vines on one side and the horse stables on the other..
We usually head up every weekend and stay for a night or two. It's SO lovely.. Sophie wakes up early in the morning and hops in the tractor to feed all the horses with her Granny, then collects fresh eggs from the chickens for breakfast.
There are so many reasons why moving to Perth feels like the best decision we ever made.. and coming up here certainly is one of them!
