Biography
When Brooklyn-born Constance Ockleman was prodded
into a performing
career by her ambitious mother, she chose her stepfather's name, Keane,
for her
nom de stage . After a year of thankless bit parts, she
was dropped by RKO Radio Pictures. When she re-emerged at MGM in a small
role in the Eddie
Cantor vehicle Forty
Little Mothers (1940), she was known as Veronica Lake.
While posing
for publicity pictures, Lake inadvertently allowed her blonde hair to
obscure one eye, thereby creating her movie persona as "the girl with
the peek-a-boo bang." Signed by Paramount in 1941, Lake quickly ascended
to leading roles. Directors such as Preston
Sturges and René
Clair had the patience to draw genuine performances from her, but,
for the most part, she was cast on the basis of her beauty and
popularity, with acting hardly an afterthought. In This Gun
for Hire (1942), Lake was teamed with up-and-coming Alan Ladd,
thereby launching one of Paramount's most successful screen duos.
Eventually renegotiating her contact and finding brief domestic
happiness with her second husband, director André
De Toth, the actress
flourished professionally and financially
until 1948, when she was hit with the double whammy of being dropped by
Paramount and being sued for support payments by her mother. De
Toth wangled a good role for Lake in the 20th Century Fox film
Slattery's
Hurricane (1949), but it failed to rekindle her stardom. She left
Hollywood in the early '50s, making a living with stage appearances. But
increasing personal problems and a stage injury effectively ended her
career, and, by 1959, she was working as a Manhattan barmaid. Lake
staged a comeback as a Baltimore TV host in the early '60s, and, in 1966
and 1970, financed two cheap films for herself (Footsteps
in the Snow and Flesh Feast).
She wrote a tell-all autobiography in 1969 and sought stage work in
England. Lake returned to the U.S. in 1971; but after more personal
problems and failed comeback attempts, she died of hepatitis two years
later while visiting friends in Burlington, VT. ~ Hal Erickson, All

Veronica
Lake Wiki
Veronica Lake
(November 14, 1922 [ 1 ]
– July 7, 1973) was an American film actress and
pin-up model . [ 2 ]
She received both popular and critical acclaim, most notably for her
femme fatale
roles in
film noir
with
Alan Ladd
during the 1940s, and was well-known for her peek-a-boo hairstyle. Her
success did not last; she had a string of broken marriages and long
struggles with
mental illness
and
alcoholism
until she died of hepatitis. Early life and career
Lake was born as
Constance Frances Marie Ockelman
in
Brooklyn, New York . Her father, Harry E. Ockelman, of
Danish - Irish
descent, [ 3 ]
worked for an oil company aboard a ship. Her father died in an industrial explosion in
Philadelphia
in 1932 when she was ten. Her mother, née Constance Charlotta Trimble (1902–1992), [ 4 ]
(listed as "Veronica F." on the 1920 census), married family friend
Anthony Keane, a newspaper staff artist, a year later, and Lake began
using his last name. [ 5 ]
Lake was sent to
Villa Maria , an all-girls Catholic boarding school in
Montreal, Canada , from which she was expelled. The Keane family later moved to
Miami, Florida .
Lake attended high school in Miami, where she was known for her beauty.
She had a troubled childhood and was, according to her mother,
diagnosed as
schizophrenic . [ 6 ]
In 1938 Lake moved with her mother and stepfather to
Beverly Hills , where her mother enrolled her in the Bliss-Hayden School of Acting. Her first appearance on screen was for
RKO , playing a small role among several coeds in the 1939 film,
Sorority House . Similar roles followed, including
All Women Have Secrets
and
Dancing Co-Ed . During the making of
Sorority House
director
John Farrow
first noticed how her hair always covered her right eye, creating an
air of mystery about her and enhancing her natural beauty. She was then
introduced, while still a teenager, to the
Paramount
producer
Arthur Hornblow, Jr. . He changed her name to Veronica Lake because the surname suited her blue eyes.
Her contract was subsequently dropped by RKO. She married art director
John S. Detlie , 14 years her senior, in 1940. A small role in the comedy,
Forty Little Mothers , brought unexpected attention. In 1941 she was signed to a long-term contract with
Paramount Pictures . On August 21, 1941, she gave birth to her first child, Elaine Detlie.
[ edit ]
1940s icon
Her breakthrough film was
I Wanted Wings
in
1941 ,
a major hit in which Lake played the second female lead and was said to
have stolen scene after scene from the rest of the cast. This success
was followed by
Hold Back the Dawn
later that year. She had starring roles in more popular movies, including
Sullivan's Travels ,
This Gun for Hire ,
I Married a Witch ,
The Glass Key , and
So Proudly We Hail! . Looking back at her career years later, Lake remarked, "I never did
cheesecake ; I just used my hair."
[ 7 ]
For a short time during the early 1940s Lake was considered one of
the most reliable box office draws in Hollywood. She became known for
onscreen pairings with actor
Alan Ladd .
At first, the couple was teamed together merely out of physical
necessity: Ladd was just 5 feet 5 inches (1.65 m) tall and the only
actress then on the Paramount lot short enough to pair with him was
Lake, who stood just 4 feet 11½ inches (1.51 m). They made four films
together.
A stray lock of her shoulder-length blonde hair during a publicity
photo shoot led to her iconic "peekaboo" hairstyle, which was widely
imitated. During
World War II ,
she changed her trademark image to encourage women working in war
industry factories to adopt more practical, safer hairstyles. [ 8 ]
Although popular with the public, Lake had a complex personality and acquired a reputation for being difficult to work with.
Eddie Bracken , her co-star in
Star Spangled Rhythm
was quoted as saying, "She was known as 'The Bitch' and she deserved the title." [ 9 ]
In that movie, Lake took part in a song lampooning her hair style, "A Sweater, A Sarong and a Peekaboo Bang", performed with
Paulette Goddard
and
Dorothy Lamour . [ 10 ]
Joel McCrea , her co-star in
Sullivan's Travels , reputedly turned down the co-starring role in
I Married a Witch , saying, "Life's too short for two films with Veronica Lake."
[ 11 ]
Lake's career stumbled with her unsympathetic role as
Nazi
spy Dora Bruckman in
1944's
The Hour Before the Dawn .
During filming, she tripped on a lighting cable while pregnant and
began hemorrhaging. She recovered, but her second child, William, was
born prematurely on July 8, 1943, dying a week later from
uremic poisoning . [ 12 ]
By the end of 1943 her first marriage ended in divorce. Meanwhile, scathing reviews of
The Hour Before Dawn
included criticism of her unconvincing German accent.
Nonetheless, Lake was earning $4,500 per week under her contract with
Paramount. She had begun drinking more heavily during this period and
people began refusing to work with her. Paramount cast Lake in a string
of mostly forgotten films. A notable exception was
The Blue Dahlia
(1946), in which she again co-starred with Ladd. During filming, screenplay writer
Raymond Chandler
referred to her as "Moronica Lake". [ 13 ]
Paramount decided not to renew her contract in 1948.
She married film director
Andre De Toth
in 1944 and had a son, Andre Anthony Michael De Toth, known as Michael
De Toth (October 25, 1945 - February 24, 1991), and a daughter, Diana De
Toth (born October 16, 1948). Lake was sued by her mother for support
payments in 1948.
Lake earned her pilot's license in 1946 and was able to fly solo between Los Angeles and New York. [ 14 ]
[ edit ]
Later years
After a single film for
20th Century Fox ,
Slattery's Hurricane
(1949), her career collapsed. By the end of 1951 she had appeared in one last film ( Stronghold , which she later described as "a dog"), filed for bankruptcy, and divorced de Toth. The
IRS
seized the remainder of her assets for unpaid taxes. Lake turned to
television and stage work and in 1955 married songwriter Joseph A.
McCarthy.
After breaking her ankle in 1959, Lake was unable to continue working
as an actress. She and McCarthy divorced, after which she drifted
between cheap
hotels
in Brooklyn and New York City and was arrested several times for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. A
New York Post
reporter found her working as a barmaid at the all-women's Martha Washington Hotel in
Manhattan .
At first, Veronica claimed that she was a guest at the hotel and
covering for a friend. Soon afterward, she admitted that she was
employed at the bar. The reporter's widely distributed story led to some
television and stage appearances. In
1966 , she had a brief stint as a TV hostess in
Baltimore, Maryland , along with a largely ignored film role in
Footsteps in the Snow .
Her physical and mental health declined steadily. By the late 1960s Lake was in
Hollywood, Florida , apparently immobilized by
paranoia
(which included claims she was being stalked by the FBI). [ 15 ]
When
Veronica: The Autobiography of Veronica Lake
(Bantam, 1972) was published, she promoted the book with a memorable hour-long interview on
The Dick Cavett Show . With the proceeds, she co-produced and starred in her last film,
Flesh Feast
(1970), a very low budget horror movie with a Nazi-myth storyline. She then moved to the
UK ,
where she had a short-lived marriage with an "English sea captain",
Robert Carleton-Munro, before returning to the U.S. in 1973, having
filed for divorce. [ 16 ]
Lake was immediately hospitalized. Although she had made a cheerful
and positive impression on the nurses who cared for her, she was
apparently estranged from her three surviving children, particularly her
daughters. Elaine Detlie became known as Ani Sangge Lhamo after
becoming a member of the
Subud
faith in
New Zealand . [ 17 ]
Diana became a secretary for the US Embassy in Rome in the 1970s. [ 17 ]
Michael De Toth stayed with his mother on and off through the 1960s and
1970s. He married Edwina Mae Niecke. When Lake died he claimed her
body.
[ edit ]
Death
Lake died on July 7, 1973 of
hepatitis
and acute
renal failure
(complications of her alcoholism) in
Burlington, Vermont , where her death was certified by Dr. Wareen Beeken at the
Fletcher Allen Hospital
and where she was seen by many staff members during her nearly two week stay. [ 18 ]
A rumor persists that she died in Montreal and was smuggled across the border to Vermont. [ 19 ]
Her ashes were scattered off the coast of the Virgin Islands as she
had requested. In 2004 some of Lake's ashes were reportedly found in a
New York antique store. [ 20 ]
Her son Michael died on February 24, 1991, aged 45, in
Olympia, Washington .
Lake has a star on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame
at 6918 Hollywood Boulevard for her contributions to the motion picture industry.
[ edit ]
Quotes
"I wasn't a
sex symbol , I was a sex zombie." [ 21 ]
"You could put all the talent I had into your left eye and still not suffer from impaired vision." [ 22 ]
"I've reached a point in my life where it's the little things that
matter... I was always a rebel and probably could have got much further
had I changed my attitude. But when you think about it, I got pretty far
without changing attitudes. I'm happier with that." (1970)
