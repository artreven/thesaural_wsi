Plot
A young farm boy from
Oklahoma
named Claude Hooper Bukowski ( John Savage ) heads to
New York City
to enter the
Army
and serve in the
Vietnam War . In
Central Park , he meets a troupe of free-spirited hippies led by George Berger ( Treat Williams ), a young man who introduces him to debutante Sheila Franklin ( Beverly D’Angelo ) when they crash a dinner party at her home. Inevitably, Claude is sent off to
recruit training
in Nevada, but Berger and his band of merry pranksters including Woof Daschund ( Don Dacus ), LaFayette “Hud” Johnson ( Dorsey Wright ), and pregnant Jeannie Ryan ( Annie Golden ) follow him. Sheila flirts with an off-duty
Sergeant
in order to steal his uniform, which she gives to Berger. He uses it to extract Claude from the base for a last meeting with Sheila, taking his place, but while Claude is away, the unit flies out to
Vietnam , taking Berger with them. The film ends with the main cast singing at Berger’s grave, followed by scenes of a large anti-war protest outside the
White House
in Washington, DC.

Differences from original version
The plot is greatly changed in the film. In the musical, Claude is a member of a hippie “Tribe” sharing a New York apartment, leading a bohemian lifestyle, enjoying “free love” and rebelling against his parents and the draft; but he eventually goes to
Vietnam . In the film, Claude is rewritten as an innocent draftee from
Oklahoma , newly arrived in New York to join the military. In New York, he gets caught up with the group of hippies while awaiting being sent to Army training camp. They introduce him to their
psychedelically -inspired style of living, and eventually drive to Nevada to visit him at a training camp. In the musical, Sheila is also an outspoken feminist leader of the Tribe who loves Berger and also Claude. In the film, she is a high-society
debutante
who catches Claude’s eye. In the film, Berger is not only at the heart of the hippie Tribe but is assigned some of Claude’s conflict involving whether or not to obey the draft. A major plot change in the film involves a mistake that leads Berger to go to Vietnam in Claude’s place, where he is killed. The musical focuses on the U.S.
peace movement , as well as the love relationships among the Tribe members, while the film focuses on the carefree antics of the hippies. [ 1 ]
The film omits the songs “The Bed”, “Dead End”, “Oh Great God of Power”, “I Believe in Love”, “Going Down”, “Air”, “My Conviction”, “Abie Baby”, “Frank Mills”, and “What a Piece of Work is Man” from the musical. The latter five songs were originally recorded for the film, but were eventually cut, as they slowed the pace of the film. They can be found on the
motion picture soundtrack album , although they were omitted on the 1990 reissue. A few verses from the songs “Manchester, England” and a small portion of “Walking in Space” have been removed. While the songs “Don’t Put It Down” and “Somebody To Love” are not sung by characters in the movie, they are both used as background or instrumental music for scenes at the army base. A new song written by MacDermot for the film is “Somebody to Love”. There are several other differences from songs in the movie and as they appear on the soundtrack, mainly in omitted verses and different orchestrations. [ 2 ]
Many of the songs have been shortened, sped up, rearranged, or assigned to different characters to allow for the differences in plot.

Reaction
James Rado
and
Gerome Ragni , who wrote the
original musical , were unhappy with the film adaptation, saying it failed to capture the essence of
Hair
in that hippies were portrayed as “oddballs” and “some sort of aberration” without any connection to the
peace movement . [ 1 ]
They stated: “Any resemblance between the 1979 film and the original Biltmore version, other than some of the songs, the names of the characters, and a common title, eludes us.” [ 1 ]
In their view, the screen version of
Hair
has not yet been produced. [ 1 ]
Nevertheless, the film received generally favorable reviews from film critics at the time of its release. [ 3 ]
Writing in
The New York Times ,
Vincent Canby
called it “a rollicking musical memoir…. [Michael] Weller’s inventions make this
Hair
seem much funnier than I remember the show’s having been. They also provide time and space for the development of characters who, on the stage, had to express themselves almost entirely in song…. The entire cast is superb…. Mostly… the film is a delight.” [ 4 ]
Frank Rich
said the “if ever a project looked doomed, it was this one” (referring to the “largely plotless” and dated musical upon which it was based, Forman’s and
Tharp’s
lack of movie musical experience, the “largely unproven cast” and the film’s “grand budget”); in spite of these obstacles, “ Hair
succeeds at all levels—as lowdown fun, as affecting drama, as exhilarating spectacle and as provocative social observation. It achieves its goals by rigorously obeying the rules of classic American musical comedy: dialogue, plot, song and dance blend seamlessly to create a juggernaut of excitement. Though every cut and camera angle in
Hair
appears to have been carefully conceived, the total effect is spontaneous. Like the best movie musicals of the ’50s ( Singin’ in the Rain ) and the ’60s ( A Hard Day’s Night ),
Hair
leaps from one number to the next. Soon the audience is leaping too.” [ 5 ]
According to
Time Out , the film is a “smug, banal fairytale-with-a-message, redeemed only by the intermittently imaginative staging of the songs”; it “sound[s], and for the most part look[s], like a
National Lampoon
parody of some ghastly
Swinging Sixties
compendium.” [ 6 ]
The film was shown out of competition at the
1979 Cannes Film Festival . [ 7 ]
[ edit ]
Awards
At the
37th Golden Globe Awards , the film was nominated for a
Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy , and Williams was nominated for
New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture – Male . The film was also nominated for
Best Foreign Film
at the
1980 César Awards , losing to
Woody Allen ‘s
Manhattan .
Years later, Forman cited his loss of his
moral rights
to the film to the studio as eventually leading to his 1997 John Huston Award for Artists Rights [ 8 ]
from
the Film Foundation : [ 9 ]
What was behind that [award] was that one day I had in my contract that when the studio wants to sell
Hair
…to the network but they have to have my, you know, consent or how would they…what they do with it. But I didn’t have this, so what they did, they didn’t sell it to the network, the sold it to
syndicated television
where I didn’t have that right. What happened: the film played on 115 syndicated stations practically all over the United States, and it’s a musical. Out of 22 musical numbers, 11 musical numbers were cut out from the film, and yet it was still presented as a Milos Forman film,
Hair . It was totally incomprehensible, jibberish, butchered beyond belief…
