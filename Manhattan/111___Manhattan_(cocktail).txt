Champagne Julep
Champagne
Julep : Champagne, Sugar Cube, Fresh Mint
Action Shot! Just Look at that Stirrer, Stirring Things Up
The
Guide
says to put some mint and a sugar cube in a highball glass, "add 2 cubes of ice and slowly pour in champagne while stirring constantly".
But beware - the fizz can get out of control. That's the sugar, right? I think I remember hearing that the sugar is used to boost the bubbles, or extend the bubbles, or something something the bubbles. Whatever the case, I can attest that there will be a lot of bubbles.
Champagne, Sugar Cube, Fresh Mint, Ice
Once you're done stirring, you're left with a drink that tastes a lot like sweet champagne with a tiny scent of mint. I suppose that if you are completely opposed to bourbon based juleps (or brandy based - don't forget the
Brandy Smash ) you might give this cocktail a try. Otherwise? Not so much.
The recipe is online at
123recipes.com :
Champagne Julep
Ingredients
Chilled champagne
1 sugar cube
2 sprigs of fresh mint
Slices of fresh fruit (optional)
Directions
1. Put sugar cube and mint in a chilled highball glass or stemmed goblet.
2. Add 2 cubes of ice and slowly pour in champagne while stirring constantly.

Champagne Cooler
Champagne
Cooler : Brandy, Cointreau, Champagne, Fresh Mint Sprig
Do you feel that? That's autumn in the air. I'm not saying it's nippy out there, but it was decidedly less hot and less humid this morning.
Time to celebrate with a Champagne Cooler!
Brandy, Cointreau, Champagne, Fresh Mint
I was 99% certain that it was the brandy/champagne combination that created the 'headache in a glass' problem with the
Champagne Pick-Me-Up , but the Champagne Cooler puts both of them together along with some Cointreau and produces a tasty orange soda of a drink that won't get you down.
We've officially killed off the
'good mint'
in our garden (I know - how is that even possible?), but we still have the less minty 'bad mint'. It's minty enough to make itself known when you bury your nose right in the glass, and it really goes well with the orange.
Epicurious
has the recipe online:
Champagne Cooler
Ingredients:
Crushed ice
1 ounce brandy
1 ounce Cointreau
6 ounces chilled champagne
Mint sprigs
Preparation:
Half-fill a 12-ounce highball glass with crushed ice. Pour in the brandy and Cointreau and fill with champagne. Garnish with mint.
The
Guide
goes along with these proportions, and now that I think about it, the 'headache in a glass' issue may just possibly arise from using twice as much brandy in the Pick-Me-Up. I'm a fan of the generous pour, but - yes - a little moderation goes a long way with the Champagne Cooler.

Hurricane Photos in Place of a Cocktail
It's stormy out there! With Hurricane Irene just off the coast, I thought it would be a good day for a walk to the Battery.
And it was. It was the walk back that left me soaked to the skin.
Keeping an Eye on Hurricane Irene
I imagine that Charleston will survive this one without too much trouble, although it's good to see that some people are taking it very seriously.
Preparing for the Worst on Meeting Street
Irene definitely put a damper on my plans for the afternoon.
My friend Snappy was going to join me for a drink at the
Bar at Husk , and I was really looking forward to a
Copper Lantern . Oh, well. There's always next week!

Champagne Pick Me Up
Champagne
Pick Me Up : Champagne, Brandy, Orange Juice, Lemon Juice, Grenadine, Lemon Twist
Champagne, Brandy, Orange Juice, Lemon Juice, Grenadine, Lemon Twist
Our friend Fancy Pants stopped by last night for cocktails, and we decided to try out the Champagne Pick Me Up.
I love the photo - thanks, DP! Just like the picture of
Snappy and the Boomerang Cocktail , it makes me look like the most generous of hosts.
After picture time came the tasting, and wow! With two ounces of brandy joining the champagne in each glass, this is a booze addled slugger of a drink, a fortified citrus bomb hidden behind a swirl of tiny bubbles. Fancy Pants guessed that the name comes from the phone call you make after you've had one, and I think she's probably right. In any case, it hit all of my favorite notes. If it weren't for the headache I woke up with this morning, I think that this would qualify as a
Top Shelf
cocktail.
AllEasyRecipes
has the recipe
online :
1 ounce fresh orange juice
1/2 ounce fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon grenadine
2 ounces brandy
3 to 4 ice cubes
4 ounces cold champagne
An 8-ounce wine glass, chilled
1. Combine the orange and lemon juices, grenadine, brandy and ice cubes in a mixing glass.
2. Place a shaker on top of the mixing glass and, grasping them firmly together with both hands, shake vigorously.
3. Remove the shaker, place a strainer on top of the mixing glass, and pour into a large wine glass. If you've been in the market for an evening-appropriate extra-tart mimosa heavy on the brandy, this is the drink for you.

Road Trip: Vegas, Baby!
Our
friends Snappy and Grey invited us to join them at their place in Las
Vegas, and you know there's no way we're going to pass up an invitation
like that, so we headed out West for Happy Hour. Multiple happy hours, really, with
the occasional sad moment - as when Barry Manilow cancelled his show at
the last minute due to "unforeseen circumstances". Sometimes, when
disaster strikes, you seek out sweet solace in a
Lemon Drop Martini , or in a
Tahitian Pineapple
(they're serious about the pineapple at the
Grand Lux ), or - if you're Grey - in whiskey. Grey may have gotten the better end of that deal. Sometimes the stars align, and you go to a show that isn't cancelled at the last minute, and you celebrate seeing
Blue Man Group
by having blue (and red) cocktails at
AquaKnox Bar . And if I ever remember anything else about those drinks, I will be sure to let you know. One thing I do remember -
Noodle Asia
is the place to go to satisfy your late night Dan Dan cravings. We then headed off to San Diego for cocktails with DP's sister and brother-in-law. They are on a most excellent
Manhattan
kick these days, using
Bulleit bourbon
to make a great cocktail - smooth, and sweet, and smokey. So good! Loved the bourbon, which apparently is known for it's
high rye content
(Snappy, take note). Loved the bottle. Loved
Bencotto , too, where we had nicely bitter Pomegranate Negronis (Campari, Sweet Vermouth, Plymouth Gin, and Pomegranate liqueur) and refreshing Cynar Citrus Cocktails (Campari, Cynar, Orange Juice, Blood Orange), and citrus punched Blood Orange Sodas (Prosecco, Grand Marnier, Blood Orange). Absolutely delicious. Then it was back to Vegas for dinner at
Border Grill
to see if
Mary Sue Milliken's
food is as good as it looked on
Top Chef Masters
(answer: yes!) and to have a Fresh Black Cherry Mojito (Fresh Black Cherries, Cruzan Black Cherry Rum, Fresh Lime, Mint, Sparkling Soda). A sweet sticky cherry coke-esque concoction, and a nice way to wrap up our trip. Now we're back home and ready to take on the next drinks in the
Guide : the Champagne Normande (Champagne, Calvados, Sugar, Angostura Bitters, Lime Slice), the Champagne Julep (Champagne, Sugar, Fresh Mint), and the Champagne Cooler (Champagne, Brandy, Cointreau, Fresh Mint).
The festivities never end!

Champagne Cocktail
Champagne
Cocktail : Champagne, Sugar, Angostura Bitters Ready for the Bitters and the Bubbles Champagne cocktails! Celebratory, right? It seemed like a great way to start things off when our friends Norfolk and Gardner came over for dinner the other night. Champagne, Lump of Sugar, Angostura Bitters The
Guide
takes a minimalist approach with this one, with a recipe that calls for one lump of sugar and one dash of Angostura bitters in a glass filled with Champagne, and no garnish (every recipe you'll find online uses a lemon twist).
The Guide - it's all about the basics. I had a generous interpretation of "dash", and we ended up with cocktails that tasted more like carbonated Angostura than anyone would really want, but by continually topping off the glasses I managed to push the bitters to the background. It's a classic cocktail, but I'm beginning to think that the Champagne cocktails are like beer cocktails - not worth the trouble.

Casino Cocktail
Casino
Cocktail : Gin, Lemon Juice, Maraschino, Orange Bitters, Maraschino Cherry Gin, Lemon Juice, Maraschino, Orange Bitters, Maraschino Cherry Now that's a drink! It's a big ol' glass of gin, with a few smidges of this and that to elevate things and to convince you that you've had a cocktail.
Throw in a cherry to marinate in the liquor, and you're all set.
I loved it. Bartenderapp
has a recipe that is
almost
the same as that in the
Guide : Casino Cocktail Ingredients: 2 oz Gin 1/4 tsp Maraschino Liqueur 1/4 tsp Lemon Juice 2 dashes Orange Bitters 1 Cherry How-to: Shake all ingredients (except cherry) with ice and strain into a cocktail glass. Add the cherry on top and serve. The difference?
The Guide calls for three ounces of gin, not two. Loved it.

Casa Blanca Cocktail
Casa
Blanca : Light Rum, Cointreau, Lime Juice, Maraschino, Orange Slice Light Rum, Cointreau, Lime Juice, Maraschino, Orange Slice I like it! We have key limes in the house again, and they are tart...
Tart enough to attempt a coup by overpowering the drink, but the Cointreau and Maraschino valiantly fought the lime to a draw. The rum was a wash - it stayed in the background, and only made itself known when I got out of my chair. Typical. Cocktail Calories wants you to know that the Casa Blanca has 184 calories in all: Casa Blanca 2 oz light rum 1 1/2 tsp Cointreau 1 1/2 tsp lime juice 1 1/2 tsp Maraschino and I want you to know that it's totally worth it.

Caruso Cocktail
Caruso
Cocktail : Gin, Dry Vermouth, Green Crème de Menthe Gin, Dry Vermouth, Green Crème de Menthe That's a green drink! I don't think the photo does it justice. And, believe me, one sip and you'll wish it tasted like mouthwash. Bill Wilson over at
Cocktails at the Cove
posts the recipe from the Mr. Boston's Guide he's working through: Caruso Cocktail 1 1/2 oz Gin 1 oz Dry Vermouth 1/2 oz Creme de Menthe (Green) Stir with ice and strain into cocktail glass I haven't put Gin and Crème de Menthe together since making
Alexander's Sister
back in October, and the thing I've discovered? The combination really benefits from the addition of whipping cream. When you add Dry Vermouth instead (Noilly Prat, in our case), you end up with a concoction that's pretty heavy on the nasty. DP gamely claimed that it got better the more he drank, but I don't think he even convinced himself. Our new bottle of Green Crème de Menthe may linger for a long time in the liquor cabinet. When will we ever use it again?
Grasshoppers , I guess - but the 'G's are a long way from the 'C's in the Guide.

Carrol Cocktail
Carrol
Cocktail : Brandy, Sweet Vermouth, Maraschino Cherry or Cocktail Onion Brandy, Sweet Vermouth, Maraschino Cherry And just like that, the
Guide
redeems itself from the Caribbean Champagne fiasco.
Everyone on the internet (and I mean everyone) says that the Carrol Cocktail should have 1 1/2 ounces of brandy and 3/4 ounces of sweet vermouth. Not our old friend the Guide!
It keeps the proportions, but raises the ante by calling for 2 ounces of brandy and 1 ounce of sweet vermouth. And then the Guide decides to play a little mind game, and says that either a maraschino cherry or a cocktail onion may be used. I went with the cherry option (you can see them nestled in the bottom of the glasses in the photo above), but figured I give you an onion visual as well, since DP was in the process of chopping some up for dinner ( Rosebank Farms'
best!) The Carrol is just a
Brandy Vermouth
cocktail minus the bitters, so we decided to switch things up by using Noilly Prat Rouge for the vermouth in the glass on the left, and
Carpano Antica Formula
for the glass on the right. And the answer is? Carpano Antica for DP, Noilly Prat for me. I liked the straightforward spicy herb profile of the Noilly Prat, while DP thought the hint of Christmas pudding in the Carpano made it a winner. Well, "winner" might be a stretch. The Carrol wasn't undrinkable, but neither version will have us going back for seconds.

Charleston Photo in Place of a Cocktail
I'm feeling Tilt-Shifty... Photo in Place of a Cocktail -
St. Luke and St. Paul Although my
tilt-shift obsession
has mostly run its course, once in a while I just can't resist.
But! Bringing the focus back to cocktails, the drinks coming up in the
Guide
(after the Carrol, of course) include the Caruso (Gin, Dry Vermouth, Green Crème de Menthe), the Casa Blanca (Light Rum, Cointreau, Lime Juice, Maraschino, Orange Slice), and the Casino Cocktail (Gin, Lemon Juice, Maraschino, Orange Bitters, Maraschino Cherry).

Champagne Cobbler
Champagne
Cobbler : Lemon Juice, Curaçao, Orange Slice, Champagne, Ice Champagne,
Curaçao (White, Orange, and Blue),
Ice, Lemon Juice,
Orange Slice We had our friend Pearson over to dinner last night, and decided to skip ahead a few drinks in order to find something appropriate to wish her
bon voyage
as she heads off for England. Given her destination, it seems appropriate to note that
Arthur Price of England
has the same recipe as the
Guide : Champagne Cobbler 1/2 tsp lemon juice 1/2 tsp curaçao thin slice of orange chilled champagne Fill a large goblet half full of cracked ice. Add lemon juice, curaçao, and orange slice. Stir and fill glass with champagne or sparkling wine. Stir again gently. What type of curaçao? Nobody says! Thanks to the Guide we have three colors of curaçao sitting around the house, and I decided to use them all.
Half a teaspoon isn't much, but that's all it takes to produce the awesome little boozy snowcones you see in the picture above. Awesome in color and concept and general summer excellence, but the orange flavor from the curaçao never really materializes in the glass. Still, you just can't go wrong with champagne! I convinced myself that shades of ruby were shining through the orange curaçao, which means that we were able to lift our glasses of red, white and blue to toast Pearson as she heads off on her adventure.
Bon voyage , Pearson!

Caribbean Cocktail
Caribbean
Champagne : Light Rum, Banana Liqueur, Angostura or Orange Bitters, Chilled Champagne, Banana Slice Light Rum, Banana Liqueur, Orange Bitters, Chilled Champagne, Banana Slice It's true - the Caribbean Champagne sounds like it might not be the best idea in the world, and when you describe this cocktail to people you may get a skeptical response. Very skeptical, if you are our friend Pheidippides. We found her running on the beach at Kiawah this weekend, and when the conversation turned to cocktails remembered that she had joined us for a previous champagne concoction, the
Bombay Punch . Very skeptical, indeed. But go ahead, embrace the bizarre. When it came time to make this drink, I poured the champagne after getting a
Thai Chicken Pizza
(well, with tofu, not chicken - embrace the bizarre!) into the oven, while DP flipped through the vinyl and put on
UB40
before styling the champagne that I'd poured. The result? We took a sip and agreed: not banana-y enough! The Guide really let me down on this one.
I always rely on it for the most generous pours possible, but its Caribbean Champagne only requires 1/2 teaspoon each of Light Rum and Banana Liqueur.
Half a teaspoon!
Most recipes out there call for at least three times as much. It has to be a typo, and we doubled up on the alcohol after our initial taste. The revised recipe: Ingredients 1 tsp (or 1 tbsp if you like) Light Rum 1 tsp (or 1 tbsp if you like) Banana Liqueur 1 dash Orange Bitters (or Angostura, if you don't feel like searching endlessly for the Orange) 4 oz chilled Champagne (or whatever it takes to fill your glass) Slice of banana Directions Pour the rum and the banana liqueur and the bitters into a chilled champagne glass. Top off with champagne and stir. Carefully!
You'll get bubbles over everything if you don't watch out. Style attractively with a banana slice. Once you've finished your glass full of Caribbean Champagne, you can go ahead and finish the bottle of champagne any way you please.
DP pulled out the Cassis and we went for a
Kir Royale
(we're not in the 'K's yet, so we just winged it without a recipe...)
Not bad! One possible Caribbean Cocktail side effect? A lingering tropical feeling that will lead you to wander down to
White Point Gardens
at lunchtime. Sure, it's hot today, but I swear the breeze off the harbor felt cool under the shade of the live oaks. And there's an added bonus to trekking around Charleston at mid-day...
seeing what the tourists are up to. I think today's chutzpah prize has to go to the two who were pushing their bicycles into
St. Michael's . Charlestonians may be
polite , but there is a line in the sand, and you cross it when you try to use George Washington's pew as a bike rack.

Cara Sposa
Cara
Sposa : Tia Maria, Triple Sec, Cream Tia Maria, Triple Sec, Cream The Cara Sposa (from " Cara sposa, amante cara "? Sure, why not!) is a sweet coffee and cream dessert cocktail, with a back note of burnt orange to bring out the best from that dark, sugary Tia Maria. It's served over ice, making it Summer appropriate, and it's a glass of creamy comfort, making it appropriate for rainy nights when Summer thunderstorms roll across Charleston. The internet can't decide whether this drink should have a
little bit of cream with the liquor , or a
little bit of liquor with the cream , but the
Guide
says the heck with it and calls for lots of everything - as they do over on
123recipes.com : Ingredients 1 ounce Tia Maria or coffee brandy 1 ounce triple sec 1 ounce cream Directions
Sh ake ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled Old-Fashioned glass over ice cubes. It may not be Top Shelf, but yes - it is a good drink!
