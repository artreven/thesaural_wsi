Donald McNicol Sutherland ,
OC
(born 17 July 1935) is a
Canadian
character actor
with a film career spanning nearly 50 years. [1]
Some of Sutherland's more notable movie roles included offbeat
warriors in such war movies as
The Dirty Dozen ,
in 1967, and
MASH
and
Kelly's Heroes
in 1970, as well as in such popular films as
Klute ,
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
and
Ordinary People . He is the father of actor
Kiefer Sutherland . [2]
Early life
Sutherland was born in
Saint John, New Brunswick , the son of Dorothy Isobel ( née
McNichol; 1892–1956) and Frederick McLea Sutherland (1894–1983), who
worked in sales and ran the local gas, electricity, and bus company. [1] [3]
He spent most of his childhood in
Hampton, New Brunswick , along the
Kennebecasis River . His teenage years were spent in Nova Scotia.
He got his first
part time
job at age 14 as a news correspondent for
local radio
station CKBW in
Bridgewater, Nova Scotia . He then studied at
Victoria College ,
University of Toronto , where he met his first wife Lois Hardwick
(not the child star of the same name), and graduated with a
double major
in engineering and drama. He had at one point been a
member of the "UC Follies" comedy troupe in Toronto. He changed his
mind about becoming an engineer, and subsequently left Canada for
England
to study at the
London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art .
HIDE TEXT
Early work
In the early to mid-1960s,
Sutherland began to get small parts in
British
films and TV, landing notable roles in horror
films
with
Christopher Lee , such as
Castle of the Living Dead
(1964)
and
Dr. Terror's House of Horrors
(1965) and twice appearing in
The Saint , firstly in the 1965 episode "The Happy Suicide" [4]
and then, more auspiciously, in a story called "Escape Route" at the
end of 1966. [5]
The episode was directed by the show's star,
Roger Moore , who later recalled that Sutherland "asked me if he
could show it to some producers as he was up for an important part...
they came to view a rough cut at the studio and he got
The Dirty Dozen . [6]
Thus, Sutherland was on course for the first of the three war films
which would be his initial great successes:
The Dirty Dozen
in
1967, with
Lee Marvin
and
Charles Bronson ; in 1970, as the lead
"Hawkeye" Pierce
in
Robert Altman 's
MASH ; and, again in 1970, as
tank commander
Sgt. Oddball
in
Kelly's Heroes , with
Clint Eastwood
and
Telly Savalas . During his time in England Sutherland also appeared
in
The Avengers
in 1967, in an episode titled "The Superlative
Seven."
Mid-career: 1972–2000
During the filming of the
Academy award -winning detective thriller
Klute , Sutherland had an
intimate relationship
with co-star
Jane Fonda . [7]
Sutherland and Fonda went on to co-produce and star together in the
anti-Vietnam war
film
F.T.A.
(1972), consisting of a series
of sketches performed outside army bases in the
Pacific Rim
and interviews with American troops who were then on
active service. A follow up to their teaming up in Klute, Sutherland
and Fonda performed together in "Steelyard Blues" (1972), a
"freewheeling, Age-of-Aquarius, romp-and-roll caper" from the writer
David S. Ward. Also starring in this film was the late Peter Boyle
(more recently known for his work in
Everybody Loves Raymond ).
Sutherland found himself in
demand as a
leading man
throughout the 1970s in films such as the
Venice -based
psychological horror
film
Don't Look Now
(1973), the
war film
The Eagle Has Landed
(1976), Federico Fellini's
Casanova
(1976) and the thriller
Eye of the Needle
(which was filmed on
location on the Isle of Mull, West Scotland) and as the
ever-optimistic
health inspector
in the
science fiction /horror film
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
(1978) alongside
Brooke Adams
and
Jeff Goldblum .
He helped launch the
internationally popular Canadian television series
Witness to Yesterday , with a performance as the Montreal
doctor
Norman Bethune , a physician and humanitarian, largely talking of
Bethune's experiences in revolutionary China. Sutherland refused a
script for this role, saying he knew Bethune's life so well they could
ask him anything—and the interviewer ended up with enough material for
two programs instead of the planned one.
Sutherland also had a small role
as pot-smoking Professor Dave Jennings in
National Lampoon's Animal House
in 1978, making himself known
to younger fans as a result of the movie's popularity. When cast, he
was offered either US$40,000 up front or a percentage of the movie.
Thinking the movie would certainly not be a big success, he chose the
40K upfront payment. The movie eventually grossed $141,600,000 (US).
He won acclaim for his
performance in the Italian director
Bernardo Bertolucci 's 1976 epic film
1900
and as the conflicted father in the
Academy award -winning family drama
Ordinary People
(1980) alongside
Mary Tyler Moore
and
Timothy Hutton . In 1981 he narrated
A War Story , an
Anne Wheeler
film. He played the part of physician-hero Norman
Bethune in two separate
biographical
films in 1977 and 1990.
A prolific actor, some of
Sutherland's better-known roles in the 1980s and 1990s were in the
South African
apartheid drama
A Dry White Season
(1989), alongside
Marlon Brando
and
Susan Sarandon ; as an incarcerated pyromaniac in the
firefighter
thriller
Backdraft
(1991), alongside
Kurt Russell
and
Robert De Niro ; and as the snobbish
NYC
art dealer
in
Six Degrees of Separation
(1993), with
Stockard Channing
and
Will Smith . In the 1991
Oliver Stone
film
JFK , Sutherland played a mysterious Washington
intelligence officer , reputed to have been
L. Fletcher Prouty , who spoke of links to the
military-industrial complex
in the assassination of U.S. President
John F. Kennedy. [8]
He played psychiatrist and visionary
Wilhelm Reich
in the video for
Kate Bush 's 1985 single, " Cloudbusting ".
In 1992, he played the part of
Merrick in the movie
Buffy the Vampire Slayer , with Kristy Swanson. He played a
software company's scheming CEO in
Barry Levinson 's 1994 drama
Disclosure
opposite
Michael Douglas
and in 1995 was cast as the antagonistic Maj. Gen.
Donald McClintock in
Wolfgang Petersen 's thriller
Outbreak , also featuring
Dustin Hoffman ,
Morgan Freeman , and
Rene Russo .
Sutherland was later cast in 1997
(for only the second time) with his son
Kiefer
in Joel Schumacher's award-winning crime thriller
A Time to Kill , based on the bestselling
book of the same name , written by
John Grisham . He played an aging yet ready-for-liftoff astronaut
in 2000's
Space Cowboys , co-starring with director
Clint Eastwood .

nomination in 2006 for his performance in the
miniseries

and narration during the intro of 1st semifinal of

" Tom "
Hanks
(born July 9, 1956) is an American actor,
producer, writer, and director. Hanks worked in television and
family-friendly comedies, gaining wide notice in 1988's
Big , before achieving success as a dramatic actor in several
notable roles, including Andrew Beckett in
Philadelphia , the title role in
Forrest Gump , Commander
James A. Lovell
in
Apollo 13 , Captain John H. Miller in
Saving Private Ryan , Joe Fox in
You've Got Mail , Chuck Noland in
Cast Away , and voicing the character
Woody
in the
Toy Story series . Hanks won consecutive
Best Actor Academy Awards , in 1993 for
Philadelphia
and in
1994 for
Forrest Gump . U.S. domestic box office totals for his
films exceed
$ 3.9 billion. [1]
He is the father of actor
Colin Hanks .
HIDE TEXT
Early life
Hanks was born in
Concord ,
California . His father, Amos Mefford Hanks (born in
Glenn County, California , on March 9, 1924 – died in
Alameda, California , on January 31, 1992), was a distant relative
of President
Abraham Lincoln , through Lincoln's mother,
Nancy Hanks . [2]
His mother, Janet Marylyn (née Frager; born in
Alameda County, California , on January 18, 1932), was a hospital
worker; she is of
Portuguese
ancestry. [3]
Hanks's parents divorced in 1960. The family's three oldest children,
Sandra (now Sandra Hanks Benoiton, a
writer ), Larry (now Lawrence M. Hanks,
Ph.D. , an
entomology
professor
at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ) [4]
and Tom, went with their father, while the youngest,
Jim , now an actor and film maker, remained with his mother in
Red Bluff, California . Afterwards, both parents remarried. Hanks's
first stepmother came to the marriage with five children of her own.
Hanks once told
Rolling Stone : "Everybody in my family likes each other. But
there were always about 50 people at the house. I didn't exactly feel
like an outsider, but I was sort of outside it." That marriage ended
in divorce after two years.
Amos Hanks became a single
parent, working long hours and often leaving the children to fend for
themselves, an exercise in self-reliance that served the siblings
well. In addition to having a family history of
Catholicism
and
Mormonism , Hanks was a "Bible-toting
evangelical
teenager" for several years. [5]
In school, Hanks was unpopular with students and teachers alike, later
telling
Rolling Stone
magazine: "I was a geek, a spaz. I was
horribly, painfully, terribly shy. At the same time, I was the guy
who'd yell out funny captions during filmstrips. But I didn't get into
trouble. I was always a real good kid and pretty responsible." In
1965, Amos Hanks married Frances Wong, a
San Francisco
native of
Chinese
descent. Frances had three children, two of whom lived
with Tom during his
high school
years. Tom acted in school plays, including
South Pacific , while attending
Skyline High School
in
Oakland, California .
Hanks studied theater at
Chabot College
in
Hayward, California , and after two years, transferred to
California State University, Sacramento . Hanks told
The New York Times : "Acting classes looked like the best place
for a guy who liked to make a lot of noise and be rather flamboyant. I
spent a lot of time going to plays. I wouldn't take dates with me. I'd
just drive to a theater, buy myself a ticket, sit in the seat, and
read the program, and then get into the play completely. I spent a lot
of time like that, seeing
Bertolt Brecht ,
Tennessee Williams ,
Henrik Ibsen , and all that, and now look at me, acting is my job.
I wouldn't have it any other way."
During his years studying
theater, Hanks met
Vincent Dowling , head of the
Great Lakes Theater Festival
in
Cleveland ,
Ohio . At Dowling's suggestion, Hanks became an intern at the
Festival. His internship stretched into a three-year experience that
covered most aspects of theater production, including lighting, set
design, and stage management, all of which caused Hanks to drop out of
college. During the same time, Hanks won the Cleveland Critics Circle
Award for Best Actor for his 1978 performance as
Proteus
in Shakespeare's
The Two Gentlemen of Verona , one of the few times he played a
villain. [6]
Career
Early career
In 1979, Hanks packed his bags
for
New York City , where he made his film debut in the low-budget
slasher film
He Knows You're Alone
and got a part in the television movie
Mazes and Monsters . Early in 1979, Hanks was cast in the lead
role of Callimaco in the
Riverside Shakespeare Company 's production of
Niccolò Machiavelli 's
The Mandrake , directed by Daniel Southern. This remains
Hanks's only New York stage performance to date; as a high profile
Off Off Broadway
showcase , the production helped Tom land an agent, Joe Ohla with
the J. Michael Bloom Agency. The next year Hanks landed a lead role on
the
ABC
television pilot of
Bosom Buddies , playing the role of Kip Wilson. Hanks moved to
Los Angeles , where he and
Peter Scolari
played a pair of young advertising men forced to
dress as women so they could live in an inexpensive all-female hotel.
Hanks had previously partnered with Scolari in the 1970s game show
Make Me Laugh .
Bosom Buddies
ran for two seasons, and,
although the ratings were never strong, television critics gave the
program high marks. "The first day I saw him on the set," co-producer
Ian Praiser told
Rolling Stone , "I thought, 'Too bad he won't be in television
for long.' I knew he'd be a movie star in two years." But if Praiser
knew it, he was not able to convince Hanks. "The television show had
come out of nowhere," best friend Tom Lizzio told
Rolling Stone .
"Then out of nowhere it got canceled. He figured he'd be back to
pulling ropes and hanging lights in a theater."
Bosom Buddies
and a guest appearance on a 1982 episode of
Happy Days
("A Case of Revenge," where he played a disgruntled
former classmate of
The Fonz ) prompted director
Ron Howard
to contact Hanks. Howard was working on
Splash
(1984), a romantic comedy fantasy about a
mermaid
who falls in love with a human. At first, Howard
considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking
brother, a role that eventually went to
John Candy . Instead, Hanks got the lead role and a career boost
from
Splash , which went on to become a box office hit, grossing
more than US$69 million. He also had a sizable hit with the sex comedy
Bachelor Party , also in 1984.
In 1983–84, Hanks made three
guest appearances on
Family Ties
as Elyse Keaton's alcoholic brother, Ned Donnelly. [7] [8]
Period of successes and
failures

after 61st
Academy Awards , March 29, 1989
Hanks and
Rita Wilson
at the 1989 Oscars
With
Nothing in Common
(1986) – about a young man alienated from
his parents who must re-establish a relationship with his father,
played by
Jackie Gleason  – Hanks began to establish the credentials of not
only a comic actor but of someone who could carry a serious role. "It
changed my desires about working in movies," Hanks told
Rolling
Stone . "Part of it was the nature of the material, what we were
trying to say. But besides that, it focused on people's relationships.
The story was about a guy and his father, unlike, say,
The Money Pit , where the story is really about a guy and his
house." [ citation

After a few more flops and a
moderate success with
Dragnet , Hanks succeeded with the film
Big
(1988), both at the box office and within the industry.
The film established Hanks as a major
Hollywood
talent. It was followed later that year by
Punchline , in which he and
Sally Field
co-star as struggling
stand-up comedians . Hanks's character, Steven Gold, a failing
medical student trying to break into stand-up, was somewhat edgy and
complex. Hanks' portrayal of Gold offered a glimpse of the far more
dramatic roles Hanks would master in films to come. Hanks then
suffered a pile of box-office failures:
The 'Burbs
(1989),
Joe Versus the Volcano
(1990), and
The Bonfire of the Vanities
(1990), as a greedy
Wall Street
type who gets enmeshed in a hit-and-run accident. Only
the 1989 movie
Turner & Hooch
brought success for Hanks during this time. In
a 1993 issue of
Disney Adventures , Hanks said, "I saw
Turner & Hooch
the other day in the SAC store and couldn't help but be reminiscent. I
cried like a baby." He did admit to making a couple of "bum tickers,"
however, and blamed his "...deductive reasoning and decision making
skills."
Progression into
dramatic roles
Hanks climbed back to the top
again with his portrayal of a washed-up
baseball
star turned manager in
A League of Their Own
(1992). Hanks admits that his acting in
earlier roles was not great and that he has improved. In an interview
with
Vanity Fair , Hanks noted his
"modern era of moviemaking ...
because enough self-discovery has gone on.... My work has become less
pretentiously fake and over the top" . This "modern era" began in
1993 for Hanks, first with
Sleepless in Seattle
and then with
Philadelphia . The former was a blockbuster success about a
widower who finds true love over the airwaves. Richard Schickel of
Time
called his performance "charming," and most critics
agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier
romantic-comedy stars of his generation. [ citation

In
Philadelphia , he played
a
gay
lawyer with
AIDS
who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost thirty-five
pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In
a review for
People , Leah Rozen stated "Above all, credit for
Philadelphia' s success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he
plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a
deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar."
Hanks won the 1993
Academy Award
for Best Actor for his role in
Philadelphia .
During his acceptance speech he revealed that his high school drama
teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two
people with whom he was close, were gay. [9]
The revelation inspired the 1997 film
In & Out , starring
Kevin Kline
as an English Literature teacher who is outed by a
former student in a similar way. [ citation

Hanks on the film set of
Forrest Gump
in 1994
Hanks followed
Philadelphia
with the 1994 summer hit
Forrest Gump . Of the film, Hanks has remarked: "When I read
the script for
Gump , I saw it as one of those kind of grand,
hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for
their lot and their position in life... I got that from the movies a
hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do." Hanks won his
second Best Actor
Academy Award
for his role in
Forrest Gump , becoming only
the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive
Best Actor Oscars. ( Spencer
Tracy
was the first, winning in 1937–38. Hanks and Tracy were the
same age at the time they received their Academy Awards: 37 for the
first and 38 for the second.)
Hanks' next role—astronaut and
commander
Jim Lovell , in the 1995 movie
Apollo 13 --reunited him with
Ron Howard . Critics generally applauded the film and the
performances of the entire cast, which included actors
Kevin Bacon ,
Bill Paxton ,
Gary Sinise ,
Ed Harris , and
Kathleen Quinlan . The movie also earned nine Academy Award
nominations, winning two. The same year, Hanks starred in the animated
blockbuster
Toy Story
as the voice of the toy
Sheriff Woody .
1996 - present:
Directing, producing and acting
Hanks turned to directing with
his 1996 film
That Thing You Do!
about a 1960s pop group, also playing the
role of a
music producer . Hanks and producer Gary Goetzman went on to create
Playtone , a record and film production company named for the
record company in the film.
Hanks executive produced,
co-wrote, and co-directed the
HBO
docudrama
From the Earth to the Moon . The twelve-part series chronicles
the space program from its inception, through the familiar flights of
Neil Armstrong
and
Jim Lovell , to the personal feelings surrounding the reality of
moon landings. The
Emmy Award -winning project was, at US$68 million, one of the most
expensive ventures taken for television.
Hanks's next project was no less
expensive. For
Saving Private Ryan
he teamed up with
Steven Spielberg
to make a film about a search through war-torn
France
after
D-Day
to bring back a soldier who has a ticket home. It earned the
praise and respect of the film community, critics, and the general
public. It was labeled one of the finest war films ever made and
earned Spielberg his second
Academy Award
for direction, and Hanks another Best Actor
nomination. Later in 1998, Hanks re-teamed with his
Sleepless in
Seattle
co-star
Meg Ryan
for
You've Got Mail , a remake of 1940's

projects: "[Since]
A League of Their Own , it can't be just
another movie for me. It has to get me going somehow.... There has to
be some all-encompassing desire or feeling about wanting to do that
particular movie. I'd like to assume that I'm willing to go down any
avenue in order to do it right". In August 2005, Hanks was voted in as
vice president of the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences . [12]

and
released a rap single in 2011 [24] ),
and Truman.
Regarding his religious views,
Hanks has said, "I must say that when I go to church – and I do go to
church – I ponder the mystery. I meditate on the 'why?' of 'Why people
are as they are' and 'Why bad things happen to good people,' and 'Why
good things happen to bad people'... The mystery is what I think it
is, almost, the grand unifying theory of mankind." [25]
Hanks became a grandfather when
his son Colin and daughter-in-law Samantha produced granddaughter
Olivia Jane Hanks on February 1, 2011. [26]

HIDE TEXT
Early life
Matt Damon was born in
Cambridge ,
Massachusetts , the son of Kent Telfer Damon, a
stockbroker , and Nancy Carlsson-Paige, an
early childhood education
professor at
Lesley University . [1] [2]
Damon is of
English ,
Scottish ,
Finnish , and
Swedish
ancestry, and is a distant cousin of actors
Ben Affleck
and
Casey Affleck . [3] [4]
He has a brother, Kyle, who is an accomplished
sculptor
and artist. [2] [5]
He and his family moved to
Newton
and lived there for two years. After his parents divorced,
Damon and his brother moved with their mother back to Cambridge, [2] [6]
where they lived in a six-family communal house. [7] [8]
Damon grew up near Ben Affleck, a close friend since childhood and
collaborator on several films, and
historian
and author
Howard Zinn , [9]
whose biographical film
You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train
and audio version of
A People's History of the United States
Damon later narrated. [8]
Damon took to
role-playing
as a child partly because his mother raised him "by
the book", [7]
which made him feel as though "you couldn’t define yourself, because
you already had been defined by her." [7]
He attended
Cambridge Rindge and Latin School , where he was a disciplined
student [10]
but had a "terrifying" first two years due to his short height at the
time. [11]
As a lonely adolescent, Damon has described feeling "such pain in
wanting to belong somewhere and not belonging." [7]
Damon performed as an actor in several high school theater
productions; [2]
he has credited his drama teacher at Rindge and Latin, Gerry Speca, as
an important artistic influence, even though Damon recalls that, "Mr.
Speca always seemed to trust Ben [Affleck] with the biggest roles and
longest speeches." [10]
Damon attended
Harvard University
from 1988 to 1992 but did not graduate. [12]
While at Harvard, he studied English and lived in
Lowell House . He took part in student theater, [13]
appearing in plays such as
Burn This in Winthrop House
and
A... My Name is Alice
(in one of the three male roles usually
performed by women). [14]
Damon dropped out of the university to pursue his acting career in Los
Angeles because he mistakenly expected
Geronimo: An American Legend
to become a big success. [15]
"By the time I figured out I had made the wrong decision, it was too
late. I was living out here with a bunch of actors, and we were all
scrambling to make ends meet," Damon has said. [16]
Acting career
Early years
Damon's first film role came in
1988 when he was eighteen, with a single line of dialogue in the
romantic comedy
Mystic Pizza . [17]
As a student at Harvard University, he continued to pursue acting and
performed small roles in projects such as the
TNT
original film
Rising Son
and the ensemble prep-school
drama
School Ties . [18]
In 1992, he landed a big part in
Geronimo: An American Legend
with
Gene Hackman
and
Jason Patric . [18]
Four years later, he auditioned for a small role in
Cutthroat Island , but was turned away. [19]
Damon next appeared as an
opiate -addicted soldier in 1996's
Courage Under Fire . He was required to lose 40 pounds (18 kg)
in 100 days (for only two days of filming). [20] [21]
After following a self-prescribed diet and fitness regimen to lose the
weight, Damon was told after filming that he was fortunate his heart
did not shrink. He took medication for several years afterwards to
correct the stress inflicted on his
adrenal gland .
Courage Under Fire
gained him some critical
notice, as
The Washington Post
labeled his performance "impressive"; [22]
Damon has stated that it was worthwhile to risk his health in order to
properly portray his character and show the industry how committed he
was to his work as an actor. [17] [21]
Breakthrough
During the early 1990s, Damon and
Affleck wrote a screenplay about a young math genius, which they then
pitched around Hollywood for a long time. Receiving advice from
director
Rob Reiner , screenwriter
William Goldman , and their friend writer/director
Kevin Smith , the two made changes to the script. [15]
The script eventually became
Good Will Hunting
(1997), and received nine
Academy Awards
nominations, earning Damon and Affleck
Oscars
for
Best Original Screenplay . [23] [24]
Damon was also nominated for an
Academy Award for Best Actor
for the same film, which also netted
an
Oscar for Best Supporting Actor
for co-star
Robin Williams . [23]
He and Affleck were each paid salaries of $500,000, while the film
grossed over $225 million at the worldwide box office. [25] [26]
The two later parodied their roles from the film in Kevin Smith's 2001
movie
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back .
Also in 1997, Damon was the lead
in the critically acclaimed drama
The Rainmaker , where he was recognized by the
Los Angeles Times
as "a talented young actor on the brink of
stardom." [27]
After meeting Damon on the set of
Good Will Hunting , director
Steven Spielberg
cast Damon as the titular character in the 1998
World War II
film
Saving Private Ryan . [15]
Hollywood star
Brad Pitt ,
George Clooney , Damon,
Andy García ,
Julia Roberts
(the cast of
Ocean's Eleven ), with director
Steven Soderbergh
in December 2001
Damon has become known for
choosing a wide variety of film roles, [28]
from his portrayal of
Patricia Highsmith 's anti-hero
Tom Ripley
in
The Talented Mr. Ripley
(1999) [17]
to a
fallen angel
who discusses
pop culture
as intellectual subject matter with Affleck in
Dogma
(1999); from a
conjoined twin
in
Stuck on You
(2003), which got a mixed critical reception, [29]
to the low budget experimental film
Gerry
(2002), which he co-wrote with
Casey Affleck
and
Gus Van Sant . Damon garnered generally positive critical reaction
for his
Golden Globe -nominated [30]
portrayal of Ripley, with
Variety
stating, "Damon outstandingly conveys his character's
slide from innocent enthusiasm into cold calculation." [31]
Damon's attempts at essaying
leading characters in romantic dramas such as 2000's
All the Pretty Horses
and
The Legend of Bagger Vance
were commercially and critically
unsuccessful. [25]
Variety
said of his work in
All the Pretty Horses :
"[Damon] just doesn't quite seem like a young man who's spent his life
amidst the dust and dung of a Texas cattle ranch. Nor does he strike
any sparks with [Penelope] Cruz." [32]
He was similarly deemed "uncomfortable being the center" of
Robert Redford 's
The Legend of Bagger Vance . [33]
From 2001 to 2007, Damon gained
wider international recognition as part of two major film franchises.
He co-starred as thief Linus Caldwell, alongside
George Clooney ,
Brad Pitt , and
Julia Roberts , in
Steven Soderbergh 's 2001
remake
of the
Rat Pack 's 1960 caper film
Ocean's 11 ; the successful crime
dramedy
spawned two sequels,
Ocean's Twelve
(2004) and
Ocean's Thirteen
(2007). [17]
He played
amnesiac
assassin
Jason Bourne
in the hit action thrillers
The Bourne Identity
(2002),
The Bourne Supremacy
(2004), and
The Bourne Ultimatum
(2007). [17]
Entertainment Weekly
placed Damon as an "action star" on its
end-of-the-decade, "best-of" list, saying, "When he first signed on as
the ass-kicking amnesiac Jason Bourne in 2002, no one would've
predicted that Damon would become the decade's best mixer of brawn and
brains. Shows what we know." [34]
In August 2007, financial magazine
Forbes
created a list of actors who generated the best box
office performance related to their salaries; the list placed Damon as
the most bankable star of the actors reviewed, revealing that Damon
had averaged U.S.$29 at the box office for every
dollar
he earned for his last three films. [35] [36]
Damon with
Robert De Niro
in Berlin in February 2007 for the premiere of
The Good Shepherd
Damon played a fictionalized
version of
Wilhelm Grimm
in
Terry Gilliam 's fantasy adventure
The Brothers Grimm
(2005), which was a critically panned
commercial failure; [25]
The Washington Post
concluded, "Damon, constantly flashing his
newscaster's teeth and flaunting a fake, 'Masterpiece Theatre'
dialect, comes across like someone who got lost on the way to an
audition for a high school production of 'The Pirates of Penzance'." [37]
Later that year, he appeared as an
energy analyst
in
Syriana . [38]
In 2006, Damon joined
Robert De Niro
in
The Good Shepherd
as a career
CIA
officer, and played an undercover
mobster
working for the
Massachusetts State Police
in
Martin Scorsese 's
The Departed , a remake of the
Hong Kong
police thriller
Infernal Affairs . [17]
Assessing his work in the two films,
Manohla Dargis
of
The New York Times
wrote that Damon "does what few stars with
his kind of billing do: he disappears." [28]
The Departed
was a success amongst critics and audiences alike. [25] [39]
Damon had an uncredited cameo in
Francis Ford Coppola 's
Youth Without Youth
(2007) and another cameo in the 2008
Che Guevara
biopic
Che . He lent his voice to the
English
version of the animated film
Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea , which was released in the
United States in August 2009. [40]
He also made a guest appearance in 2009 on the sixth season finale of
Entourage
as himself, where he tries to pressure
Vincent Chase
( Adrian
Grenier ) into donating to his charity OneXOne—a real foundation
for which Damon is an ambassador—and gets increasingly irritated when
Chase does not seem to comply. [41] [42]
Damon next appeared in Steven
Soderbergh's dark comedy,
The Informant!
(2009), [43]
in which his Golden Globe-nominated work was described by
Entertainment Weekly
as such: "The star – who has quietly and
steadily turned into a great Everyman actor – is in nimble control as
he reveals his character's deep crazies." [44]
Also in 2009, Damon portrayed
South Africa national rugby union team
captain
François Pienaar
in the
Clint Eastwood -directed
Nelson Mandela
film
Invictus , which is based on the 2008
John Carlin
book
Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game
That Changed a Nation
and features
Morgan Freeman
as Mandela. [45]
Invictus
earned Damon an Academy Award nomination for Best
Supporting Actor.
The New Republic
observed, "It is not a demanding role, but
the ever-more-actorly Damon brings it off with low-key charm and
integrity." [46]

Damon in front of the
Grauman's Chinese Theatre
In 2010, Damon re-teamed with
director Paul Greengrass, who directed him in the
Bourne Supremacy
and
Bourne Ultimatum , for the action thriller
Green Zone , which flopped commercially [47]
and received ambivalent reception from critics. [48]
In motion pictures that feature
him either as a leading actor or as a supporting co-star, his films
have grossed a total of U.S.$1.94 [49]
to U.S.$2.42
billion [50]
(based on counting his roles as strictly lead or including supporting
roles, respectively) at the North American box office, placing him in
the top forty grossing actors of all time.
He has appeared as a guest star
in an episode of
Arthur , titled
The Making of Arthur , as himself. [51]
During Season 5 of
30 Rock , he appeared as guest star in the role of
Liz Lemon 's boyfriend in the episodes "I Do I Do", "The Fabian
Strategy", " Live
Show " and "Double Edged Sword".
Damon's 2010 projects included
The Adjustment Bureau , Clint Eastwood's
Hereafter , and the
Coen Brothers ' remake of the
1969 John Wayne-starring
Western
True Grit ; the latter movie started filming in March 2010 and
was released in December of that year. [52]
Upcoming films
He will next work with frequent
collaborator Steven Soderbergh on two projects: as the longtime
Liberace
love interest, Scott Thorsen, opposite
Michael Douglas
in an upcoming film centered on the pianist's life [53]
and as part of an ensemble cast in
Contagion . [52]
Damon has also performed a supporting role in
Kenneth Lonergan 's drama
Margaret , which was scheduled for a theatrical debut in 2007
but is yet to be released due to production conflicts. He will also
star in
We Bought a Zoo , and has been cast to play in
Elysium .
Producing career
Along with Affleck and producers
Chris Moore
and Sean Bailey, Damon founded the production company
LivePlanet , through which the four created the documentary series
Project Greenlight
to find and fund worthwhile film projects
from novice filmmakers. [54]
The company produced and founded the short-lived mystery-hybrid series
Push, Nevada , among other projects.
Project Greenlight
was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Reality Program in 2002,
2004, and 2005. [15]
In March 2010, Damon and Affleck
teamed up again to sign a first-look production deal with
Warner Bros. [55]
Humanitarian work
Damon volunteering in Haiti as
part of the
United Nations Stabilization Mission
Damon has taken part in
philanthropy since the age of 12, deciding what to do with his $5
allowance. [56]
Damon was the founder of
H2O Africa Foundation , the charitable arm of the
Running the Sahara
expedition, [15] [57]
which merged with
WaterPartners
to create
Water.org
in July 2009. [58]
He, along with George Clooney, Brad Pitt,
Don Cheadle , and
Jerry Weintraub , is one of the founders of
Not On Our Watch , an organization that focuses global attention
and resources to stop and prevent mass atrocities such as in
Darfur . [59]
Damon supports the
ONE Campaign , which is aimed at fighting
AIDS
and
poverty
in
Third World
countries. He has appeared in their print and
television advertising. Damon is also an ambassador for OneXOne, a
non-profit foundation committed to supporting, preserving and
improving the lives of children at home in Canada, the United States,
and around the world. [60]
Damon is also a spokesperson for
Feeding America , the largest USA-focused hunger-relief
organization, and a member of their Entertainment Council,
participating in their
Ad Council
PSAs.
Damon is a board member of Tonic
Mailstopper (formerly GreenDimes), a company that attempts to halt
junk mail delivered to American homes each day. [61]
Appearing on
The Oprah Winfrey Show
on April 20, 2007, Damon promoted the
organization's efforts to prevent the trees used for junk mail letters
and envelopes from being chopped down. Damon stated: "For an estimated
dime a day they can stop 70 per cent of the junk mail that comes to
your house. It's very simple, easy to do, great gift to give, I've
actually signed up my entire family. It was a gift given to me this
past holiday season and I was so impressed that I'm now on the board
of the company." [62]
In the media
Kimmel and Damon
Comedian
Jimmy Kimmel
at some point started stating near the end of his
ABC
television show
Jimmy Kimmel Live! , "My apologies to Matt Damon, we ran out of
time." The line is a gag lampooning instances where shows cannot
feature their last guest due to time constraints. On September 12,
2006, after a segment highlighting the running gag and a lengthy
introduction by Kimmel, Damon finally appeared on the show, only for
Kimmel to apologetically cut his interview and head to credits, as
Damon cursed him. This encounter was entirely planned by Kimmel and
Damon. [63]
Kimmel's girlfriend at the time,
comedian
Sarah Silverman
appeared on
Jimmy Kimmel Live
on January
31, 2008 and aired a clip where she is singing a song entitled " I'm
Fucking Matt Damon ". Damon appeared in the song with Silverman. [64]
Kimmel responded by airing his own music video in which he announced,
through song, that he is "fucking
Ben Affleck ". The video aired on February 24, 2008, and featured
Affleck along with a host of celebrities, including
Don Cheadle ,
Brad Pitt ,
Cameron Diaz ,
Harrison Ford , and
Robin Williams .
Later on, Kimmel's sidekick,
Guillermo, appeared in a spoof of
The Bourne Ultimatum , which starred Damon. He was then chased
down by Damon as he cursed about Kimmel being behind all this.
The most recent encounter was
titled "The Handsome Men's Club" which featured Kimmel, along with
other "Handsome Men" including
Matthew McConaughey ,
Rob Lowe
and
Lenny Kravitz . At the end of the skit Kimmel has a door slammed in
his face by Damon stating that they had run out of time and then Damon
continues with a sinister laugh. [65]
Political views
Damon appeared on
Hardball with Chris Matthews
in December 2006 and, while
discussing the ongoing
war in Iraq , he stated: "I don't think that it's fair, as I said
before, that it seems like we have a fighting class in our country
that's comprised of people who have to go for either financial
reasons, or ... if you're gonna send people to war, then that needs to
be shared by everybody." [66]
On September 10, 2008, a video
was released on
YouTube
by the
Associated Press
in which Damon criticized the
Republican
Vice Presidential candidate
Sarah Palin , whom he found unready to lead the country in case
John McCain
were to not make it through his first term. Damon
referred to Palin as a "...bad
Disney
movie... 'I'm just a hockey mom from Alaska here to take on
the White House'," and added, "It's absurd ... I need to know if she
really thinks
dinosaurs
were here
4,000 years ago . Because she’s gonna have the
nuclear codes ." [67]
Damon narrated the audiobook
version of historian
Howard Zinn 's
A People's History of the United States , published in 2003. [68]

bartender . [71]
They married in a private
civil ceremony
on December 9, 2005, at the
Manhattan Marriage Bureau
near
New York City Hall . [71]

previous marriage. The couple's first child together, daughter
Isabella, was born on June 11, 2006. [72]

(WSOP) events [77] [78]
including the
2010 World Series of Poker
main event. [79]

(1998) [80]
and after filming the movie Damon was busted out of the 1998 WSOP by
