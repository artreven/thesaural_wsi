Dominick John Dunne
(October 29, 1925 - August 26, 2009) [ 2 ]
was an American
writer
and
investigative journalist
whose subjects frequently hinged on the ways high society interacts with the
judicial
system. He was a producer in Hollywood and was also known for his frequent appearances
on television. He was the brother of author
John Gregory Dunne ; the writer
Joan Didion
was his sister-in-law. He was the father of Alexander Dunne, and of the actors
Griffin Dunne
and
Dominique Dunne
as well as two daughters who died in infancy.
Biography
Dunne, the second of six children, was born in Hartford, Connecticut, the son of Dorothy
Frances (née Burns) and Richard Edwin Dunne, a hospital chief of staff and prominent heart surgeon. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
His
Irish Catholic
family was wealthy (his maternal grandfather founded the Park Street Trust), but from
his earliest days Dunne recalled feeling like an outsider in the predominantly
WASPish
West Hartford . [ 3 ]
After Dunne's studies at the
Kingswood School
and
Canterbury School
in
New Milford, Connecticut [ 5 ]
'Nicky' Dunne – as he was known during his boyhood – attended
Williams College
and then served in
World War II , including the battle of
Metz . Afterward he moved to New York, then to
Hollywood , where he directed
Playhouse 90
and became vice-president of
Four Star Television . He hobnobbed with the rich and the famous of those days. In 1979, beset with addictions,
Dunne left Hollywood and moved to rural
Oregon , where he says he dealt with his personal demons and wrote his first book,
The Winners .
In November 1982, his daughter,
Dominique Dunne , best known for her part in the film
Poltergeist ,
was murdered. Dunne attended the trial of her murderer ( John Thomas Sweeney ) and wrote the article "Justice: A Father's Account of the Trial of his Daughter's Killer"
for
Vanity Fair .
Dunne went on to write for
Vanity Fair
regularly and
fictionalized
several real-life events, such as the murders of
Alfred Bloomingdale 's mistress
Vicki Morgan
and banking heir
William Woodward, Jr. , for best-selling books. He eventually hosted the TV series
Dominick Dunne's Power,
Privilege, and Justice
on
CourtTV
(later
truTV ), in which he discussed justice and injustice and their intersection with celebrities.
Famous trials he covered include those of
O.J. Simpson ,
Claus von Bulow ,
Michael Skakel ,
William Kennedy Smith , and the
Menendez brothers .
In 2005,
Gary Condit
won an undisclosed amount of
money
and an
apology
from Dunne, who had earlier implicated him in the disappearance of
Chandra Levy , an intern from his district with whom he had been carrying on an affair. In November
2006, he was sued again by Condit for comments made about the former politician on
Larry King Live
on
CNN [ 6 ]
but the suit was tossed out of court.
While it was rumored in early 2006 that he intended to cease writing for
Vanity Fair ,
Dunne stated the opposite in a February 4, 2006 interview with
talk show
host
Larry King . "Oh, I am at
Vanity Fair . I'll be in the next issue and the issue after that.
We went through, you know, a difficult period. That happens in long relationships and, you know, you either work your way
through them or you get a divorce. And I didn't want a divorce and we've worked our way through and
Graydon
and I are close and he's a great editor and I'm thrilled to be there." [ 7 ]
Dunne frequently socialized with, wrote about, and was photographed with celebrities.
A
Salon.com
review of his memoir,
The Way We Lived Then , recounted how Dunne appeared at a
wedding reception for
Dennis Hopper . Sean Elder, the author of the review, wrote: "But in the midst of it all there was one
man who was getting what ceramic artist Ron Nagle would call 'the full cheese,' one guy everyone gravitated toward and paid
obeisance to." That individual was Dunne, who mixed easily with artists, actors and writers present at the function. The final
line of the review about Dunne quoted Dennis Hopper wishing he "had a picture of myself with
Allen Ginsberg
and
Norman Mailer ." [ 8 ]
In 2008, at age 82, Dunne traveled from
New York
to
Las Vegas
to cover O.J. Simpson's trial on charges of kidnapping and armed robbery for
Vanity
Fair
magazine, claiming it would be his last. During the trial, an unidentified woman approached and kissed him, causing
her to be ejected from the courtroom. When he collapsed and was rushed to the hospital, he expressed amazement [1] at how fast the word spread at his fan site, DominicksDiary.com. [2]
Dunne's adventures in Hollywood as an outcast, top-selling author and reporter, were
catalogued in the release of
Dominick Dunne: After the Party .
This film documents his successes and tribulations as a big name in the entertainment
industry. In the film, Dunne reflects on his past as a
World War II
veteran, falling in love and raising a family, his climb and fall as a Hollywood producer,
and his epic comeback as a writer.
In September 2008, Dunne disclosed that he was being treated for
bladder cancer . [ 9 ]
He was working on
Too Much Money , his final book, at the time of his death. [ 10 ]
On September 22, 2008, Dunne complained of intense pain and was taken by ambulance to
Valley Hospital . [ 11 ]
Dunne died on
August 26 ,
2009
at his home in
Manhattan
from
bladder cancer . [ 12 ]
However news of his death was minimal, as Massachusetts Senator
Ted Kennedy
had died the day before. [ 13 ]
It is fair to say that the halls of
Vanity Fair
will be lonelier without
him and that, indeed, we will not see his like anytime soon, if ever again
