A.P. Ranks ‘Em From 1-11: Jersey Sponsors in MLS
The San Jose Earthquake became the 11th team in Major League Soccer to reel in a jersey sponsor Tuesday when they secured Amway as their official sponsor.
To celebrate their (well mostly the leagues) new found money I am ranking the sponsors and team. My ranking is based on three qualities, each with 5 possible positive and negative points: •
Company Reputation •
Money involved •
Logo Design (includes how well it works with the kit) The Top 11 1. Seattle Sounders : 4 million annually XBOX 360 LIVE Company Reputation:
5 Money:
5 Logo Design:
5 Total Score:
15 Seattle scored big when they brought Microsoft and XBOX 360 LIVE in as a sponsor. It is hard to get a bigger company than Microsoft. Seattle and Microsoft work great together because Seattle has a great tech industry. The young and technological savvy crowd that Major League Soccer attracts is a great fit for Microsoft. Microsoft bring the money, and they brought top dollar to the deal with the Sounders. The design works too. The Sounder’s colors fit the XBOX and the XBOX’s colors fit the Sounders. It’s the perfect match. 2. DC United : 3.1 to 3.7 million annually Volkswagen Company Reputation:
5 Money:
4.5 Logo Design:
5 Total Score:
14.5 DC United is a very close second to Seattle. Volkswagen is a top company that everyone immediately recognizes. Not only do they support DC, but Volkswagen is a main sponsor of the league itself. Every time you see the logo you have to think of DC, even if you are at a RSL vs Colorado game. The Volkswagen logo looks classy on both the home and away jerseys. The white and black negative spaces are simple and clear. I love the round design; eons better than “Volkswagen” splayed across the kit. 3. New York Red Bulls : Part of a 100 million dollar deal Red Bull Company Reputation:
4 Money:
5 Logo Design:
5 Total Score:
14 Metrostars fans might hate me but I like Red Bull as a sponsor. The jerseys look great. The Bulls on front give off the brand without the company name yelling out who they are. The money is wonderful as well. Red Bull has brought increased press, a new stadium, and an improved commitment to the league. Red Bull has always been a great sponsor of athletes, without them many fringe sports and athletes could not succeed. I admit to having yelled that Red Bull tastes like piss and then drinking a free can. They are good for the community. 4 (TIE). Chicago Fire : 2 to 4 million annually Best Buy Company Reputation:
4 Money:
3.5 Logo Design:
3 Total Score:
10.5 Best Buy is another great sponsor for Major League Soccer. The nationally known logo fits well with the Chicago Fire’s all red jerseys. I hate fighting the crowds in Best Buy, but I wouldn’t mind at a Fire game. The brand recognition is instantaneous; the white tag against the red background stands out and looks slightly garish. Did they only give the designer paint.NET? “Well I have the select a box tool, I don’t know how to change off white and black, and I have a paint can tool.” The money is right too. I could not find clear figures so the Fire misses 5 points for money. A varied figure means they get a slightly lower score and miss out on fourth place by .5 points. 4 (TIE). Houston Dynamo : 1.785 million annually Amigo Energy Company Reputation:
3 Money:
2.5 Logo Design:
5 Total Score:
10.5 Amigo Energy is a local company that the South is familiar with but it does not hold the brand recognition that the top 4 have. While it doesn’t have the recognition it connects locally and bring recognition to a team that doesn’t always have the respect it deserves from the local government. At 1.785 million annually, Houston has secured enough money to put themselves right at the medium for sponsor money. The logo is unique to the area and culture. It’s got flavor baby. The Amigo Energy logo is about more than just the company, it also talks about the culture in Houston, Texas. 5. Columbus Crew : 1 million annually Glidden Company Reputation:
4 Money:
1 Logo Design:
5 Total Score:
10 Columbus Crew, the 2008 MSL Cup Champions are getting the short end of a stick shoved somewhere nasty. At 1 million annually they are tied with Real Salt Lake as worst negotiators (was it really was to appoint Steve Sampson to take care of it?). However, they stick at fifth place because Glidden has done more than pay their 1 million dollars and walk away. The Glidden logo looks professional and cool on Columbus’ jerseys. The rounded logo, reminiscent of the Volkswagen design stands out and melds well with the kit. Glidden also has put more money into sponsoring MLS and they have a sweet line of paint at Home Depot where you can order custom MLS colors. Never done it, but I think it’s cool. 6. Toronto FC : 1 to 1.5 million annually BMO Company Reputation:
4 Money:
1.5 Logo Design:
3 Total Score:
8.5 At 1 to 1.5 million, Toronto FC isn’t getting anything spectacular from a bank. Toronto may excel at giving goals away but BMO isn’t quite as generous. BMO is a solid bank relatively free from the credit crisis but it doesn’t help that BMO is only accessible to those in Canada and Chicago. The brand recognition isn’t there. The logo design is bland. The black BMO stands beside some kind of emoticon typed by a Japanese adolescent girl. 7. Chivas USA : 2 million annually Comex Company Reputation:
3 Money:
2.5 Logo Design:
2 Total Score:
7.5 The Comex group is the other paint company in MLS sponsor world. They want you to buy their paint and industrial smoothing products and proceed get all colorful and shit but the logo doesn’t tell me that. It says, “We sell white paint and if you paint an X, it will be in a totally sweet font. Schwing!” While the money is right and the culture connection with South and Central America is there, the rest just got stabbed in Tijuana. 8. LA Galaxy :
4 to 5 million annually Herbalife Company Reputation:
-5 Money:
5 Logo Design:
3 Total Score:
3 Oh Galaxy, when will you stop being so easy to pick on? Let’s get the positive out of the way. Hey um, HERBALIIIIIFE, you paid out some good money and I like the little plant design but I think it is missing a couple of leafs. The only way the Galaxy aren’t last in this list is the great money they are getting. But Herbalife? Inappropriate business practices, running a pyramid scheme, many lawsuits, Herbalife has paid out 50 Million in lawsuits over the years. Do I need to say anymore about how sleazy life is in Herbalife? 9. Real Salt Lake : 1 million annually XanGo Company Reputation:
-2 Money:
1 Logo Design:
2 Total Score:
1 XanGo. Interesting name. If I stare at the name long enough and say it over and over in my mind it means I’m supposed to take some Xanax and Go somewhere exotic? RSL isn’t exactly making bank on this deal. Sure when they signed it they were in a horrible stadium with bouncy turf action but 1 million is pretty low. The logo is sufficient but if that’s the kind of creativity XanGo inspires 10. San Jose Earthquakes : 2 to 3 million annually Amway Company Reputation:
-6 Money:
3 Logo Design:
3 Total Score:
0 Amway, meet your neighbor pyramid Herbalife. Nice of you to sponsor a California team too. The two rivals have something in common; they will sell you stupid shit. Amway, I get your connection with California, they had riots and you caused riots in China! You are illegal in India and tried to get away with tax evasion in Canada! You are pure class. At least you are paying decent money and were willing to change their logo color so it matches the Earthquake color scheme.

Fredy Montero: A Player Profile
The Seattle Expansion: Let’s Not Finish Last No expansion team goal is: “Finish Last.” Unfortunately for them, most have hit that goal with pomp and flair. An expansion team has built in disadvantages. Most of the players have never worked together. They are just settling into the area. Family and friends are far away. In MLS wives cannot always afford to follow their husbands. When you make 30 – 60k, making your wife quit her job to follow you is not always an option. Life is expensive. Seattle will carry many of those disadvantages with them into their first season. Their defense may leak goals, they may be playing on field turf in a giant stadium, their DP may be unfairly labeled as over the hill, but Seattle is bringing the excitement offensively. Fredy Montero New forwards are exciting and Fredy Montero is excitement with possibilities galore. Seattle has scored a coup by bringing in a young, proven goal scorer on loan. Fredy Montero’s move to Seattle comes as a surprise considering he was being chased by Real Betis. Despite signing with Seattle, Montero’s dream of playing in Europe lives on. Like many soccer journeymen Montero views MLS is a place to learn, grow, prove himself in a new environment, and ultimately to sell himself to a European team. Seattle may not be Europe, but some of the tests stay the same. Fredy has to deal with a new country, city, and language. His ability to work with new teammates from a diverse background he cannot immediately communicate with will be tested. Culture shock is seeing Seattle’s Best Coffee on every corner.
What were you doing at 21? I was wandering around college being stupid. I hope Fredy has more maturity than I had. Fredy’s History: Scoring and Being Loaned Ou t At 18, Fredy signed a contract with
Deportivo Cali
a Columbian Club in
Santiago de Cali, Colombia . Fredy immediately made an impact at the club by scoring at a prodigious rate. In 38
total appearances over three years, Fredy has scored 20 goals. Fredy has scored .526 goals per game for Deportivo Cali. Fredy may not be Christiano Ronaldo, but he has proven he can score a goal every other game. If Fredy can maintain that rate in MLS he will increase his value exponentially. At 19, Fredy was loaned out to lower division
Atletico Huila
where he has scored 13 goals in 26 appearances, a solid .5 goals per game. When Fredy was recalled to Deportiva Cali for the 2007 season he started 17 games and scored no goals. His drought lasted all the way to the 2008 season when he began scoring again. A Hidden Problem? Yet amongst all the scoring a mystery appears that I cannot easily explain. Why is Deportivo Cali so eager to send Fredy out on loan? A proven goal scorer at 21, Fredy should be a commodity that Deportivo Cali would want to hold on to. Usually young goal scorers are held onto and milked for every goal they can give the club until an offer to buy is just too good to pass up. What is Fredy’s downside? Fuck It, We’ll Watch Him Play Live Whatever his secret is, we can always watch videos of him scoring great goals. That is sure to make any Seattle fan feel better about hidden downsides. This video shows most of his goals, including some incredible pile drivers, but with out music. This video only shows three goals but it has some enchanting music. This one includes a rocking soundtrack as well as great pictures of Fredy. Don’t Forget My Contest , Damnit Hey I still have a
contest going
remember? Turn in your supporter pictures to grahamfox[@]gmail.com and win a

Dennis Hamlett: A Man of Character
Diversity in Major League Soccer In Major League Soccer it is easy to spot diversity. Every team has players from around the world and many different walks of life. However, Dennis Hamlett stands alone at the top as the only black Latino head coach in MLS. Dennis Hamlett Suffers a Stroke of Destiny In the preseason of the 1997, Dennis Hamlett was preparing for the second ever MLS season. His first season had been full of promise. Hamlett played all but one game of the inaugural MLS season and was named Colorado’s 1996 Defender of the Year. It happened innocuously; the play seemed like hundreds of others Hamlett had made in preseason training. The ball was thrust through the air and into Colorado’s box. Pushing off from the ground and leaping slightly backwards, Hamlett soared through the air and headed the ball away. Like any good defender he had mounted a successful challenge and continued onward without fanfare. This challenge changed Hamlett’s destiny. While he lay down to take a nap, the carotid artery in his neck seeped blood. Hamlett awoke with a “massive headache.”
The leaking carotid artery had given the 28 year old Hamlett a stroke. After recovering from the stroke Hamlett found his intensity and drive were gone. He still loved soccer and every aspect surrounding the game but his ability to passionately play the game had been severely diminished.
Despite playing for Colorado, Hamlett received the care and attention he deserved from MLS. They were not ready to give up on Hamlett’s talented brain. Instead of casting him aside they tried to find him a job.
Peter Wilt , Chicago Fire's first president, was happy to welcome Hamlett into the fold as an assistant coach. Paying Penance to the Fire Hamlett spent five years under
Bob Bradley , the winningist coach in MLS history. Hamlett was beside Bradley while Chicago won a MLS Championship and two Open Cups. When Bradley moved on, Hamlett was passed over. Hamlett had learned from the best, but his hard work and brilliant soccer mind was not enough for Chicago. Instead Chicago decided to bring in
Dave Sarachan
who Hamlett helped to gain two more Open Cup titles. While the Fire were not interested in Hamlett for the head coaching position, Hamlett was determined to lead from more than an assistant’s position.
He continued his hard work with Chicago, but interview for head coaching positions around the league. Hamlett’s time was coming, but one head coach later than he hoped. When Sarachan moved on, Hamlett again tried for the head coaching job only to be passed over for Juan Carlos Osorio. Only after Osorio resigned was Hamlett finally given his chance. Ten years after suffering a stroke, Hamlett was back on top. Alone at the Top Hamlett stands as one of the few black coach’s in all of soccer. His dedication, commitment, and love for soccer and the Chicago Fire has held him in good steed. Hamlett’s dream has been realized and today on Martin Luther King Jr. day we should celebrate his accomplishments. Don’t judge Dennis Hamlett by the color of his skin but by the content of his character.
Today, we celebrate Hamlett’s character. The character that lead him through strokes, ten years of assistant coaching, and to the top of Major League Soccer.

Soccer in America: Soccer with James Parker, Manhattan KS
The Interviewee's Music Picks! Introductions I met James while playing pick-up soccer at K-State. He is a talented player who is heavily involved with the
K-State
Men’s Club Team. Who is James? Hi James, would you give the readers a quick background of yourself? I’m a fourth year right now at K-State in the architecture department. I grew up in
Manhattan , and played football and soccer there. What’s your first memory of soccer? How far back can you go? It may be one of those that’s more ingrained in my dad’s memory. My dad forgot to sign me up for city league soccer. I was sitting there just bawling my brains out at the city department because I wasn’t on the team. I was crying, wouldn’t get in the car, pissed off at the world. My dad felt pretty horrible and he reminds me of it time in time out. You played both Football and Soccer in High-School? I gave it a shot. I was just a kicker. I played four years of soccer, three varsity. I wanted to try something different. Me and my friend both did a multi-sport same season our senior year. We were both kickers for the football team and members of the soccer team. It pretty hectic but it was a blast. What are your soccer aspirations do you have hopes for semi-pro or professional soccer? I’ve always gone back and forth with that. Soccer has been my passion and dream since I was a little kid. I love soccer so much, I could easily see myself doing it but at the same time it’s so much training. I know I have the basic skill-talent to do it but I don’t have much time to train so the dream starts to fall away. When I go to Europe this next spring I really want to get out there and play and see if I can hop onto some semi pro teams. What is K-State Club Soccer? How did you become involved with the
Kansas State Men's Club Soccer ? Actually the first year of college I pursed football and went and kicked at a community college.
I realized that football wasn’t my sport, I just had too much of a passion for soccer and love for the game. I came back to K-State because I knew I wanted to do architecture.
I was out playing one afternoon when a few guys off the team told me to come out for try outs. I didn’t even know K-State had a team. At this point the team wasn’t structured that well, there wasn’t any real direction on the team so I said, “OK, I’ll give it a try.” When does your season run? You have games in the Fall? There are actually two seasons. The main core of the season runs in the fall. We’ll get a good 15 games in. It really comes down to how much time we have to travel. We do a little in the spring. We have a tournament and bring teams in from around the Midwest, teams like Creighton, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. How is the club led? Do you have a president or coach? It’s set up president, vice president, secretary treasurer. Because it’s a club you’ve got to give everyone a title. When it comes down to it as far as importance, everyone has basically the same duties, equal responsibility. Just because you’re president doesn’t mean you do all the work. Have you ever had an official coach? How do you manage the coaching duties? I know the girls have had a coach in the past. They’ve liked it but not having a coach becomes an advantage for certain players at K-State. They are there for mainly academics so they aren’t really focused as much on training and getting better. They make practices when they can. As far as drills we don’t have anyone setting them up. We just get out there. That’s the only thing that sucks about it because everyone is busy and we have so much on our plate we aren’t able to sit down and say “Hey, here is what we need to work on tonight, here is what we need to improve on.” The thing I love about K-State is so many different nationalities are represented. Do you know how many different countries are represented on the club team? Right now I believe there are four of five. We had a few guys from China, a guy from Japan, a few guys from the Middle East, and a few guys from Europe also. What’s you assessment of the talent level at Kansas State? There is a lot of good talent that comes out. We’d be competing with division one programs, maybe not the top teams but competing. It’s hard to see such good talent. They should be able to play somewhere bigger and better but the fact of the matter is they’re at K-State. A lot of people think “The club team, oh they are going to be bad," but they don’t realize that they are some of the best players you will see in the Midwest but they are focusing more on academics because here in America there is really no outlet for soccer. K-State Soccer and Nationals What kind of support do you get from K-State? We get a little bit of money from the school. It ends up being divided out even through the Recreation Complex between all sports clubs. We don’t get as much support as we like. But at the same time there is money and we are able to fundraise and do what we need to do to get by. I noticed we were really running into troubles with the Kansas State when we made it to nationals. It was the first time K-State had done it. We had approximately one month do get down there [Pensacola, Florida]. We didn’t necessarily have support from the school but there were quite a few nice ladies who worked at K-State who saw what we were trying to do and accomplish. They set up a nice soccer clinic. We got quite a good showing last year and raised quite a bit of money. I know the club team has had some success, you went to nationals last year, how did you do in that tournament? I think it was more a learning experience. That’s what everyone always says but there is some merit to that because we faced some great competition. We faced Virginia Tech, Georgia, and Michigan. The teams we faced all had coaches. That’s where we first saw the difference between what we had and the other top schools. They were able to train before the game while we were kinda standing around not really knowing what to do. It took us a good 15-20 minutes to get in the grove of the game and ready to play and by that time we were already down a goal and fighting back the rest of the time. Men’s and Woman’s Soccer in the Big XII Why is there no Men’s Soccer in the
Big XII ? I couldn’t tell you. I do know if K-State was to get a soccer team it would be girls not guys because K-State is the only team in the Big XII without a woman’s soccer team. It’s very hard to believe especially considering we have such a nice stadium. I love
Memorial Stadium / The Old Stadium
so much. It’s a great place to play and so beautiful. I was talking to someone who used to work in the Athletic Department at K-State and he was telling me that because of Title 9 it ends up shooting the girls in the foot because for some reason K-State would have to build a new stadium just for the Woman’s soccer team. That’s a whole new plot of land and a whole lot of money and they’d rather put it somewhere else. Do you think we will ever have Men’s Soccer in the Big XII? I’m going to say yes just because I want to see it. I hope so. It’s a sport that’s growing. Just recently it’s starting to come around and I think there’s a whole era of kids right now. Our era is getting older and we’ll have money. The era above us grew up on football and baseball so that’s what they make their kids play. We are going to grow up and have our kids play soccer. Hopefully down the road it will come around.

It's Really Drafty in Here!
Combine Harvest's Goals The combine is now well under way. Games have been played, weakness exposed, and the quality of some has show through. While I would love to be at the Combine giving you on the spot live videos, interviews, and pictures that is not going to happen on a grad school budget. Instead I am going to focus on just a few players, the players who scored goals and the keepers who posted shutouts. Of course, you can play a great game without being a goal scorer so just because there name doesn’t appear below doesn’t mean they didn’t put in a great performance. The Combine Games Official MLS Combine Roster Day 1 Game 1: adiTunit beat Powerserve 2-0 Goals: Chris Pontius, Peri Marosevic Shutout: Stefan Frei, Evan Bush Day 1 Game 2: adiPure beat Tiro 1-0 Goal: Jordan Seabrook Shutout: Neal Kitson, Alec Dufty Day 2 Game 1: adiTunit tied
Tiro 1-1
Goal: Peri Marosevic; Nick Perera Day 2 Game 2: PowerSwerve beat adiPure
2-0 Goals: Quincy Amarikwa (2) Shutout: Evan Bush The Players Forward
Chris Pontius (USCB): 1 goal Chris is a 6’0 170 forward for UC Santa Barbra. In the 2007 season he was the conferences top goal scorer with 11. In 2008 he was the team Co-Captian, as well as a M.A.C Hermann Trophy Candidate. In 2007 he was the Big West Offensive Player of the Year. Listen to an
Interview with Chris Pontius Forward
Peri Marosevic
(Michigan): 2 goals Peri is a 5’9 160 forward from Michigan. He has played with the US U-17 and U-20 National Team. While with the U-20 team he scored a brace against Mexico. While at Michigan he has qualified for a variety of teams, including All-Distric First Team. He holds the record for single season shot total (66). Too bad that is just shots and not goals. Peri scores the first goal in this video. Forward
Quincy Amarikwa
(UC Davis): 2 goals Quincy is a 5’9 160 forward who is loaded with skill. He has been named to the Big West All Conference Second Team and finished the season with 5 goals in his 2007 season (2 of the game winners). In 2008 he was named to the All American team after a season with 15 goals. Read an
interview with Quincy . Watch Quincy hit a sweet bicycle kick. Forward
Jordan Seabrook (South Florida): 1 goal Jordan, a 5’10 160 striker is very fast and has handled himself well during the combine. In his 2007 season he had 5 goals and 8 assists. He was ranked #42 in the nation based on assists per game. Seabrook is also a track and field star. Watch Seabrook twist and turn in the box to create a game winning goal in the Big East Tournament Championship. Forward
Nick Perera (UCSB):1 goal Nick is a 6’3 200 forward for US Santa Barbra. He has a great first touch and is very calm in front of goal. In 2007 he appeared in every match during the season. In the 2006 Men’s College Cup he was named the best offensive player (when he was a sophomore). Wow a whole video dedicated to a college soccer player. I just shat myself. GK
Evan Bush
(Akron): 2 shutouts At 6’3 185 Bush has size and speed. He has been named to the All MAC First Team twice. In 2007 he started 21 games and posted 12 shutouts. Unfortunately there are no videos of Bush in action. Weird huh? Great MLS Draft Sites - Pro Player Pipeline :The best breakdown and explanation of every game, notes on each player, and overall grade - Soccer by Ives : Daily updates, you probably already visit here - MLSnet : The official MLS site has updates and video of the combine. - 3rd Degree : The FC Dallas site has great insider observation and info - MLS Draft : A whole site dedicated to just the MLS draft. Ooooooh Twitter TWEET TWEET TWEET I have a
Twitter feed . Next time on Advantage Played On Wednesday I continue my Soccer in America series. I look at soccer at Kansas State and in the Big XI.

MLS Draft
Friday, January 9, 2009
It's Drafty in Here
Music Time
(My girlfriend helped pick these out) The MLS Draft is Coming! Well the draft is almost upon us. The Generation Adidas contracts have been signed and the draft fodder is now heading to the combine. During three days they will all play each other under the watchful eye of all fifteen MLS teams coaches and scouts. For these young men it’s got to be a time of deep anxiety. The dream of playing pro-soccer is closer to them than ever before. Yet they still have to prove themselves after four years of success. The past seasons they have stood out above their teammates and shown their skill. Now they have to build on their previous confidence to take it to the next level. While the rookies have to be at their best, so do the MLS scouts. Every year there are late picks that far exceed the early picks. Without the supplemental draft and reserve league those diamonds will have to be found quick and early. If you are like me, you know what is happening in college soccer but you don’t get to see a lot of games. In this update and the next few, I’m going to do the video search for you and present you with a rich buffet of the stars of tomorrow in action (I can’t promise you will love the music that goes with the videos). The Stars of Tomorrow Part 1 Steve Zakuani Steve comes to us from Akron College. From 1997-2003 he played with the Arsenal Youth Team. At 6-0 170 pounds, this forward has skill and great vision. In 2008 he had 20 goals for Akron. Omar Gonzalez Omar comes to us from the University of Maryland. He has been named the ACC Defensive Player of the Year. At 6-5’, 206 pounds he is an imposing presence. Omar has been with the U.S. soccer residency program since 2005. He scored the goal which secured the
US U-17 team a spot in the FIFA U-17 World Championship. Omar
scores the #3 goal of the 2007 season in this video
(2.23 in). Rodney Wallace
Rodney, a 5-11’ 152 pound Midfielder for the University of Maryland. A former teammate of Stephen King, he has focus and confidence that will serve him well in MLS. Rodney
scores the #8th, 7th, 2nd, and 1st best goal of Maryland’s 2007 season in this video . Next Time on Advantage Played I’m going to give you an even better update on the draft players. I will scour the internet and find every last video of anyone in the draft. And I do it because I love you. Help Me! If you know college soccer players with an interesting story who would like to be interviewed for my soccer in America series, please let me know. Email is at the top.

Inside American Soccer
Listen to Some Music Chosen by the Interviewee American Soccer I want to take you inside American soccer. You will see the trials, joys, tribulations, and excitement that the young men and woman of American soccer experience. You will also start to understand their training and daily lives. We enjoy our footballers when they are on the pitch, but off it they face just as many challenges, especially the college hopefuls. Today I’m bringing you the first in what I hope to be a series of articles focusing on footballers in the American collegiate system. Inside Midwest Soccer with Center Midfielder David Fox Welcome to Advantage Played David. We’ll just start out with the basics. What college do you play for? I play at
William Jewell College
in Liberty Missouri. How did you end up at William Jewell? My club soccer coach’s daughter plays at Benedictine the school that my coach at William Jewell’s twin brother coaches at. So that was one of my connections. Jewell’s head coach talked to my club coach and liked what he heard. I came up, tried out, had a kick around with the team, and they offered me a scholarship. What are your thoughts after you first season with William Jewell? It’s what I love about soccer. It’s really competitive but at the same time the feeling of being on a team [is great] and the team chemistry at Jewell is amazing. Everybody gets along so well. Even though everyone is fighting for spots and playing time the team still stays together. There is no in-fighting between the players. How did you do personally in your first season? I ended up with about 35 minutes of Varsity playing time as a freshman which I was pretty excited about. We defiantly have some good players. Next year I am looking to play a more significant role. Are there going to be seniors leaving, or will you find the way in through your own virtues? There really won’t be seniors leaving, but I know things I can improve on and how to improve on them in the summer and offseason.
Hopefully that will make the difference. What are you going to try and improve on the most? The biggest area is touch, the first touch on the ball makes or breaks a center midfield player. Good control and balance when there is pressure on my back and working on making my shot more accurate and powerful. What is a typical day of training like? Pre-season begins with waking up at seven and we go to breakfast as a team.
We have practice ball control in the morning for the first thirty minutes, then drills for another hour. Then there is an hour break and lunch as a team. After lunch we have another practice. We do sprints and drills for the rest of practice.
We then go to dinner as a team, and have a practice after dinner where we scrimmage. So that’s preseason? Ya, in season we practice once a day. Sometimes we’ll go two a day if our games are spaced far enough apart. Do you like training all the time? I’ll be able to answer that better after the offseason when we lift weights all the time. I did like it. One of the reasons I decided to play college soccer is because I can play all day and look forward to the next day of soccer. What is the main difference between college and high school soccer? In high school each team has a couple good players and good athletes; in college everyone on the field is very skilled. The biggest difference is you have to be at your top form every game. The intensity and amount of skill required is incredible. The good teams in college aren’t going to mess up in the back. You have to work to create your own opportunities. A lot of time in high school you get goals because the back line messes up or the forward steals the ball from a defender. How does the training in college compare to training in high school? It’s defiantly different.
We didn’t have the best high school team (Salina South) but we had some good players. Most high schoolers aren’t as committed. When it comes to college training everyone was the best player on their high school team. We have to do the drills 100% or everyone will know you’re slacking. It’s a lot more pressure but it makes you work harder and get a lot better. What is your favorite soccer moment or memory from your first season? That’s easy I know that right away. It was preseason and our third scrimmage. We were playing the non-starters vs starters. I was playing center mid for the non-starters. We were down 1-0. I got a pass from about 40 yards out and I took a step with it. Their center mid came in to mark me. I did a step over, broke to my left, and I fired from about 35 yards out with my left foot. It felt really good and I could see the ball just flying. It curved into the top left corner. It hit the back of the net and I went crazy. I remember the keeper standing there flat footed watching the ball go in. What are your future soccer aspirations? Even though there is a low chance I can see myself playing soccer after college. There is a semi pro indoor team that plays maybe 15 minutes from our campus and probably next year I’ll try out for them. I know a couple guys on the team who have made it. I’m going to work on any opportunities I get in the Kansas City area so someday I can hopefully make money playing soccer. Any last words to the soccer world? You can expect Jewell to go to the National Tournament next year. Be looking out for that!

Hull City: The Dream Makers
Happy Fun Music Time! I love these three songs. And Here We Go Again And Advantage Played is back! I had a chance to do some brainstorming and research over break and I’ve come up with some great ideas. I’ve got great articles to read and wonderful music to listen to. Hull City – The Dreams Begin To be a Hull City fan now is to feel glory. Gloom and disappointment have been forgotten. In 1999 Hull City fans were partying, but it was a party that celebrated a season that did just enough not to fail. The fans drank and loved knowing that they would not being going down to the
Football Conference (below the first four tiers of English football). They had just completed a season that is known as their “Great Escape.” When your luck is bad. When the managers are shit. When your only glory is not failing miserably. Then every positive is a reason to celebrate. Little did Hull City fans know that their frenzied celebration was the start of a remarkable turn around that would bring them to the top division of English Football. And What a Good Dream It Was Over the next nine years Hull City made an amazing turn around that most lower division English football fans dream of while stumbling home drunk. With an new commercial director,
Adam Pearson
that gave them financial stability, a
new stadium
in 2002, and quality acquisitions by two head coaches
Peter Taylor
and then
Philip Brown , Hull City fulfilled their fans every dreams. The fans emotions and hopes went from darkest black to the pure light. They were the lucky few, the fans whose dreams came true. The old men with weathered wrinkled faces who had watched every game for fifty years were going to see Hull in the Premier League. They were not going to die perpetual losers. The joys and despair Hull City fans felt are the purest emotions in English football: Patience. Anger. Love. Joy. Hatred. Fulfillment. Self-Prophecy. Love of Money. Hull City has packaged these emotions together and sold them to their fans over the last ten years and they are a brilliant success. Where do they go from here? From Dreams to Nightmares? In the Premiere League, movement is immeasurably slow. The Big Four sit like sandstone giants at the top and look down at the foolish challengers below. They will fall in the end. Nothing stands forever, but it will take time. The years will wear away on the big four like wind, sand, and water carve canyons of immeasurable size. For Hull City, this means progress has slowed to a pace that cannot match the last ten years. UEFA Cup spots, Champions League, winning the Title, all these are goals and mark progress but progress that will take years and years to complete. Can the fans stand the slow emotions and bitterly slow progress that comes with the Premier League? Will the emotions and glories of the Premier League ever match the glory of the last ten years? Maybe relegation isn’t such a bad thing.
