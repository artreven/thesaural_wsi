The
M useum of Natural History  is a  museum  with exhibits about  natural history , including such topics as  animals ,  plants ,  ecosystems ,  geology ,  paleontology , and  climatology . Some museums feature natural history collections in addition to other collections, such as ones related to history, art and science.  Nature centers  often include natural history exhibits too.
Riverside Park  is a scenic waterfront public park on the  Upper West Side  of the borough  of  Manhattan  in  New York City , operated and maintained by the  New York City Department of Parks and Recreation . The park consists of a narrow four-mile (6 km) strip of land between the  Hudson River  and the gently curving rise-and-fall of  Riverside Drive . When the park was first laid out, access to the river was blocked by the right-of-way of the  New York Central Railroad   West Side Line ; later it was covered over with an esplanade  lined with  honey-locusts . Riverside Park also contains part of the  Manhattan Waterfront Greenway  which encircles Manhattan's waterfronts, with car-free bike routes.
he  Beacon Theatre , also known as the  Beacon Theater and Hotel , is an historic  New York City   theater  on upper  Broadway  in  Manhattan . A 2,894-seat, three-tiered  movie palace , it was designed by Chicago architect  Walter W. Ahlschlager  for  motion pictures  and  vaudeville . Today it is one of New York's leading live music and entertainment venues, and controlled by  Madison Square Garden, Inc.
H&H Bagels  is a popular  bagel  company in  New York City , It is the largest bagel manufacturer in New York City and one of the largest bagel manufacturers in the world, producing about 80,000 bagels a day.
The business was started in 1972 when Helmer Toro and his brother in law Hector Hernandez (hence "H&H") bought Midtown Bagels at Broadway  and 80th Street for $5,000 in cash and $50,000 in a loan (with the new name derived from their first names). Toro eventually assumed full control of the business. [ 1 ]
In 1993 it moved its bakery to 46th Street at  12th Avenue  in  Hell's Kitchen  although its primary storefront remains on the  Upper West Side .
H&H Bagels are  Hechsher  certified  Kosher  and  Pareve  by Kof-K.
Zabar's  is a specialty food store at 2245 Broadway and 80th Street, on the  Upper West Side  of Manhattan  in  New York City , founded by Louis Zabar. It is one of the best known commercial landmarks of the neighborhood, and is known for its selection of  bagels ,  smoked fish ,  olives , and  cheeses  (see appetizing store ). Zabar's is frequently referenced in popular culture; it is mentioned in the  1998  film You've Got Mail , the 2009 TV series  V  and episodes of  Will & Grace ,  Dream On ,  Mad About You ,  Sex and the City ,  The Nanny ,  Seinfeld ,  The West Wing ,  Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip ,  30 Rock ,  The Daily Show , and  Castle .
