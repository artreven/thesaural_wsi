hip-hop
as an agent for social change. [4]
Marable was also a member of the New York Legislature’s Amistad Commission, created to review state curriculum regarding the slave trade. [5]
It was reported in June 2004 by activist group

Malcolm X biography
Marable’s biography of Malcolm X has attracted criticism. Karl Evanzz, the author of

University of Chicago
professor Michael Dawson defended Marable’s biography stating Marable had “precisely focused on some of the critical central questions confronting black and progressive politics.” [11]
Author and journalist Herb Boyd stated he found as many as 25 significant errors in the book, some of which he described as “absolutely egregious”. [12]

Edward Stobart, British haulage contractor and entrepreneur , died he was 56.
Edward Stobart
was a
British
haulage company owner
who first became involved with his father’s company aged 15 in 1969, and subsequently expanded it into one of the UK’s most well known multimodal logistics companies,
Stobart Group .Stobart died on 31 March 2011 in a
Coventry
hospital of what was termed ‘heart problems’.
(21 November 1954 – 31 March 2011)
Stobart initially took over his father Eddie’s company that had started in
Cumbria
as a local company that delivered
fertilizer
and grew it into a road transport and warehousing company. In 2004 he sold the company to his brother William [6]
and took over a
Midlands -based company that built lorry trailers [7]
but that company failed in 2009.
Stobart’s funeral service took place on 9 April at
Carlisle Cathedral , followed by a private burial. [8] [9]
He is survived by his second wife Mandy and their two children, Stobart also had 4 adopted children from his first marriage to Sylvia. [10]
Bosko “The Yugo” Radonjich
( Serbian : Бошко Радоњић,
Boško Radonjić ; 17 May 1943 – 31 March 2011) was a
Serbian
nationalist and later leader of
the Westies , a predominantly
Irish-American
gang based in New York’s
Hell’s Kitchen .
Early life
Radonjich was born in 1943 in
Užice . Bosko’s father Dragomir, a teacher, was captured and executed during
World War II
by the
Josip Broz Tito ‘s
Partisans
for his belonging to the
Chetniks
led by general
Draža Mihailović . Stigmatized as a son of a royalist Chetnik soldier, Radonjich grew up in communist Yugoslavia under Tito.
In his late twenties, Radonjich fled the country and immigrated to the United States in 1970. Physically leaving Yugoslavia was no easy task for a person of his family background and he used a friendship with
Red Star Belgrade
footballer
Milovan Đorić
(also a son of a fallen Chetnik) to achieve this. Đorić snuck Radonjich onto the team bus headed for
Graz , which allowed him to get across the border. [1]
After some time in
Austria , Radonjich went to
Italy
before immigrating to the United States.
American years
Once in America, Radonjich settled in
Hell’s Kitchen
area of
Manhattan
in
New York City . He also joined the Serbian Homeland Liberation Movement (SOPO), an anti-communist and terrorist organization headed by
Nikola Kavaja . Sharing royalist and anti-communist views, the two men became life-long friends. [2]
Already known to Yugoslav state security
UDBA , Radonjich’s activities began to be monitored even more closely by its agents.
In 1975, Radonjich took part in a bombing at the Yugoslav mission to the
United Nations
in which no one was hurt. In 1978, he pled guilty to conspiracy charges in the 1975 bombing of a Yugoslavian consul’s home and for plotting to bomb a Yugoslav social club, both in
Chicago .
Upon his release in 1982, Radonjich moved back to
New York ‘s West Side and began working as a minor associate of
Jimmy Coonan . Radonjich was able to seize control of the gang following the imprisonment of many of the Westies leadership during the late 1980s. Under his leadership, he was able to reestablish the Westies’ former working relationship with the
Gambino crime family
under
John Gotti , and was involved in the jury tampering during Gotti’s original 1986 trial for
racketeering .
He supervised Westie underling
Brian Bentley ‘s highly successful burglary ring using two Hispanic gang members until the arrest of Bentley and his group in the early 1990s. Later investigations under Michael G. Cherkasky, chief of the Investigations Division of the District Attorney’s Office, would eventually force Radonjich to flee the United States for good in 1992 to avoid prosecution.
Back in Serbia
Since 1990 Radonjich had already spent a lot of time in Serbia, mostly dividing his time between
Belgrade
where he owned a night club named Lotos in Zmaj Jovina Street and
Mount Zlatibor
where he owned a casino named Palisade and where he also later built a casino named Club Boss located at
Kraljeve Vode .
As the
Bosnian War
broke out, Radonjich became a close adviser to
Radovan Karadžić , the
Bosnian Serb
leader charged with war crimes (on the run from 1996 until 2008), whom Radonjich described in a 1997
Esquire
article penned by Daniel Voll as: “My angel, my saint.” Due to Zlatibor’s close proximity to the Bosnian border, Radonjich also helped the Serbian war effort by providing funds for weapons and equipement as well as by arranging for soldiers to rehabilitate and rest. Throughout this time Radonjich maintained links with Serbian state security service (renamed from UDBA to SDB after the dissolution of SFR Yugoslavia) and its chief
Jovica Stanišić
with whom he shared a friendship. During autmn 1995, Radonjich was involved in the release operation of two French pilots who were shot down over Bosnia by the
Republika Srpska Army
and held captive for more than a month. [3]
1999 arrest in Miami
Though based in the Balkans, Radonjich frequently travelled abroad, especially to
Caribbean
and
South American
destinations. During one such trip in late December 1999 after almost a decade spent in the former
Yugoslavia , Radonjich was arrested by U.S. custom officials in
Miami, Florida . Actually, he was on a plane from Europe to
Cuba
for New Year’s celebration, but after learning that Radonjich is on the passanger list,
FBI
got the plane to be re-routed to Miami where he got arrested in spectacular manner as the entire aiport got shut down.
Held without bail, he was tried under a 1992 indictment for jury tampering in Gotti’s racketeering trial. The charges against Radonjich were dropped shortly after because the key witness in his case, Gotti’s former Underboss turned FBI-informant
Salvatore “Sammy the Bull” Gravano , was charged with drug related offenses while in the
Witness Protection Program . Radonjich was freed in March 2001. He immediately left the United States and went back to former Yugoslavia. In subsequent interviews Radonjich claimed FBI had ulterior motives for persecuting and harrasing him:
“
In
the late 1980s I found out through my sources that FBI along with the
Justice Department
is preparing to arrest and put on trial the boss of bosses John Gotti.
Unfortunatelly for me, only three people in America at that moment were
allowed to have this piece of information – the
federal prosecutor , the
FBI director ,
and the
US Attorney General . In
order to protect this
classified information , FBI
decided to arrest me, so I had to leave America and seek refuge in
Yugoslavia. Because of this they issued an arrest warrant for me based on
which they organized my kidnapping on 31 December 1999 in Miami . [4]
”
During spring 2003 following the
assassination
of Serbian Prime Minister
Zoran Đinđić , Radonjich was arrested and questioned as part of
Operation Sablja , a wide-sweeping police action initiated by the Serbian authorities under the state of emergency. After spending three days in prison, Radonjich was released. He died following a brief illness in
Belgrade, Serbia
on 31 March 2011. [5]
In popular culture
In the
1998 made-for-TV movie
Witness to the Mob , a very loose
depiction of the life of Sammy the Bull, Radonjich is played by Stephen
Payne.
Niko
Bellic , the main character of
Grand Theft Auto IV , may have been
inspired by Radonjich – both are Serbian criminals with ties to Italian
and Irish mafias.
