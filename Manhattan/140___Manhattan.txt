LANGUAGE OF ONE P.XII
UGANDA SKY
"SORROW TEARS AND BLOOD"-
FELA KUTI
"The African country of Uganda has had a turbulent history in the 20th century, and music has been an integral part of the nation's development.
The first form of music genre in Uganda was kadongo kamu (single guitar). Top artists in Uganda include Jose Chameleon (heavy weight), Bebe Cool locally called Munene Munene, Bobi Wine who is called ghetto president, Radio and Weasel (also operating as Goodlyfe Crew), another sammie e with an exceptional talent, Ragga Dee and Madoxx Ssematimba, Babaluku and The Bataka Squad founders of Luga Flow which promotes rapping in your mother tongue. These artists are also doing well on the international scene." -

BREAKING: 1/4 OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF HIP-HOP
Monday gives the picture of a stream: healing waters of culture in the midst of conflict. I personally hold the U.S as the "breadbasket of pop-culture"; knowing every style and genre of music had and has global effect, the highlight is when a movement aids, or empowers a people. Bouncing cats is one example. This movement bears reflection of my brother, Joel baptiste, CEO of negusworld enterprises, who started this clothing line/movement for the self-actualization/empowerment of a people globally:

MUSIC IS LIFE P. XIII: CONSCIOUS VS. COMMERCIALISM(THE PRELUDE)
"CASA DE MUSICA"- NNEKA "Popular music belongs to any
musical genres
"having wide appeal", [1]
and stands in contrast to
art music , [2] [3] [4]
and
traditional music
which was disseminated orally. [2] [3] [4]
Although popular music sometimes is known as " pop music ", the two terms are not interchangeable. Popular music is a generic term for music of all ages that appeals to popular tastes"; [5]
on the other hand, pop music usually refers to a specific
musical genre ." "Conscious hip hop or socially conscious hip-hop is a sub-genre of
hip hop
that focuses on
social issues . It is not necessarily overtly political, but it discusses social issues and conflicts. Themes of conscious hip hop include
religion , aversion to
violence , African American culture and advancement, the
economy , or simple depictions of life in the
projects / ghetto
that reveal the struggle of ordinary people.
Grandmaster Flash 's " The Message " was an early and hugely influential political and conscious hip hop track, decrying the poverty, violence, and dead-end lives of the black youth of the time."- Wikipedia Thursday hosts the prelude to an exclusive blog feature: "CONSCIOUS VS. COMMERCIALISM"; 1/3 part of a U.P.G blog series called "CONTEMPLATION AND RESISTANCE" (Authors Zion Antoni and Cesar "Yedeed" Espinoza). Contemplation and resistance is a blog series that moves in the train of thought to simply "stop, look, and think" at a present situation or circumstance. Conscious vs. commercialism takes a brief view in the contrasts between the two. We start with a video on the reflection of the messages exchanged in pop music, and cultural influence, featuring today's leading figures. With this.. we conclude with the official "Contemplation and Resistence" series:(click link)

MUSIC IS LIFE P. XII : SIDEWALK PROPHETS
"THE EXTENSION OF A MAN"- DONNY EDWARD HATHAWAY Monday opens in reflection to yesteryear-and its relation to the present. A retrospective look at some of the socio-political issues of race, economy and black america. Revolutionary movements and collectives of the late 60's, and reflections of the african diaspora at this time brought about pro-black consciousness; mainly through culture(blaxploitation films, music etc.), foreign relations(war), socio-political ills and race relations. This era is one of the biggest influences and inspirations to modern day artists ie: common, lupe fiasco, mos def, jill scott: -Below are two features, one of the icons of soul and social consciousness, Gil Scott Heron and the legendary "Last poets" ; a report and documentry on the voices who raised awareness for that and the coming generations: -We close with the movements of a group of whom they regard themselves as the "Little brother" of the late 80's early 90's hip hop groups. The north carolina collective takes you into their world of beats rhymes and life. THEE URBANPRIESTHOOD GROUP LLC 2010.

LANGUAGE OF ONE P.XI: ASIAN TOUNGUE
"ONE MORE MORNING"
-RITA ANDERSON MARLEY
"Since the end of the 20th century, pop music in mainland China started to become more popular. Especially at the start of the 21st century, Mainland Chinese artists have started producing a wide range of mandarin pop songs along with many new albums.
Many mainland Chinese, Taiwanese and Hong Kong artists performed for the promotion of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Hip hop and rap
Main articles: Chinese rap, Hong Kong hip hop, Taiwanese hip hop
Mandarin rap music gradually became popular in mainland China, especially in Shanghai and Beijing where pop culture is very diverse and modern. Although Chinese perform rap in different dialects and languages, most Chinese hip hop artists perform in China's most popular language: Mandarin.
Cantonese rap is also very diverse in cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Mandarin rap music has also been popular in Taiwan." -

Language of one: thursday hosts the east as another face of hip hop's global front. Language of one series of the A.L.I.H.S.T blogspot also challenges the unfortunate reality of people, races and nationality's stained with stereotypes; exceptionally in america socialogically, and through mass media. Tonight's blog along with chinese culture and mandarin heritage, gives insight to the east, spoken through the universal language of music:

THE ARCHIVE P.VI : JAZZ: AMERICAN CLASSICAL MUSIC
“It is an honor to be here.” Sonia Sanchez " By 1808 the
Atlantic slave trade
had brought almost half a million
Africans
to the United States. The slaves largely came from
West Africa
and brought strong tribal musical traditions with them. [16]
Lavish festivals featuring African dances to drums were organized on Sundays at Place Congo, or
Congo Square , in
New Orleans
until 1843, as were similar gatherings in
New England
and
New York . African music was largely functional, for work or ritual, and included
work songs
and
field hollers . The African tradition made use of a single-line melody and
call-and-response
pattern, but without the European concept of harmony. Rhythms reflected African speech patterns, and the African use of pentatonic scales led to
blue notes
in blues and jazz." "The origin of the word jazz is one of the most sought-after
word origins
in modern
American English .[ citation needed ] The word's intrinsic interest—the
American Dialect Society
named it the
Word of the Twentieth Century —has resulted in considerable research, and its history is well-documented. The word began as West Coast
slang
around 1912, the meaning of which varied but did not refer to music or sex. It came to refer to the music in
Chicago
around 1915. The music was played in New Orleans prior to that time but was not referred to by that name." -
Wikipedia One of the greatest genre's of music in the african diaspora, Jazz, in its many forms. Late jazz historian, and a friend of my mine and teacher Harrison Riddley Jr. who tuaght at temple university,once spoke and said "jazz should be rated as traditional as classical music that have its origins in europe, due its legacy and longevity" : -The list of american jazz greats is seemingly endless. Harrison once stated that the institutionalized slavery of africans is one of the worst; but here post 21st century from then the greatest genre's of music and artists issued out from the african diaspora, from soul, bebop, jazz, and ultimately hip-hop. We close this brief archive spot tonight with a throwback of one of the greatest..and one of my favorites; a late 60's performance of "Favorite things" by the late philly native John Coltrane.

MUSIC IS LIFE P.XI : THE LOST BOROUGH:Y.O.
“Don't Waste Your Time,”
- Mary J. Blige
"Yonkers is the fourth most populous
city
in the state of
New York
(behind
New York City ,
Buffalo
and
Rochester ), and the most populous city in
Westchester County , with a population of 196,086 (according to the 2000 census), and an estimated 2008 population of 201,588. [3]
Yonkers borders the
New York City
borough of
The Bronx
and is 2 miles (3 km) north of
Manhattan
at the city's two respective closest points."
-Wikipedia
"Ayo, yonkers is the lost boro" a sentiment spoken to me by a friend which is also a native. A region that graced the industry and world on international level. Music is life abroad.. especially in the city of yonkers: "Yonkers is struggling to overcome its violent image. This violent image of Yonkers has been endorsed largely through hip-hop culture. Many hip-hop songs can be found where crime and violence in Yonkers is praised. Many neglect to realize that almost all of this crime in its entirety takes place in the Southwest section of the city. Other sections of the city (particularly the eastern side) are, in fact, wealthy neighborhoods with low crime rates."-
Wikipedia
" B, yonkers is L.A without the colors"
-
expressed in music, arts and entertainment is the struggles and issues of a city; even in politics. Four years ago yonkers native Victor Earl ran for mayor; someone who has come through the rites and passage of the social ills, and sought to establish reform in the city, and proggressive change among the youth. Figures in the industry, as D Blocks Styles P holds on to social consciousness of his hometown, and the black and latino diaspora's under the umbrella of the urban plight. My family Jayonez, CEO of up and coming "Moneyshotfilms" film company was there to cacth footage of styles p realease party of his fiction novel "Invincible" in june:
-To close we have behind the scene's footage of Joell Ortiz "Project boy" video narrative..and the official cut..a story too familiar amongst america's inner cities.

MUSIC IS LIFE P. X: PHILLY: THE SOCIO-LANDSCAPE
"Seize the Time.”
-Bobby Seale
" Out of the ten most populous cities in the United States in 2006, Philadelphia had the highest homicide rate at 27.7 per 100,000 people, though the number of murders decreased to 392 in 2007. [75]
In 2004, there were 7,513.5 crimes per 200,000 people in Philadelphia. [76]
In 2005, Philadelphia was ranked by
Morgan Quitno
as the sixth-most dangerous among 32 American cities with populations over 500,000. [77]
Among its neighboring Mid-Atlantic cities in the same population group,
Baltimore
and
Washington, D.C.
were ranked second- and third-most dangerous cities in the United States, respectively, and
Camden ,
New Jersey , a city across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, was ranked as the most dangerous city in the United States. [78]
In 2008, Camden was the second-most dangerous city in the country, lower than its 2004 ranking, but still high for a city its size, while Philadelphia was ranked 22nd. [79] "
The statistics rage in the one of the most cultural ediface's of the east coast. Music is life hosts philly..taking insight through the voices told by the diamonds in the rough:
- Controversial, even in the midst of the city's current situation, the brightest jewel's still shine. In the population of the city, notably between the african, and latino diaspora's, in the city's darkest hour, the consciousness of the people are opening, for collective survival. Proggressively conscious of the need for social change. The awareness is raised through legendary groups like the roots. Peep how i got over..a call/cry still relevant.

The mindset of social activism challenges the ills of a society, starting with the community. July opens with the principles, and themes of social activism; specifically in the movements of accomplished public figures who sow their gifts and talents back into the betterment of communities, whether financially, musically, or through means of education : "The Common Ground Foundation is dedicated to the empowerment and development of urban youth in the United States. The Common Ground Foundation was created by Hip Hop artist, actor and children’s author Lonnie Rashid Lynn, known as “Common”. Common’s social-conscience message serves as inspiration for equality, opportunity and hope among youth in underserved communities. The Foundation is committed to empowering youth in urban neighborhoods and providing life skills needed to achieve their dreams."- http://www.commongroundfoundation.org/ -One Example, Followed by Ilana weaver(Invincible), who was recently featured on the politically conscious show "Democracy Now", who explains her movements in detroit's inner city's: -We close with Brooklyn artist Blitz the Ambassdor's latest effort featuring an innovative music ensemble: "Remembering the future" THEE URBANPRIESTHOOD GROUP LLC 2010 Post Scripts: New single by Zion Antoni realeased 7/5/10: "Fatimah" and Ani(beautifull).
