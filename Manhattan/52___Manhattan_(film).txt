The
Star Wars
cutaway in the opening is a recreation of a similar scene in
Curb Your Enthusiasm , complete with theme music. The scene is especially reminiscent of one in the
Curb
episode “Krazee Eyez Killa.”
The name of Peter’s film,
Steel Vaginas , is a play on the title of the film
Steel Magnolias .
The scene where Brian continually tells Stewie “It’s not your fault” recreates the same scene in
Good Will Hunting .
Chester Cheetah
smashes his hand through the glass table, stating “It ain’t easy bein’ cheesy,” a slogan from his commercials in the 1990s.
Several
Woody Allen
films are referenced: the scene where Stewie and Olivia are people watching is similar to a scene in
Annie Hall
in which Allen and Diane Keaton make similar quips about people walking by. Victor, who is voiced to sound just like Alan Alda, is a parody of that actor’s character as a pompous writer in
Crimes and Misdemeanors . The scene where they’re sitting under a bridge is a parody of
Manhattan .
While at the restaurant with Brian, Jillian and Olivia, Stewie states "Sorry we're late, everyone, but JonBenét here took forever with her makeup."
He refers to
JonBenét Ramsey , an American child beauty pageant queen made famous by her murder and the subsequent media coverage.
Stewie makes a reference to the Don McLean song “American Pie” while talking to Brian with "Drove my Chevee to the Levy but the levy was Bri".
The chick flick that Lois and Peter go to see takes place at “Barncliff School for Girls,” a play on the women’s colleges Barnard and Radcliffe.
