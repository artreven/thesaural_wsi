Birdbooker Report 190
Books to the ceiling,
Books to the sky, My pile of books is a mile high. How I love them! How I need them! I'll have a long beard by the time I read them.

Compiled by Ian "Birdbooker" Paulsen, the
Birdbooker Report
is a weekly report listing the wide variety of nature, natural history, ecology, animal behaviour, science and history books that have been newly released or republished in North America and in the UK. The books listed here were received by Ian during the previous week, courtesy of various publishing houses.

Five Darwins to the Watt
The new £50 note, with enhanced security features, celebrates the renowned 18th century business partnership of entrepreneur Matthew Boulton and engineer James Watt. Photograph: Bank of England/PA
Normally, I don't talk about money, except when I am wondering aloud where the cash in my pocket went to, but this is special. If you are one of the lucky few who live in the UK, you should know that the Bank of England is introducing a new £50 bank note on 2 November 2011. What makes this bank note special is that it will feature not one, but
two scientists : Matthew Boulton and James Watt.

Gallium
Crystals of 99.999% gallium.

Dmitri Mendeleev predicted the existence of Gallium -- which he referred to as
"eka-aluminium" -- a few years before it was first discovered, and even correctly predicted several of its properties, all based on its position in his new discovery, the Periodic Table of the Elements.
When I first learned about Gallium, I thought its name was somehow connected with chickens because their scientific name is
Gallus gallus . I later learned that I was wrong, and then even later than that, I learned I might have been correct all along. Well, maybe. In fact, Gallium comes from the Latin word,
Gallia
(gaul), which refers to France, the homeland of the man who discovered this element. But it wasn't long before its discoverer, Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, was accused of naming this element after himself, since his family name, "Le coq", is French for "rooster". Of course, Le coq always vigorously denied this association.
Oh, how like a rooster! In this video, The Professor and his colleagues teach us a little about Gallium, and tell us about a breakthrough experiment done by one of their colleagues at the University of Nottingham:

Cancer. Just saying the word strikes fear into many of us. But what would you think if you learned that some cancers are
contagious ? This might sound far-fetched, but a contagious cancer is in fact what is threatening an entire species, the Tasmanian devil,
Sarcophilus harrisii . But one person is leading the fight to save this iconic marsupial. In this video, researcher Elizabeth Murchison tells us what she's learning about all cancers by fighting to save the "Taz", which is critically endangered due to this unusual strain of cancer. Be forewarned: this video has some truly disturbing images of facial cancer.
