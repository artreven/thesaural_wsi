Quivers was born in the Pikesville area of Baltimore, Maryland to Louise Quivers, a homemaker and housekeeper, and Charles Quivers, Sr., a steelworker at Bethlehem Steel. Both parents had only seventh grade educations.She has an older brother, Charles Quivers, Jr. On April 7, 1995, Quivers released her autobiography, Quivers: A Life. She reveals that her father molested her on several occasions when she was a pre-teen. He is now deceased, having suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
Quivers enrolled in the University of Maryland and decided to major in nursing. Her first position after graduating in 1974 was at Maryland Shock Trauma, the shock trauma facility of the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services System. "I was a shock-trauma, intensive care kind of nurse, so I saw unpleasantness all the time," she said. Restlessness however, spurred her to seek opportunities farther afield. Knowing she could use her nursing degree, Quivers joined the United States Air Force in July 1975, initially appointed a Second Lieutenant. She entered active duty on January 11, 1976, promoted to First Lieutenant in six months, and Captain by June 1978. The following month she was discharged, although records show that she remained a member of the U.S. Air Force Reserve, with no active duty, until 1990...
Quivers currently resides in the Manhattan borough of New York City. From the mid-1990s until April 2007, her long-time boyfriend Tony was a man mysteriously referred to on the radio show as "Mr. X." On April 23, 2007, Quivers called in to the Bubba the Love Sponge Show on Howard 101, announcing their separation.
Her personal health and well-being also have been the subject of discussion. In June 2007, Quivers began a strict vegan diet which she says helped to increase her energy and helped her to lose 60 pounds over a six month period.
Quivers has made attempts at many different hobbies including race car driving. Robin claimed she would be a successful racer and even challenged radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge, an experienced driver, to a future race. Quivers eventually competed in the 2007 Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race '07 but was a failure finishing in last place of all drivers to cross the finish line.She took criticism on her radio show but contended she was a success because she didn't wreck, unlike George Lucas who in attempts to win the race wrecked trying to make a pass. Robin has since not talked about racing and her challenge against Bubba the Love Sponge was never brought up again.
In August 2007, comedian Jim Florentine asked Quivers on the air to go on a date with him. Due to the attention this garnered, Quivers became tight-lipped about the topic. On July 28, 2008, Quivers announced on the radio show that she and Florentine had indeed ended their relationship.She stated that the breakup was amicable, that Florentine was "genuine and honest," and that it was he who initiated the break-up.
On March 18, 2009, Dr. Drew Pinsky and Dr. Mark Young administered a narcissism test to members of the show's staff. Quivers, who scored a 34, had the highest score of anyone who had taken the test, with the average celebrity scoring 18. Dr. Young, insisting the results were very real, said "there are seven categories of narcissism, and she scored close to the maximum in every one...higher than 99% of the population.
