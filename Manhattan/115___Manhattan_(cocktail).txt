Feast of the Seven Fishes 2009
This Christmas Eve, we continued our yearly tradition based loosely on the Italian Feast of the Seven Fishes. We don't worry about the exact number of fishes, and we don't limit ourselves to Italian dishes. We just use the holiday as an inspiration to create a multi-course meal centered around fish and shellfish.
We had no real unifying theme this year. Our initial thoughts revolved around a " Mediterranean (both sides) " idea, but we ended up throwing in a bit of the new world as well.
Here's how it played out:
Oysters with Chile de Arbol and Cilantro
Our Christmas Eve feasts have always started out with oysters, and we weren't about to change that this year. This guy is a local Olympia oyster, grown by
Carlsbad Aqua Farm
and purchased from
Bay Park Fish Company . The sauce was made from chile de arbol - whole dried chiles, soaked and then blended with garlic, cilantro and a bit of red wine vinegar.
This is what the oysters looked like pre-shucking (the one pictured above is on the left below, sporting his big barnacle):
The flavor of the oyster was clean and briny, and went well with the hot punch from the chile de arbol. In addition to the Olympia oysters, we also had some Conway Cup and St. Simon oysters for good measure.
Niçoise Tuna Skewers
Kind of a play on a Niçoise Salad. The tuna (Ahi) was salted and then poached confit-style in olive oil that was flavored with garlic, bay leaf and peppercorns. We skewered it with potato and green bean, served it over a bed of lettuce and chopped egg and sauced everything with a vinaigrette. The tuna had fantastic flavor all by itself, and was made even better by the other ingredients.
As you can see, we had fun playing with various platings:
The vinaigrette consisted of oil, white wine vinegar, lemon, Dijon mustard, anchovy and minced shallot and garlic. We don't often make emulsified dressings, but we really enjoyed this one and found ourselves scraping every last morsel of salad from the plate.
Seared Scallops with Spicy Lentils
I was really pleased at how the half-moon presentation of the dish turned out. To be honest, though, I have to credit it more to affordance than inspiration. The simple fact was that the scallops we picked up (also from
Bay Park Fish Company ) were absolutely massive:
Cutting them up seemed the only sensible way to serve them (although we did sear them whole).
In addition, we did a sliced version that also worked really well. There was a great textural contrast between the harder-cooked and caramelized outer slices and the pristine inner slices:
The bright-yellow base underneath the scallop is a hugely aromatic and tasty mixture of red lentils and yellow split peas we often use with fish (you can find the recipe
here ). The flavoring is turmeric, cumin, ginger, lemon and cilantro.
Seafood Paella
This year's way of getting maximum fishes out of a reasonable number of dishes. The fish were shrimp, squid, asari clams, rock cod and lingcod. Some green beans and piquillo peppers rounded out the mix.
We initially under-measured the amount water in the rice which resulted in a longer than ideal cooking time for the seafood. Despite the mishap, it came out looking beautiful and tasting great. It was the first time we've made a seafood paella, but it certainly won't be the last.
So ends another fun, if a bit exhausting, "seven" fish feast. The final tally for this this year was 4 dishes and 8 fishes (10, if you count the varieties of oysters separately).

The Sazerac Cocktail
The Sazerac is my hands-down favorite winter cocktail. Created in New Orleans in the 1830's, it is a delightful concoction of rye whiskey spiked with the complex aromatic flavors of anise liqueur and
Peychaud's bitters
(named for apothecary Antoine Peychaud who came up with both the recipe for the bitters and the cocktail itself).
I first discovered the Sazerac while doing research for a
visit to New Orleans . We planned to try the cocktail at
Napoleon House , but it was closed for a private party and we didn't quite manage to try the drink in its city of origin. In the end, I finally had my first Sazerac later on the same trip at
City House in Nashville . I was an instant fan.
Originally made with cognac, the Sazerac is now made with rye whiskey. I generally use the appropriately named Sazerac Rye which is produced by
Buffalo Trace Distillery
(whose parent conglomerate now also control the Herbsaint and Peychaud's brands). I quite like the stuff, and enjoy it on its own when I'm too lazy to make a cocktail.
My version of the Sazerac is a bit stripped down from the
official recipe . I omit the sugar, and I do not like to use a chilled glass (I have the same preference when making a
Manhattan ).
First up is the
Herbsaint , an anise-flavored liqueur. I add just enough so that I can roll it around to create a coating on the inside of a whiskey glass.
I love the smell of the Herbsaint, and coating the glass with it brings out the aroma and helps it persist after the whiskey is added.
Next, a few drops of Peychaud's bitters:
The ruby-red color of the bitters instantly turn the color of the glass from lime-green to a burnished orange.
Then it is time for the whiskey. I generally pour in around two fingers worth, but I'm not at all fussy about the exact measure. The more whiskey, the less dominant the flavors of the Herbsaint and Peychaud's will be - I use more or less depending on my mood.
Then, it's down the hatch - tongue-tingling and belly-warming.
Cheers, and Happy Holidays!

Beef Short Rib Pot Pie
Who says pot pies have to be made with chicken? We love to take all sorts of savory fillings and encase them in flaky pastry. Most commonly, the filling is leftovers from some sort of braised dish.
A few days ago, we had short ribs for dinner, using
Daniel Boulud's recipe
from the excellent
Café Boulud Cookbook
(we also love the version in
The Balthazar Cookbook ). After a fantastic meal, we still had some of the rich sauce and lovely meat left over. Time for pot pies!
They start with savory shortcrust pastry (we like a mixture of butter and lard for the fat). The bottom crust gets pricked with a fork and par-baked in a 450°F oven for about 10 minutes:
For the filling, we took the already super-flavorful sauce from our leftover short ribs and added in some finely-diced and sautéed onion, carrot, mushroom and celery (with the leaves - don't leave out the leaves). We separately cooked a potato until just tender, and cut it into chunky pieces about the same size as our leftover bits of rib meat.
Then it was on with the pastry top and back into the same 450°F oven for about 15 minutes - until the crust was a beautiful golden brown.
And finally time to dig in:
The contents are always way too hot eat at first, but fortunately you have the top layer of pastry already cooling nicely so that you can flake off bits and dip them in the gravy.
Perfect, decadent winter meal.

Thanksgiving Stuffing Croquettes with a Gravy Center
While we often make a non-standard Thanksgiving meal, this year we did it pretty much straight-up traditional. The leftovers, on the other hand, we've been playing around with a bit.
Case in point, these stuffing croquettes. Think of them as Thanksgiving in a ball. A crispy, fried ball.
We took some leftover stuffing, mixed in some small bits of turkey and formed them into balls.
The gravy center was added to each ball by poking a hole, inserting a gravy "cube" (the gravy was set up well enough at fridge temperatures to be easy to work with) and then re-forming the ball.
They were then  coated in panko:
And fried in oil at a temperature of about 350°F until they were golden brown.
We initially tried a higher temperature, but the outside cooked before the gravy in the middle had time to melt. Although it was difficult to restrain ourselves from eating them straight out of the fryer, we found that it helped to let them rest for a few minutes to let the heat penetrate through.
This is what they came out looking like:
After being cut in half, the gravy oozes out of the center - like a savory take on a molten chocolate cake...
I think we've definitely got a fun new addition to our Thanksgiving leftover repertoire.
