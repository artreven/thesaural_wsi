Crazy Joe Gallo’s last moments in Little Italy
Joseph Gallo , nicknamed “crazy” by fellow mobsters, was a
Red Hook –born gangster specializing in typical 1950s and 1960s mafia activities such as extortion and racketeering.
He was also flamboyant, charming, and well-read, and in the early
1970s
he became kind of a celebrity, hanging out with writers, actors, and other New York scenesters.
Gallo , who was born and raised in the  Red Hook
section of  Brooklyn , was a very colorful character and talkative by nature. In the
1950s
he was nicknamed “ Joey the Blond ” because of his full chest of blond hair. In
1947
after viewing the  Richard Widmark
film  Kiss of Death
Joseph
began to mimic
Widmark ‘s film character, “Tommy Udo” with his drowsy, heavy-lidded appearance and in later years could recite long passages of the movie’s dialogue.
He
secretly owned several nightclubs on
Eighth Avenue
and two  sweat shops
in the  Manhattan
garment district
where forty or fifty women made fabric for dress suits. He ran floating dice and high-stakes card games, an extortion racket and a numbers betting operation from an apartment building on
President Street
in
Brooklyn .
Joey
used kids to deliver and pick up this booty. He allegedly kept a pet lion in the basement of the same address.
In the late
1950s , Gallo tried to overpower  mafia
boss  Joseph Profaci
to take control of the Profaci family. In
May 1961 , several gunmen tried and failed to kill
Gallo . In
1961 , Gallo was convicted of  extortion
and sent to prison for the next ten years. After
Profaci
died of cancer, underboss  Joseph Magliocco
was the new target of the
Gallo
revolt. While incarcerated at  Auburn Correctional Facility
Joseph
was an avid reader of  Jean-Paul Sartre ,  Franz Kafka ,  Albert Camus ,  Alexandre Dumas ,  Victor Hugo ,  Leon Tolstoy ,  Ayn Rand , and his literary role model  Niccolò Machiavelli .
In the early to late
1960s
Gallo
befriended  African-American
youths from  Brooklyn
realizing that there was a lot of money to be made by joining forces. While in prison,
Gallo
already had made numerous connections with black mobsters such as  Nicky Barnes .
Gallo
was one of the first Mafiosi to predict a shift of power in the
Harlem
rackets from the Italian Mafia to black gangs.
Upon his release in
1971 , Gallo started battling family boss  Joe Colombo
and the renamed
Colombo family .
Gallo
was allied with
Carlo Gambino . On
June 28, 1971
Joe Colombo
was shot three times in the head by an African-American posing as a photographer.
Colombo
went into a coma from which he never awoke. The “photographer”, who was immediately shot dead by unknown shooters, was said by authorities to be a
Gallo
associate. However even though the
FBI
and police were taping and photographing the rally, no pictures or film of
Colombo
or his killer being shot has ever been released.
On
April 7, 1972 ,
Gallo
was celebrating his 43rd birthday with sister
Carmella , his wife, her daughter, and his bodyguard,
Peter “Pete the Greek” Diapoulas
at  Umberto’s Clam House
located at 129  Mulberry Street
in  Little Italy ,  Manhattan .
Between seafood courses at least two gunmen burst in through the rear entrance and opened fire with .32 and .38 caliber revolvers.
Gallo
was hit five times, overturning a butcher block dining table to protect his party, then drawing fire away from them by running toward the exit.
Diapoulas , caught by surprise, was shot once in the buttocks as he dove for cover.
Gallo , mortally wounded, stumbled into the street, where he collapsed while his killers sped away in a car.
Apparently
Gallo
thought he was safe there because of an unwritten agreement that
Little Italy
was off-limits to bloodshed.
At his funeral,
Carmella
cried over the open coffin that “ The streets are going to run red with blood, Joey! ”
>>>
Bob Dylan ’s 1976
Desire
album contained the over-11-minute long “Joey” song.
>>   Umberto’s Clam House
has since relocated a few blocks away, on the corner of
Broome
and
Mulberry Streets
