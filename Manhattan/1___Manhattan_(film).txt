Writing Prompts
By Jake  Every serious writer has come face-to-face with writer's block.
It is better to write through it instead of falling prey to this carnivorious roadblock.
Therfore, I have taken it upon myself to provide you with some top-notch writing prompts to hopefully get you unstuck and onto composing a classic novel or novella.
If you use any of these prompts make sure you send them to jake@oneyearintexas.com, unless otherwise noted. Write a suicide note.
Make sure not to actually commit suicide.
This is just a writing prompt. You were on a cruise, but the ship went down.
You were not the captain, therefore you managed to escape death's sweet embrace.
The only albums you have with you are Nine Inch Nails' "Fixed" and "Further Down the Spiral."
Write a review of each album and send the reviews to Glenn. Nobody ever attends your birthday party.
Instead of wallowing in self-pity or committing suicide, imagine what it would be like to celebrate with friends, that is if you had any. Pretend you believe in God.
Imagine the outrageous adventures you would have at church and in Christian bookstores. Imagine that you live in the United States of America.
Write five paragraphs on why you are an American patriot.
Really strech your imagination. You own an amusement park based on the fanastic adventures of Might Mouse, the first super hero/mouse.
Wirte a shore essay about what food you would serve to the patrons of your park and explain how it fits into the park's theme.

One Week In Entertainment
By Katy Hello everyone! Glenn is busy doing a sit-in at Ground Zero to support New Yorker's right to kosher, veggie hot dogs, so I'm taking over entertainment this week. I'm really excited. I actually loathe celebrity gossip, current events, political scandals, and popular culture all at once, but I plan on getting pretty into it today. Shit has gotten fairly ill. ICP FANS BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF TILA TEQUILA Some crazy-stupid PR agent thought it would be p henomenal if MySpace and destroyer-of-outspoken-sexual-freedom "star" Tila Tequila sang at a concert in Illinois with The Kottonmouth Kings and ICP. If that isn't a set up for intolerance and violence I don't know what is. But since it
was
a set up for intolerance and violence, over 2,000 ICP fans pelted Tila with beer bottles, rocks, and even " took the sh*t out of the port-o-potty and threw sh*t and piss at [her] when [she] was onstage ." Violent J of ICP isn't particularly empathetic since he warned her there were rumors about mass violence. But he did say he was disappointed in the crowd's reaction, boldly and intelligently stating, " I wish they didn’t throw stuff at her ." RAPE IS BAD...and easy If you slept until 11AM today (12PM Eastern time/10AM Mountain Time/9AM Pacific Time) then you missed
Wikileaks
founder Julian Assange being accused, warranted, and acquited of rape and sexual molestation charges all within four hours. I wish my rape charges were so easily discarded. WILL SHE NEVER LEARN?! Kourtney Kardashian has been rumored to make the statement that she will "probably have another baby" with partner Scott. If you've been
Keeping Up with the Kardashians
as much as I have, you'll know Kourtney's family (especially her mom and sister, Khloe) loathe Scott Disick with the fire of a thousand burning temples. I think we'll all be pretty interested to see how the fifth season turns out. "EITHER DO ANOTHER REALITY SHOW WITH ME OR I'M GOING TO RELEASE AMAZING SEXUAL CONTENT." While I've made that statement several times to various lovers, this time the sentiment is coming from Spencer Pratt as a love token to estranged wife, Heidi Montag. I didn't even know these two people got married. I didn't realize they were having problems. But I had certainly assumed they made a sex tape together that Spencer was hoping to one day hold it over Heidi's head when the possibility of becoming unimportant finally hit him. Actually,
Spencer literally told TMZ
that Heidi was aware that his one and only goal in life being to get famous off reality television (and quite frankly, sex tapes are pretty real). He met her at a hotel to hand off her dogs and verbally held her captive while he sadly pled his case. It's people like Spencer and Heidi that make me hoe I never understand love. TWEET, TWEET, BITCHEZ Once upon a time, Ashton Kutcher ruled the celebrity Twitter netways. Then, *BOOM*, Britney Spears stepped in and stole his spotlight the way she stole Justin Timberlake's virginity, and not unlike American Muslims are stealing our ex-Burlington Coat Factories to build their worship temples. Now, a new Tweet Queen is stepping up: Lady "Tweet Tweet" Gaga. According to
People Magazine
online, the pop diva herself has taken back Twitter, "besting Spears by approximately 6,000 followers." I challenge each and every OYIT reader to grab the title out from under Lady Gaga's questionable private parts. By this time next week, One Week in Entertainment better be about YOU. And that's about all the insanity I think we can handle for this week in entertainment. Go and get some followers!

KTz Movie Preview Reviewz [August 20, 2010]
By Katy
Prepare yourself for one of my longest movie review articles to date. It's sweeps weekend at the theatre! Lottery Ticket
(Rated PG-13 for the sheer societal strain of opening your eyes to life. Life on the street). My Synopsis : Bow Wow (formally Little Bow Wow of Little Bow Wow fame) stars in this delightful hollywood romp about a young man named Kevin Carson who wins the lottery. He wins $370 million to be more specific, but due to a three-day weekend, he has to dodge neighbors, friends, and local vagrants before he can cash in and be a true Lord of the Ghetto. Oh, did I forget to mention that? Kevin is from the projects. Therefore, the needs of his brethern are greater and more immediate than if this took place in Naperville, IL. Come and enjoy mocking the pain and misery of the poor and underprivelaged everywhere. My Take : The very fact that this movie stars a kid whose net worth was already in the millions by his teens is enough to leave me feeling broken and alone. If Ice Cube wasn't in this movie, I wouldn't even offer it a second glance. However, Ice Cube is in this movie and other than the second glance I'm offering it to give you my take on it, I don't care for this one bit. First of all, I refuse to pay my local theatre's ticket price of $9.75 to see almost anything, even movies I actually might enjoy. If I can't afford $10 for entertainment once a month, why would I want to watch someone happen into $370 mil? The answers is: I don't. Second, I don't care to watch a bunch of people wish they also had $370 million dollars. Third, I wish I had $370 million dollars, or at least $10 to go see a decent movie. Nanny McPhee Returns
(Rated PG for glorifying magic; the devil's way in). My Synopsis : Nanny McPhee is pretty much the new-aged Mary Poppins, but she uses her magic far more often and it's more physical and straight-forward than the slight charms and tricks of her former. While Nanny McPhee previously tackled the Brown family, she now moves on to the Green family, mothered by Isabel (Maggie Gyllenhaal). With her husband off to war, Isabel is left to tend the family farm and given woman's inability to tackle work AND raise a family, Nanny McPhee steps in to whip those children into shape. My Take : I think I caught a few bits and pieces of the original
Nanny McPhee
on ABC Family one night, but I barely remember anything about it other than I think she starts off super hideous and becomes prettier as the children learn from her? So, it's basically an excellent metaphor for life. I like Maggie Gyllenhaal
and
Emma Thompson quite a bit, but I think this movie is twelve years too late for my enjoyment. Piranha 3-D
(Rated R for unpleasant fish violence). My Synopsis : I was hoping this was a remake of the 1978
Piranha , a movie I became fascinated with after finding it on IMDB two minutes ago. Unfortunately, it seems to follow the exact same concept (pirahna's tearin fools UP) but at Lake Victoria rather than Lost River Lake. The "pirahnas" in the movie are referred to in the IMDB synopsis as "prehistoric monsters," so more aptly, these are megapirahnas, an extinct breed once found in Argentina (according to
Wiki ). People done get eaten. My Take : Alexandre Aja directs this movie, the same gentlemen whose brillance fueled the thriller
The Hills Have Eyes . Therefore, the only conclusion I can surely make about this movie is that megapirahnas are continuously raping teenaged girls...in 3D. The film also stars Richard Dreyfuss and Christopher Lloyd (who isn't dead yet!) so while the acting may be tolerable, I cannot abide the rape of my mind by archaic fish. The Switch
(Rated PG-13 for crimes against God and mankind by exploiting unnatural insemination). My Synopsis : Kassie (Jennifer Aniston) and Wally (Jason Bateman) are two good friends who share laughter, joy, and an accidental baby. Scratch that. The baby isn't accidental... completely. Perhaps I should start again. Kassie is a single woman whose biological clock has ticked past noon. She finds a sperm donor and via the classy use of a turkey baster, prepares to impregnante herself. But whoops! Due to a drunken, fluke of a disaster, I BELIEVE Wally spills sperm all over the bathroom and rather than scoop it all back up, he refills the jar himself. The two must deal with this misconceieved chid seven years later when Wally finally comes clean and apologizes for the neurotic mess of a kid he left with Kassie. My Take : Apparently, this is partially adapted from a short story Jeffrey Eugenides wrote? Eugenides is, of course, the author behind best-selling novels
The Virgin Suicides
and
Middlesex , both dealing with fairly effed up children. Eugenides connection with the movie is the only thing I can see that gives it some merit, otherwise, I am completely uninterested. Vampires Suck
(Rated PG-13 for being awful, but also for "teen partying" which I find amusing). My Synopsis : This is another spoof "comedy" from Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the jerks that did all those
Scary Movie s and
Date Movie
and everything else that's wrong with the world. It revolves around the
Twilight
Saga and focuses on being uninteresting and unoriginal; popular movie with some added popular music and popular fads and fart noises. The perfect formula for a blockbuster hit. You're pathetic, America. My Turn
I'm clearly no giant fan of the
Twilight
movies, but that doesn't justify the destruction of parady and satire that Friedberg and Seltzer keep raining on the world. It's like when Alanis Morisette marred my generation's ability to understand what "irony" truly is.
Vampires Suck
is the black fly in my Chardonnay. * * * * * Eclipse
review will be posted this week! It's all for you, Maddie, kitten, and Ashlee!

Good Morning Brains
By Keelin  Good morning, brains. Congratulations -- you are the only organ in the human body that can read and enjoy OYIT (pending FDA approval of the new consciousness-enhancing drug for spleens). It's been a week of shocking news for the body's third most important part. For all you aimless
twenty-somethings , we learned that your listless, pathetic ways aren't your fault but simply a function of cortical development. So don't feel bad the next time your parents pay your rent and you spend the day reading Craigslist Missed Connections. It's what your brain wants!
We also learned that
football
is bad for your brain, a fact you can confirm by attending your high school reunion and finding out what your school's former quarterback is up to. Today's Brain Forecast Keep your head warm -- brains hate the cold! Oh, wait, your brain has no nerve endings, so it can't sense temperature or pain. In that case, do whatever you want. Today's Brain Fact "Experts" say we may be able to
reverse engineer
a human brain by the year 2020! The first brain we'll try to re-create? Famed reality show personality Kim Kardashian. Today's Famous Brain After the death of noted Soviet leader and premature baldy Vladimir Lenin, scientists removed his brain to examine it for signs of genius. Which is exactly what they found, if by "genius" you mean "neurosyphilis." Today's Brain Prediction No matter how many artificial improvements you make to your brain, your neighbor will still beat you at Settlers of Catan.

Hi Katy [Volume II, Issue XVII]
By Katy  Hi Katy, I am now in the hunt for an apartment. Don't worry - I always eat an apartment after I kill it lol. Anyway, do you have any tips for this? I don't want to have to live with a lot of people, but I also don't want to be paying a shitload of money for a place I promise I will never even go to the bathroom in. -Arnie the Apartment Hunter Hi Arnie, It seems the time of year for new apartmenting. I've already enlisted myself as an executive apartment finder for TWO people in the last two weeks. These are two people who look at a computer and shutter. Then cry. Then look at me and panic. The idea of finding an apartment, to
these
people, involves: 1.) Going outside. 2.) Talking to people in person. 3.) Filling out PAPER applications (I know, right? Just wait...) 4.) PHYSICALLY ENTERING the building of the gas/electric company to sign up for an account. 5.) Paying their friends in beer and pizza to help them move in. Painfully archaic, isn't it? These saps are probably also the people using their car phones to call 411 and check the price of a pair of "slacks" at Sears. But you, Arnie, are clearly ahead of the game. You e-mailed me this question so I know your knowledge of computer usage isn't completely lacking. However, what sort of apartment you're looking for and why you're going to eat it is sort of out of my realm of helpitude here. I deal in pretty traditional 1-4 bdrm apartment pursuits and have thus far not run across the fabled "gingerbread house" of apartment complexes. What you should probably do is really think about the apartment you want, perhaps mention that having a toilet on the premises is a strict waste of square footage, and put an ad on Craigslist under the housing section titled: WANTED: SINGLE CELLED, PADDED WALLS, DAILY FOOD DELIVERY, NO FUCKING TOILET--IMMEDIATE AVAILABILITY You'll get some kind of hit I'm sure. Hello "Katy," I've noticed that your advice resembles Ann Landers's advice column ( http://www.creators.com/advice/classic-ann-landers.html ). Have you been stealing from the greatest gift god gave to the world? -Wondering Wendy Hello "Wendy," How dare you... No. How FUCKING dare you not only insinuate that
I
would steal advice, vehicles, personal data, bank information, or literary stylings from "Ann Landers," but you have the goram gall to
link
me to her advice column as if I wasn't thoroughly knowledgeable and aware of one of the most influential predecessors of my field. Don't think for a second I haven't run into "Ann Landers" at advice column workshops. Workshops
I
teach, and "Ann Landers" attends. That's right. Who is stealing what from whom now? "Ann Landers" can't even use a computer, did you know that? And not because Ruth Crowley is fucking dead, but because Esther Lederer was so busy orchestrating the murder of Madalyn Murray O'Hair that she never got around to a keyboarding class. I
created
advice columns. Did your "Ann Landers" tell you that? Did you know prior to my birth in 1932, females were banned from giving advice or any kind; even if it was about the most successful way to roll out the topping of an apple pie? I bet you didn't. I bet you could learn a lot from attending one of my workshops. I bet you'd be better off
wondering
somewhere else you trollop-y slutbag. hi k8eee, its kitten again. did u watch teen choice awards they were pretty kewl lol. gossip girl 1 best tv thing is it good? ive never seen it. do u agree wit da winners? kitt Hi kitten, I haven't had television for two years, and I haven't watched the
Teen Choice Awards
since never, so I can definitely say with some satisfaction and certainty that I did not catch the event this year, though the front page of my local paper had quite a write up on the scene that took place between Zac Efron and Justin Bieber. If I remember correctly, Efron was quoted as yelling out at the end of Bieber's preformance saying, "Yo, Justin. You suck, man. Also, you're kind of feminine and your music is only mildly catchy!" Efron was then seen running from the venue muttering, "I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am. I'll give it all I got, that is my plan. Realize on what I lost, You know you can." Then there was some run over into how Chicagoians are ruining Iowa, but that's
The Gazette
for you. I think it tied into how Chicagoians are ruining the
Teen Choice Awards . For the sake of yourself and all of America I hope that's not true. 'Til next time kitten, keep growing up into a beautiful specimen of a girl.

Good Morning Twenty-Somethings
By Glenn  Good morning.
Sorry this GM is late, but I'm a twenty-something.
There has been a column in the New York Times recently called
What Is It About 20-Somethings?
that explains why my generation is full of such lazy, shiftless people.
One of my friends turned 20 last night and I went to her party as a celebration of this accomplishment (living 20 years is a long time in some circles!) and as a protest of the Cordoba House/Park51 Islamic center in Manhattan.
There were tons of people that age at the party and most of them were very responsible and appreciated my irrational anger towards an Islamic culture center.
So maybe the writer of this article needs to spend some more time in REAL AMERICA! Today's Weather "It's August, and the heat is rising!" is the kind of headline and lede people read a year ago this month when crazed, teabagging psychos descending on town halls and military funerals to talk about things that weren't real and scream about transgressions that never happened.
It's not as hot right now in a literal sense but the battle over whether the 500 story mosque should be built over the remains of Ground Zero rages on.
I'd like meteorologists and sociologists to answer the question as to why the stupidest controversies all happen in the summer. Today's Viral Video Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, formerly twins and children, are now adults and actually twenty-somethings.
When they were children, they made a video about the desire for pizza featured here.
Little Caesar's adopted this video as part of their marketing campaign in the early 90's after the Noid was convicted of double murder, but it fell flat.
People just weren't willing to try this kind of pizza except for twenty-somethings.
You can't make money
just
selling things to youth culture or we would have shit movies that catered to teens and a culture that glorified being young.
Today's Platitude I couldn't find any pictures of platitudes, so I put this picture of a kitten saying hang in there.
I don't find that phrase such a platitude as I do a well-meaning suggestion that misses the point.
If we don't hang together, we will surely hang separately. Today's Prediction We'll hit 30 and everything will be fine.

Scam Bait: Togo Edition
By Keelin  Greetings Keelin, Late Family Estate. I'm Mr. Faye K. LAWSON (ESQ), Attorney to the Court of Lomé-TOGO. One of my client, Late Dr. Paul O., a native of your country, who shares the same surname as yours, died in an air crash in Benin republic on 26 December, 2003, at exactly 18:16gmt alongside his wife and their only daughter. After his death, investigation to lacate his relatives prove abbortive. I put myself in contact with you to seek your help to share the money left behind by my client,a sum of (€6 million euro) is currently in one of the banks here with an open WILL. Please contact me via the email for more details; (fayeklaw@yahoo.com) Best regards, LAWSON CHAMBERS. Mr. Faye K. LAWSON (ESQ) Solicitors & Advocates Block 2, Flat 5, Rue du Boulevard, PB 333, Lome-Togo.
____________________________________________________ Greetings to you as well Mr. Faye K. Lawson, First of all, let me compliment you on your evocative and trust-inspiring name. All lawyers should have the word "law" somewhere in their name, if only out of professional courtesy. Secondly, thank you for informing me of the death of my relative with such tact and tenderness. To be honest, nobody in the family even liked Dr. Paul O., which is probably why we haven't noticed that he's been dead for seven years. His wife and daughter were OK, I guess, but we think they might have had a pill problem and anorexia, respectively. Also, they gave the worst Christmas gifts.
Anyway, it's good to know the exact time they died in case something creepy starts happening and we need to figure out if they are haunting us. I've shared your email with the family and we are all wondering what Dr. Paul O. was doing in Benin. We knew he was in deep with the cartels, but we always imagined he'd die under suspicious circumstances in a Latin American country -- certainly not in your esteemed republic! In terms of claiming my inheritance, why don't you just send me your ATM card with the PIN and I'll withdraw the money myself? You'll save a ton in transaction fees! Most eagerly awaiting your reply, Keelin

Good Morning Students (and Teachers)
By Stephen  Unless you are (or were?) homeschooled by fundamentalists, this week marks the beginning of a new school year. For students and teachers alike, this means another 9-ish months of baffling, awkward, occasionally erotic "educational" encounters and American Gladiator style physical challenges that nibble away at the psyche like a lazy moth in a closet full of old halloween costumes. Something to be excited about? Maybe! But maybe not...
Today's Most Important Meal (hint: not breakfast)
A break from class and a time to socialize with your peers, lunchtime is undoubtedly the most exciting part of any school day. It's even more exciting if your parents can't afford to feed you at home, like the child in the picture above. So sad. Today's Best Break Besides kittens, the only people who get naptime during a school day are kindergarteners and college students. Other age-groups caught napping will probably be disciplined, and rightly so. Today's Most Embarrassing Moment at School This may seem like it's only applicable to females, but just imagine how embarrassing it would be if the same thing happened to a young man! Today's Suggestion No more movies about adults going to back to school.

Debate: Is Farmville a Waste of Time?
By Glenn and Jake  With the exception of The Beatles and Kraft brand macaroni & cheese, no product has spread across America’s landscape like Farmville, the farm simulation computer game.
Farming is a dying American tradition that is perpetually falling on ‘hard times,’ but computer simulation games have never been more popular.
When you put them together the results are similar to other famous pairings such as Hall & Oates, Dr. Frankenstein and his monster and The Rescuers and going down under.
One can make the argument that Farmville is a waste of time, but not without having to read this debate first. Glenn : I don’t know any way to say this other than in the way a character on Farmville would: “YeS, FaRmViLlE iS a WaStE oF tImE.”
Before you start lecturing me about how that’s not how characters on Farmville talk, I would like to point out that I do not know because I refuse to play the game.
As a Jewish American and strong supporter of Israel, I find it offensive in addition to a waste of time.
Think of all the hours that could have and should have been spent studying the Torah but instead are wasted playing Farmville, a game that says nothing about the history of the Jewish people.
Though there are Jewish farmers in the world still, they are rare and the game does nothing to capture what their lives are like.
For the sake of the six million, stop playing Farmville, Jake :
Like Glenn, I do not play Farmville and am Jewish, but where our paths diverge is that I am a farmer.
Like many other Jewish farmers I support anything that has to do with farming, including strong support for the pesticide industry.
I also am a huge fan of Facebook and its many applications.
One has to do nothing more than type “super poke” into the search box on this very website to find that out.
Farmville is not exclusively on Facebook, but it might as well be, since it is one of the three websites I am allowed to visit at the Washington District Library.
In my opinion nothing on the internet is a waste of time, not even Family Matters fan fiction, of which I am an avid reader (I get it on my Kindle), or my Saved by the Bell recaps. Glenn :
Of course I agree that your Saved by the Bell recaps are not a waste of time.
How could anything that evokes nostalgia and laughs together be a waste?
I’ve never laughed at Farmville though - only at the people who have had to take second, third even fourth mortgages out on their
actual
farms in order to pay for their addiction to the game.
The only nostalgia this evokes is what it was like to grow up in the Great Depression and see family after family lose their farms.
That was because of adverse agricultural conditions but addiction to Farmville is the modern equivalent.
In fact, I might even dare to say that addiction to Farmville has killed more people than an addiction to heroin. Jake :
Farmville is a productive use of time.
In this day and age where we can elect Marxist Kenyans to the highest office in the country, our time is far less valuable than that of latter generations.
Farmers were the backbone of society, but they have been replaced by factory farms that can give us far cheaper prices on eggs and pig brains.
Now the only way to get in touch with the lost art of manual labor is through simulation computer games.
Our version of back-braking hard labor is clicking on our mouses as if they were an elevator button or one of those buttons on a crosswalk that do nothing.
Farmville is our only way to connect with nature.
We live in a postmodern dystopia, where everything, including manual labor, has become nothing more than a computer game enjoyed by the masses.
These games are fun and how can anything fun be a waste of time?
If that were the case then Ziggy would have disappeared from the pages of newspapers ages ago instead of becoming the subject of a feature film. Glenn :
You are making a very sophisticated cultural argument in defense of Farmville and I applaud it.
But moral relativism and female circumcision defenses will only get you so far.
Factory farms, for example, treat animals worse than we treat our elderly.
There are plenty of other opportunities for manual labor in our day to day lives: cleaning our guns, spanking our children and writing check after check to Hamas, Hezbollah, etc.
Even farming itself would be a better use of young people’s time!
I know agribusiness has put most family farms out of business, but there’s also a huge push towards local, organically grown food - a trend Farmville ignores at its own peril.
In other words, plant a garden instead of letting the Farmville application access your pictures, profile and other personal information. Jake :
I think you are completely missing the point of Farmville: encouraging members of our generation and lower to become farmers.
It is an effect that worked so well for SimCity.
Nearly everybody I know now lives in a city, and the only way of explaining it is that they were drawn to it because of the classic simulation game.
Furthermore, many of our friends have taken residence in Portland, Oregon because of the classic frontier simulation game The Oregon Trail.
Elderly people are always claiming that video games are to blame for all of society’s woes, but they are seldom to remark about the positive effects of games.
This is why I hate anybody over the age of 45 with a deep guttural burning.
This could be attributed to my acid reflux and the 13 seven layer burritos saturated in fire sauce I eat every day for lunch, but that just seems so unlikely.
Although it definitely is why I always have diarrhea.
To reiterate: Farmville is a good use of time that would otherwise be spent sniffing glue or reading Maxim magazine.

Good Morning One Year In Texas
By Maddie  Good morning, One Year In Texas! Today is Ted Hughes' birthday.
Poet and mortal enemy of every fifteen-year-old who just discovered Sylvia Plath, he died of a heart attack in 1998. Better that than in an oven.
We Must Be In Heaven, Man As everyone who went through a hippie phase or was friends with a guy named Chaz in high school knows, today marks the 41st anniversary of the final day of Woodstock. This is probably my favorite performance of the festival: ...okay, you caught me. I'm a pussy. This is my favorite performance of the festival: The Senator from Connecticut
On this day in 2000, the Democratic National Convention nominated Joe Lieberman for vice president. That's funny enough, right? No joke needed?
In Life and in Art
Today in fucked-up director news: eighteen years ago,
Woody Allen admitted he was dating the much-younger daughter of his longtime girlfriend Mia Farrow. 34 years her senior, he went on to marry Soon-Yi, his almost-kind-of daughter, in 1997. Let's just watch
Manhattan
and forget about this nonsense, okay? Oh, wait.

Life with Mikey (8-16-10)
By Mikey  I was thinking about going to see the Beach Boys live, but I don't know if it would be the same without Brian Wilson and all the others.
Has anybody seen them recently?
Do they play "Kokomo"? What's next: a movie based on a vending machine? Kids are always telling each other that they aren't "all that."
I don't like that. Mr. T always pitied fools, but he never helped any of them.
That's why he won't become a saint. It's been too long since my last pumpkin pie. The Full Monty is my favorite film about full frontal male nudity. How do you blow smoke rings? They say Fig Newtons aren't cookies, but they really are. I don't watch commercials now that I TiVo everything. I can't get enough minor league baseball. Copycat killers are so cliché. Why does Don Rickles call everybody hockey pucks?
What's so bad about being a hockey puck? My favorite flavor of ice cream is strawberry cheese cake. I still can't believe that Gomer Pile was a Marine.
I guess they have no standards. I hope it's nice Sunday.
I want to go hiking! There are too many motivational posters on the internet.

Good Morning Racists!
By Cougar & Goat It is a well established fact that One Year In Texas is a pro-racism website.
In fact, we are so racist we make
Prussian Blue
look like the Prussian
Rainbow Coalition .
But you, our readers, know this, and that's why you continue to frequent our site.
I've seen the stats.
I've seen the search queries.
I know that at least 34% of the people that will read this post have a shaved head.
You visit this site because you can't get what you need from your KKKA (Ku Klux Klan Anonymous) meetings.
This site is a haven for you - a place where you can surf the purest information super highways of cyberspace, but I'm afraid I have some disturbing news.
Watch this trailer: It's true, my white brethren, and you know it all too well.
Activist Judges have turned our world on its head.
It's been a rough summer for us.
It started when well known racist and actor Mel Gibson was ridiculed in the press.
I know most of you have already memorized the telephone rant between him and his Russian wife, but I will post it here again. He is a role model for us all, but there are others, too.
And they continue to lead us through adversity. Our favorite physician, Dr. Laura Schlessinger, has been dragged into the streets by a mob of angry east coast media elites and strung up by her microphone chord: She was only speaking the truth!
What was our White Brother thinking when he married that uppity black?
Dr. Laura was just following Don Imus' lead and putting her back in her place.
When will the intermingling stop?
It's starting to infest our music. It appears that some "DJs" called
The Hood Internet
have "mashed up" the band Grizzly Bear with a rapper, Dead Prez.
It's an abomination to all the educated, white, college kids who listen to Grizzly Bear and disdain the primal sounds of today's "Jungle Music."
Just listen: The Hood Internet - Two Weeks Of Hip Hop (Dead Prez x Grizzly Bear)
by
hoodinternet I bet "President" Barack Hussein Obama-Soetoro listened to that before he gave that speech endorsing the building of the radical Islamic madrassa and mosque that are being built on Ground Zero.
He may call it "hallowed ground" like Lincoln at Gettysburg, but he's just trying to emulate the president that freed him. Predictions: Grizzly Bear and Dead Prez will play at the grand opening of the Ground Zero Mosque while Obama speaks at its dedication.
Meanwhile, Prussian Blue will headline an opposition rally/campaign kick-off for the Gibson/Schlessinger presidential ticket.
The movie
Activist Judges
will literally bomb at the box office when the Aryan Nation finally awakes:

20 Things I'd Rather Do Than See Yogi Bear 3D
By Glenn  It's been a while since we really skewered a mainstream movie.
The way we do that is by listing 20 things we'd rather do than see the movie, to illustrate just how much we don't want to see it.
Usually Maddie writes these and indeed she has popularized the fad.
Now everywhere there are teenage girls writing about 20 things they'd rather do than homework, or 20 things they'd rather do than communicate in proper English.
But since she really wants to see the new film Yogi Bear 3D, I step in to explain why how much I don't.
Please watch the trailer, which is introduced by the human being who used to be known as Dan Aykroyd: 20 Things I'd Rather Do Than See Yogi Bear 3D : Pack up and move apartments in a major urban area every week for a year. Drive around and look for a parking spot during the New York City West Indian Parade, Puerto Rican parade or Gay Pride festival. Be a professional blogger for AIPAC. Write an academic paper discussing the movie the Expendables and what it says about military contracting. Attempt to mediate an argument between two mentally unstable homeless people. Have my alarm clock be an extremely loud, 15 minute remix of "Milkshake" by Kellis, with no snooze option.
Be responsible for administering President Obama's deportation program. Lead a month-long protest against the "Ground Zero" mosque without making any appeals to bigotry.
Testify against Naomi Campbell and in favor of Charles Taylor at the Hague. Watch only family movies and romantic comedies because movies for adults are "too depressing." Spend even one more minute of my time following and caring about Lost. Help my parents set up Facebook accounts. Create a Google alert for "Obama socialism." Switch to using crayons instead of pens. Clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Live my life like I'm a character on Entourage (more than I already do). Stop using email or texts and only call people any time I want something. Become a full-time volunteer recruiter for the Linda McMahon for US Senate campaign. Dress in a bear suit and continue murdering people in the forests of the Northeastern United States. Live the rest of my life without the ability to use hyperbole.
