Synopsis of The Stepford Wives (2004)
After Joanna Eberhart, the New York television executive,  has  been  fired,
she moved to Stepford with her husband, Walter, and two children for  a  new
life. However, Joanna realized quite soon that  the  Stepford  wives  are  a
little too perfect. Stepford is also a little too  perfect  place  to  live.
One night, Joanna discovered that those Stepford wives are mindless  robots;
and she was going to be the next victim.  Fortunately,  Walter  has  changed
his mind in the last minute and saved all the mindless wives with Joanna.

Rationale of why this film has been chosen
People always complain and desire for more. However, it is sad that they  do
not really know what they want; and even  they  are  not  as  good  as  they
expect. They only demand others to be perfect and flawless. They  hope  that
everything goes on the track they prefer. However, the reality is  not  like
this. This movie reminds people that sometimes Perfect doesnt work,  this
is what Joanna said at the end of the film. It is sometimes  more  important
for people to appreciate than to complain.

              Worksheet 5 --- The Stepford Wives  Plot summary
Part 1 ~ Reading the plot summary
After successful  television  executive  Joanna  Eberhart  is  attacked  and
nearly killed by a disgruntled reality  television  show  contestant,  she's
immediately fired by her work and experiences a nervous breakdown. With  her
loving husband and work colleague Walter and their two children,  they  move
from Manhattan to Stepford, a quiet  Connecticut  suburb  for  a  change  of
scenery. Eberhart becomes  friends  with  Bobbie  Markowitz,  a  writer  and
recovering alcoholic, and Roger Bannister, who is homosexual and  has  moved
to town with his longtime partner. The three of them are suspicious  of  the
other women in the town, who are all placid and  blissful  and  spend  their
days exclusively on domestic tasks. After witnessing  a  quickly  covered-up
incident in which one of the  Stepford  wives,  Sarah  Sunderson,  violently
malfunctions, and later, the increasingly  bizarre  behavior  of  their  own
spouses, Joanna, Bobbie, and Roger are  moved  to  investigate  the  strange
going-ons in Stepford. In the process,  Roger  and  Bobbie  are  transformed
into bland, unnatural, domestic versions of themselves. The  inhuman  nature
of these new Stepford spouses is revealed to Joanna  when  she  attempts  to
confront the newly-transformed Bobbie, who unknowingly places her hand on  a
lit stove, but does not react to the flame. Joanna attempts  to  flee,  only
to discover that her  children  have  been  taken  hostage  by  the  men  of
Stepford.  She  storms  the  Stepford  Men's  Club,  angrily  demanding  her
children to be returned, and is entrapped by the men who have been lying  in
wait for her. She is forced into the transformation room with her husband.
Part 2 ~ Dilemma
1. If you were Walter, would you change Joanna or not? Why or why not?
