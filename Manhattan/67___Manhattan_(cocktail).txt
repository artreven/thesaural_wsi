Manhattan, New York, United States  /
May 20, 2009
Opus Moreschi made a
ShamWow
cocktail in 28.52 seconds, a new world
record. He poured all the liquid ingredients of a
Manhattan
into a
ShamWow, and then squeezed the towel into a glass. Timing stopped when
the final ingredient, a maraschino cherry, was placed in the drink.
Moreschi termed the resulting cocktail a “Shamhattan.”
Moreschi set the record on May 20, 2009 at a
World Record Appreciation
Society [] event in New York City. Dan Rollman and Corey Henderson were
present as witnesses.
