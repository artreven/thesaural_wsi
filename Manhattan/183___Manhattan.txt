The
Great Famine
or the
Great Hunger
( Irish :
An Gorta Mór
or
An Drochshaol ), known more commonly
outside of
Ireland
as the
Irish
Potato
Famine , is the name given to a
famine
in
Ireland
between
1845
and
1849 . The Famine was at least fifty
years in the making, due to the disastrous interaction
of
British
economic policy, destructive farming methods, and the
unfortunate appearance of "the Blight" —the
potato fungus
that almost
instantly destroyed the primary food source for the
majority population. The immediate after-effects of
The Famine continued until
1851 . The number of deaths is unrecorded,
and various estimates suggest totals between 500,000
and more than one million in the five years from 1846.
Some two million refugees are attributed to the Great
Hunger (estimates vary), and much the same number of
people emigrated to
Great Britain , the
United
States ,
Canada , and
Australia
( see
the
Irish
Diaspora ).
The
immediate effect on Ireland was devastating, and its
long-term effects proved immense, permanently changing
Irish culture and tradition. The Irish Potato Famine
was the culmination of a social, biological, political
and economic catastrophe, caused by both Irish and British
factors.

The potato in Ireland
The
potato contains considerable
food energy , and yet is very
easy to cultivate. Typical farming practice of the era
seeded a field once after being hoed, and future years'
crops were "seeded" by simply leaving some of the potatoes
unharvested in the ground. Weeding was minimal, and
irrigation unnecessary. The
potato
had become Ireland's major
food crop after being introduced sometime around
1650 , though its dominance was not
achieved until around the
1780s . Even small plots could provide
enough food energy for a family (and also to feed pigs,
providing access to meat, which could also be sold,
providing extra income.) While potatoes are relatively
rich in energy they are only a fair source of protein.
Some paleo-nutritionists estimate that potato consumption
prior to the famine averaged an astonishing 14 pounds
per day per adult. This monotonous diet provided good
nutrition which led to a taller average height in Ireland
than in England during the early 19th century. In addition
to the potato crop, other lands were used for cash crops
like
flax . The abundance of food and cash
led to a rise in population in Ireland.
The
potato's benefits also led to a dangerous inflexibility
in the Irish food system. The majority of food energy
was being provided from a single crop. That alone is
not unusual, and is still the case today for many subsistence
farmers around the world. However, the traditional Irish
practice of
sub-dividing
plots
among the male children of a family, though diminishing,
was still widely practiced in the poorer areas of the
country. The use of the potato and sub-division produced
two interlinked side-effects; with increased food energy
the number of surviving male heirs was quickly increasing,
while with the prospect of inheriting a land-holding,
heirs married young and produced large families-hence
increasing subdivision into smaller estates for their
own heirs.
Irish
landholdings
The
Famine was the product of a number of complex problems
which affected nineteenth century Ireland. One of the
most central was the nature of land-holdings. From the
middle-ages
onwards, Irish ownership of the land of the island had
been in decline, as waves of settlers following British
conquest, from the
Elizabethan
plantations
on,
assumed control of large tracts of land. A practice
of consolidation of lands into large estates was widespread
in Europe, but, in Ireland, it was complicated by the
discriminatory laws applied to all faiths other than
the British imposed
Church of Ireland , but
which most directly affected native Irish
Roman Catholics , by far
the religion of the overwhelming majority of Irish people.
Under the
Penal Laws ,
Irish Catholics faced the threat of confiscation of
property. While the enforcement of the law fluctuated
both in terms of period and geography, and by the time
of the Great Hunger the laws had in any case been repealed,
the cultural effect of the discrimination they embodied
helped shape Irish attitudes towards land. As a result
of all of this, by the time of the Great Hunger most
Irish Catholics were restricted to holding small, frequently
impoverished tenancies, lacking what came to be known
as the ' Three Fs '; fair rent, fixity
of tenure, and free sale.
This
was further complicated by a cultural tradition known
as
'sub-division' ,
whereby lands and property, instead of being inherited
by the first-born son ( primogeniture ) was divided
equally among male heirs, both legitimate and on occasion
illegitimate. The Penal Laws had decreed sub-division
among the conquered Catholic Irish, in the hopes of
forcing conversion to Protestantism. In its nineteenth
century land-holding form, it meant that, over each
generation, the size of a tenant farm was reduced, as
it was split between all living sons, though by the
1840s, sub-division was increasingly only found among
the poorest people on the smallest farms. In 1845, for
example, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4 to
2
hectares
(one to five
acres )
in size, while 40% were of 2 to 6 hectares (five to
fifteen acres). This included
marshland
and
bogland
that could not be used for food production. As a result,
holdings were so small that the only crop that could
be grown in sufficient quantities, and which provided
sufficient nourishment to feed a family, was potatoes.
A British Government report carried out shortly before
the Great Hunger noted that the scale of the poverty
was such that one third of all small holdings in Ireland
were presumed to be unable to support their families,
after paying their rent, other than through the earnings
of seasonal migrant labour in
England
and
Scotland .
1
As
a result, the Irish landholding system in the 1840s
was already in serious trouble. Many of the big estates,
as a result of earlier agricultural crises, were heavily
mortgaged and in financial difficulty. (10% were eventually
bankrupted by the Great Hunger). Below that level were
mass tenancies, lacking rent control and security of
tenure, many of them through sub-division so small that
the tenants were struggling to survive in good years,
and almost wholly dependent on potatoes because they
alone could be grown in sufficient quantity and nutritional
value on the land left to native ownership, while many
tons of cattle and other foodstuffs from estates were
exported by absentee British landlords to foreign markets.
Furthermore, efforts of tenants to increase the productivity
of their land were actively discouraged by the threat
that any increase in land value would lead to a disproportionately
high resulting increase in rents, possibly leading to
their eviction.
The

Potato blight
is a fungal
pathogen that is spread by air-born
spores . It infects leaf surfaces
and then spreads through the entire plant.
Although
the point of origin is still unclear, in
1845
a
potato blight
struck across
Europe ,
turning potatoes into a soggy and inedible mess. The
Freeman's Journal
(the
main nationalist newspaper) on
June 27 ,
1846
carried the headline
Disease
in the New Potato Crop , recounting an early outbreak
in
County Mayo .
By
Black '47 , the vast majority of that year's
crop was ruined. Food stores and emergency supplies
made up for some of this setback, but the blight appeared
again in
1848 . There was no reserve capacity
remaining. The
famine
affected different parts
of the island to varying degrees.

"...
six famished and ghastly skeletons, to all appearance
dead, huddled in a corner, their sole covering what
seemed to be a ragged horse cloth, and their wretched
legs hanging about, naked above the knees. I approached
in horror and found by a low moaning that they were
alive, they were in fever -- four children, a woman
and what had once been a man... In a few minutes I was
surrounded by at least 200 of such phantoms, such frightful
spectres as no words can describe. By far the greater
number were delirious either from famine or fever...
Within 500 yards of the Cavalry Station at Skibbereen,
the dispensary doctor found seven wretches lying, unable
to move, under the same cloak -- one had been dead many
hours, but the others were unable to move, either themselves
or the corpse."
"I
can recollect [she writes] being awakened in the early
morning by a strange noise, like the croaking or chattering
of many birds. Some of the voices were hoarse and almost
extinguished by the faintness of famine; and on looking
out of the window I recollect seeing the garden and
the field in front of the house completely darkened
by a population of men women and children, squatting
in rags; uncovered skeleton limbs protruding everywhere
from their wretched clothing, and clamorous though faint
voices uplifted for food and in pathetic remonstrance
against the inevitable delay in providing what was given
them from the house every morning. I recollect too,
when walking through the lanes and villages, the strange
morbid famine smell in the air, the sign of approaching
death, even in those who were still dragging out a wretched
existence"
[1]
Evictions
In
a final disastrous twist, local relief was paid for
through the
Poor Law
Union,
which was funded by rates (local taxes) paid by landlords,
on the basis of an estate's tenant numbers. This produced
the perverse farce of increasing local reliance on the
poor law leading landlords to evict impoverished tenants
in order to control their rapidly rising rates bills,
only to see those evictees, now reliant on the Poor
Law Union pushing up rate bills further, leading to
more evictions. But if they kept on tenants unable to
pay rents, they then might be unable to meet
their
rates bill (many estates were already in financial trouble),
meaning the Poor Law would not be able to offer local
relief, leading to more starvation.
5
Only central funding of Poor Law Unions from the exchequer
could solve this conundrum, but Russell's government
was opposed to this. Some landlords, to avoid ex-tenants
relying on the Poor Law, provided passage to other countries,
on what became known as
coffin ships . All too many
emigrants, already weak, some with
cholera , died during the passage
to North America.
Ireland
experienced a massive number of evictions, due to financial
reasons, and infamously to 'clear' their lands to allow
cattle grazing, similar to the
Highland Clearances ,
which were happening in
Scotland
around the same time.
Some evicted reluctantly because of their climbing rates
bills, others with notorious brutality to take advantage
from the Famine. 90,000 people were evicted in 1849
alone, though up to one third were allowed to return
as 'caretakers'. 109,000 were evicted in 1850.
6
Many estates did however provide help for their tenants,
with reduced rents and the provision of soup kitchens,
in some cases bankrupting themselves in the process.
Many also initiated relief works, where workers were
paid a pittance for building (mostly superfluous) roads
and walls. The
Shannon - Erne
canal (recently reopened) was
built as a relief work after petition from the landholders
of South Leitrim. 7
10% of all estates were bankrupt by 1850, as heavily-mortgaged
estates could not cover their financial costs from tenants
facing starvation and bankruptcy themselves. The failure
of the United Kingdom to control the behaviour of landlords
has often been criticised. However in the mid-nineteenth
century, few states internationally restricted the rights
of landlords; restrictions in Ireland were only imposed
from the 1870s, as under the Land Acts which conceded
the Irish nationalist demand for the Three Fs and which
finally allowed tenants to buy their farms.
Large
sums of money were donated by charities;
Calcutta
is credited with making
the first donation of £14,000. The money was raised
by Irish soldiers serving there and Irish people employed
by the
East India Company .
Pope Pius IX
sent funds,
Queen Victoria
personally gave the modern day equivalent of €70,000,
while the
Choctaw
Indians
famously sent $710 and grain, an act of generosity still
remembered to this day, and publicly commemorated by
President
Mary Robinson
in the 1990s.
Lord
Rothschild
donated more than every other English
aristocrat combined, although he had not the financial
interests in Ireland that many others had. Nevertheless,
charitable donations could not solve the scale of the
problem.

The
initial British government policy towards the famine
was, in the view of historians such as
F.S.L. Lyons , "prompt and
relatively successful" 3 .
Professor Joe Lee contends: "There was nothing unique
(by the standards of pre-industrial subsistence crisis)
about the [Irish] famine. The death rate had been frequently
equalled in earlier European famines, including, possibly,
in Ireland itself during the famine of
1740-41 "
4 .
This 1740 -1741 famine is commonly referred to as The
Forgotten Famine.
In
the case of the 1846-49 Irish Famine, the response of
Tory
government head Sir
Robert Peel
was to purchase some foreign maize for delivery to Ireland,
and to repeal the
Corn Laws , which prohibited
imports of the much cheaper foreign grain to Ireland.
The repeal of the Corn Laws was enacted over a three-year
period from 1846 to 1849 and came too late to help the
starving Irish, and was politically unpopular, resulting
in the end of Sir Peel's ministry. Succeeding him was
replaced a
Whig
ministry under
Lord John Russell . Lord
Russell's ministry focused on providing support through
public works and
work-houses , as laid forth
in the
Poor Law Amendment
Act 1834 . The "Gregory Clause" of the Act was introduced,
making aid available only to those who owned less than
one quarter of an acre (1,000 m²) of land. This
forced poverty-stricken starving tenants either to give
up their homes and land, and so become destitute
after
the famine, or hold on to them and risk starvation.
For a brief time in 1847, soup kitchens were operated
by the Poor Law Authority, but soon closed.
Deathtolls
Fall in Irish population (1841-1851)
No-one
knows for certain how many people died in the Famine.
State registration of births, marriages or deaths had
not yet begun, while the Roman Catholic Church's records,
where they exist at all, are understandably incomplete,
given the sheer scale of deaths. Many of the
Church of Ireland 's
records (which included records of local Catholics,
who paid
tithes
(local taxes) to their local
Church of Ireland), were destroyed when the
IRA
blew up the
Irish Public Records
Office
in 1922.
One
possible estimate has been reached by comparing the
expected population with the eventual numbers in the
1850s. Earlier predictions expected that by 1851, Ireland
would have a population of 8 to 9 million. This calculation
is based on numbers contained in the ten year census
results compiled since 1821. (However, a recent re-examination
of those returns raise questions as to their accuracy;
the 1841 Census, for example, incorrectly classed farm
children as labourers, affecting later calculations
on how many adults capable of child-bearing existed
to produce children between 1841 and 1851!). What we
do know is that in 1851 the actual population was 6.6
million. Making straightforward calculations is complicated
by a secondary effect of famine, a key side-effect of
malnutrition, namely plummeting fertility and sexual
activity rates. The scale of that effect on population
numbers was not fully recognised until studies done
during
African
famines in the twentieth
century. As a result, corrections based on inaccuracies
in census returns and on the previous unrealised decline
in births due to malnourishment have led to an overall
reduction in the presumed death numbers. Modern historians
and statisticians estimate that between 500,000 and
1,500,000 died. Some historians suggest the death-toll
was in the region of 700,000 to 800,000. 2
One website claims a figure of over five million though
most historians have dismissed this claim and the reliability
of its calculations.
[2]
In
addition, in excess of one million Irish emigrated in
the notorious
coffin ships
to the
United States ,
Great
Britain ,
Canada ,
Australia , and elsewhere, while
more than one million emigrated over following decades;
by 1911, a combination of emigration and an abnormally
high number of unmarried men and women in the population,
had reduced the population of Ireland to 4.4 million.
The
aftermath
Potato
blights continued in Ireland, especially in
1872
and
1879 - 1880 . These killed few people, partly
because they were less severe, but mainly due to a complex
range of reasons. The growth in the numbers of railways
made the importation of foodstuffs easier; in 1834,
Ireland had 6 miles of railway tracks; by 1912, the
total was 3,403. The banning of sub-division, coupled
with emigration, had increased the average farm holding,
enabling tenant farms to diversify in terms of produce
grown. The increasing wealth in urban areas meant alternative
sources of food, grain, potatoes and seed were available
in towns and villages. The 1870s agricultural economy
thus was more efficient and less dependent on potatoes,
as well as having access to new farm machinery and product
control that had not existed thirty years earlier.
Of
particular importance was the wholesale re-organisation
of the agricultural sector, which had begun after the
famine with the
Encumbered
Estates Act
and which in the period (1870s-1900s)
saw the nature of Irish landholding changed completely,
with small owned farms replacing mass estates and multiple
tenants. Many of the large estates in the 1840s were
debt ridden and heavily mortgaged. In contrast, estates
in the 1870s, many of them under new Irish middle class
owners thanks to the Encumbered Estates Act, were on
a better economic footing, and so capable of reducing
rents and providing locally organized relief, as was
the Roman Catholic Church, which was better organised
and funded than it had been in 1847-49.
If
sub-division produced earlier marriage and larger families,
its abolition produced the opposite effect; the 'inheriting'
child would wait until they found the 'right' partner,
preferably one with a large dowry to bring to the farm.
Other children, no longer with the possibility of inheriting
a farm (or part of it at least) had no economic attraction
and no financial resources to consider an early marriage.
As
a result, later mini-famines made only minimal effect
and are generally forgotten, except by historians. However,
even though by the 1880s Ireland went through an economic
boom unprecedented until the
Celtic Tiger
era, emigration,
often of children who no longer could inherit a share
in the land and who as a result chose to go abroad for
economic advantage and to avoid poverty, continued.
By the
1911
census, the island of Ireland's
population had fallen to 4.4 million, about the same
as the population in
1800
and
2000
and only a half of
its peak population.
The
same mould ( Phytophthora infestans )
was responsible for the 1847-51 and later famines. When
people speak of "the Irish famine", or " an Gorta
Mór ", they nearly always mean the one of the
1840s , even though a similar Great
Famine did in fact hit in the early
18th century . The fact that
only four types of potato were brought from
the Americas
was a fundamental
cause of the famine, as the lack of
genetic diversity
made
it possible for a single
fungus -relative to have much more
devastating consequences than it might otherwise have
had.
Emigration
As
a result of the famine, many Irish families were forced
to
emigrate
from
the country. By
1854 ,
between 1.5 and 2 million Irish left their country.
In the
United
States , most Irish became city-dwellers. With little
money, many had to settle in the cities that the ships
they came on landed in. By
1850 , the Irish made up a quarter
of the population in
Boston ,
New York
City ,
Philadelphia ,
and
Baltimore . The 1851
census reported that about one third of the inhabitants
of
Toronto ,
Canada , were Irish.
The Famine is often seen as an initiator in the steep
depopulation of Ireland in the 19th century, however,
it is likely that real population began to fall in 1841
with the Famine accelerating any population changes
already occurring. Some may argue the Famine was necessary
to restore population equilibrium to Ireland given that
population increased by 13-14% in the first three decades
of the 19th century (using
Thomas Malthus 's idea of
population expanding geometrically, resources increasing
arithmetically) nonetheless there is a tendency among
Irish historians to dispute this. Statistics show that
between 1831 and 1841 population grew by only 5% so
this gives more value to those who argue that population
was already falling by 1844.
The
mass exodus in the years following the famine must be
seen in the context of overpopulation, industrial stagnation,
land shortages, declining agricultural employment and
inadequate diet. These factors were already combining
to choke off population growth by the 1830s. It would
be wrong, therefore, to attribute all the population
loss during the famine, to the famine.
Suggestions
of genocide
The
suggestion that the Famine "amounted to
genocide " by the British against
the Irish is a divisive issue. Few Irish historians
accept outright such a definition, as "genocide" implies
a
deliberate policy
of extermination. Many agree
that the British policies during the Famine, particularly
those applied under
Lord John Russell , were
misguided, ill-informed, based on prevailing British
bigotries toward the Irish, and disastrous. Irish poet
Jonathan Swift
had satirized
the plight of the Irish in relation to English economic
domination almost a century prior to the famine in his
pamphlet " A Modest Proposal " (1729).
Professor Joe Lee called what happened a
holocaust .
(See
Democide ). Others, however, note
that over three-million people were fed through soup-kitchens
(though much of it through non-governmental aid), and
that factors such as poor communication, primitive retail
distribution networks and the inefficiencies of local
government had exacerbated the situation.
The
"debate" is largely a moral one, attempting to ascertain
whether within the policies of the British Empire lay
a racist, forgetful, or simply inconsiderate mentality
that, despite its power, made it impotent to handle
a humanitarian crisis in its own backyard, or whether
a large reduction in Ireland's population was looked
on as a favourable outcome by a large segment of the
British body politic, who then decided to let nature
take its course. Some Irish, British and US historians
F.S.L. Lyons ,
John
A. Murphy ,
Joe Lee ,
Roy
Foster , and
James S. Donnelly,
Jr. , as well as historians
Cecil Woodham-Smith ,
Peter
Gray ,
Ruth
Dudley Edwards
and many others have long dismissed
claims of a
deliberate policy
of extermination.
This dismissal usually does not preclude any assessment
of
British Imperial
rule as
ill-mannered or unresponsive toward certain of its
subjects .
The
notable difference between the Famine and other
humanitarian crises
was that it occurred within the imperial homeland, at
a time well into the modern prosperity of the
Victorian
and
Industrial
age. Even today,
such crises tend to be far away from
centers of power
such
that the subjects of empire, almost by definition, are
of distant
cultures ,
languages
and
religious beliefs .
Within the imperial culture, the reportage of a crisis
among its subjects more often uses dismissive and
dehumanizing
terms, and
treats otherwise urgent matters with little relevancy
or interest. With respect to geography, the famine would
appear to belie many of the typical circumstances in
which colonialist dismissal of native plight often occurred.
With respect to era, the famine came at a crossroads
of old world and modern world. Though human suffering
during the famine was never
photographed , the event immediately
and profoundly altered the course of generations of
Irish and Irish diaspora —for whom history has a rich
and prosperous record.
Memorials

The
Great Famine is still remembered in many locations throughout
Ireland, especially in those regions which suffered
the greatest losses, and also in cities overseas with
large populations descended from Irish immigrants.

Liverpool ,
England . A memorial is in the
grounds of St Luke's Church on Leece Street, itself
a memorial to the victims of the Blitz. It recalls
that from 1849-1852 1,241,410 Irish immigrants arrived
in the city and that from Liverpool they dispersed
to locations around the world. Many died though despite
the help they received within the city, some 7000
in the city's parish within one year. The sculpture
is dedicated to the memory of all famine emigrants
and their suffering. There is also a plaque on the
gates to Clarence Dock. Unveiled in 2000 The plaque
inscription reads in Gaelic and English: "Through
these gates passed most of the 1,300,000 Irish migrants
who fled from the Great Famine and 'took the ship'
to Liverpool in the years 1845-52" The Maritime Museum,
Albert Dock, Liverpool has an exhibition regarding
the Irish Migration, showing models of ships, documentation
and other facts on Liverpool's history.
