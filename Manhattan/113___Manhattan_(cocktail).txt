Nick Charles [ edit ]
The important thing is the rhythm. Always have rhythm in your shaking. Now a
Manhattan
you shake to
foxtrot
time, a
Bronx
to
two-step
time, but a
dry martini
you always shake to
waltz
time.
[Threatened by a man with a gun]
Hey, would you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm a very timid fellow... All right, shoot. I mean, uh, what's on your mind?
The murderer is right in this room. Sitting at this table. You may serve the fish.
Nora Charles [ edit ]
Waiter, will you serve the nuts? ...I mean, will you serve the guests the nuts?
The next person who says "Merry Christmas" to me, I'll kill 'em.
Oh Nicky, I love you because you know such lovely people.
Others [ edit ]
Marion : I don't like crooks. And if I did like 'em, I wouldn't like crooks that are stool pigeons. And if I did like crooks that are stool pigeons, I still wouldn't like you!
Dialogue [ edit ]
Nick : Now how did you ever remember me?
Dorothy : Oh, you used to fascinate me. A real live detective. You used to tell me the most wonderful stories. Were they true?
Nick : Probably not.
Nick : I'm a hero. I was shot twice in the
Tribune .
Nora : I read where you were shot five times in the tabloids.
Nick : It's not true. He didn't come anywhere near my tabloids.
Nora : All right! Go ahead! Go on! See if I care! But I thinks it's a dirty trick to bring me all the way to New York just to make a widow of me.
Nick : You wouldn't be a widow long...
Nora : You bet I wouldn't!
Nick : ...Not with all your money.
Nick : How'd you like
Grant's Tomb ?
Nora : It's lovely. I'm having a copy made for you.
Nora : Pretty girl.
Nick : Yes. She's a nice type.
Nora : You've got types?
Nick : Only you, darling, lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Nora : You know, that sounds like an interesting case. Why don't you take it?
Nick : I haven't time. I'm much to busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Nora :Take care of yourself.
Nick : Why, sure I will.
Nora : Don't say it like that! Say it as if you mean it!
Nick : Well, I do believe the little woman cares.
Nora : I don't care! It's just that I'm used to you, that's all.
Nora : Nick? Nicky?
Nick : What?
Nora : You asleep?
Nick : Yes!
Nora : Good. I want to talk to you.
Nora : What hit me?
Nick : The last martini.
Nora : Do you want a drink?
Nick : What do you think?
Nora : How do you feel?
Nick : Terrible. I must have gone to bed sober.
Reporter : Say, listen, is he working on a case?
Nora : Yes, he is.
Reporter : What case?
Nora : A case of scotch. Pitch in and help him.
Reporter : Well, can't you tell us anything about the case?
Nick : Yes, it's putting me way behind in my drinking.
