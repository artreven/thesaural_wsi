استنلی کوبریک
(به
انگلیسی :
Stanley Kubrick )
کارگردان
و تهیه‌کنندهٔ
یهودی تبار
آمریکایی
بود. بیشتر فیلم‌های کوبریک اقتباسات ادبی هستند. فیلمهای کوبریک معمولاً جنجالی و همینطور مورد ستایش منتقدان واقع شده‌اند. کوبریک به دقیق بودن و به نمایش درآوردن همه جزئیات دقیق در فیلمهایش معروف بود. به همین علت روش او در فیلمسازی کند و طولانی بوده، تا آنجا که گاهی میان دو فیلم او سالها وقفه می‌افتاده‌است. او در طول ۴۸ سال فعالیت در حیطه کارگردانی تنها ۱۳ فیلم بلند ساخت. سبک‌های گوناگون فیلمهایش و انزوای او چه در روش فیلمسازی و چه در مورد شخصیت فردی وی، او را مشهور ساخته‌است. استنلی کوبریک یکی از معدود کارگردانان
کمالگرا
در تاریخ سینما به شمار می‌آید. کوبریک جزء معدود کارگردان‌هایی بود که همواره در انتخاب فیلمنامه ریسک می‌کرد. او فیلم‌های خود را در ژانرهای گوناگونی می‌ساخت. [۱]

زندگی‌نامه [ ویرایش ]
نوجوانی و جوانی [ ویرایش ]

استنلی کوبریک در سال ۱۹۲۸ در
منهتن
نیویورک
به دنیا آمد. او اولین فرزند از خانوادهٔ چهار نفره ژاک کوبریک و همسرش گرترود بود. خواهرش باربارا در سال
۱۹۳۴
به دنیا آمد. اجداد کوبریک از مهاجران
یهودی
ساکن
اتریش
بودند. پدر او، ژاک، پزشک بود و آنها در موقع تولد استنلی در آپارتمانی در خیابان کلینتون ۲۱۶۰ در
برانکس
زندگی می‌کردند. پدرش در دوازده سالگی
شطرنج
را به او آموخت که در سراسر زندگی‌اش به عنوان یک علاقه ماندگار شد. در سیزده سالگی، پدرش به عنوان هدیه تولد یک
دوربین
گارفلکس به او هدیه داد که توجه استنلی جوان را به عکاسی سوق داد. در نوجوانی به
موسیقی جاز
علاقه پیدا کرد و مدت کمی هم به عنوان یک نوازندهٔ
درام
مشغول بود.
در دوران دبیرستان، کوبریک با دوربین هدیه پدرش، به طور جدی به
عکاسی
پرداخت و به زودی به عنوان عکاس رسمی مدرسه شناخته شد. بعد از فارغ‌التحصیلی، عکس‌های خود را برای مجلهٔ نیویورکی
لوک
فرستاد. پس از مدتی به بازی حرفه‌ای شطرنج روی آورد و در همین حال فروش عکس به مجلهٔ لوک را نیز ادامه می‌داد، او در سال ۱۹۴۶ به عنوان یکی از خبرنگاران تمام وقت مجله شناخته شد. در شش سال فعالیت کوبریک در مجلهٔ لوک او عکس‌های بسیاری از مناظر و وقایع در
آمریکا
گرفت. او در این سال‌ها با «توبا متز» ازدواج کرد و به دهکدهٔ گرنویچ واقع در نیویورک نقل مکان کرد. او با دیدن فیلم‌های سینمایی در نیویورک، تحت تأثیر کارگردانی قرار گرفت.
دوران فیلم‌سازی [ ویرایش ]
در سال ۱۹۵۱ «الکس سینگر» دوست کوبریک او را تشویق کرد که یک
فیلم مستند
کوتاه برای شرکت March of Time بسازد. کوبریک موافقت کرد و با هزینهٔ شخصی فیلم
روز نبرد
را ساخت. اگرچه پخش‌کننده در همان سال کارش را تعطیل کرد، اما کوبریک توانست فیلم را به قیمت ۱۰۰ دلار به شرکت «آر. ک. او» (به
انگلیسی :
RKO ) بفروشد. کوبریک کار در مجله لوک را رها کرد و دومین مستند کوتاهش را با نام «کشیش پرنده» در همان سال و با سرمایه‌گذاری RKO ساخت. سومین فیلمش «ملوان» اولین فیلم رنگی او به مدت ۳۰ دقیقه، تبلیغی برای «اتحادیهٔ جهانی ملوانان» بود. این فیلم‌ها همراه با چند فیلم کوتاه دیگر که اکنون باقی نمانده‌اند، تنها آثار او در گونه سینمای مستند بودند. او همچنین دستیار کارگردان یکی از قسمت‌های
برنامه تلویزیونی
«اتوبوس همگانی» درباره زندگی
آبراهام لینکلن
بود.
«هراس و هوس» در سال ۱۹۵۳ اولین فیلم داستانی کوبریک بود. هراس و هوس، داستان گروهی سرباز بود که در جنگی خیالی پشت خطوط دشمن گیر افتاده بودند. در پایان آن‌ها درمی‌یافتند که تصویر دشمنان درواقع همان تصویر خودشان است (بازیگران دو نقش یکی بودند). کوبریک و همسرش توبا متز تنها عوامل فیلم بودند و داستان را دوست کوبریک «هوارد ساکلر» نوشته بود که بعدها نویسندهٔ موفقی شد. فیلم با برخورد خوبی مواجه شد اما توفیق تجاری نیافت. بعدها وقتی کوبریک کارگردان مهمی شد آن را اثر یک تازه‌کار که باعث خجالت او است نامید و نگذاشت که در هیچ‌جا به عنوان آثار قبلی او نمایش داده شود. بعدها به شکل غیررسمی به صورت DVD منتشر شد.
زندگی مشترک او با «توبا» دوست دوران مدرسه‌اش هم‌زمان با ساخت «هراس و هوس» پایان یافت. او با «روت سوبوتکا» رقصندهٔ اتریشی در سال ۱۹۵۴ ازدواج کرد. او باید در فیلم بعدی کوبریک با نام «بوسهٔ قاتل» (۱۹۵۵) هنرنمایی می‌کرد. بوسهٔ قاتل، همانند «هراس و هوس» فیلمی کوتاه با زمانی کم‌تر از یک ساعت بود. و همانند آن با توفیق تجاری و انتقادی کمی مواجه شد. فیلم داستان مشت‌زن سنگین‌وزنی است که در پایان دوران حرفه‌ای خود درگیر یک جنایت می‌شود. این دو فیلم با سرمایه خانوادگی خود کوبریک تهیه شدند.
اولین فیلم حرفه‌ای [ ویرایش ]
آلکس سینگر، کوبریک را به تهیه‌کنندهٔ جوانی به نام «جیمز بی هریس» معرفی کرد و آن دو برای تمام عمر دوست هم باقی‌ماندند. شرکت مشترک آن دو هریس-کوبریک، تهیه کنندهٔ سه فیلم بعدی او بود. آن دو حقوق کتاب «شکست کامل» (به
انگلیسی :
Clean Break ) نوشتهٔ «لیونل وایت» را خریدند، کوبریک و «جیم تامپسون» آن را به داستانی دربارهٔ سرقت از یک مسابقه که پایان وحشتناکی دارد تبدیل کردند. «استرلینگ هیدن» در این فیلم بازی کرد.
«کشتن» اولین فیلم کوبریک با بازیگران و دست‌اندرکاران حرفه‌ای بود. فیلم به‌خوبی از روش داستان‌گویی غیرخطی استفاده کرده بود که در دههٔ ۵۰ نامتداول بود و اگرچه توفیق تجاری نیافت ولی با تحسین منتقدان مواجه شد. تحسین زیاد از فیلم توجه استودیوی «متروگلدین مه‌یر» را جلب کرد و به او پیشنهاد ساخت دو فیلم‌نامه که در اختیار آن‌ها بود داده شد. کوبریک داستان «رازهای آشکار» نوشتهٔ نویسندهٔ
آلمانی
«اشتفان تسوایگ» را انتخاب کرد. اما آن‌ها پیش از ساخت به توافق نرسیدند.

Stanley Kubrick
( / ˈ k uː b r ɪ k / ; July 26, 1928 – March 7, 1999) was an American film director, screenwriter, producer,
cinematographer ,
editor
and photographer. Part of the
New Hollywood
film-making wave, Kubrick's films are considered by film historian
Michel Ciment
to be "among the most important contributions to world cinema in the twentieth century", and he is frequently cited as one of the greatest and most influential directors of all time. His films, which are typically adaptations of novels or short stories, cover a wide range of genres, and are noted for their
realism , dark humor, unique cinematography, extensive set designs, and evocative use of music.
Kubrick grew up in
The Bronx
in New York City, and attended
William Howard Taft High School
from 1941 to 1945. Although he only received average grades, Kubrick displayed a keen interest in literature, photography and film from a young age, and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school. After a period working as a photographer for
Look
magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s, he began making short films on a shoestring budget, and made his first major Hollywood film,
The Killing , for
United Artists
in 1956. This was followed by two collaborations with
Kirk Douglas , the war picture
Paths of Glory
(1957) and the historical epic
Spartacus
(1960). His reputation as a filmmaker in Hollywood grew, and he was approached by
Marlon Brando
to film what would become
One-Eyed Jacks
(1961), though Brando eventually decided to direct it himself. Creative differences arising from his work with Douglas and the film studios, a dislike of Hollywood, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick to move to the United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career. His home at
Childwickbury Manor
in
Hertfordshire , which he shared with his wife
Christiane , became his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing and management of production details. This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first British productions were two films with
Peter Sellers ,
Lolita
(1962) and
Dr. Strangelove
(1964).
Kubrick is noted for his attention to detail and evocative use of music. A demanding perfectionist, he assumed control over most aspects of the
filmmaking
process, from direction and writing to editing, and took painstaking care with researching his films and staging scenes, working in close coordination with his actors and other collaborators. He often asked for several dozen retakes of the same scene in a movie, which resulted in many conflicts with his casts. Despite the resulting notoriety among actors, many of Kubrick's films broke new ground in cinematography. The scientific realism and innovative special effects of
2001: A Space Odyssey
(1968) were without precedent in the history of cinema, and the film earned him his only personal Oscar, for Best
Visual Effects .
Steven Spielberg
has referred to the film as his generation's "big bang", and it often tops polls of the
greatest films ever made . For the 18th-century period film
Barry Lyndon
(1975), Kubrick obtained lenses developed by Zeiss for
NASA , in order to film scenes under natural candlelight. With
The Shining
(1980), he became one of the first directors to make use of a
Steadicam
for stabilized and fluid tracking shots. While many of Kubrick's films were controversial and initially received mixed reviews upon release—particularly
A Clockwork Orange
(1971), which Kubrick pulled from circulation following a mass media frenzy—most of his films were nominated for
Oscars ,
Golden Globes
or
BAFTA
Awards. His last film,
Eyes Wide Shut , was completed shortly before his death in 1999.

Early life
Stanley Kubrick was born on July 26, 1928, in Lying-In Hospital at 307 2nd Avenue in
The Bronx , New York City. He was the first of two children of Jacob Leonard Kubrick (May 21, 1902 – October 19, 1985), known as Jack or Jacques, and his wife Sadie Gertrude Kubrick (née Perveler; October 28, 1903 – April 23, 1985), known as Gert, both of whom were Jewish. His sister, Barbara Mary Kubrick, was born in May 1934. [ 1 ]
Jack Kubrick, whose parents and paternal grandparents were of
Polish ,
Austrian , and
Romanian
origin, was a doctor, [ 2 ]
graduating from the
New York Homeopathic Medical College
in 1927, the same year he married Kubrick's mother, the child of Austrian immigrants. [ 3 ]
Kubrick's great-grandfather, Hersh Kubrick (also spelled 'Kubrik' or 'Kubrike'), arrived at
Ellis Island
via
Liverpool
by ship on December 27, 1899 at the age of 47, leaving behind his wife and two grown-up children, one of whom was Stanley's grandfather Elias, to start a new life with a younger woman. [ 4 ]
Elias Kubrick followed in 1902. [ 5 ]
At Stanley's birth, the Kubricks lived in an apartment at 2160 Clinton Avenue in the Bronx. [ 6 ]
Although his parents had been married in a Jewish ceremony, Kubrick did not have a religious upbringing, and, in his later life, he professed an
atheistic
view of the universe. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
By the district standards of the West Bronx, the family were fairly wealthy, his father earning a good income from his work as a physician. [ 9 ]
Soon after the birth of his sister, Kubrick began schooling in Public School 3 in The Bronx, and moved to Public School 90 in June 1938. Although his IQ was discovered to be above average, his attendance was poor, and he missed 56 days in his first term alone, as many as he attended. [ 10 ]
He displayed an interest in literature from a young age, and began reading Greek and Roman myths and the fables of the
Grimm brothers
which "instilled in him a lifelong affinity with Europe". [ 11 ]
He spent most Saturdays during the summer months watching the
New York Yankees , and would later photograph two boys watching the game in an assignment for
Look
magazine to emulate his own childhood excitement with baseball. [ 9 ]
When Kubrick was twelve, his father taught him
chess . The game remained a lifelong obsession and appeared in many scenes in his films. [ 12 ]
Kubrick, who later became a member of the
United States Chess Federation , explained that chess helped him develop "patience and discipline" in making decisions. [ 13 ]
At the age of thirteen, Kubrick's father bought him a
Graflex
camera, triggering a fascination with
still photography . He became friends with a neighbor, Marvin Taub, who shared his passion for photography. Taub had his own darkroom where he and the young Kubrick would spend many hours perusing over photographs and watching the chemicals "magically make images on photographic paper". [ 1 ]
The two would indulge in numerous photographic projects, crawling the streets looking for interesting subjects to capture, and would also spend much time in local cinemas studying films. Freelance photographer
Weegee
(Arthur Fellig) was a considerable influence on the young Kubrick in his development as a photographer; he would later hire Fellig as the special stills photographer for
Dr Strangelove . [ 14 ]
As a teenager, Kubrick was also interested in
jazz , and briefly attempted a career as a drummer. [ 15 ]
Kubrick attended
William Howard Taft High School
from 1941 to 1945. One of his classmates was Edith Gormezano, later known as the singer
Eydie Gorme . [ 16 ]
Though he joined the school's photographic club which permitted him to photograph the school's events in their magazine, [ 1 ]
he was a mediocre student, with a meager 67
grade average . [ 17 ]
Introverted and shy, Kubrick had a low attendance record, and often skipped school to watch double-feature films. [ 18 ]
He graduated in 1945, but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from the Second World War, eliminated hope of higher education. Later in life, Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of education in general, maintaining that nothing about school interested him. His father was disappointed in his failure to achieve excellence in school, of which he felt Stanley was fully capable. He encouraged him to read from his library at home while, at the same time, permitting him to take up photography as a serious hobby. [ 7 ]
Photographic career
Kubrick with showgirl Rosemary Williams in 1949
While still in high school, Kubrick was chosen as an official school photographer for a year. In the mid 1940s, since he was not able to gain admission to day session classes at colleges, he briefly attended evening classes at the
City College of New York
(CCNY). [ 19 ]
Eventually, he sold a photographic series to
Look
magazine, having taken a photo to Helen O'Brian, head of the photographic department, who purchased it without hesitation for £25 on the spot. [ 20 ] [ a ]
It was printed on June 26, 1945. Kubrick supplemented his income by playing chess "for quarters" in
Washington Square Park
and various
Manhattan
chess clubs. [ 22 ]

Look
magazine, 1949
In 1946, he became an apprentice photographer for
Look
and later a full-time staff photographer. G. Warren Schloat Jr., another new photographer for the magazine at the time, recalled that he thought Kubrick lacked the personality to make it as a director in Hollywood, remarking, "Stanley was a quiet fellow. He didn't say much. He was thin, skinny, and kind of poor—like we all were". [ 23 ]
Kubrick quickly became known for his story-telling in photographs through mini photo stories. His first, published on April 16, 1946, was entitled "A Short Story from a Movie Balcony" and staged a fracas between a man and a woman, during which the man is slapped in the face, caught genuinely by surprise. [ 20 ]
In another assignment, eighteen pictures of people waiting in a dental office demonstrated an early ability by Kubrick to capture people and their feelings in a given environment.
[ 24 ]
In 1948 he was sent to Portugal to document a travel piece, and covered the
Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus
in
Sarasota, Florida . [ 25 ] [ b ]
Kubrick, a boxing enthusiast, eventually began photographing boxing matches for the magazine. His earliest, "Prizefighter", was published on January 18, 1949 and captured a boxing match and the events leading up to it, featuring
Walter Cartier . [ 27 ]
On April 2, 1949 he published a photo essay, named "Chicago-City of Extremes" in
Look , which displayed his talent early on for creating atmosphere with imagery, including a photograph ( pictured ) taken above a congested Chicago street at night. The following year, on July 18, 1950, the magazine published his photo essay, "Working Debutante -
Betsy von Furstenberg ", which featured a
Pablo Picasso
portrait of Angel F. de Soto in the background. [ 28 ]
Kubrick was also assigned to photograph numerous jazz musicians, from
Frank Sinatra
and
Errol Garner , to
George Lewis ,
Eddie Condon ,
Phil Napoleon ,
Oscar Celestin ,
Alphonse Picou ,
Muggsy Spanier ,
Sharkey Bonano , and others. [ 29 ]
Kubrick married his high-school sweetheart Toba Metz on May 28, 1948. They lived together in a small apartment at 36 West 16th Street, off
6th Avenue
in
Greenwich Village . [ 30 ]
During this time, Kubrick began frequenting film screenings at the
Museum of Modern Art
and the cinemas of New York City. He was inspired by the complex, fluid camerawork of the director
Max Ophüls , whose films influenced Kubrick's later visual style, and by the director
Elia Kazan , whom he described as America's "best director" at that time, with his ability of "performing miracles" with his actors. [ 31 ]
Friends began to notice that Kubrick had become obsessed with the art of filmmaking—one friend, David Vaughn, observed that Kubrick would scrutinize the film at the cinema when it went silent, and would go back to reading his paper when people started talking. [ 20 ]
He also spent many hours reading books on film theory and writing down notes.
Sergei Eisenstein 's theoretical writings had a profound impact on Kubrick, and he took a great number of notes from books in the library of
Arthur Rothstein , the photographic technical director of
Look
magazine. [ 32 ] [ c ]
Film career
Short films (1951–1953)
Kubrick shared a love of film with his school friend Alexander Singer, who after graduating from high school had the intention of directing a film version of Homer's
The Iliad . It was through Singer, who worked in the offices of the newsreel production company,
The March of Time , that Kubrick learned that it could cost $40,000 to make a proper short film, money he could not afford. However, he had $1500 in savings and managed to produce a few short documentaries fueled by encouragement from Singer. He began learning all he could about filmmaking on his own, calling film suppliers, laboratories, and equipment rental houses. [ 33 ]
Kubrick decided to make a short film documentary about boxer
Walter Cartier , whom he had photographed and written about for
Look
magazine a year earlier. He rented a camera and produced a 16-minute black-and-white documentary,
Day of the Fight . Kubrick found the money independently to finance it. He had considered asking
Montgomery Clift
to narrate it, whom he had met during a photographic session for
Look , but settled on CBS news veteran
Douglas Edwards . [ 34 ]
According to Paul Duncan the film was "remarkably accomplished for a first film", and was notable for using the
reverse tracking shot
to film a scene in which the brothers walk towards the camera, a device later to become one of Kubrick's characteristic camera movements. [ 35 ]
Vincent Cartier, Walter's brother and manager, later reflected on his observations of Kubrick during the filming. He said, "Stanley was very stoic, impassive but imaginative type person with strong, imaginative thoughts. He commanded respect in a quiet, shy way. Whatever he wanted, you complied, he just captivated you. Anybody who worked with Stanley did just what Stanley wanted". [ 33 ] [ d ]
After a score was added by Singer's friend Gerald Fried, Kubrick had spent $3900 in making it, and sold it to RKO-Pathé for $4000, which was the most the company had ever paid for a short film at the time. [ 35 ]
Kubrick described his first effort at filmmaking as having been valuable since he believed himself to have been forced to do most of the work, [ 36 ]
and he later declared that the "best education in film is to make one". [ 1 ]
Inspired by this early success, Kubrick quit his job at
Look
and visited professional filmmakers in New York City, asking many detailed questions about the technical aspects of film-making. He stated that he was given the confidence during this period to become a filmmaker because of the number of bad films he had seen, remarking that "I don't know a goddamn thing about movies, but I know I can make a better film than that". [ 37 ]
He began making
Flying Padre
(1951), a film which documents Reverend Fred Stadtmueller, who travels some 4,000 miles to visit his 11 churches. The film was originally going to be called "Sky Pilot", a pun on the slang term for a priest. [ 38 ]
During the course of the film the priest performs a burial service, confronts a boy bullying a girl, and makes an emergency flight to aid a sick mother and baby into an ambulance. Several of the views from and of the plane in
Flying Padre
are later echoed in
2001:A Space Odyssey
in the footage of the spacecraft, and a series of close-ups of faces at the funeral in the film are clearly inspired by
Sergei Eisenstein 's
Battleship Potemkin
and
Ivan the Terrible . [ 35 ]
Flying Padre
was followed by
The Seafarers
(1953), Kubrick's first color film, which was shot for the
Seafarers International Union
in June 1953. There are shots of ships, machinery, a canteen, and a union meeting. For the cafeteria scene in the film, Kubrick chose a long, sideways-shooting
dolly shot
to establish the life of the seafarer's community; this shot is an early demonstration of a signature technique that he later used in his feature films. The montage of speaker and audience echoes scenes from Eisenstein's
Strike
and
October . [ 39 ]
Day of the Fight ,
Flying Padre
and
The Seafarers
constitute Kubrick's only surviving documentary works, although some historians believe he made others. [ 40 ]
Early feature work (1953–1955)
Kubrick at the age of 21
After raising $1000 showing his short films to friends and family, Kubrick found the finances to begin making his first feature film,
Fear and Desire
(1953), originally running with the title
The Trap , written by his friend
Howard Sackler . Kubrick's uncle, Martin Perveler, a Los Angeles businessman, invested a further $9000 on condition that he be credited as executive producer of the film. [ 41 ]
Kubrick assembled several actors and a small crew totaling fourteen people (five actors, five crewman and four Mexicans to help transport the equipment) and flew to the
San Gabriel Mountains
in California for a five-week low-budget shoot. [ 41 ]
Later renamed
The Shape of Fear
before finally being named
Fear and Desire , it is an allegorical tale about a team of soldiers who survive a plane crash and are caught behind enemy lines in a fictional war. During the course of the film one of the soldiers becomes infatuated with a beautiful girl in the woods and binds her to a tree. This scene is noted for its close-ups of the face of the actress. To reduce production costs, Kubrick had intended to make it a silent picture, but in the end the adding of sounds, effects and music brought the production over-budget to around $53,000. [ 42 ]
He had to be bailed out by producer
Richard de Rochemont , on condition that he help in his production of a five-part television series about
Abraham Lincoln
on location in
Hodgenville, Kentucky . [ 43 ]
Upon release,
Fear and Desire
garnered some respectable reviews but was still a commercial failure. Critics such as the reviewer from
The New York Times
believed that Kubrick's professionalism as a photographer shone through in the picture, and that he "artistically caught glimpses of the grotesque attitudes of death, the wolfishness of hungry men as well as their bestiality, and in one scene, the wracking effect of lust on a pitifully juvenile soldier and the pinioned girl he is guarding". Columbia University scholar
Mark Van Doren
was particularly impressed with the tree girl footage, remarking that it would make movie history as a "beautiful, terrifying and weird" scene which illustrated Kubrick's immense talent and guaranteed his future success. [ 44 ]
Kubrick, however, was later embarrassed by his amateur effort and tried to keep it out of circulation. [ 45 ] [ e ]
Following
Fear and Desire , Kubrick began working on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the commercial failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but began working on a
film noir
script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title
Kiss Me, Kill Me , and then
The Nymph and the Maniac ,
Killer's Kiss
(1955) is a 67-minute film noir film about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like
Fear and Desire , it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. [ 39 ]
Kubrick began shooting footage in
Times Square , and frequently explored during the filming process, discovering new angles and ways to generate imagery, and experimenting with lighting. He initially decided on recording the sound on location but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound. [ 46 ]
Alfred Hitchcock 's
Blackmail
(1929) directly influenced the film with the painting laughing at a character, and
Martin Scorsese
has in turn cited Kubrick's innovative shooting angles and atmospheric shots in
Killer's Kiss
as an influence on
Raging Bull
(1980). [ 47 ]
Actress
Irene Kane , the star of the film, observed: "Stanley's a fascinating character. He thinks movies should move, with a minimum of dialogue, and he's all for sex and sadism". [ 48 ]
The film met with limited commercial success and barely made any money over its production budget of $75,000. [ 47 ]
The acting is considered by critics to be mediocre, and the plot a weak one, lacking originality, [ 49 ]
a mistake that Kubrick never made again. [ 47 ] [ f ]
Hollywood success (1956–1961)
Sterling Hayden , circa 1953
While playing chess in Washington Square, Kubrick met producer
James B. Harris , who considered Kubrick to be "the most intelligent, most creative person I have ever come in contact with", and the two formed the Harris-Kubrick Pictures Corporation in 1955. [ 52 ]
Harris purchased the rights to
Lionel White 's novel
Clean Break
for $10,000, [ g ]
and upon Kubrick's suggestion, they hired film noir novelist
Jim Thompson
to write the script for the film—which later became
The Killing
(1956)—about a meticulously planned racetrack robbery gone wrong. The film starred
Sterling Hayden , whom Kubrick had been impressed with in
The Asphalt Jungle
(1950). [ 54 ]
Kubrick and Harris moved to Los Angeles from New York and signed with the
Jaffe Agency
to shoot the picture, which became Kubrick's first full-length feature film shot with a professional cast and crew. The Union in Hollywood stated that Kubrick would not be permitted to be both the director and the cinematographer of the movie, so veteran cinematographer
Lucien Ballard
was hired for the shooting. Kubrick agreed to waive his fee for the production, which was shot in just 24 days on a budget of $330,000. [ 55 ]
He clashed with Ballard during the shooting, and on one occasion Kubrick threatened to fire Ballard following a camera dispute, despite being only 27 years old at the time and 20 years Ballard's junior. [ 54 ]
Hayden recalled that Kubrick was "cold and detached. Very mechanical, always confident. I've worked with few directors who are that good". [ 56 ]
The Killing
failed to secure a proper release across the United States, and it was only at the last minute that it was promoted as a second feature to
Bandido!
(1956), and it failed to make money. Several critics, however, did notice the film, with the reviewer from
Time
comparing Kubrick's work to that of
Orson Welles . [ 57 ]
Many contemporary critics regard this film as one of his best, and its non-linear narrative and clinical execution had a major influence on later directors, including
Quentin Tarantino .
Dore Schary
of
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
was impressed with the film, and offered the duo $75,000 to write, direct and produce a film, which ultimately became
Paths of Glory
(1957). [ 58 ] [ h ]
Adolphe Menjou
( left ) and
Kirk Douglas
( right ) in
Paths of Glory
(1957)
Kubrick's next film,
Paths of Glory , set during
World War I , is based on
Humphrey Cobb 's 1935 anti-war novel, which Kubrick had read while waiting in his father's office. Schary of MGM was familiar with the novel, but stated that the company would not finance another war picture after having just done another anti-war film,
The Red Badge of Courage
(1951). [ i ]
After Schary was fired by MGM in a major shake-up, Kubrick and Harris managed to interest
Kirk Douglas
in playing Colonel Dax. [ 60 ] [ j ]
The film, shot in
Munich , Germany from January 1957, follows a French army unit ordered on an impossible mission, and follows with a war trial of Colonel Dax and his men for misconduct. For the battle scene, Kubrick meticulously lined up six cameras one after the other along the boundary of no man's land, with each camera capturing a specific field and numbered, and gave each of the hundreds of extras a number for the zone in which they would die. [ 61 ]
Kubrick himself operated an
Arriflex camera
for the battle, zooming in on Douglas.
Paths of Glory
became Kubrick's first significant commercial success, and established him as an up-and-coming young filmmaker. Critics praised the film's unsentimental, spare, and unvarnished combat scenes and its raw, black-and-white cinematography.
Bosley Crowther
of
The New York Times
wrote: "The close, hard eye of Mr Kubrick's sullen camera bores directly into the minds of scheming men and into the hearts of patient, frightened soldiers who have to accept orders to die". [ 62 ]
Despite the praise, the Christmas release date was criticized, [ 63 ]
and the subject was a controversial one in Europe. The film was banned in France until 1974 for its "unflattering" depiction of the French military, and was censored by the Swiss Army until 1970. [ 62 ]
The film poster for
Spartacus
(1960)
Marlon Brando
contacted Kubrick, asking him to direct a film adaption of the Charles Neider western novel,
The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones , featuring
Pat Garrett
and
Billy the Kid . [ 62 ] [ k ]
Brando was highly impressed with the director, remarking that "Stanley is unusually perceptive, and delicately attuned to people. He has an adroit intellect, and is a creative thinker—not a repeater, not a fact-gatherer. He digests what he learns and brings to a new project an original point of view and a reserved passion". [ 65 ]
The two worked on a script for six months, begun by a then unknown
Sam Peckinpah . Many disputes broke out over the project and in the end Kubrick distanced himself from what would become
One-Eyed Jacks
(1961). [ l ]
In February 1959, Kubrick received a phone call from Kirk Douglas asking him to direct
Spartacus
(1960), based on the true life story of the historical figure
Spartacus
and the events of the
Third Servile War . Douglas had acquired the rights to the novel by
Howard Fast
and blacklisted screenwriter
Dalton Trumbo
began penning the script. [ 70 ]
It was produced by Douglas, who also starred as rebellious slave Spartacus, and cast
Laurence Olivier
as his foe, the Roman general and politician
Marcus Licinius Crassus . Douglas hired Kubrick for a reported fee of $150,000 to take over direction soon after he fired director
Anthony Mann . [ 71 ]
Kubrick had, at 31, already directed four feature films, and this became his largest by far, with a cast of over 10,000 and a large budget of $6 million. [ m ] [ 70 ]
At the time this was the most expensive film ever made in America, and Kubrick became the youngest director in Hollywood history to helm an epic. [ 73 ]
It was the first time that Kubrick filmed using the anamorphic 35mm horizontal
Super Technirama
process to achieve ultra-high definition, which allowed him to capture large panoramic scenes, including one with 8,000 trained soldiers from Spain representing the Roman army. [ n ]
Disputes broke out during the filming. Kubrick complained about not having full creative control over the artistic aspects, insisting on improvizing extensively during the production. [ 75 ] [ o ]
Kubrick and Douglas were also at odds over the script, with Kubrick angering Douglas when he cut all but two of his lines from the opening 30 minutes. [ 79 ]
Despite the on-set troubles,
Spartacus
was a critical and commercial success, earning $14.6 million at the box office in its first run. [ 75 ]
The film established Kubrick as a major director, receiving six Academy Award nominations and winning four, and it ultimately convinced him that if so much could be made of such a problematic production, he could achieve anything. [ 80 ]
Spartacus
marked the end of the working relationship between Kubrick and Douglas. [ p ]
Collaboration with Peter Sellers (1962–1964)
Sue Lyon , who played the role of Dolores "Lolita" Haze in
Lolita
In 1962, Kubrick and Harris made a decision to film Kubrick's next film
Lolita
in England, due to clauses placed on the contract by producers
Warner Brothers
that gave them complete control over every aspect of the film, and the fact that the
Eady plan
permitted producers to write off the costs if 80% of the crew were English. Instead, they signed a $1 million deal with
Eliot Hyman 's
Associated Artists Productions , and a clause which gave them the artistic freedom that they desired. [ 82 ]
Lolita , Kubrick's first attempt at
black comedy , was an adaptation of the
novel
of the same name by
Vladimir Nabokov , the story of a middle-aged college professor becoming infatuated with a 12-year-old girl. Stylistically,
Lolita , starring
Peter Sellers ,
James Mason ,
Shelley Winters
and
Sue Lyon , was a transitional film for Kubrick, "marking the turning point from a naturalistic cinema ... to the surrealism of the later films", according to film critic
Gene Youngblood . [ 83 ]
Kubrick was deeply impressed by the chameleon-like range of actor Peter Sellers and gave him one of his first opportunities to improvize wildly during shooting, while filming him with three cameras. [ 84 ] [ q ]
Lolita
was shot over 88 days on a budget of $2 million at
Elstree Studios , between October 1960 and March 1961. [ 87 ] [ 88 ]
During the production, Kubrick often clashed with Shelley Winters, whom he found "very difficult" and demanding, and at one point he almost fired her. [ 89 ]
It was Kubrick's first film to generate controversy because of its provocative story, even though he was forced to remove much of the erotic element of the relationship between Mason's Humbert and Lyon's Lolita which had been evident in the novel, in order to comply with the censors. [ 90 ] [ 91 ]
The film was not a major critical or commercial success upon release, earning $3.7 million at the box office on its opening run. [ 87 ] [ r ]
It has since become acclaimed by film critics and holds a 95% rating on
Rotten Tomatoes
as of August 2015. [ 92 ]
Social historian Stephen E. Kercher documented that the film "demonstrated that its director possessed a keen, satiric insight into the social landscape and sexual hang-ups of cold war America", while Jon Fortgang of
Film4
wrote: "Lolita, with its acute mix of pathos and comedy, and Mason's mellifluous delivery of Nabokov's sparkling lines, remains the definitive depiction of tragic transgression". [ 92 ]
Peter Sellers as President Merkin Muffley
Kubrick's next project was
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb
(1964), another satirical black comedy. Kubrick became preoccupied with the issue of
nuclear war
as the
Cold War
unfolded in the 1950s, and even considered moving to Australia because he feared that New York City might be a likely target for the Russians. He studied over 40 military and political research books on the subject and eventually reached the conclusion that "nobody really knew anything and the whole situation was absurd". [ 93 ]
After reading the novel
Red Alert , he decided that a "serious treatment" of the subject would not be believable, and thought that some of its most salient points would be fodder for comedy. [ 94 ]
Kubrick hired noted black comedy and satirical writer
Terry Southern
to transform
Red Alert
into "an outrageous black comedy", loaded with sexual innuendo, [ 95 ]
a film which showed Kubrick's talents as "unique kind of absurdist" according to the film scholar Abrams. [ 96 ]
Kubrick found that
Dr. Strangelove , a $2 million production [ 97 ]
which employed what became the "first important visual effects crew in the world", [ 98 ]
would be impossible to make in the U.S. for various technical and political reasons, forcing him to move production to England. It was shot in 15 weeks, ending in April 1963, after which Kubrick spent eight months editing it. [ 99 ]
Peter Sellers again agreed to work with Kubrick, and ended up playing three different roles in the film. [ s ]
Upon release, the film stirred up much controversy and mixed opinions.
The New York Times
film critic
Bosley Crowther
worried that it was a "discredit and even contempt for our whole defense establishment ... the most shattering sick joke I've ever come across",
[ 101 ]
while
Robert Brustein
of
Out of This World
in a February 1970 article called it a " juvenalian
satire". [ 99 ]
Kubrick responded to the criticism, stating: "A satirist is someone who has a very skeptical view of human nature, but who still has the optimism to make some sort of a joke out of it. However brutal that joke might be". [ 102 ]
Today the film is considered to be one of the sharpest comedy films ever made, and holds a near perfect 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 68 reviews as of August 2015. [ 103 ]
It was voted the 39th greatest American film and third greatest comedy film of all time by the
American Film Institute , [ 104 ] [ 105 ]
and in 2010 it was voted the sixth best comedy film of all time by
The Guardian . [ 106 ]
Ground-breaking cinema (1965–1971)
A model of the bedroom which appeared at the end of
2001: A Space Odyssey
Kubrick spent five years developing his next film,
2001: A Space Odyssey
(1968), having been highly impressed with science fiction writer
Arthur C. Clarke 's novel
Childhood's End , about a superior race of alien beings who assist mankind in eliminating their old selves. After meeting Clarke in New York City in April 1964, Kubrick made the suggestion to work on his 1948 short story
The Sentinel , about a tetrahedron which is found on the Moon which alerts aliens of mankind. [ 107 ] [ 108 ]
That year, Clarke began writing the novel
2001: A Space Odyssey , and the screenplay was written by Kubrick and Clarke in collaboration. The film's theme, the birthing of one intelligence by another, is developed in two parallel intersecting stories on two very different times scales. One depicts transitions between various stages of man, from ape to "star child", as man is reborn into a new existence, each step shepherded by an enigmatic alien intelligence seen only in its artifacts: a series of seemingly indestructible eons-old black monoliths. In space, the enemy is a supercomputer known as HAL who runs the spaceship, a character which novelist
Clancy Sigal
described as being "far, far more human, more humorous and conceivably decent than anything else that may emerge from this far-seeing enterprise". [ 109 ] [ t ]
Kubrick spent a great deal of time researching the film, paying particular attention to accuracy and detail in what the future may look like. He was granted permission by
NASA
to observe the spacecraft being used in the
Ranger 9
mission for accuracy. [ 111 ]
Filming commenced on December 29, 1965 with the excavation of the monolith on the moon, [ 112 ]
and footage was shot in
Namib Desert
in early 1967, with the ape scenes completed in the summer of that year. The special effects team continued working diligently until the end of the year to complete the film, taking the cost to $10.5 million. [ 112 ]
2001: A Space Odyssey
was conceived as a
Cinerama
spectacle and was photographed in
Super Panavision 70 , giving the viewer a "dazzling mix of imagination and science" through ground-breaking effects, which earned Kubrick his only personal Oscar, an
Academy Award for Visual Effects . [ 112 ] [ u ]
Louise Sweeney of the
Christian Science Monitor
called the film the "ultimate trip" while praising one of the scenes where the viewer moves through space while witnessing a vibrant mix of lighting, color and patterns. [ 114 ]
Kubrick said of the concept of the film in an interview with
Rolling Stone : "On the deepest psychological level, the film's plot symbolized the search for God, and finally postulates what is little less than a scientific definition of God. The film revolves around this metaphysical conception, and the realistic hardware and the documentary feelings about everything were necessary in order to undermine your built-in resistance to the poetical concept". [ 115 ]
Upon release in 1968,
2001: A Space Odyssey
was not an immediate hit among many critics, who faulted its lack of dialogue, slow pacing, and seemingly impenetrable storyline.
[ 116 ] [ 117 ]
The film appeared to defy genre convention, much unlike any science-fiction movie before it, [ 118 ]
and clearly different from any of Kubrick's earlier films or stories. Kubrick was particularly outraged by a scathing review from
Pauline Kael , who called it "the biggest amateur movie of them all", with Kubrick doing "really every dumb thing he ever wanted to do".
[ 119 ]
Despite the initial poor critical response,
2001: A Space Odyssey
gradually gained popularity and earned $31 million worldwide by the end of 1972. [ 112 ] [ v ]
Today it is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, and is a staple on All Time Top 10 lists. [ 121 ] [ 122 ]
Baxter describes the film as "one of the most admired and discussed creations in the history of cinema", [ 123 ]
and Steven Spielberg has referred to it as "the big bang of his film making generation". [ 124 ]
For LoBrutto it "positioned Stanley Kubrick as a pure artist ranked among the masters of cinema". [ 125 ]
An example of the erotica from
A Clockwork Orange
(1971)
After completing
2001: A Space Odyssey , Kubrick searched for a project that he could film quickly on a small budget. He settled on
A Clockwork Orange
(1971) at the end of 1969, an exploration of violence and experimental rehabilitation by law enforcement authorities, based around the character of
Alex
(portrayed by
Malcolm McDowell ). Kubrick had originally received a copy of
Anthony Burgess 's
novel of the same name
from Terry Southern while they were working on
Dr. Strangelove , but had rejected it on the grounds that Nadsat, [ w ]
a street language for young teenagers, was too difficult to comprehend. In 1969, the decision to make a film about the degeneration of youth was a more timely one; the
New Hollywood
movement was witnessing a great number of films that were centered around the sexuality and rebelliousness of young people, which no doubt influenced Kubrick in Baxter's opinion. [ 126 ]
A Clockwork Orange
was shot over the winter of 1970-1 on a budget of £2 million. [ 127 ]
Kubrick abandoned his use of CinemaScope in the filming, deciding that the 1:66:1 widescreen format was, in the words of Baxter, an "acceptable compromise between spectacle and intimacy", and favored his "rigorously symmetrical framing", which "increased the beauty of his compositions". [ 128 ]
The film heavily features "pop erotica" of the period, including a giant white plastic set of male genitals, decor which Kubrick had intended to give it a "slightly futuristic" look. [ 129 ]
McDowell's role in
Lindsay Anderson 's
if....
(1968) was crucial to his casting as Alex, [ x ]
and Kubrick professed that he probably wouldn't have made the film if McDowell had been unavailable. [ 131 ]
Because of its depiction of teenage violence,
A Clockwork Orange
became one of the most controversial films of the decade, and part of an ongoing debate about violence and its glorification in cinema. It received an X-rated certificate upon release, just before Christmas in 1971, though many critics saw much of the violence depicted in the film as satirical, and less violent than
Straw Dogs
which had been released a month earlier. [ 132 ]
Kubrick personally pulled the film from release in the United Kingdom after receiving death threats following a series of copycat crimes based on the film; it was thus completely unavailable legally in the UK until after Kubrick's death, and not re-released until 2000. [ 133 ] [ y ]
John Trevelyan, the censor of the film, personally considered
A Clockwork Orange
to be "perhaps the most brilliant piece of cinematic art I've ever seen, and believed it to present an "intellectual argument rather than a sadistic spectacle" in its depiction of violence, but acknowledged that many would not agree. [ 135 ]
Ignoring the negative media hype over the film,
A Clockwork Orange
received four Academy Award nominations, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Editing, and was named by the
New York Film Critics Circle
as the Best Film of 1971. [ 136 ]
After
William Friedkin
won Best Director for
The French Connection
that year, he told the press: "Speaking personally, I think Stanley Kubrick is the best American film-maker of the year. In fact, not just this year, but the best, period". [ 137 ]
Period and horror filming (1972–1980)
Ryan O'Neal , the lead actor of
Barry Lyndon
(1975)
Barry Lyndon
(1975) is an adaptation of
William Makepeace Thackeray 's
The Luck of Barry Lyndon
(also known as
Barry Lyndon ), a
picaresque novel
about the adventures of an 18th-century Irish gambler and social climber.
John Calley
of Warner Bros agreed in 1972 to invest $2.5 million into the film, on condition that Kubrick approach major Hollywood stars, to ensure it of success. [ 138 ]
Like previous films, Kubrick and his art department conducted an enormous amount of research, and he went from knowing very little about the 18th century at the start of the production to becoming an expert on it. Extensive photographs were taken of locations and artwork in particular, and paintings were meticulously replicated from works of the great masters of the period in the film. [ 139 ] [ z ]
The film was shot on location in
Ardmore, County Waterford , Ireland beginning in the autumn of 1973, at a cost of $11 million with a cast and crew of 170. [ 141 ]
The decision to shoot in Ireland stemmed from the fact that it still retained many buildings from the 18th century period which England lacked. [ 142 ]
The production was problematic from the start, plagued with heavy rain and political strife involving Northern Ireland at the time. [ 143 ]
After Kubrick received death threats from the
IRA
in the New Year of 1974 due to the shooting scenes with English soldiers, he fled Ireland with his family on a ferry from
Dún Laoghaire
under an assumed identity, and filming resumed in England. [ 144 ] [ 145 ]
William Hogarth 's
The Country Dance
(c.1745) illustrates the type of interior scene that Kubrick sought to emulate with
Barry Lyndon .
Baxter notes that
Barry Lyndon
was the film which made Kubrick notorious for paying scrupulous attention to detail, often demanding 20 or 30 retakes of the same scene to perfect his art. [ 146 ]
Often considered to be his most authentic-looking picture, [ 147 ]
the cinematography and lighting techniques that Kubrick and cinematographer
John Alcott
used in
Barry Lyndon
were highly innovative. Most notably, interior scenes were shot with a specially adapted high-speed f/0.7
Zeiss
camera lens originally developed for NASA to be used in satellite photography. The lenses allowed many scenes to be lit only with candlelight, creating two-dimensional, diffused-light images reminiscent of 18th-century paintings. [ 148 ]
Cinematographer
Allen Daviau
states that the method gives the audience a way of seeing the characters and scenes as they would have been seen by people at the time. [ 149 ]
Many of the fight scenes were shot with a hand-held camera to produce a "sense of documentary realism and immediacy". [ 150 ]
Although
Barry Lyndon
found a great audience in France, it was a box office failure, grossing just $9.5 million in the American market, not even close to the $30 million Warner Bros. needed to generate a profit. [ 151 ]
The pace and length of
Barry Lyndon
at three hours put off many American critics and audiences, but the film was nominated for seven
Academy Awards
and won four, including Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Musical Score, more than any other Kubrick film. As with most of Kubrick's films,
Barry Lyndon' s reputation has grown through the years and it is now considered to be one of his best, particularly among filmmakers and critics. Numerous polls, such as
Village Voice
(1999),
Sight & Sound
(2002), and
Time
(2005), have rated it as one of the greatest films ever made. [ 152 ] [ 153 ] [ 154 ]
As of August 2015 it has as 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 52 reviews. [ 155 ]
Roger Ebert
referred to it as "one of the most beautiful films ever made", "certainly in every frame a Kubrick film: technically awesome, emotionally distant, remorseless in its doubt of human goodness." [ 156 ]
Several of the interiors of
Ahwahnee Hotel
were used as templates for the sets of the Overlook Hotel
The Shining , released in 1980, was adapted from the
novel
of the same name by bestselling horror writer
Stephen King .
The Shining
was not the only horror film that Kubrick had been linked to; he had turned down the directing of both
The Exorcist
(1973) and
Exorcist II: The Heretic
(1977), despite once claiming in 1966 to a friend that he had long desired to "make the world's scariest movie, involving a series of episodes that would play upon the nightmare fears of the audience". [ 157 ]
The film stars
Jack Nicholson
as a writer who takes a job as a winter caretaker of a large and isolated hotel in the Rocky Mountains. He spends the winter there with his wife, played by
Shelley Duvall , and their young son, who displays
paranormal
abilities. During their stay, they confront both Jack's descent into madness and apparent supernatural horrors lurking in the hotel. Kubrick gave his actors freedom to extend the script, and even improvise on occasion, and as a result, Nicholson was responsible for the 'Here's Johnny!' line and scene in which he's sitting at the typewriter and unleashes his anger upon his wife. [ 158 ]
So determined to produce perfection was Kubrick that he often demanded up to 70 or 80 retakes of the same scene. The bar scene with the ghostly bartender was shot 36 times, while the kitchen scene between the characters of Danny ( Danny Lloyd ) and Halloran ( Scatman Crothers ) ran for 148 takes. [ 159 ]
The aerial shots of the Overlook Hotel were shot at
Timberline Lodge
on
Mount Hood
in Oregon, while the interiors of the hotel were shot at Elstree Studios in England between May 1978 and April 1979. [ 160 ]
Cardboard models were made of all of the sets of the film, and the lighting of them was a massive undertaking, which took four months of electrical wiring. [ 161 ]
Kubrick made extensive use of the newly invented
Steadicam , a weight-balanced camera support, which allowed for smooth hand-held camera movement in scenes where a conventional camera track was impractical. According to
Garrett Brown , Steadicam's inventor, it was the first picture to utilize its full potential. [ 162 ]
Five days after release on May 23, 1980, Kubrick ordered the deletion of a final scene, in which the hotel manager Ullman ( Barry Nelson ) visits Wendy (Shelley Duvall) in hospital, believing it to have been unnecessary after witnessing the audience excitement in cinemas at the climax of the film. [ 163 ]
The Shining
opened to strong box office takings, earning $1 million on the first weekend and earning $30.9 million in American alone by the end of the year. [ 160 ]
The original critical response was mixed, and King himself detested the film and disliked Kubrick. [ 164 ]
Janet Maslin
of
The New York Times
praised the "eerie way" in which Kubrick turned an "enormous building into something cramped and claustrophobic", which would "undoubtedly amount to one of the screen's scarier haunted houses". [ 165 ]
The Shining
is now considered to be a horror cult classic,
[ 166 ]
and the American Film Institute has ranked it as the 27th greatest thriller film of all time. [ 167 ]
Later work and final years (1981–1999)
R. Lee Ermey
who portrayed the tyrannical Sergeant Hartman in
Full Metal Jacket
(1987)
Kubrick met author
Michael Herr
through mutual friend David Cornwell (novelist
John le Carré ) in 1980, and became interested in his book
Dispatches , about the
Vietnam War .
[ 168 ]
Herr had recently written Martin Sheen's narration for
Apocalypse Now
(1979). Kubrick was also intrigued by
Gustav Hasford 's Vietnam War novel
The Short-Timers .
With the vision in mind to shoot what would become
Full Metal Jacket
(1987), Kubrick began working with both Herr and Hasford separately on a script. He eventually found Hasford's novel to be "brutally honest" and decided to shoot a film which closely follows the novel. [ 168 ]
All of the film was shot at a cost of $17 million within a 30-mile radius of his house between August 1985 and September 1986, later than scheduled as Kubrick shut down production for five months following a near-fatal accident with a jeep involving Lee Ermey. [ 169 ]
A derelict gasworks in
Beckton
in the
London Docklands
area posed as the ruined city of
Huế , [ 170 ]
which makes the film visually very different from other Vietnam War films. Around 200 palm trees were imported via 40-foot trailers by road from North Africa, at a cost of £1000 a tree, and thousands of plastic plants were ordered from Hong Kong to provide foliage for the film. [ 171 ]
Kubrick explained he made the film look realistic by using natural light, and achieved a "newsreel effect" by making the Steadicam shots less steady,
[ 172 ]
which reviewers and commentators thought contributed to the bleakness and seriousness of the film. [ 173 ]
According to critic
Michel Ciment , the film contained some of Kubrick's trademark characteristics, such as his selection of ironic music, portrayals of men being dehumanized, and attention to extreme detail to achieve realism. In a later scene where United States Marines patrol the ruins of an abandoned and totally destroyed city, the theme song to the
Mickey Mouse Club
is heard as a sardonic counterpoint. [ 174 ]
The film opened strongly in June 1987, taking over $30 million in the first fifty days alone, [ 175 ]
but critically it was overshadowed by the success of
Oliver Stone 's
Platoon , released a year earlier. [ 176 ]
According to one review, notes co-star
Matthew Modine , "The first half of
FMJ
is brilliant. Then the film degenerates into a masterpiece." [ 177 ]
Roger Ebert wasn't particularly impressed with it, awarding it a mediocre 2.5 out of 4. He concluded: "Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" is more like a book of short stories than a novel", a "strangely shapeless film from the man whose work usually imposes a ferociously consistent vision on his material". [ 178 ]
The mask from
Eyes Wide Shut
(1999)
Kubrick's final film was
Eyes Wide Shut
(1999), starring
Tom Cruise
and
Nicole Kidman
as a Manhattan couple on a sexual odyssey. Tom Cruise portrays a doctor who witnesses a bizarre masked quasi-religious orgiastic ritual at a country mansion, a discovery which later threatens his life. The story is based on
Arthur Schnitzler 's 1926 Freudian novella
Traumnovelle
( Dream Story
in English), which Kubrick relocated from turn-of-the-century Vienna to New York City in the 1990s. Kubrick said of the novel: "A difficult book to describe—what good book isn't. It explores the sexual ambivalence of a happy marriage and tries to equate the importance of sexual dreams and might-have-beens with reality. All of Schnitzler's work is psychologically brilliant".
[ 179 ]
Although Kubrick was almost seventy, he worked relentlessly for 15 months in order to get the film out by its planned release date of July 16, 1999. He began working on a script with
Frederic Raphael , [ 150 ]
and worked 18 hours a day, all the while maintaining complete confidentiality about the film. Principal photography began on November 7, 1996 and ended in February 1998.
[ 180 ]
Eyes Wide Shut , like
Lolita
and
A Clockwork Orange
before it, faced censorship before release. Kubrick sent an unfinished preview copy to the stars and producers a few months before release, but his sudden death on March 7, 1999 came a few days after he finished editing. He never saw the final version released to the public,
[ 181 ]
but he did see the preview of the film with Warner Brothers, Cruise and Kidman and had reportedly told Warner executive Julian Senior that it was "my best film ever". [ 182 ]
Today, critical opinion of the film is mixed, and it is viewed less favorably than most of Kubrick's films. Roger Ebert awarded it 3.5 out 4 stars, comparing the structure to a thriller and writing that it is "like an erotic daydream about chances missed and opportunities avoided", and thought that Kubrick's use of lighting at Christmas made the film "all a little garish, like an urban sideshow." [ 183 ]
Stephen Hunter
of
The Washington Post
disliked the film, writing: "Its actually sad, rather than bad. It feels creaky, ancient, hopelessly out of touch, infatuated with the hot taboos of his youth and unable to connect with that twisty thing contemporary sexuality has become.". [ 184 ]
A.I. Artificial Intelligence
and unrealized projects
Main article:
Stanley Kubrick's unrealized projects
A.I. Artificial Intelligence
Steven Spielberg , whom Kubrick approached in 1995 to direct
A.I. Artificial Intelligence
(2001)
Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Kubrick collaborated with
Brian Aldiss
on an expansion of his short story " Super-Toys Last All Summer Long " into a three-act film. It was a futuristic fairy-tale about a robot that resembles and behaves as a child, and his efforts to become a 'real boy' in a manner similar to
Pinocchio . Kubrick approached Spielberg in 1995 with the AI script with the possibility of Steven Spielberg directing it and Kubrick producing it. [ 176 ]
Kubrick reportedly held long telephone discussions with Spielberg regarding the film, and, according to Spielberg, at one point stated that the subject matter was closer to Spielberg's sensibilities than his. [ 185 ]
Following Kubrick's death in 1999, Spielberg took the various drafts and notes left by Kubrick and his writers and composed a new screenplay based on an earlier 90-page story treatment by
Ian Watson
written under Kubrick's supervision and according to Kubrick's specifications. [ 186 ]
In association with what remained of Kubrick's production unit, he directed the movie
A.I. Artificial Intelligence
(2001). [ 187 ] [ 186 ]
which was produced by Kubrick's longtime producer (and brother-in-law)
Jan Harlan . [ 188 ]
Sets, costumes and art direction were based on the works of conceptual artist, Chris Baker, who had also done much of his work under Kubrick's supervision. [ 189 ]
Although Spielberg was able to function autonomously in Kubrick's absence, he said he felt "inhibited to honor him," and followed Kubrick's visual schema with as much fidelity as he could, according to author
Joseph McBride . Spielberg, who once referred to Kubrick as "the greatest master I ever served," now with production underway, admitted, "I felt like I was being coached by a ghost". [ 190 ]
The film was released in June 2001. It contains a posthumous production credit for Stanley Kubrick at the beginning and the brief dedication "For Stanley Kubrick" at the end.
John Williams 's score contains many allusions to pieces heard in other Kubrick films. [ 191 ]
Napoleon
The script from Kubrick's unrealized project,
Napoleon
Following
2001: A Space Odyssey , Kubrick originally planned to make a film about the life of the French emperor
Napoleon . Fascinated by his life and own "self-destruction", [ 192 ]
Kubrick spent a great deal of time planning the film's development, and had conducted about two years of extensive research into Napoleon's life, reading several hundreds books and gaining access to Napoleon's personal memoirs and commentaries. He also tried to see every film ever made about Napoleon and found none of them appealing, including
Abel Gance 's
1927 film
which is generally considered to be a masterpiece, but for Kubrick, a "really terrible" movie. [ 193 ]
Lo Brutto states that Napoleon was an ideal subject for Kubrick, embracing the director's "passion for control, power, obsession, strategy and the military" while Napoleon's psychological intensity and depth, logistical genius and war, sex, and the evil nature of man were all ingredients which deeply appealed to Kubrick. [ 194 ]
Kubrick drafted a screenplay in 1961, and envisaged making a "grandiose" epic, with up to 40,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. He had intended hiring the armed forces of an entire country to make the film, as he considered Napoleonic battles to be "so beautiful, like vast lethal ballets," with an "aesthetic brilliance that doesn't require a military mind to appreciate" He wanted them to be replicated as authentically as possible on screen. [ 195 ]
Kubrick had sent research teams to scout for locations across Europe, and missioned screenwriter and director
Andrew Birkin , one of his young assistants on
2001 , to the
Isle of Elba ,
Austerlitz
and
Waterloo , taking thousands of pictures for his later perusal. Kubrick approached numerous stars to play leading roles, including
Audrey Hepburn
for
Empress Josephine , a part which she could not accept due to semi-retirement. [ 196 ]
British actors
David Hemmings
and
Ian Holm
were considered for the lead role of Napoleon, before
Jack Nicholson
was cast. [ 197 ]
The film was well into pre-production and ready to begin filming in 1969 when MGM cancelled the project. Numerous reasons have been cited for the abandonment of the project, including its projected cost, a change of ownership at MGM, [ 192 ]
and the poor reception the 1970 Soviet film about Napoleon,
Waterloo , received. In 2011,
Taschen
published the book,
Stanley Kubrick's Napoleon: The Greatest Movie Never Made , a large volume compilation of literature and source documents from Kubrick, such as scene photo ideas and copies of letters Kubrick wrote and received. In March 2013, Steven Spielberg, who previously collaborated with Kubrick on
A.I. Artificial Intelligence
and is a passionate admirer of his work, announced that he would be developing
Napoleon
as a TV miniseries based on Kubrick's original screenplay. [ 198 ]
Other projects
In the 1950s Kubrick and Harris developed a sitcom starring
Ernie Kovacs
and a film adaption of the book
I Stole $16,000,000
but nothing came of them. [ 62 ]
Tony Frewin, an assistant who worked with the director for a long period of time, revealed in a March 2013
Atlantic
article: "He [Kubrick] was limitlessly interested in anything to do with Nazis and desperately wanted to make a film on the subject." Kubrick had intended making a film about the life story of Dietrich Schulz-Koehn, a Nazi officer who used the pen name "Dr. Jazz" to write reviews of German music scenes during the Nazi era. Kubrick had been given a copy of the Mike Zwerin book
Swing Under the Nazis
after he had finished production on
Full Metal Jacket , the front cover of which featured a photograph of Schulz-Koehn. A screenplay was never completed and Kubrick's film adaptation plan was never initiated. [ 199 ]
The unfinished
Aryan Papers , based on
Louis Begley 's debut novel
Wartimes Lies , was a factor in the abandonment of the project. Work on
Aryan Papers
depressed Kubrick enormously, and he eventually decided that Steven Spielberg's
Schindler's List
(1993) covered much of the same material. [ 176 ]
According to biographer John Baxter, Kubrick had shown an interest in directing a
pornographic film
based on a satirical novel written by Terry Southern, entitled
Blue Movie , about a director who makes Hollywood's first big budget porn film. However, Baxter claims that Kubrick concluded that he didn't have the patience or temperament to become involved in the porn industry, and Southern stated that Kubrick was "too ultra conservative" towards sexuality to have seriously gone ahead with it, but liked the idea. [ 200 ]
Kubrick was unable to direct a film of Umberto Eco's
Foucault's Pendulum
as Eco had given his publisher instructions to never sell the film rights to any of his books after his dissatisfaction with the film version of
The Name of the Rose . [ 201 ]
Also, when the film rights to Tolkien's
The Lord of the Rings
were sold to United Artists,
the Beatles
approached Kubrick to direct them in a film based on the books, but Kubrick was unwilling to produce a film based on a very popular book. [ 202 ]
Director Peter Jackson has reported that Tolkien was against the involvement of the Beatles. [ 203 ]
Career influences
As a young man Kubrick was fascinated by the films of
Sergei Eisenstein
and would watch films like
Battleship Potemkin
(1925) (pictured) endlessly
Kubrick stated that "anyone who has ever been privileged to direct a film knows that, although it can be like trying to write
War and Peace
in a bumper car at an amusement park, when you finally get it right, there are not many joys in life that can equal that feeling." [ 204 ]
As a young man, Kubrick was fascinated by the films of Soviet filmmakers such as
Sergei Eisenstein
and
Vsevolod Pudovkin . [ 205 ]
Kubrick read Pudovkin's seminal theoretical work,
Film Technique,
which argues that editing makes film a unique art form, and it needs to be employed to manipulate the medium to its fullest. Kubrick recommended this work to others for many years. Thomas Nelson describes this book as "the greatest influence of any single written work on the evolution of [Kubrick's] private aesthetics". Kubrick also found the ideas of
Constantin Stanislavski
to be essential to his understanding the basics of directing, and gave himself a crash course to learn his methods. [ 206 ]
Kubrick's family and many critics felt that his Jewish ancestry may have contributed to his worldview and aspects of his films. After his death, both his daughter and wife stated that although he was not religious, "he did not deny his Jewishness, not at all". His daughter noted that he wanted to make a film about the Holocaust, the
Aryan Papers , having spent years researching the subject. [ 207 ]
Most of Kubrick's friends and early photography and film collaborators were Jewish, and his first two marriages were to daughters of recent Jewish immigrants from Europe. British screenwriter
Frederic Raphael , who worked closely with Kubrick in his final years, believes that the originality of Kubrick's films was partly because he "had a (Jewish?) respect for scholars". He declared that it was "absurd to try to understand Stanley Kubrick without reckoning on Jewishness as a fundamental aspect of his mentality". [ 208 ]
Director
Max Ophüls
was a major influence on Kubrick; pictured is his 1953 film
Madame de
Walker notes that Kubrick was influenced by the tracking and "fluid camera" styles of director
Max Ophüls , and used them in many of his films, including
Paths of Glory
and
2001: A Space Odyssey . Kubrick noted how in Ophuls' films "the camera went through every wall and every floor". [ 209 ]
He once named Ophüls'
Le Plaisir
(1952) as his favorite film. According to film historian John Wakeman, Ophüls himself learned the technique from director
Anatole Litvak
in the 1930s, when he was his assistant, and whose work was "replete with the camera trackings, pans and swoops which later became the trademark of Max Ophuls". [ 210 ]
Geoffrey Cocks believes that Kubrick was also influenced by Ophüls' stories of thwarted love and a preoccupation with predatory men, while Herr notes that Kubrick was deeply inspired by
G. W. Pabst , who earlier tried but was unable to adapt
Schnitzler 's
Traumnovelle , the basis of
Eyes Wide Shut . [ 211 ]
Film critic Robert Kolker sees the influence of
Welles ' moving camera shots on Kubrick's style. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick identified with Welles and influenced the making of
The Killing , with its "multiple points of view, extreme angles, and deep focus". [ 212 ] [ 213 ]
Kubrick also cited
David Lynch 's
Eraserhead
(1977) as one of his favorite films and used it as a creative reference during the directing of
The Shining . [ 214 ]
Directing techniques
Philosophy
HAL 9000, the computer from
2001: A Space Odyssey
Kubrick's films typically involve expressions of an inner struggle, examined from different perspectives. [ 204 ]
He was very careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation. He explained in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, what is it that you were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what
T. S. Eliot
said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was
The Waste Land —what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. If I could have said it any differently, I would have". [ 215 ]
Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. [ 215 ]
In a
Time
magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves." [ 37 ]
He also said "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious". [ 216 ]
Kubrick's production notes from
The Killing
Diane Johnson , who co-wrote the screenplay for
The Shining
with Kubrick, notes that he "always said that it was better to adapt a book rather than write an original screenplay, and that you should choose a work that isn't a masterpiece so you can improve on it. Which is what he's always done, except with
Lolita ". [ 217 ]
When deciding on a subject for a film, there were a number of aspects that he looked for, and he always made films which would "appeal to every sort of viewer, whatever their expectation of film". [ 218 ]
According to his co-producer
Jan Harlan , Kubrick mostly "wanted to make films about things that mattered, that not only had form, but substance". [ 219 ]
Kubrick himself believed that audiences quite often were attracted to "enigmas and allegories" and did not like films in which everything was spelled out clearly. [ 220 ]
Although none of his features display graphic sex scenes, sexuality in Kubrick's films is usually depicted outside matrimonial relationships in hostile situations. Baxter states that Kubrick explores the "furtive and violent side alleys of the sexual experience: voyeurism, domination, bondage and rape" in his films. [ 221 ]
He further points out that films like
A Clockwork Orange
are "powerfully homoerotic", from Alex walking about his parents' flat in his Y-fronts, one eye being "made up with doll-like false eyelashes", to his innocent acceptance of the sexual advances of his post-corrective adviser Deltroid ( Aubrey Morris ). [ 222 ]
British critic Adrian Turner notes that Kubrick's films appear to be "preoccupied with questions of universal and inherited evil", and Malcolm McDowell referred to his humor as "black as coal", questioning his outlook on humanity. [ 223 ]
Although a few of his pictures were obvious satires and black comedies, such as
Lolita
and
Dr. Strangelove , many of his other films also contained less visible elements of satire or irony. His films are unpredictable, examining "the duality and contradictions that exist in all of us". [ 224 ]
Ciment notes how Kubrick often tried to confound audience expectations by establishing radically different moods from one film to the next, remarking that he was almost "obsessed with contradicting himself, with making each work a critique of the previous one". [ 225 ]
Kubrick stated himself that "there is no deliberate pattern to the stories that I have chosen to make into films. About the only factor at work each time is that I try not to repeat myself". [ 226 ]
As a result, Kubrick was often misunderstood by critics, and only once did he have unanimously positive reviews upon the release of a film—for
Paths of Glory . [ 227 ]
Writing and staging scenes
The tunnel used in the making of
A Clockwork Orange
Film author Patrick Webster considers Kubrick's methods of writing and developing scenes to fit with the classical
auteur theory
of directing, allowing collaboration and improvization with the actors during filming. [ 228 ]
Malcolm McDowell recalled Kubrick's collaborative emphasis during their discussions and his willingness to allow him to improvize a scene, stating that "there was a script and we followed it, but when it didn't work he knew it, and we had to keep rehearsing endlessly until we were bored with it." [ 229 ]
Once Kubrick was confident in the overall staging of a scene, and felt the actors were prepared, he would then develop the visual aspects, including camera and lighting placement. Walker believes that Kubrick was one of "very few film directors competent to instruct their lighting photographers in the precise effect they want." [ 230 ]
Baxter believes that although American, Kubrick was heavily influenced by his ancestry and always possessed a European perspective to filmmaking, particularly the Austro-Hungarian empire and his admiration for Johann Ophuls and
Richard Strauss . [ 231 ]
Gilbert Adair , writing in a review for
Full Metal Jacket , commented that "Kubrick's approach to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression". [ 232 ]
Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a "visual filmmaker," he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique. [ 233 ]
Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the actual filming, finding it more "more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals" as he put it. [ 230 ]
Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: "I think you have to view the entire problem of putting the story you want to tell up there on that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing". [ 147 ]
Kubrick also said: "I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools." [ 141 ]
Directing
"They work with Stanley and go through hells that nothing in their careers could have prepared them for, they think they must have been mad to get involved, they think that they'd die before they would ever work with him again, that fixated maniac; and when it's all behind them and the profound fatigue of so much intensity has worn off, they'd do anything in the world to work for him again. For the rest of their professional lives they long to work with someone who cared the way Stanley did, someone they could learn from. They look for someone to respect the way they'd come to respect him, but they can never find anybody ... I've heard this story so many times."
— Michael Herr, screenwriter for
Full Metal Jacket
on actors working with Kubrick. [ 234 ]
Kubrick was notorious for demanding multiple takes during filming to perfect his art, and his relentless approach was often extremely demanding for his actors. Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to 50 takes of a scene. [ 235 ]
Nicole Kidman explains that the large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a "deeper place." [ 236 ]
Kubrick's high take ratio was considered by some critics as "irrational," although he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the actual filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates. [ 237 ]
Kubrick explained: "Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how hard they try"... [ 238 ]
"When you make a movie, it takes a few days just to get used to the crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself". [ 239 ]
He also told biographer Michel Clement: "It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough. An actor can only do one thing at a time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he's thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera. [ 145 ]
Kubrick would devote his personal breaks to having lengthy discussions with actors. Among those who valued his attention was Tony Curtis, star of
Spartacus , who said Kubrick was his favorite director, adding, "his greatest effectiveness was his one-on-one relationship with actors." [ 81 ]
He further added, "Kubrick had his own approach to film-making. He wanted to see the actor's faces. He didn't want cameras always in a wide shot twenty-five feet away, he wanted close-ups, he wanted to keep the camera moving. That was his style." [ 73 ]
Similarly, Malcolm McDowell recalls the long discussions he had with Kubrick to help him develop his character in
A Clockwork Orange , noting that on set he felt entirely uninhibited and free, which is what made Kubrick "such a great director." [ 235 ]
Kubrick also allowed actors at times to improvize and to "break the rules", particularly with Peter Sellers in
Lolita , which became a turning point in his career as it allowed him to work creatively during the actual shooting, as opposed to the preproduction stage. [ 240 ]
During an interview, Ryan O'Neal recalled Kubrick's directing style: "God, he works you hard. He moves you, pushes you, helps you, gets cross with you, but above all he teaches you the value of a good director. Stanley brought out aspects of my personality and acting instincts that had been dormant ... My strong suspicion [was] that I was involved in something great". [ 241 ]
He further added that working with Kubrick was "a stunning experience" and that he never recovered from working with somebody of such magnificence. [ 242 ]
Cinematography
Model of the War Room from
Dr Strangelove
Kubrick credited the ease with which he photographed scenes to his early years as a photographer. [ 243 ]
He rarely added camera instructions in the script, preferring to handle that after a scene is created, as the visual part of film-making came easiest to him. [ 244 ]
Even in deciding which props and settings would be used, Kubrick paid meticulous attention to detail and tried to collect as much background material as possible, functioning rather like what he described as "a detective". [ 245 ]
Cinematographer John Alcott, who worked closely with Kubrick on four of his films, and won an Oscar for
Best Cinematography
on
Barry Lyndon , remarked that Kubrick "questions everything", [ 246 ]
and was involved in the technical aspects of film-making including camera placement, scene composition, choice of lens, and even operating the camera which would usually be left to the cinematographer. Alcott considered Kubrick to be the "nearest thing to genius I've ever worked with, with all the problems of a genius". [ 247 ]
Kubrick's camera, possibly used in
Barry Lyndon
Among Kubrick's notable innovations in cinematography are his use of special effects, as in
2001 , where he used both
slit-scan photography
and
front-screen projection , which won Kubrick his only Oscar for special effects. Some reviewers have described and illustrated with video clips, Kubrick's use of " one-point perspective ", which leads the viewer's eye towards a central vanishing point. The technique relies on creating a complex visual symmetry using parallel lines in a scene which all converge on that single point, leading away from the viewer. Combined with camera motion it could produce an effect that one writer describes as "hypnotic and thrilling." [ 248 ]
The Shining
was among the first half-dozen features to use the then-revolutionary
Steadicam
(after the 1976 films
Bound for Glory ,
Marathon Man
and
Rocky ). Kubrick used it to its fullest potential, which gave the audience smooth, stabilized, motion-tracking by the camera. Kubrick described Steadicam as being like a "magic carpet", allowing "fast, flowing, camera movements" in the maze in
The Shining
which would otherwise would have been impossible to accomplish. [ 249 ]
Kubrick was among the first directors to use
video assist
during filming. At the time he began using it in 1966, it was considered cutting-edge technology, requiring him to build his own system. Having it in place during the filming of
2001 , he was able to view a video of a take immediately after it was filmed. [ 250 ]
On some films, such as
Barry Lyndon , he used custom made zoom lenses, which allowed him to start a scene with a close-up and slowly zoom out to capture the full panorama of scenery and to film long takes under changing outdoor lighting conditions by making aperture adjustments while the cameras rolled. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's technical knowledge about lenses "dazzled the manufacturer's engineers, who found him to be unprecedented among contemporary filmmakers." [ 251 ]
For
Barry Lyndon
he also used a specially adapted high-speed (f/0.7) Zeiss camera lens, originally developed for NASA, to shoot numerous scenes lit only with candlelight. Actor Steven Berkoff recalls that Kubrick wanted scenes to be shot using "pure candlelight," and in doing so Kubrick "made a unique contribution to the art of filmmaking going back to painting ... You almost posed like for portraits." [ 252 ]
LoBrutto notes that cinematographers all over the world wanted to know about Kubrick's "magic lens" and that he became a "legend" among cameramen around the world. [ 253 ]
Editing and music
György Ligeti , whose music Kubrick used in
2001 ,
The Shining
and
Eyes Wide Shut
Kubrick spent extensive hours editing, often working seven days a week, and more hours a day as he got closer to deadlines. [ 254 ]
For Kubrick, written dialogue was one element to be put in balance with
mise en scène
(set arrangements), music, and especially, editing. Inspired by
Pudovkin 's treatise on film editing, Kubrick realized that one could create a performance in the editing room and often "re-direct" a film, and he remarked: "I love editing. I think I like it more than any other phase of filmmaking ... Editing is the only unique aspect of filmmaking which does not resemble any other art form—a point so important it cannot be overstressed ... It can make or break a film". [ 254 ]
Biographer John Baxter stated that "Instead of finding the intellectual spine of a film in the script before starting work, Kubrick felt his way towards the final version of a film by shooting each scene from many angles and demanding scores of takes on each line. Then over months ... he arranged and rearranged the tens of thousands of scraps of film to fit a vision that really only began to emerge during editing". [ 255 ]
Kubrick's attention to music was an aspect of what many referred to as his "perfectionism" and extreme attention to minute details, which his wife Christine attributed to an addiction to music. In his last six films, Kubrick usually chose music from existing sources, especially classical compositions. He preferred selecting recorded music over having it composed for a film, believing that no hired composer could do as well as the public domain classical composers. He also felt that building scenes from great music often created the "most memorable scenes" in the best films. [ 256 ]
In one instance, for a scene in
Barry Lyndon
which was written into the screenplay as merely, "Barry duels with Lord Bullingdon," he spent forty-two working days in the editing phase. During that period, he listened to what LoBrutto describes as "every available recording of seventeenth-and eighteenth- century music, acquiring thousands of records to find
Handel 's sarabande used to score the scene." [ 257 ]
Jack Nicholson likewise observed his attention to music for his films, stating that Kubrick "listened constantly to music until he discovered something he felt was right or that excited him." [ 227 ]
Kubrick is credited with introducing Hungarian composer
György Ligeti
to a broad Western audience by including his music in
2001 ,
The Shining
and
Eyes Wide Shut . According to Baxter, the music in
2001
was "at the forefront of Kubrick's mind" when he conceived the film. [ 258 ]
During earlier screening he played music by
Mendelssohn [ aa ]
and
Vaughan Williams , and Kubrick and writer Clarke had listened to
Carl Orff 's transcription of
Carmina Burana , consisting of 13th century sacred and secular songs. [ 258 ]
In the film, Kubrick employed the new style of
micropolyphony , which used sustained dissonant chords that shift slowly over time, a style which he originated. Its inclusion in the film became a "boon for the relatively unknown composer" partly because it was introduced alongside background by notable composers,
Johann Strauss
and
Richard Strauss . [ 260 ]
Personal life
Main articles:
Personal life of Stanley Kubrick
and
Political and religious beliefs of Stanley Kubrick
Kubrick married his high-school sweetheart Toba Metz, a keen caricaturist, on May 29, 1948, when he was nineteen years of age. They had attended Taft High School together and had lived in the same apartment block on Shakespeare Avenue. [ 20 ]
The couple lived together in
Greenwich Village
and divorced three years later in 1951. He met his second wife, the Austrian-born dancer and theatrical designer
Ruth Sobotka , in 1952. They lived together in New York's
East Village
beginning in 1952, got married in January 1955 and moved to Hollywood in July 1955, where she played a brief part as a ballet dancer in Kubrick's film,
Killer's Kiss
(1955). The following year she was art director for his film,
The Killing
(1956). They divorced in 1957. [ 261 ]
Kubrick lived with dancer and actress
Valda Setterfield
after the marriage broke down. [ 262 ]
During the production of
Paths of Glory
in Munich in early 1957, Kubrick met and romanced the German actress
Christiane Harlan , who played a small though memorable role in the film. Kubrick married Harlan in 1958, and the couple remained together 40 years, until his death in 1999. Besides his stepdaughter, they had two daughters together; Anya Renata (born April 6, 1959, died July 7, 2009 (age 50)), and Vivian Vanessa (born August 5, 1960). [ 263 ]
In 1959 they settled into a home at 316 South Camden Drive in
Beverly Hills
with Harlan's daughter, Katherina, aged six. [ 264 ]
They also lived in New York, during which time Christiane studied art at the
Art Students League of New York , later becoming an independent artist. [ 265 ]
The couple moved to the United Kingdom in 1961 to make
Lolita , and Kubrick hired Peter Sellers to star in his next film,
Dr. Strangelove , Sellers was unable to leave the UK, so Kubrick made Britain his permanent home thereafter. The move was quite convenient to Kubrick, since he shunned the Hollywood system and its publicity machine, and he and Christiane had become alarmed with the increase in violence in New York. [ 266 ]
Kubrick's
Childwickbury Manor
in Hertfordshire, England
In 1965 the Kubricks bought Abbots Mead from
Simon Cowell 's father on Barnet Lane, just south of the Elstree/Borehamwood studio complex in England. Kubrick worked almost exclusively from this home for 14 years where, with some exceptions, he researched, invented special effects techniques, designed ultra-low light lenses for specially modified cameras, pre-produced, edited, post-produced, advertised, distributed and carefully managed all aspects of four of his films. In 1978, Kubrick moved into
Childwickbury Manor
in
Hertfordshire , a mainly 18th century stately home, which was once owned by a wealthy racehorse owner, about 30 mi (50 km) north of London and a 10-minute drive from his previous home at Abbotts Mead. His new home became a workplace for Kubrick and his wife, "a perfect family factory" as Christiane called it, [ 267 ]
and Kubrick converted the stables into extra production rooms besides ones within the home that he used for editing and storage. [ 268 ]
A workaholic, Kubrick rarely took a vacation or left England during the forty years before he died. [ 269 ]
Biographer Vincent LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's confined way of living and desire for privacy has led to spurious stories about his reclusiveness, similar to those of
Greta Garbo ,
Howard Hughes , and
J. D. Salinger . [ 270 ]
Michael Herr, Kubrick's co-screenwriter on
Full Metal Jacket , who knew him well, considers his "reclusiveness" to be myth: "[H]e was in fact a complete failure as a recluse, unless you believe that a recluse is simply someone who seldom leaves his house. Stanley saw a lot of people ... he was one of the most gregarious men I ever knew, and it didn't change anything that most of this conviviality went on over the phone."
[ 271 ]
Lo Brutto states that one of the reasons he acquired a reputation as a recluse was because he insisted in remaining near his home, but the reason for this was because for Kubrick there were only three places on the planet he could make high quality films with the necessary technical expertise and equipment: Los Angeles, New York or around London. He disliked living in Los Angeles, and had thought London a superior film production center to New York. [ 272 ]
As a person, Kubrick was described by
Norman Lloyd
as "a very dark, sort of a glowering type who was very serious". [ 273 ]
Marisa Berenson , who starred in
Barry Lyndon
fondly recalled: "There was great tenderness in him and he was passionate about his work. What was striking was his enormous intelligence, but he also had a great sense of humor. He was a very shy person and self-protective, but he was filled with the thing that drove him twenty-four hours of the day." [ 274 ]
Kubrick was particularly fond of machines and technical equipment, to the point that his wife Christiane once stated that "Stanley would be happy with eight tape recorders and one pair of pants". [ 275 ]
Although Kubrick had obtained a pilot's license in August 1947, some have claimed that he later developed a fear of flying, stemming from an incident in the early 1950s when a colleague had been killed in a plane crash. Kubrick had been sent the charred remains of his camera and notebooks which, according to Duncan, traumatized him for life. [ 75 ] [ ab ]
Kubrick also had a strong mistrust of doctors and medicine, especially those he didn't know, and on one occasion he had a dentist from the Bronx flown to London to treat him. [ 277 ]
Death
On March 7, 1999, four days after screening a final cut of
Eyes Wide Shut
for his family and the stars, Kubrick died in his sleep at the age of 70, after suffering a massive heart attack. His funeral was held five days later at his home estate at Childwickbury Manor, with only close friends and family in attendance, totaling approximately 100 people. The media were kept a mile away outside the entrance gate. [ 278 ]
Alexander Walker, who attended the funeral, describes it as a "family farewell, ... almost like an English picnic," with cellists, clarinetists and singers providing song and music from many of his favorite classical compositions.
Kaddish , the Jewish prayer of mourning, was recited. A few of his obituaries mentioned his Jewish background. [ 279 ]
Among those who gave eulogies were
Terry Semel , Jan Harlan, Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. He was buried next to his favorite tree on the estate. In her book dedicated to Kubrick, his wife Christiane included one of his favorite quotes by
Oscar Wilde : "The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young." [ 280 ]
Legacy
Main article:
Influence of Stanley Kubrick
Part of the New Hollywood film-making wave, Kubrick's films are considered by film historian
Michel Ciment
to be "among the most important contributions to world cinema in the twentieth century", [ 31 ]
and he is frequently cited as one of the greatest and most influential directors in the history of cinema. [ 281 ] [ 282 ]
Leading directors, including
Martin Scorsese ,
Steven Spielberg ,
James Cameron ,
Woody Allen ,
Terry Gilliam , the
Coen brothers ,
Ridley Scott , and
George A. Romero , have cited Kubrick as a source of inspiration, and in the case of Spielberg, collaboration. On the DVD of
Eyes Wide Shut , Steven Spielberg comments that Kubrick "tells a story is antithetical to the way we are accustomed to receiving stories" and that "nobody could shoot a picture better in history". Writing in the introduction to a recent edition of Michel Ciment's
Kubrick , film director Martin Scorsese notes that most of Kubrick's films were misunderstood and under-appreciated when first released. Then came a dawning recognition that they were masterful works unlike any other films. Perhaps most notably, Orson Welles, one of Kubrick's greatest personal influences and all-time favorite directors, famously said that: "Among those whom I would call 'younger generation' Kubrick appears to me to be a giant." [ 283 ]
Kubrick continues to be cited as a major influence by many directors, including
Christopher Nolan , [ 284 ]
Todd Field , [ 285 ]
David Fincher ,
Guillermo del Toro ,
David Lynch ,
Lars von Trier ,
Michael Mann , and
Gaspar Noé . Many filmmakers imitate Kubrick's inventive and unique use of camera movement and framing, as well as his use of music, notably
Frank Darabont . [ 286 ]
Paul Thomas Anderson , in an interview with
Entertainment Weekly , stated "it's so hard to do anything that doesn't owe some kind of debt to what Stanley Kubrick did with music in movies. Inevitably, you're going to end up doing something that he's probably already done before. It can all seem like we're falling behind whatever he came up with." [ 287 ]
In 2000 BAFTA renamed their Britannia lifetime achievement award the "Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award", [ 288 ]
joining the likes of
D. W. Griffith ,
Laurence Olivier ,
Cecil B. DeMille , and
Irving Thalberg , all of whom have annual awards named after them. Kubrick won this award in 1999, and subsequent recipients have included
George Lucas ,
Warren Beatty , Tom Cruise,
Robert De Niro ,
Clint Eastwood , and
Daniel Day-Lewis . A number of people who worked with Kubrick on his films created the 2001 documentary
Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures , produced and directed by Kubrick's brother-in-law, Jan Harlan, who had executive produced Kubrick's last four films. [ 289 ]
The film's chapters each cover one of Kubrick's films and Kubrick's childhood is explored in the introductory section.
Entrance to Kubrick museum exhibit at LACMA
In 2009, an exhibition of paintings and photos inspired by Kubrick's films was held in Dublin, Ireland, entitled "Stanley Kubrick: Taming Light". [ 290 ]
On October 30, 2012, an exhibition devoted to Kubrick opened at the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art
(LACMA) and concluded in June 2013. Exhibits include a wide collection of documents, photographs and on-set material assembled from 800 boxes of personal archives that were stored in Kubrick's home-workplace in the UK. [ 291 ]
A number of celebrities attended and spoke at the museum's pre-opening gala, including Steven Spielberg,
Tom Hanks
and Jack Nicholson, [ 292 ]
while Kubrick's widow, Christiane, appeared at the pre-gala press review. [ 293 ]
In October 2013, the Brazil
Sao Paulo International Film Festival
paid tribute to Kubrick, staging an exhibit of his work and a retrospective of his films. The exhibit is also scheduled to open at the
Toronto International Film Festival
(TIFF) in late 2014. [ 294 ]
Kubrick is widely referenced in popular culture, and the TV series
The Simpsons
is said to contain more references to Kubrick films than any other pop culture phenomenon. [ 295 ]
When the
Director's Guild of Great Britain
gave Kubrick a lifetime achievement award, they included a cut-together sequence of all the homages from the show. [ 296 ]
Pop singer
Lady Gaga 's concert shows have included the use of dialogue, costumes, and music from
A Clockwork Orange . [ 297 ]
Several films have been made related to Kubrick's life, including the mockumentary film
Dark Side of the Moon
(2002), which is a parody of the pervasive conspiracy theory that Kubrick had been involved with the
faked footage of the NASA moon landings
during the filming of
2001: A Space Odyssey , and
Colour Me Kubrick
(2005), starring
John Malkovich
as
Alan Conway , a con artist who had assumed Kubrick's identity in the 1990s. [ 298 ]
Both films were authorized by Kubrick's family. In the 2004 film
The Life and Death of Peter Sellers , Kubrick was portrayed by
Stanley Tucci , and documents their filming of
Dr. Strangelove , rather than
Lolita . [ 299 ]

Kubrick called
Fear and Desire

Kubrick and Harris had thought that the positive reception from critics had made their presence known in Hollywood, but
Max Youngstein
of United Artists disagreed with Schary on the merit of the film and still considered Kubrick and Harris to be "Not far from the bottom" of the pool of new talent at the time.
[ 58 ]

Kubrick and Schary agreed to work on
Stefan Zweig 's
The Burning Secret , and he began working on a script with novelist
Calder Willingham . However, Kubrick refused to forget the idea of making
Paths of Glory , and secretly began drafting a script at night with Jim Thomson. [ 59 ]

Douglas informed United Artists that he would not do
The Vikings
(1958) unless they agreed to make
Paths of Glory
and pay $850,000 to make it. Kubrick and Harris signed a five-film deal with Douglas's Bryna Productions and accepted a fee of $20,000 and a percentage of the profits in comparison to Douglas's salary of $350,000. [ 60 ]

This is disputed by Carlo Fiore, who has claimed that Brando had not heard of Kubrick initially and that it was he who arranged a dinner meeting between Brando Kubrick. [ 64 ]
^
According to biographer John Baxter, Kubrick was furious with Brando's casting of
France Nuyen , and when Kubrick had confessed to still "not knowing what the picture was about", Brando snapped "I'll tell you what it's about. It's about $300,000 that I've already paid
Karl Malden ". [ 66 ]
Kubrick was then reported to have been fired and accepted a parting fee of $100,000, [ 65 ] [ 67 ]
though a 1960
Entertainment Weekly
article claims he quit as director, and that Kubrick had been quoted as saying "Brando wanted to direct the movie". [ 68 ]
Kubrick's biographer LoBrutto states that for contractual reasons Kubrick was not able to cite the real reason, but issued a statement saying that he had resigned "with deep regret because of my respect and admiration for one of the world's foremost artists". [ 69 ]

Spartacus
eventually cost a reported $12 million to produce and earned only $14.6 million. [ 72 ]

The battle scenes of
Spartacus
were shot over six weeks on location in Spain in the summer of 1959. Biographer John Baxter has criticized some of the battle scenes, describing them as "awkwardly directed, with some clumsy stunt action and a plethora of improbable horse falls". [ 74 ]

A problematic production in that Kubrick wanted to shoot at a slow pace of two camera set-ups a day, but the studio insisted that he do 32; a compromise of eight had to be made. [ 76 ]
Stills cameraman
William Read Woodfield
questioned the casting and acting abilities of some of the actors such as
Timothy Carey , [ 77 ]
and cinematographer
Russell Metty
disagreed with Kubrick's use of light, threatening to quit, but later muting his criticisms after winning the Oscar for
Best Cinematography . [ 78 ]
^
According to biographer Baxter, Douglas continued to resent Kubrick's domination during production, remarking, "He'll be a fine director some day, if he falls flat on his face just once. It might teach him how to compromise". [ 72 ]
Douglas later stated: "You don't have to be a nice person to be extremely talented. You can be a shit and be talented and, conversely, you can be the nicest guy in the world and not have any talent. Stanley Kubrick is a talented shit." [ 81 ]
^
The two got on famously during production, displaying many similarities; both left school prematurely, played jazz drums, and shared a fascination with photography. [ 85 ]
Sellers would later claim that "Kubrick is a god as far as I'm concerned". [ 86 ]
^
Kubrick and Harris had proved that they could adapt a highly controversial novel without interference from a studio. The moderate earnings allowed them to set up companies in Switzerland to take advantage of low taxes on their profits and give them financial security for life. [ 87 ]

Footage of Sellers playing four different roles was shot by Kubrick: "an RAF captain on secondment to Burpelson Air Force Base as adjutant to Sterling Hayden's crazed General Ripper; the inept President of the United States; his sinister German security adviser; and the Texan pilot of the rogue B52 bomber", but the scene with him as a Texan pilot was excluded from the final version.

Several commentators have speculated that HAL is a slur on IBM, with the letters alphabetically falling before it, and point out that Kubrick inspected the IBM 7090 during
Dr Strangelove . However, both Kubrick and Clarke have denied this, and insist that HAL simply means "Heuristically Programmed Algorithmic Computer". [ 110 ]
^
Biographer John Baxter quotes Ken Adam as saying that Kubrick wasn't actually responsible for most of the effects, and that Wally Veevers was the man behind about 85% of them in film. However, Baxter notes that none of the film's technical team resented Kubrick taking sole credit, as "it was Kubrick's vision which appeared on the screen". [ 113 ]

Kubrick had been impressed with his ability to "shift from schoolboy innocence to insolence and, if needed, violence". [ 130 ]
^
Despite this, Kubrick disagreed with many of the scathing press reports in British media in the early 1970s that the film could transform a person into a criminal, and argued that "violent crime is invariably committed by people with a long record of anti-social behavior". [ 134 ]

Kubrick told Ciment, "I created a picture file of thousands of drawings and paintings for every type of reference that we could have wanted. I think I destroyed every art book you could buy in a bookshop." [ 140 ]

Duncan notes that during the filming of
Spartacus
in Spain, Kubrick had suffered a nervous breakdown after the flight and was "terribly ill" during the filming there, and his return flight would be his last one. [ 75 ]
Matthew Modine , star of
Full Metal Jacket , however, has stated that the stories about his fear of flying were "fabricated", and that Kubrick simply preferred spending most of his time in England, where his films were produced and where he lived. [ 276 ]
