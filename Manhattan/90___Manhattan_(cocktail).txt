Radio 3
Howdy, folks. I'm back in the radio host's chair for a day here. Sure feels different from sitting in the van seat after a month-long, cross-Canada tour with
Brasstronaut . Bryan in the band did a recent mileage calculation and concluded that we'd driven approximately 12,000 KM on this trip. Actually, I cheated and flew home.
The tour started in Victoria on May 23rd and ended in Montreal with a lot of stops in between and you know, I learned a few new things about this excellent nation of ours. For instance, you can actually roll into a BC town, walk into a bar and get a gig--on the spot. And yes, I was also reminded of a few things I already knew from previous trips, like how far a drive it is from Winnipeg to Thunder Bay or how delicious the roti is at the
Gandhi
restaurant in Toronto.
I've got a few stories from the road to share with you today but I also want to spend time catching up on YOUR adventures. So, even though it's not officially summer and all I still want to know...
WHAT'S BEEN THE HIGHLIGHT OF YOUR SUMMER SO FAR?
A trip? A live concert? Weekends at the cottage? A summer romance?
If the highlight hasn't happened yet but is coming up, let us know about that too. Or if summer is simply sucking for you, feel free to share your woes. Post your comments on the blog or Tweet
@cbcradio3
and we can collectively assess our summers so far.
Now, poll question, part 2. When I was in Toronto I stumbled into a bunch of cool little watering holes (quite a few of them were owned by people who play in bands). So, let's talk summer beverages too:
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE WATERING HOLE AND WHY?

Hello!
I think for sure the highlight of my summer so far is nxne! It's really all that I've done! I did a recap on the Monday after nxne and wrote down all the bands I saw and it came out to 25!! That's crazy. I was only there for 3 days and most of the music didn't start until later in the night. I did include the R3 Picnic though, and bands that I only saw for a couple songs. Still though, what a great weekend. It's totally going to become an annual thing for me.
What's my favourite watering hole? I guess I would have to say that Molly Bloom's in London is my "favourite" in that, I go there a lot and know everyone that works there. I'm like that token old man most pubs have, but I'm 22 and a girl. But my ACTUAL favourite watering hole would have to be the Patio at Barney's here in London. They don't have the best beer, or the best service, or the best crowds BUT the patio is HUGE and has sunshine all day long. it's awesome.

Hello Tariq!
My summer has been pretty awesome so far. Lots of cool new experiences to take the edge off most of my friends being out of town for a stint. Perhaps the best experience of summer is that it's my first one where I'm working 9-5 and don't have anything to do after I leave work. That or my trip home this past weekend, which ruled.
My favourite watering hole is the Hart and Thistle. The beer is mindblowingly good and they have a massive patio which ends less than 2 metres from the ocean. I would be going for Happy Hour today but the chiller for the house beers broke so I'm debating going to a different patio. Henry House, perhaps. Or maybe the one at my apartment.

@steph it's always great to be greeted by name and have your favourite drink dropped in front of you. Having a place where one element is so good it helps forget that the rest is lousy is sometimes key. I cite the food at Hart and Thistle as an example here.

Highlight of the Summer (so far)
That's an easy one. An unexpected trip to London and beyond this weekend for Homemade Jam. Getting to meet half-a-dozen R3ers. Getting a hug from Jenn Grant.
How can I top that?

Well, Tariq, every time I come to Canada, I’m the place I most want to be in the world.  And although I was highly skeptical how Green Couch Productions could pull off the Tracks on Tracks idea, by the time we left, I felt that everyone had a pretty good handle on it.
The point when I realized this was something extra special – in fact, a trip of a lifetime – was on the second day, just after we left Jasper.  Adeline was singing in the rear Park car observation, just her on a guitar.  At the time, I was sitting up in the dome in that car with Adrian (forget his last name), and when I heard Adeline start singing, I excused myself and said I want to hear her sing.  Adrian also got up and we went downstairs.  As Adeline was singing, Adrian started singing perfect harmony from across the room.  Suddenly, the event evolved from a good performance to magic.  Here we were, traveling through spectacular scenery – and hearing the most beautiful harmony.  Gave me chills.
And at this moment I realized we were experiencing a real “event”.  From then on, it was just magic piling on top of magic.  And by that fourth day, I had about 75 new best friends.  See you in 2013!

Not a summer guy.
I was at the inlaws on the weekend so I got to watch television. CBC is running an ad about their summer movie schedule (to replace hockey I guess) which runs through all the things that are making me miss winter. It was so satisfying to know that it's not just me, but a whole demographic who isn't that into summer.
Mosquitoes are attacking my kids if they go in the shade. It's way too hot even in the middle of the night. Hockey news is so scarce I have to spend my day working. There are grown men everywhere dressed like 8-year-olds. There is too much going on, too many places to get to in a hot car. Public pools are pretty gross, but I have to pretend I'm an aligator. You can't cook. It's too hot for coffee. Whah whah whah . . .

Tariq - speaking of "afterglow" from an event - I don't think I've ever had such an extended afterglow of astonishment, as I did after Tracks on Tracks.  Even now, as I think about it, I start getting excited at the thought of it.  It was THAT good.

re: parlovr
I could be totally wrong, BUT...
I think they spell it that way because there were legal disputes over simply "Parlour"
and
I think they don't really care if you say it "parlour" or "par-lover"
These are both things I
think
I remember hearing, so I could be way off.

Parlovr
My band mates Alex and Louis were roommates in a loft while they were putting together demos. The loft was zoned for commercial, so they incorporated themselves as ‘The Parlour’ – I think it was from a book that Alex was reading at the time. It just sort of naturally became the name of the band when it came time to name it. There were a few other bands with the same name, so they went with a Roman ‘u’ in the spelling. Now when we tour in Quebec, people often refer to us as Par-luv- errr …We like that; it rolls off the tongue (laughs).﻿

@Tariq - Actually, I didn't stay for NxNE.  I didn't have the vacation time available.  I left Toronto on the day I arrived there on the train.  As it was, I rode the train mainly because Grant really asked me to be there more than I wanted to go.  I'm so glad he did, because I'd have have hated to miss that amazing event.  My great regret is that I didn't bring my girlfriend, Peggy, along too, as she'd have loved it as much as I did.
Want another event?  On the second night out, Top Less Gay Love Techno Party was playing one of their songs at 12:30am, and we were all in the ToT activity car, jam packed with everyone who could fit in there, and as we rolled down the tracks at 100kph, we were all sort of dancing in place - and we got the car to start bouncing on its springs.  Now those cars are HEAVY, and I never dreamed that you could get it bouncing.  But we did!

Pretty dull summer so far - literally and figuratively here in Vancouver.   Two unexpected highlights so far: unlimited access to the Vancouver Art Gallery with membership from my mom, and going to see a friends new band.  Regarding the latter, I think this is my favorite project of his to date:

Just don't watch any of their other videos - they don't have my friend and aren't nearly as awesome.﻿

Hilight of the summer so far, the concentrated goodness of NXNE. So many great bands to see, so many new friends to meet, and old friends to become re-acquainted with. There are regrets about people - like you Tariq whom I missed meeting somehow, but other surprises like new friend Zach Gray. I was able to share the R3 love with my wife and daughter, whom both also enjoyed the NXNE experience.
Looking forward to Mariposa starting on Thursday with setting up camp.
Favourite Watering Hole in T.O., probably C'est What because of their great selection of Canadian Craft Beers on tap, but also pool table, food and music.

@iceman +1 for C'est What. Love that place. Great cask selection too. My first trip involved confusion as there's a bar service only area to the left of the bar that isn't indicated, but we finally got food and drinks. Staff ignored us. I guess they didn't want tips.

One of my Tracks on Tracks highlights:
The Belle Game was about to play stripped down set -- though still had some electric elements. They were literally two notes in to the first song when a fuse blew.
So they had to do the set completely acoustic, and it ended up being pretty incredible. When they played Sleep To Grow, they were joined by the ladies of Sidney York on oboe, bassoon and french horn and it sounded
spectacular .

best watering holes -
all depends where you are and waht your looking for...
one of the best pubs in Halifax for food and atmosphere and all that jazz is the Olde Triangle (it's an irish pub - co-owned by the Irish Rovers I think).
I also enjoy Charlies in halifax for people watching and good times. Cheap booze Tuesdays was always a hit.
The Seahorse or Gus' were always great for live tunes. The seashorse used to be pretty grungy but it has cleaned itself up now. There are lots of other extinct venues/watering holes in the Fax but the fact is, you lose one and a new one pops up and since its been  a while, iI have no idea whats good now.
In Regina where I'm at now, O'Hanlons is the spot downtown. Literally, the only spot downtown, there's nothing else down there. Except for Beer Bros whihc has awesome food and a metric shit tonne of beers.
Bushwakkers is a good brew pub here too. It's not great but its good, try their Sod Buster brown ale. Yum!

Oh!
Another watering hole I love is Failte in Waterloo, ON. Its an Irish pub that actually feels/looks like an Irish pub. Not like those Irish pubs that just have Guinness on tap and everything is written in that "Irish font". Its cute and small and there's stone walls inside. It's dark and kinda dingy feeling. Very awesome. :)

not a suck-up moment, but another highlight was the Brasstronaut show at the Rio. Since the first time I saw the band, I knew I wanted to see them at a soft seat theatre venue so it was kind of perfect.
Next time: The Vogue.

Summer highlight so far has been NXNE. Nice meeting you, Tariq, at the picnic and sharing with you how much I enjoy that 2007 podcast you did with Matt Mays for his soundtrack album "When the Angels Make Contact." Speaking of Matt, his show during NXNE was a major highlight among the highlights. It was my first time seeing him live and he and his band gave a great show. In the profile pic here his bandmate (I think that's Adam Baldwin on a Fender) and he are doing a Springsteen cover as part of their encore. It struck me later that Matt is kind of Canada's Springsteen. A hard-working rocker who plays long live shows and conjures romanticized visions of his hometown ("City of Lakes") and folks who come from that locale.

I found out, sadly, that my fav Chicago spot for Oberon has closed. no more Grami & Jose the awesome bartender. I have a few favorite spots out here but was just at BeerBellyLA on Sunday. Had a great Craftsman Bier de Blanco. I know the bartenders & we had a nice chatit's been pretty calm. I heard a great gal busking with her accordion in the metro the other day. she's from a band call AeonNow & has a terrific voice so I hope to see that band soon. & I'm done house sitting so I get to move back to my pal Nicole's, in the heart of Franklin Village. Very happy about being there for awhile.

If you are in Banff, there are no shortage of fantabulous watering holes but a couple good ones are the pump and tap (brit bar where locals hang out), Rose and Crown, The Gate and Devil's Gap which is a snowboard/punker bar are all excellent choices in a town where there are no shortage of options!

If I have to mention one in Toronto, I might have to go with the Old Nick.  I've stayed with a couple friends who live over near the Danforth & I make an effort to get there.
Great brunch on weekends but always good food. Really nice back patio/garden area. PErfect for day beers. Last time I went my pal Dave Borins & I took our computers & worked there for a good few hours & drank our share of Creemores.
The owners are also big Mariposa Folk attendees so great music people. They tend to hire musicians as servers:)

Tracks on Tracks/NXNE was by far my highlight and will be for a long time. I will also be paying for it for a long time, so hopefully the great memories last longer. So worth it and so glad I made the decision to go.
Regina Folk Fest will be my next highlight of the summer, but yesterday I was looking at some other festivals around Saskatchewan and contemplating heading to some of them.
The Gateway Festival
in Bengough, SK looks good. I love OKA.
Ness Creek
maybe. I may get
All Folked Up
in Montmartre this weekend. I would love to be able to go to festivals all over the place, but I just don't have the funds. Trying to win tickets to Osheaga.

My favourite watering hole in Ireland:
Well, that's a hard one, but I went to a couple I'll never forget. The Brazen Head in Dublin is awesome because it's mostly still the original building which was built in 1198!!!!!!! ELEVEN NINETY EIGHT! That's insane.
And there was a pub in Galway (the name escapes me... for various reasons) that I loved because their solution for the new no smoking indoors law was to literally just cut a big whole in the ceiling of the upper level. Hilarious.

If I lived in Toronto full-time I'm not sure what my fave watering hole would be, but for music venues during NXNE I really enjoyed Dakota Tavern and Cameron House.
#79--Tariq, that podcast was really my gateway to Matt Mays. For those who don't know it's an early (2007) Sessions podcast that TH hosted with Matt and the band he assembled to play the soundtrack for his film "When the Angels Make Contact." Great music, great convo! I recommend you look it up.

<-- Took my son to a live DJ'd house party on Saturday (pictured). He kept the party rocking even after the cops showed up but at the end of the night he told me it was time to go home by grabbing my finger and pulling me to the car. I asked hime if it was time to go home and he nodded and said "Go Home". Oh yeah, he's 22 months old. Good thing he knows his limits!

Taqiq:  Charlie's is a total dive near the Common. On Maynard St I think. Great spot. I think Tom mentioned it too. It's members-only but there are lots of events such as "Every Wednesday" where journalists go (stemmed from the local alt-weekly, The Coast, which has it's office nearby going to press Wednesday evening.) Anyway, it's a great spot in the winter.

it would be rude of me not to say that getting to spend a bit of time hanging with Chopz during his LA svisit was pretty damn awesome. tho again, no hoing that day.  maybe when he's back in Spetember.
musicwise, Bahamas for free in Pasadena with TOtoLA & his pals. was pretty damn awesome. ok, it's the only Canuck show I've been to  this summer but he's so good it would still probably be a highlight. & we had great hot dogs for dinner after.

Going to St John's newfoundland for May 2-4. Been there several times, but each time just gets better and better.
<-----Favourite watering hole:
ok so it's certainly not local, and I have no idea what this place is like in the summer, but the Gingerman pub in Dublin is my favourite pub that I've ever been to. Everytime Kidcauley and I walked into that place, everyone immediately knew we were foreigners some how.. Probably our cbc toques, plaid shirts, and funny accents.

Tariq!! SO great to meet you at the picnic, even if it was just saying hi before I ran off haha
WHAT'S BEEN THE HIGHLIGHT OF YOUR SUMMER SO FAR? ﻿
EASY : I pretty much spent the first 5 weeks of the summer travelling across Canada.That trip cummulatively makes up the best time of my life. (even if it wasn't the official start date of summer, May 2-4 weekend marks it in my books). Between spending time with siblings in edmonton, cousins and mom in calgary, a roadtrip to sasquatch, hanging in victoria and vancouver (seeing gigs from arkells, wintersleep and we are the city),
tracks on tracks.
NxNE. relaxing and decompressing from it all on the train from Montreal to Halifax. seeing old friends in halifax.
And meeting so many of you guys  all along the way.
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE WATERING HOLE AND WHY? ﻿
The Ship Pub in St. John's. The staff are fantastic. The shows are ALWAYS amazing. A small, intimate, rocking venue that bands love playing cause of it's atmosphere. You'd probably think it was a dive bar if you wandered in on a tuesday or thursday night, but on the weekends and mondays for it's open mic, nothing beats it. Gotta appreciate the character and charm of a place that's been around as long as it has. (Even The Smugglers have played there!)

My two favourite watering holes in Houston are: the Flying Saucer - although part of a chain, they've got a huge beer selection (well over 200 beers at any one time) and a scheme where if you drink 200 different beers, you get your name on a saucer on the wall (I'm at 126).
Velvet Melvin - Fun dive bar a block from my office. It's the perfect place to go have a cheap beer with co-workers after a long day/week.

Annie is short & has short brown hair & a great cheerful smiley face.She usually is in charge of the volunteer camping but with the change up in camping this year, she might be working with the attendee camping too.
I  might have a picture on FB of her. I'll have a peek. I know a ton other people up there but oy, too tough to explain. You could partake in my usually MFF hang activity which is to get a large order of fries & go stand in the pub. Inevitably everyone I know will find me & share the fries. It's a good portion control trick if you want gravy fries but not too many.

I have a couple of watering holes that top my list here in Calgary.
One is The Palomino. Not only do they have amazing BBQ, they also have free live music during Friday happy hours and they bring through some of the best indie music. Some say the staff are surly, but I haven't found that to be the case. I was there often enough in March (during 30 bands in 30 days) that the waitresses knew me, and often enough during Sled Island that the door guy knew me. Lovely folks.
My local is the Kensington Pub (KP). Cozy place in the neighbourhood to grab a beer (or two) with friends. Get to know the waitresses and bartenders and you can bring your own mug for your pints. Love it there.

@benoit - Well, as they say, "It's not the heat, it's the humidity."  California, although sometimes well over 40C, usually has low humidity.  Makes forest and grass fires a constant threat in our land of no summer rain, but 90F/33C can be very tolerable if you get out of the sunshine, into the shade.

Cleaver - Palomino. Went there when I was in YYC a few weeks ago. Bacon wrapped corn blew my mind. Didn't see any bands though! It seems like a cool hang all the same.

Yeah, Steph, just because we're not famous doesn't mean we're not rememberable!
I've had something similar, though different, happen a few times when I meet a performer I've seen before at the Sheep, and I don't particularly remember talking to him or her, but (s)he goes '"oh hi, glad you could come!", and slaps me on the shoulder or something... We are not necessarily forgettable, even though...
Also, some performers have steel trap memories.

204, hedge: well then, just rehearse saying something banal but true, for instance "I really like your music, and I'm glad to have heard you live."
Maybe take the time to get a signature. And then kick off, unless you want to chat some more.﻿

@RAM - IME were the headliners on George for Canada Day... didn't sell very well I don't think. Deff not as packed when we walked past as t usually is. saw the lead singer solo a few months ago and he covered Wagon Wheel. I pretty much lost all respect for him on the spot. And I live on Wilcox Place, so it'll kinda be like you're still there watching david Wilcox... Maybe? hahah

Port Hope has a music festival...  It's Jazz. Not like other cities are 'Jazz', though. It's actually all Jazz.
This fest, a couple towns over, is a better option. I'm trying to get a bunch of people to go, actually.

They give more background and information on the topic and other options that are being suggested. The Senate committee on transportation recently released a report suggesting airports reduce rental fees so those savings can, eventually, be passed on to the consumers.
Obviously that won't work. The airlines will take the savings and line their pockets with them.

@Steph - Airport fees, taxes and other surcharges are a large part of why we pay more. Toronto Int'l Airport has some of the highest airport fees around.
