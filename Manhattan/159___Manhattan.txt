Character and places of interest
North Holland is mainly made up of
high-rise projects
and ghettos, with a heavy gangster influence. The area is ethically diverse although there is a large African-American and Black population. It is where the
North Holland Hustlers
originated from.
Landmarks in the district include:
The
Holland Hospital Center
at Frankfort Avenue and Uranium Street.
The Algonquin
TW@
cybercafe at Frankfort and Wardite Street.
A
Burger Shot
restaurant at Galveston Avenue and Topaz Street.
Club Liberty
at Galveston and Wardite.
Transportation
North Holland houses
Vauxite subway station
on Vauxite Street, the train station is served by the
A/J Algonquin Outer Line .
Frankfort High
and
Frankfort Low
stations also serve North Holland, located on Frankfort Avenue at the boundary of
Northwood
and North Holland; the stations are served by the
Algonquin Inner Line . The three stations and two lines served in North Holland make the district very well facilitated from a transport standpoint.
Influences
North Holland is based on
Harlem , a northern
Manhattan
neighbourhood that was known for crime throughout the 20th century, but is currently experiencing gentrification. The choice of name for North Holland is
presumably
based on the location of
Haarlem
(which Harlem takes its name from), the provincial capital of Noord-Holland, (Translation:
North Holland ), Netherlands.
Among the landmarks spoofed in the district include
Hotel Theresa , known in game as "Hotel Hamilton", located on both sides of the East Holland-North Holland border, the
125th Street station
as the elevated Frankfort High station, and the
second Cotton Club
as the
Linen Lounge .   the idea for holland might have came from the holland tunnel which connects jersey city to manhatten
Falling glitch
If you go to
Vauxite Street
in North Holland, there is a red accesible door to the west of the
Modo
store. If you can get the police to follow you when you have a wanted level, it is possible to accomplish this glitch. So when you have lured them up the stairs, go to the rooftop and head south around the small building and go down the stairs and you will find a plank. Jump over the gap to the other building (Police still following) and find cover behind the brick wall. Up your wanted level and the police will attempt to jump over the gap between the two buildings. However every police officer will just fall of the edge of the plank (they dont even jump).
