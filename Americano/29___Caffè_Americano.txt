$15.000 Must Go PJ Won
Saturday, July 19th!
I
was very, very shocked when this occured Saturday night. I believe that I am
still in shock. I'm one of those people that never wins, until now. This is the
best bingo site that I have ever been too. I'll continue playing here, as long
as, this site is around. Words really can't express how suprised I am. I can't
wait to go on vacation because I have money to burn. Thank you so much bingo fest
for being the best bingo site on the web. I'll be sure to tell all my friends
to come to this website because it is truly the best around.

Hi…My username is sharonbruckner and I was playing Friday night in the Deuces and Jokers video poker room and decided to plan the 5-line and bet the max. Imagine my surprise when I looked and saw that I had won

" Thanks to AlphaBingo's (now BingoFest) generous 499% deposit special this weekend I was able to play some extra video poker. I had a hard day at work and came home to relax to some gaming, playing a bit of bingo and ALOT of poker. To my amazement, while playing Double Joker Poker I was dealt three cards of the royal flush and not thinking much of it, I hit deal and the other 2 came in! A whopping $4000 win!!!!  I am always impressed with the big bingo pots and great payout odds on the casino games here. Thanks Alpha for a GREAT win!!!

From there, members can redeem accrued points whenever they wish for cash bonuses by clicking on the 'Loyalty' button in the member's area.

Christian Bale, Amy Winehouse, Mark Whitaker
July 29, 2008
NBC has named
Mark Whitaker
as its next
Washington
bureau chief,
succeeding the late
Tim Russert
. Whitaker, the former editor of Newsweek, has been a senior vice president of
NBC News since 2007. The appointment has been widely expected because of
Whitaker's extensive journalism credentials. He will fulfill the off-camera
duties that had been handled by Russert, including overall management of the
bureau and oversight of political coverage as well as the "Meet the
Press" Sunday discussion program. He said he recognized that he had
"big shoes to fill." In a telephone interview Whitaker said:
"I'm honored to get the chance. We're in the middle of a historic
election, the economy is going through its worst time in a generation and there
are big changes on the world scene."
Amy Winehouse
was released Tuesday
from a
London
hospital after she suffered a reaction to medication the day before, a hospital
spokesman said. An ambulance had taken Winehouse from her north
London
home to
University
College
Hospital ,
a spokesman said. It was the second time in as many months that Winehouse had
been in the hospital. She was admitted to a
London
clinic in June after collapsing, and
her father,
Mitch Winehouse
, said at the time that she had developed early stage emphysema from smoking
cigarettes and crack cocaine. Winehouse got out in time to perform at the 90th
birthday of the former president of
South Africa ,
Nelson Mandela
.

Christian Bale
skirted questions
about the assault allegations against him at the
Tokyo
premiere of "The Dark Night."
British media have reported that Bale's mother and sister told the police that
he had assaulted them at the hotel a day before the film's European premiere.
But the Batman star managed to make it through the hugely successful movie's
premiere in
Japan
with virtually no comment on his personal problems. "It's a private
matter," he told a crowded news conference. Bale, 34, has said through his
lawyers that the assault allegations are false. The Welsh actor's personal
drama hasn't hurt the movie. It crossed the $300 million mark in just 10 days
in the
United States
and is
expected to do well in Europe and
Asia .

Just months before he
died,
George Carlin
was
looking into the face of death - and making it the butt of his jokes. "You
know what I've been doing? Going through my address book and crossing out the
dead people. It gives you a feeling of power, of superiority, to have outlasted
another old friend," Carlin says on what turned out to be his final comedy
album. The recording, "It's Bad For Ya," was to be released Tuesday
on Eardrum Records. Carlin died June 22 of a heart attack at 71. In an interview
four months before his death, he said he was particularly pleased with the
material he was working up for the album and an HBO show that aired last March.
"Definitely some people who are close to me who have seen this show, and
have seen a lot of the others, feel this is my best stuff yet," he said.

"Glory Days"
are here again for
Bruce Springsteen
, whose upcoming tour could make him the biggest touring artist of the year in
North America . Springsteen and his
E Street Band
, who kick off the second

The British singer
Chris de Burgh
will stage a concert

PORSCHE
SEES THE GREEN LIGHT
Motoring with
www.bingofest.com
Sunday July 13,2008
If you were making a list of what not to
do in the middle of a fuel crisis, launching a sports car would surely be
somewhere near the top.
If you were being uncharitable, you might
even compare it to Gerald Ratner’s classic joke about his lacklustre products.
Don’t be too hasty – the new 911 might look like its predecessor but this is
the first Porsche to emphasise its green credentials.
Hiding beneath the retractable rear wing is a choice of two new engines.
A technical tour de force, it promises lower fuel consumption and emissions and
a few more horsepower, too.
Available as a 3.6-litre in the standard Carrera and a 3.8 in the Carrera S,
it’s joined by a new double-clutch, semi-automatic gearbox that aims to inject
fresh life into Porsche’s image leader.
Some manufacturers might have been tempted to announce these techno delights
with a bold new look, but you’d have to be a serious Porsche anorak to notice
the new LED rear lights, wing mirrors and front air intakes.
Don’t expect a new look inside either.
There’s a revised and marginally less confusing entertainment system and that’s
about it.
You still sit upright in an intimate cabin and view the world through a steeply
raked windscreen.
Compared with such rivals as Audi’s R8 it feels rather old school but this has
always been part of the 911’s charm.
The cockpit of the world’s most iconic sports car is still an emotive place to
be.

NOW BURGLARS WILL NOT BE
JAILED
BRITAIN ’S soft justice system hit a new low
yesterday with plans to scrap prison sentences for burglars.
Hundreds of
thousands of crooks could escape jail every year under the proposals by
advisers to the Lord Chief Justice.
Those sentenced to
short, sharp shock jail terms of less than 12 months for “less serious
offences” – including burglary – should be handed community penalties instead,
they said.
Even those who are
likely to reoffend could walk free from court if it is believed they will go on
to commit “non-serious offences”.
And in a further
blow, while courts must not be swayed by victims demanding harsher punishments
for offenders, the advisers said that judges should listen if they call for
leniency.
Critics said the
proposals would do nothing to calm the fears of law-abiding members of the
public who have lost their faith in the criminal justice system, and would not
deter those intent on crime.
Shadow Justice
Secretary Nick Herbert said burglary is “deeply upsetting for its victims and
should not be dealt with lightly”. He added: “People rightly expect that
offenders who invade their home will be dealt with severely, and they have
little confidence in weak community sentences which too often aren’t even properly
enforced.”
Retired judge Keith
Matthewman QC called the proposals “an absolute disgrace”. He said: “Criminals
laugh at community sentences. The only thing they are frightened of is prison.
Many years ago when I was defending people they would say, ‘Can you get me off
with a community sentence?’.
“It is entirely the
wrong way to go and I hope judges take no notice of it. The law-abiding public
has lost all faith in the criminal justice system and so have I.”
More than 292,000
burglaries were reported to police last year. Burglars are locked up for an
average of six months – but the Sentencing Advisory Panel said unpaid work or a
curfew could be a better way of punishing them.
The panel – which
advises the Sentencing Guidelines Council, chaired by the Lord Chief Justice –
said short custodial sentences are not as effective at rehabilitating offenders.
But it stressed
that, rather than suggesting longer jail terms, it was saying that “there may
be better alternatives to short custodial sentences”.
The panel’s review
said: “A presumption in favour of a community order is most likely to be
appropriate in relation to the less serious offences of theft and dishonesty,
burglary and motoring offences, where there may be clear advantages in a
sentence in the community.”
It added: “The risk
that an offender may commit further offences of a non-serious nature should not
automatically indicate that custody is necessary.”
And after saying
victims’ views should only affect a judge if they are calling for leniency
rather than harsher sentencing, it admitted the move would “create a certain
level of inconsistency”.
Liberal Democrat
home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said the advice looked like a way of
avoiding further prison overcrowding. “Punishments should fit the crime and not
the availability of prison places,” he said.
Mr Matthewman added:
“Panels like this think more about the criminals than the victims – and yet it
is the victims who spend the rest of their lives suffering.”
The panel also
suggested  cases where criminals could get lesser sentences. They include
pregnant women and carers.
It also said those
in gainful employment should get community orders so they can keep their jobs –
but then said this would “work against those disadvantaged by being unemployed”.
SAP chairman Andrew
Ashworth said: “In what circumstances should an offender be given a custodial
sentence? We need to make sure we have an up-to-date understanding of public
opinion.”

Fashion king Yves Saint Laurent dies
By
Crispian Balmer, PARIS (Reuters)
2/06/2008
04:06
French fashion king
Yves Saint Laurent has died at the age of 71, hailed as a 20th century cultural
icon who revolutionised the way women dressed.
The reclusive
Saint Laurent 's couture creations won global fine art
status and he was widely considered to be one of an elite club of designers
including Christian Dior and Coco Chanel who made
Paris
the fashion capital of the world.
From Princess Grace
of
Monaco
to the actress
Catherine Deneuve,
Saint Laurent 's
creations adorned many famous women but he was also the first designer to make
luxury labels accessible to a wider audience through innovative read-to-wear
collections.
He exploded on to the
world stage at just 21 and built up a clothes, perfumes and accessories empire
that resulted in a 1989 stock market flotation -- the first by a fashion house.
Advertisement
But
Saint Laurent , whose death on Sunday was
announced without any details of the cause, was plagued by health problems --
he suffered from severe depression and underwent treatment for alcohol abuse.
French President
Nicolas Sarkozy praised
Saint Laurent
as a creative genius. "He was convinced that beauty was a luxury that
every man and woman needed," Sarkozy said in a statement.
"( Coco ) Chanel gave women freedom. Yves Saint Laurent gave
them power,"
Saint Laurent 's
long-time friend and business partner Pierre Berge told France Info radio.
"(But) he was
someone who was very shy and introverted, who had only very few friends and hid
himself from the world."
Saint Laurent , who retired in
2002, was widely credited with changing forever what women wore, making the
trouser suit a daytime staple and the tuxedo an elegant option.
He also popularised
safari jackets and thigh-high boots, and his transparent blouses made
near-nudity acceptable in high society. His square-shouldered suits became
classics and he simplified evening-wear, moving from shocking satins to flowing
white crepe of Hellenic purity.
"He completely
revamped a woman's wardrobe," luxury underwear designer Chantal Thomass
told French radio. "His fashion was full of colour and inspired by
art."
EARLY TALENT
The eldest child of a
wealthy French industrialist,
Saint Laurent
was
born and grew up in the then French colony of
Algeria
and showed a talent for
design, making clothes for his younger sisters' dolls.
At 17 he entered a
Paris
fashion school, and
his sketch for a cocktail dress won first prize in an annual contest.
Introduced to
Christian Dior, the gangly
Saint
Laurent
was hired on the spot by the creator of the
"New Look" and became his chief assistant. On Dior's death in 1957,
Saint Laurent
became
chief designer and swiftly outshone his mentor.
After his first
collection introduced the widely copied "trapeze" silhouette with
narrow shoulders and flared skirt, the shy 21-year-old was pushed out on to the
Dior building balcony and crowds in the avenue below hailed him like royalty.
Saint Laurent
directed Dior for
three years, until drafted for military service during the Algerian war.
For a sensitive
person whose homosexuality had made his school years a torture, army life was
an ordeal. He had a nervous breakdown and spent nearly three months in
hospital.
Berge got a
businessman to provide backing for the young designer to establish his own
fashion house, and
Saint Laurent
presented his first collection under his own name in 1962.
The "YSL"
empire grew steadily and
Saint Laurent
showed an instinctive ability to sense what the mood on the streets was and
turn it into high fashion.
But by the late 1980s
his health problems were an issue.
Insiders said
Saint Laurent , who never
read newspapers or listened to the radio, became increasingly cut off from
reality and lost touch with all but a tiny group of friends.
"Fame has
destroyed him," Berge once said.
"All designers
have a bit of the megalomaniac in them -- the only difference is that the fake
designers, the bad ones, are happy megalomaniacs while the real ones are
unhappy megalomaniacs.
Saint Laurent
is an unhappy megalomaniac."
Despite the personal
demons, his business empire thrived. The 1989 flotation was a runaway success.
But when the Gulf War
erupted and the world economy slumped in the early 1990s, Berge and
Saint Laurent
sank into
debt.
In 1992, YSL was
absorbed by cosmetics and drugs company Sanofi, with
Saint Laurent
retaining creative control.
Then in 1999 it was bought by the Gucci group, itself controlled by French
luxury giant PPR.
Saint
Laurent , rarely seen in public after his retirement, was awarded
one of
France 's
top honours in 2007.

Remembering Charlton Heston, the nicest man 'that ever lived
in movies'
Published: April 11, 2008
'What does it matter what you say about
people?" Marlene Dietrich asks at the end of that 1958 American
masterpiece "Touch of Evil." She's talking about the dead cop Hank
Quinlan, a mound of stilled flesh and lasting corruption given frightening life
by the film's director, Orson Welles. The man who brings him down is Vargas,
the upright Dudley Do-Right Mexican detective with a paint-on tan. Lantern jaw
set like a vise, this is of course Charlton Heston.
Dietrich's character probably had it right
that it doesn't really matter what we say about people, but in the wake of
Heston's death on Saturday, I would like to offer a few words about one of the
last American movie stars. This seems particularly worthwhile because in the
final decades of his life he had all but disappeared from the screen, making
one of his only on-camera appearances in "Bowling for Columbine,"
Michael Moore's 2002 anti-gun feature.
Moore
shows up at Heston's home and tries to shame this stooped and visibly frail old
man for his stance on guns. The old man doesn't engage
Moore , just walks away, unfailingly polite to
the end.
Welles called Heston "the nicest man to
work with that ever lived in movies." These two seemingly unlikely collaborators
were brought together to star in a pulpy Universal Pictures project originally
titled "Badge of Evil." Heston thought that his co-star had been
hired as the director ("any picture that Welles directs, I'll make"),
which prompted the studio quickly to sign Welles up for what would be his last
Hollywood
studio gig. Welles rewrote the screenplay and
shot much of the film in the
Venice
Beach
area of
Los
Angeles . History, alas, repeated itself, and he lost
control of the film as he had on "The Magnificent Ambersons," which
is a different story from the one I want to tell. (A beautifully re-edited
version was released in 1998 and is available on DVD.)
It was Welles who decided that Heston should
play the role as a Mexican, partly as a way of building up what he considered
to be an uninteresting character. (At first glance it may seem as if Welles
failed.) Shortly after the film opens, Vargas and his delectable new American
bride, Susan (Janet Leigh), kiss at the Mexican-American border, a passionate
embrace that leads to a cataclysmic explosion and soon plunges the newlyweds
into a phantasmagoria of sleaze, violence and very low camera angles. Vargas, a
celebrity cop who has brought a case against a drug ring that's about to go to
trial in
Mexico City ,
spends much of the story separated from Susan and circling Quinlan, a dirty
American lawman.
In long shot and choking close-up, Welles
directs Heston brilliantly, making particularly memorable use of the actor's
physicality, his big, rangy body and the hard, clean right angles of his face.
The ramrod straight, straight
as an arrow Vargas, with his impossibly long and loping stride, could not look
or register more different from Quinlan, an amorphous blob who all but rolls
across the screen. Welles exploits Heston's rigidity as a performer (and his
American movie-star presence) for the character, using what in other films
sometimes seemed like a limitation of craft and technique to the great
advantage of the story's texture and meaning. He turns Heston's jutting jaw
into the wagging finger of righteousness, deepening the film's complex
morality.
Heston starred in other notable films, of
course, including Sam Peckinpah's vicious 1965 western, "Major
Dundee," another story about border crossing and yet another ill-fated
production taken away from its director. Heston plays the title character, a
fanatical cavalry officer who, along with a motley posse, chases marauding
Apaches into
Mexico .
Heston has his moments as
Dundee
- there's something about his intensity that lends itself to obsessive characterizations
- but he remains elusive, never becoming the Ahab that Peckinpah was after. As
he had with Welles, Heston showed great loyalty to his troubled director and
threatened to walk if the studio fired Peckinpah, who was drinking heavily
throughout the production. Heston forfeited his salary in the bargain.
As much as I admire "Major Dundee,"
my fondness for Heston can be traced back to the films I saw growing up, most
important his great dystopian trilogy: "Planet of the Apes" (1968),
"The Omega Man" (1971) and "Soylent Green" (1973).
This was the Charlton Heston I first met and
loved and the one I still love, the last man on Earth, the raging
consciousness, the horrified hero. Few films thrilled me - or scared me - as
much as "Soylent Green," in which his character realizes that the
stuff keeping the human race alive is made from other human beings:
"Soylent Green is people!" By then, he had played Moses and saved an
entire people from destruction.
Things didn't look good in "Soylent
Green," but somehow, I thought, surely Charlton Heston could save us.

"Monster's Ball" and "The Kite Runner."

'Run, Fat Boy, Run': A goofy, but
inspirational fantasy
The
beleaguered man-boy Dennis Doyle (Simon Pegg) is always running, running, running,
an activity befitting the hero of the British comedy titled "Run, Fat Boy,
Run." In the film's prologue he runs away from his pregnant fiancée, Libby
(Thandie Newton, charming in a largely reactive role), minutes before their
scheduled wedding.
When we
catch up with him years later, he's a chubby security guard sprinting after a
shoplifter. Soon after, Dennis decides to enter the same marathon as Libby's
rich American boyfriend, Whit, to show Libby and his now elementary school-age
son, Jake, that he can make plans and see them through. "You can't even
finish a sentence," Libby says.
"Fat
Boy" will never be mistaken for art. It's "Rocky" by way of
"There's Something About Mary," an inspirational fantasy with
guy's-guy banter and gross-out humor (including a blister-popping scene that
seems to be this film's answer to the hair gel bit in "Mary"). Yet
it's effective and affecting; much of its impact comes from its images of
Dennis running and its conviction that there's a difference between running toward
something and running away. (The film, which had a limited release last year,
is being released worldwide this spring.)
Pegg -
the star and co-writer of "Shaun of the Dead," "Hot Fuzz"
and "Fat Boy," which is derived from a script by Michael Ian Black that
was originally set in America - never shies away from Dennis's pathetic
essence. Even when training for a marathon he can't seem to stop smoking and
eating junk food. But Pegg also gives us enough of a sense of Dennis's capacity
for self-transformation that his mission seems both plausible and inspiring.
Pegg is
abetted by a strong supporting cast that includes Hank Azaria as the laid-back
yet ferociously competitive Whit; Matthew Fenton as the sweet but never-cloying
Jake; and Dylan Moran as Dennis's best friend, Gordon, a degenerate gambler.
The
film's mix of droll banter, lowbrow slapstick and melancholy song montages
suggests that its director, the former "Friends" star David
Schwimmer, has seen "The Graduate" more than once. The movie is
formulaic, and there are times when Schwimmer and his writers overdo things,
particularly in the finale, which finds Whit, previously a human-scaled jerk,
indulging in cartoon villainy.
But its
assembly line aspects are countered by touches that translate drama into
metaphor, like the scene in which Dennis and Whit walk with Jake, each would-be
daddy tugging at one of the boy's hands, wishbone style, and an earlier scene
in which Whit warns Dennis that every marathoner hits a wall - an admonition
that pays off in the marathon sequence when Dennis encounters a chillingly
effective visualization of that wall.
"Run,
Fat Boy, Run" is the kind of movie that's apt to be dismissed a goofy
lark. It is that. But it's also a rare comedy that believes in its own message,
and that could inspire the depressed and the demoralized to grit their teeth
and keep running.

(Jim Sturgess, serviceable), who because he can't afford Harvard Medical School
(boo hoo), starts counting cards to rake in some serious cash.
The
conduit to Ben's journey of counterfeit self-discovery is a racially,
ethnically, sexually balanced gang of other greedy bright things (the most
appealing being Aaron Yoo, wasted as the kooky, sexless Asian guy), run by an
equally avaricious math professor, Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey on autopilot).
Using a system of mnemonic devices, goofy hand signals and a talent for
numbers, the team has devised a way to beat the bank. Because Ben doesn't want
to use his poor widowed mother's savings to go to Harvard, he decides to ditch
his qualms if not his sense (because he really has none) and signs on.
And so
it's off to Vegas they go, where they count the cards, take the money and run.
Amid the din and glare of various casinos, the director Robert Luketic, whose
credits include "Legally Blonde," engages in other dodgy business: He
cribs from Wong Kar Wai's "Chungking Express" period (Ben sits
motionless as the world races by); borrows from the David Fincher of
"Fight Club" (camera tricks for kicks); lifts from Martin Scorsese's
"Casino" (throw the money in the air like you just don't care); and
pays homage to universal whoredom by restaging the "Pretty Woman"
shopping montage. He also tosses in some gleaming rides, a couple of PG-13 pole
dancers and a Rolling Stones remix that both Dad and the kids can enjoy. (The
film is being released worldwide this spring.)

Speak out on Tibet
China
has cracked down on
Tibet
and
neighboring provinces. It sent more troops into restive regions and made scores
of arrests in
Lhasa .
It acknowledged firing on demonstrators in
Sichuan . Yet, the response of the
international community - and of the International Olympic Committee - has been
tepid.
Beijing
must be called to account, especially since it will be the host to the 2008
Games.
China
has blocked most news coverage despite
a pledge to give freer access to journalists in the run-up to the Olympics.
Tibetan exile groups say as many as 100 people died in violence that followed a
week of peaceful protests.
Beijing
puts the toll at about 20.
The U.S. State Department says
Tibet
- taken by force by
China
in
1951 - is "one of
China 's
poorest regions." Authorities have increased controls over the practice of
Buddhism and committed serious human rights abuses.
The Dalai Lama,
Tibet 's
exiled spiritual leader, has shown remarkable restraint against what he calls
"cultural genocide." Despite the bloodshed, he reaffirmed a
commitment to nonviolence and greater autonomy - rather than independence - for
Tibet .
In return,
Beijing
called him a "devil."
But
China 's authoritarianism is
backfiring, fueling resentment that exploded in
Lhasa
and radicalizing Tibetans, who
increasingly demand independence.
The
United
States
and other major countries must go
beyond anemic statements urging Chinese restraint. They must make it clear that
such repression violates the promise
Beijing
made to improve its human rights record when it won the Olympics bid. It mocks the
Olympic Charter, which extols "human dignity." It mocks the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, which recognizes "equal and inalienable
rights of all."
The West should keep pressing
Beijing
to begin serious talks with the Dalai Lama and instruct the UN Human Rights
Council to begin a probe in
Tibet .
The White House says President George W. Bush is trying to influence
Beijing . So far, we see
no positive results.
Inexcusably, the International Olympic Committee has done little
to defend its values and has stuck with plans to have the Olympic torch pass
through
Lhasa .
Boycotting the Games doesn't work; we know that from experience.
But the idea of Bernard Kouchner,
France 's foreign minister, about
not attending the opening ceremony is worth considering. What message does it
send if dignitaries lend their prestige to
China 's
coming out party as if nothing happened in
Tibet ?

Rice apologizes to Obama for passport
breach
The Associated Press, The New York Times
Published: March 21, 2008
WASHINGTON :
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice apologized Friday to
Senator Barack Obama for an incident in which three State Department contract
workers unnecessarily reviewed the Democratic presidential candidate's passport
file.
"I
told him that I was sorry, and I told him that I myself would be very disturbed,"
Rice said. "None of us wants to have a circumstance where any American's
passport files are looked at in an unauthorized way," she added.
The
episode raised questions as to whether the scrutiny was politically motivated.
Two of the workers were fired and a third was reprimanded for improperly
opening electronic information from the passport file of Obama, State
Department officials said.
Rice,
who spoke with Obama by telephone, said she was particularly disappointed that
senior officials at the State Department had not been immediately notified.
The
State Department's inspector general is investigating the breach. On Friday,
the State Department announced that the Justice Department would be monitoring
the inquiry.
A
spokesman for the Obama campaign, Bill Burton, said, "This is an
outrageous breach of security and privacy, even from an administration that has
shown little regard for either over the last eight years."
A
State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said Friday that all of the results
of the investigation would be made available to congressional oversight
committees and to Obama's office. The department said it would not release the
names of those who had been fired and disciplined or the names of the two
companies for which they worked.
McCormack
said the breaches occurred on Jan. 9, Feb. 21 and March 14 and had been
detected by internal computer checks.

Whitney museum to receive $131 million gift
Leonard Lauder, the cosmetics executive and chairman of the Whitney Museum of American Art, said on Tuesday that his art foundation would give the museum $131 million, the biggest donation in the Whitney's 77-year history.
The bulk of the money — $125 million — will go toward the Whitney's endowment, boosting it to $195 million from $70 million, Lauder said in a telephone interview.
The Whitney called the gift one of the largest donations ever to a
New York
museum's endowment. Lauder said that the money required the museum not to sell its Marcel Breuer building on Madison Avenue at
75th Street
for an extended period, although he declined to specify how long.
The Whitney announced last year that it planned to open a satellite museum downtown in the meatpacking district of Manhattan, which stirred speculation that it might sell its Breuer building.
But Lauder said he was determined that the Whitney keep its hulking 1966 building. "Like so many architecture lovers, I believe the Whitney and the Breuer building are one," he said.
Given the precarious state of the economy, Lauder, who turns 75 on Wednesday, emphasized that he could be depended on for the donation, which he said he had long planned.
"Being old enough to have lived through several recessions, when I made the decision years ago, I asked my financial advisers to move the money into T-bills," he said. "So it is sitting there and is very secure."
Lauder is chairman of the Estée Lauder Companies and, according to Forbes magazine, had a net worth of $3.2 billion in 2007.
The gift includes $6 million to cover expenses until the donation is complete, which is expected to be by June 30, 2009. The money is a major infusion for the Whitney, which has been historically under-endowed. Its new endowment total of $195 million will still pale in comparison with those of institutions like the
Museum
of
Modern Art , with an $850 million endowment. (Ronald Lauder, Leonard Lauder's brother, is a trustee and former board chairman at MoMA.)
Adam Weinberg, the Whitney's director, said the gift would help the Whitney sustain its "risk-taking" tradition. "It will now be the first time our endowment will be large enough so that the Whitney can maintain its commitment to living artists and to adventurous programming," he said.
Although Lauder's donation is likely to quiet rumors that the Whitney might decamp from the Breuer building, the museum's plans remain an open question. Since the Whitney set its sights on the meatpacking district, the city's arts world has fretted that the institution might not be able to afford two locations.
The gift was timed to encourage other Whitney trustees to donate generously to the downtown project. "It has already generated tremendous support on the part of the trustees," Weinberg said.
Although he declined to say how much money had been raised for the new building or how much the Whitney still needed, he said that the initial, or so-called silent, phase of the capital campaign was "going forward."
In November the Whitney announced that it had reached a conditional agreement with the city's Economic Development Corporation to buy a city-owned site at
Washington
and West Streets, the same place where the Dia Art Foundation had planned to build a museum. (In October 2006 Dia said it had scrapped that idea and would seek a different site in the city.) The Whitney satellite is to be designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano.
Piano was also the architect for a proposed nine-story addition to the Breuer building that was abandoned in 2006.
The Piano scheme was the third time in more than a decade that the museum had commissioned a celebrity architect to design a major expansion, only to pull out.
To realize its new project in the meatpacking district, the museum needs to go through the zoning process, conclude the land purchase and determine the cost of designing and building the satellite and operating museums both uptown and downtown, Weinberg said.
"We are studying the idea of a comprehensive Whitney, trying to see how the two programs would work," he said.
In the world of museum fund-raising, endowment money is always the most difficult to solicit. Unlike donations for building projects, an endowment gift does not give a donor the opportunity to finance a namesake building, a promise extended to the Wall Street financier Stephen Schwarzman last week when he gave the
New York
Public Library $100 million to jump-start its $1 billion expansion. In return, the library's main branch on
Fifth Avenue
at
42nd Street
is being renamed the
Stephen
Schwarzman
Building .
Lauder's gift surpasses that of Schwarzman as well as a $100 million endowment gift pledged to MoMA by David Rockefeller, a chairman emeritus of the Modern, in 2005. But unlike Lauder's gift, Rockefeller's donation will not be completed until after his death. In the meantime Rockefeller is giving $5 million a year, as if the money were already invested in the endowment.
Lauder's gift is not the first major donation he has made to the Whitney. Since becoming its chairman in 1994, he has led the campaign for the new fifth-floor galleries in the Breuer building, which are devoted entirely to the permanent collection.
Six years ago he led a three-year initiative to acquire about $200 million worth of art by masters like Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Ellsworth Kelly, Barnett Newman and Jackson Pollock.
Lauder's American Contemporary Art Foundation was responsible for the largest single group of art in that gift, including major works by Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, Warhol and Pollock.

In sleep, we are birds of a feather
By Henry
Fountain
(HT)
Published: July 1, 2008
Did you sleep like a
baby last night? You might think so, but actually you slept like a bird.
Or rather, a bird
slept like you. One bird, in particular — the zebra finch, which researchers
say has a sleep structure very much like that of people and other mammals.
Philip Steven Low of
the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in
San Diego ,
California ,
and colleagues report in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
that electroencephalograms of the songbirds show they have episodes of
rapid-eye-movement sleep and slow-wave sleep as well as transition stages and
quick spikes, all reminiscent of mammalian sleep patterns.
It's the first time
that this complete group of sleep characteristics has been found outside of
mammals — a surprising finding, Low said, because birds lack a neocortex, the
part of the mammalian brain thought necessary for such patterns.
Indeed, although
scientists have wanted to study sleep in songbirds because of evidence that
sleep played a role in song learning, the lack of a neocortex has hampered
efforts to do so; it has been difficult to pick up the proper electrical
signals from bird brains. Low experimented with moving the EEG electrodes around
the brain until he found a suitable spot. "The key to this is not unlike
California
real
estate," he said. "Location, location, location."
He
also devised an algorithm to analyze the signals. "It's pointless to look
at this data second by second," Low said. "I had to come up with a
mathematical way to understand the brain activity."
The algorithm produces
multidimensional grids that reveal the structure, he said. One goal is to use
similar algorithms to be able to detect structural changes in the sleep of
people with neurological disorders — "to use sleep as a microscope for
brain activity," Low said.
As for the zebra finch
results, he said, they show that a cortex isn't required to have such
structured sleep, and they also raise evolutionary issues. "The question
now becomes whether evolution has gone through the trouble of selecting for
these particular patterns more than once," he said.

History of Cleveland, Ohio
With
www.bingofest.com
Cleveland obtained its name on
July 22 ,
1796
when surveyors of the
Connecticut Land Company
laid out
Connecticut's
Western Reserve
into townships and a
capital city they named "Cleaveland" after their leader, General
Moses
Cleaveland . Cleaveland oversaw the plan for the modern downtown
area, centered on the
Public Square , before returning home, never
again to visit
Ohio .
The first settler in Cleaveland was Lorenzo Carter, who built a cabin on the
banks of the
Cuyahoga
River . The
Village
of
Cleaveland
was incorporated on
December 23 ,
1814 . The spelling of the
city's name was later changed to " Cleveland "
when, in 1831, an "a" was dropped so the name could fit a newspaper's
masthead.
In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, its waterfront
location proved providential. The area began rapid growth after the 1832
completion of the
Ohio and Erie Canal . This key link between the
Ohio River
and the
Great Lakes
connected the city to the
Atlantic Ocean
via the
St. Lawrence Seaway
and the
Gulf of
Mexico
via the
Mississippi
River . Growth continued with added railroad links.
Cleveland
incorporated as a city in 1836.
In 1836, the city, then located only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga
River, nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring
Ohio City
over a bridge
connecting the two.
Ohio
City
remained an independent municipality until it
was
annexed
by
Cleveland
in 1854. The site flourished as a halfway point for
iron ore
from
Minnesota
shipped across the
Great Lakes
and other raw
materials ( coal )
carried by rail from the south. Cleveland emerged as a major American
manufacturing center, home to numerous major
steel
producers, as well
as a number of
carmakers , including
gasoline
cars
Peerless ,
People's ,
Jordan ,
Winton
(first car driven across the U.S.),
steam car
builders
White
and
Gaeth , and
electric car
company
Baker . By 1920,
Standard Oil
founder
John D. Rockefeller
had made his fortune and
Cleveland
had become the
fifth largest city in the country. The city was a center for the national
progressive
movement , headed locally by Mayor
Tom L.
Johnson . Many Clevelanders of this era are buried in the historic
Lake View Cemetery , along with
James A.
Garfield , the twentieth
U.S. President .
The
Cuyahoga
River
winds through
the Flats
in a December 1937 aerial view of
downtown Cleveland .
In commemoration of the
centennial
of
Cleveland 's
incorporation as a city, the
Great Lakes Exposition
debuted in June
1936 along the
Lake Erie
shore north of downtown. Conceived as
a way to energize a city hit hard by the
Great
Depression , it drew 4 million visitors in its first season, and 7
million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937. The
exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the
Great Lakes Science Center , the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
and
Burke Lakefront Airport , among others.
Immediately after
World War II , the city experienced a brief
boom. In sports, the
Indians
won the
1948 World
Series
and the
Browns
dominated professional
football
in the 1950s. Businesses
proclaimed that
Cleveland
was the "best location in the nation". The city's population reached
its peak of 914,808, and in 1949
Cleveland
was
named an
All-America City
for the first time. By
the 1960s, however, heavy industries began to slump, and residents sought new
housing in the suburbs, reflecting the national trends of
white flight
and
urban sprawl .
Like other major American cities, Cleveland also began witnessing racial
unrest, culminating in the
Hough Riots
from
July 18 ,
1966
–
July 23 ,
1966
and the
Glenville Shootout
on
July 23 ,
1968
–
July 25 ,
1968 . The city's nadir is
often considered to be its
default
on its loans on
December 15 ,
1978 , when under Mayor
Dennis
Kucinich
it became the first major American city to enter default
since the Great Depression. National media began referring to Cleveland as
"the mistake on the lake" around this time, in reference to the
city's financial difficulties, a notorious 1969 fire on the
Cuyahoga
River
(where industrial waste on the river's surface caught on
fire), and its struggling professional sports teams. The city has worked to
shed this nickname ever since, though in recent times the national media have
been much kinder to the city, using it as an exemplar for
public-private partnerships , downtown
revitalization, and
urban renaissance .
The
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
on
Cleveland 's
North Coast Harbor
The metropolitan area began recovery thereafter under Mayors
George
Voinovich
and
Michael R. White . Redevelopment within the city
limits has been strongest in the downtown area near the
Gateway complex —consisting
of
Progressive Field
and
Quicken Loans Arena , and near
North Coast Harbor —including the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ,
Cleveland Browns Stadium , and the
Great Lakes Science Center . Although
Cleveland
was hailed by the media as the " Comeback
City ," many of the inner-city
residential neighborhoods remain troubled, and the public school system
continues to experience serious problems.
Economic development ,
retention of
young professionals , and capitalizing upon its waterfront are
current municipal priorities. In 1999,
Cleveland
was identified as an emerging
global city .

CANNES
FESTIVAL NOTEBOOK
Cannes : Where reality intrudes, like a goat,
on fantasy
CANNES :
Toward the end of Brillante Mendoza's
"Serbis," the patrons of a dilapidated
Manila
adult-movie palace are surprised to discover that a goat has wandered in from
the street, partly obstructing their view of the naked bodies on screen.
The animal's sudden appearance - which sets
off one of several chaotic, hilarious chases in this rambunctious, noisy film -
might be taken as a symbol. The cinema can be a place of fantasy and sometimes
disreputable pleasure, but reality, as stubborn and hard to corral as that
goat, has a way of intruding whether we like it or not.
At the Cannes Film Festival, however, the
metaphor often works in reverse. The metaphorical goats, as it were, can be
found in the screening rooms, where audiences gather, sheeplike, to witness the
frustration, misery and disorder of real life in various parts of the world.
The main competition (which this year includes Mendoza's film) and the
adventuresome Un Certain Regard side program share a tendency to exalt
seriousness and suffering, and some of the strongest entries this year plunge
viewers into worlds of private pain, family dysfunction, economic deprivation
and social cruelty.
Already, as the festival approaches its
midpoint, a rich sampling of modern cinematic realism has been on display.
Something approaching the 19th-century literary understanding of the term
informs "Un Conte de Noël," Arnaud Desplechin's busy, unpredictable
variation on the venerable home-for-the-holidays genre. With a cast that
includes Catherine Deneuve, Chiara Mastroianni and Mathieu Amalric, "A
Christmas Story" is one of the more lighthearted selections. It begins
with the death of a child and includes a vicious sibling feud, mental illness
and cancer.
On the more somber side, Walter Salles' and
Daniela Thomas' "Linha de Passe," from Brazil, looks back to the
models of postwar Italian cinema and sideways to the sentimental formulas of
Sundance as it tells the story of four brothers and their pregnant mother
struggling to rise above the mean streets of São Paulo. An equally well shot,
far more unsparing and analytically disciplined look at the predatory logic of
urban life (and lawless capitalism) can be found in " Gomorrah ,"
Matteo Garrone's ferocious adaptation of Roberto Soriano's best-selling
semifictional exposé of organized crime in
Naples .
If you want escapism it is sometimes necessary to flee the
screening rooms altogether. You might hop a cab to the Hôtel du Cap down the
coast and the scene, late Saturday night, of the Vanity Fair party.
What a lark! (What a mistake.) Clutching your
hard-won, holograph-embossed invitation, you descend from your taxi into the
care of solicitous security personnel, who, if they were a bit friendlier and
less neatly dressed, might be mistaken for some of the Neapolitan hit men in
" Gomorrah ."
Fortified with a glass of Veuve Clicquot and a paper cone of tiny fried fish,
you swirl through the crowd, telepathically air-kissing celebrities - Harrison!
Calista! Bono! Mr. Murdoch! - before settling into conversation with the two or
three people who will actually talk to you. After a brief stroll around the
grounds you're ready to go home.
But here comes that goat. By taking that
stroll around the grounds, it seems you forfeited your right to re-enter what's
left of the party, even to use the men's room. No means of escape is
forthcoming. A line of cars snakes up the drive, but none is here for you, and
your friends have all vanished. At that moment, you would give anything to be
back in the Palais, staring at a wide-screen projection of someone else's far
more interesting unhappiness.
(A.O. Scott)
Box-office Beasties
Each year a Big Hollywood movie clomps into
the Cannes Film Festival like Godzilla, stirring up an orchestrated panic among
media members frantic to get a piece of the action for the folks (and editors)
back home. Two years ago the beastie was called "The Da Vinci Code,"
which withstood mass attacks to conquer the world box office. This year it goes
by the name of "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"
which was shown on Sunday afternoon to a pumped-up crowd that cheered more
enthusiastically during the opening credits than it did at the end.
Whether the audience was disappointed or just
wrung out by the two hours of chase sequences and noise is probably less
relevant than that so many of us dutifully filled the theater, which of course
is the scenario that Paramount Pictures hopes to replicate worldwide when the
movie opens across the globe on Thursday. I'll have more to say on the movie
then, by which point it will already have been thoroughly masticated, spit out
and chewed all over again in the media that has already sunk its little teeth
into Indy's tired body with early negative notices. I was bored out of my mind
while watching the movie, which makes me think that Steven Spielberg was
terribly bored while directing it. But that's a germ of an idea that I would
like to actually contemplate for a few days.

Neil
Young , already a singer and songwriter, is now spider man. No, not
Peter Parker of comic book fame, but the man whose name has been bestowed on a
new species of spider. The tribute was rendered to the 62-year-old musician by
Jason Bond , a
biologist at
East
Carolina
University
in
Greenville ,
North
Carolina , who discovered a new trapdoor spider that's indigenous
to
Alabama
and chose to call it Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi. In a statement Bond, 40, said:
"There are rather strict rules about how you name new species. As long as
these rules are followed, you can give a new species just about any name you
please. With regards to Neil Young, I really enjoy his music and have a great
appreciation of him as an activist for peace and justice."
The
"Sex and the City" stars lit up London's Leicester Square for the
world premiere of the cinematic sequel to their New York adventures, dressed in
the glamorous - and sometimes quirky - outfits that helped make the show an
international hit.
Sarah
Jessica Parker , who plays the columnist Carrie Bradshaw, stole
the show with a soaring
Philip Treacy
hat complemented by a pale green dress by
Alexander McQueen .
She was joined by her co-stars
Kim
Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon
and
Kristin Davis , known on screen as
Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte. Cattrall wore a red
Vivienne Westwood
dress
and Nixon was in a floor-length black pleated
Calvin Klein
gown.
Davis
wore a more modest vintage fuschia
dress. The film begins opening worldwide on May 28.
David
Byrne , the former frontman for the
Talking Heads , is planning to transform
a landmark
Manhattan
building into a huge
musical instrument, The Associated Press reported, quoting state officials in
New York . The officials
said Byrne's "Playing the Building" installation, at the
Battery
Maritime
Building ,
a 1909 Beaux Arts structure, would use devices attached to ceiling beams,
plumbing, electrical conduits and other structural elements to produce sound
through vibration. The temporary installation is to open this month.
Four
artists have been nominated for this year's Turner Prize, with film and
sculpture dominating the shortlist. They are:
Mark Leckey
for his solo exhibition
Industrial Light & Magic, which mixed sculpture, film and performance;
Cathy Wilkes
for her
approach to figurative sculpture;
Runa
Islam
for her use of classic cinematic techniques in her works;
and
Goshka Macuga
for works that establish her as a "cultural archaeologist." The
winner of the £25,000 (about $49,000) prize, founded in 1984 and awarded
annually to a British-based artist, will be announced in
London
on Dec. 1.
Sometimes
love isn't all you need. A judge in
London
has granted a preliminary divorce to
Paul
McCartney
and
Heather
Mills . If no one objects, the divorce will be final in six
weeks. Mills, 40, will emerge from the rancorous divorce with a settlement of
$47.5 million but a reputation damaged by her televised outbursts, which
included emptying a pitcher of water on the head of McCartney's lawyer,
Fiona Shackleton .
Mills will also retain custody of the couple's 4-year-old daughter,
Beatrice . McCartney
will retain the bulk of his fortune, estimated by the court at $880 million. At
age 65, he is the last of
The

Kingston
-
Jamaica
Few
Caribbean islands can offer up the diversity of our island country —where there's
so much more than "rum, sun & reggae"—especially in the often
overlooked capital city of Kingston, the heartbeat of Jamaica and the second
largest English-speaking city south of Miami, Florida.
Kingston
overlooks what is the seventh
largest natural harbour in the world. Like a fan, the city spreads north from
the harbor as far as the foothills of the famous
Blue Mountains —impressive peaks that form a
glorious backdrop to the whole.
What better way to combine business with leisure than to take in all that
Kingston
has to offer?
With an eye on satisfying the most demanding visitor, this cosmopolitan city
extends excellence in upscale high-rise accommodations, fine international
dining, pulsating nightlife, business and financial services, shopping and
culture. Just like any major metropolitan city, we have our share of street
vendors, beggars and unappealing, less desirable areas, but north of the harbor
and uptown, New Kingston sparkles!
Most people think of
Kingston
as being divided into two parts. It's not unlike a vibrant modern American city
in that there's a downtown sector—stretching north from the waterfront to the
busy traffic junction at Cross Roads—and also an uptown sector, which extends
to the smart suburbs located at the base of the mountains. It will probably
take you at least half a day to check out the downtown sights —maybe a bit more
to encompass all the must-dos in the uptown area.
DOWNTOWN
KINGSTON
A great place to sample the essential atmosphere of this noisy and vigorous
metropolis. Finding your way about on foot is pretty easy, since
Kingston
uses the grid
system. If you get tired, flag down a taxi (fix the price beforehand) as rates
are fairly reasonable and it's more straightforward than trying to tackle the
chaos of the city's bus system.
The waterfront is a pleasant place to begin your tour of the area. Mixing
alongside industrial-looking ships and warehouses, you get fishermen and
pelicans, vendors flogging root snacks, and people dozing under the shade of a
palm tree.
Ocean Boulevard
is the waterfront's breezy main strip, and its focal point is the emotionally
charged
Negro Aroused
statue depicting a crouched man breaking free from
bondage. This is a replica of the original, now in the
National Gallery of Jamaica , by Edna Manley,
wife of former prime minister and National Hero Norman Manley and mother of
another former prime minister, Michael. The highlight of the waterfront is the
National Gallery, a repository of Jamaican art, with important works by John
Dunkley, Carl Abrahams, David Pottinger and Barrington Watson. (See recommended
tours for more information).
The
Kingston Crafts Market
at the western end of
Ocean Boulevard (open daily except Sunday) houses myriad little stores where
you can pick up jewelry, T-shirts, carvings and richly embroidered baskets,
though don't expect to be able to barter prices down. The area just north of
the grassy waterfront forms the historic city center, though many grand 18th
century buildings were flattened in an earthquake in 1907. In colonial days,
King Street
was the
main thoroughfare, and despite the earthquake, it still retains a number of
beautiful old buildings with columned verandahs and decorative carvings. Half
way up is the Parade, a large square used as a parade ground by British troops
in the 18th century as well the site for grisly public floggings and hangings.
The center of the parade is the shady, statue-filled area,
William Grant Park . Today, following a massive
facelift in the 1980s, the Parade is one of the most vibrant spots in
town—music blares from ghetto blasters, traffic screeches, vendors hawk their
baubles and queues for taxis and buses spill onto the road.
North of the park is the elegant sky-blue wedding cake building of the
Ward Theatre , a magnet for thespians since the
18th century and home to the annual panto as well as seasonal spectacles; feel
free to nose around the inside.
To the west, stretching three blocks from the Parade, is the crowded, colorful
and cacophonous Jubilee Market (M-F)—also known as Solas Market. It inspired a
famous Jamaican folksong: "Come we go down a Solas Market; come we go buy
banana." Further west are the ghetto areas known as the yards, where hard
hitting wall murals act as territorial markers. The region is a no go for
tourists - even Jamaicans from neighboring areas think twice before entering
the opposition's turf.
Duke Street & Around
Kingston has many handsome old churches, but one of the most impressive is the
octagonal
St Andrew Scots Kirk , built in the Georgian
manner by a group of prominent Scottish merchants, and surrounded by a gallery
supported by Corinthian pillars. Upon completion, it was dubbed the handsomest
building in
Kingston .
Headquarters House & Gordon House
Two blocks west of
East Street
is
Headquarters House , a trim little townhouse
once known as Hibbert House, but now home to the National Heritage Trust, which
has its offices in the former bedrooms. You can explore the rest of the
building; the debating chamber is on the ground floor, still furnished with
original furniture and impressive portraits of Jamaican heroes, and the
basement has some offbeat relics and a mish-mash of art collections.
Gordon House is where
Jamaica 's parliament resides. The
House of Representatives meets here most Tuesdays at 2pm, and the Senate sits
in chamber on Fridays at 11am. Entrance to the public galleries, for a glimpse
of how
Jamaica
conducts business, is free.
Other downtown sites:
Walk along
North Street
and you reach the imposing domed
Holy Trinity Cathedral , the island's center of
Catholicism.
Gleaner
Building , at the junction of North and East streets,
is home to
Jamaica 's
premier newspapers, the
Daily and Sunday Gleaner .
UPTOWN KINGSTON
The district north of Cross Roads—is where the
commercial sprawl of hotels, banks, embassies and offices meets the
residential areas of Hope, Mona, and Beverly Hills.
Centuries ago, uptown was mostly rural, save the odd sugar estate or
livestock farm. But
Kingston 's
wealthy merchants soon bought up the land—seeing in it a chance to escape the
noise and bustle of the waterfront area. The process continues, and you will be
able to spot newer, more fashionable residential quarters as far north as the
foothills of the
Blue Mountains .
New Kingston
The heart of uptown—a pulsating urban centerpiece dominated by
high rise financial buildings bounded by Trafalgar Road, Half Way Tree Road and
Old Hope Road. It is likely that your hotel will be located here and it's a
good area too, for restaurants and bars (see Dining & Drinking section).
You can also easily walk to all the most interesting sights from here.
Half Way Tree
This busy quarter about a mile west of New Kingston used to be a tiny
village, dominated by the
parish church of St Andrew
(always open; free).
It's one of the oldest churches on the island, a tranquil,17th century redbrick
building with delicate stained glass, and marble wall tablets commemorating
Jamaican civil servants and English soldiers. Half Way Tree's central plaza
(now a busy shopping area), was where farmers would rest as they traveled
towards the city's main markets. The eponymous cotton tree under which they
rested has long since gone—but a clock tower now stands in its place, erected
in the early 19th century as a memorial to the British King, Edward VII.
Carry on walking east of Half Way Tree, and you hit
Devon House
on
Hope Road . This impressive edifice was
built in 1881 by
Jamaica 's
first black millionaire- it has fine landscaped grounds where you can stop for
a snack or a drink - and the tour of the house is well worth considering (see
Recommended Tours section).
Half a mile up
Hope Road
brings you to Jamaica House (closed to visitors),used as the Prime Minister's
office, and
King's House —the official home of the
governor-general. You can get a tour of the staterooms in this impressively
restored 19th century house; more interestingly - the governess occasionally
holds afternoon teas, as part of the island's successful 'Meet the People'
program. Contact the Jamaican Tourist Board on +1
876 929 9200 for more information, or reservations.
Hope Road
is also home to the much-vaunted
Bob Marley Museum . It then forks up towards the
Hope Botanical Gardens
and
Coconut
Park —the
latter, a haven for kids, with great rides and a small zoo housing lions,
mongoose and monkeys.
If you have wheels, consider driving into the Blue Mountains from here —or at
least going up onto
Skyline Drive —a
road noted for its stunning views over the city and across the harbor to
Port Royal . You can get there by following
Barbican Road to its northernmost edges—then join Jack's Hill Road and then
onto Skyline Drive.

Tampa
sued to collect on 147-year-old promissory note worth
millions
"Tampa
issued a promissory note for $299.58 to pioneer storekeeper Thomas Pugh Kennedy
on June 21, 1861. And his great granddaughter Joan Kennedy Biddle, 77, who has
known about the note since she was a little girl, wants to collect with
interest."
TAMPA
— In the early months of the Civil War, the city of
Tampa
needed ammunition
and other supplies to defend against attack but apparently was short on cash.
So it issued a
promissory note for $299.58 to storekeeper Thomas Pugh Kennedy on June 21,
1861.
Kennedy's
great-granddaughter says the city never made good on its loan. Now, Joan
Kennedy Biddle and her family are suing to collect the payment plus 8 percent
annual interest.
The total bill:
$22.7-million.
"Obviously we came
at a bad time because the city seems like they're trying to cut their
budget," she said. "On the other hand, they're building the
Riverwalk."
Attorney James Purdy
filed the suit in the Hillsborough Circuit Court last week. He did not return
calls for comment.
Biddle wouldn't give
specifics on why she decided to sue now, using as evidence a piece of paper
that has been handed down as an heirloom for generations.
"This thing has
been in the family since the date on the note, and it has never been
repaid," said Biddle, 77. "My daddy told me, and I certainly believe
him."
Tampa City Attorney
David Smith said he doesn't consider the claim valid.
In legal documents,
Biddle's attorney argues that the statute of limitations doesn't apply in the
case because at the time the note was issued, the state had no such statute on
such documents.
And Biddle pointed out
that in the 1990s the federal government agreed to pay the Seminole tribe for
land illegally taken in the 1820s.
But attorney John Grandoff
said the city can defend against the case using the "doctrine of
laches," which prevents claims from being made after an extraordinary
passage of time.
"It's kind of how
the court feels about whether it's been too long or not," Grandoff said.
"It's total discretion on the judge's part."
Rodney Kite-Powell,
curator at the
Tampa
Bay
History
Center , noted that the
Tampa
of 1861 is not the same city that
exists today — literally.
Tampa
was
originally incorporated in 1855, but was abolished in 1869 in part because
residents had no money to pay taxes, and the city had no money to pay its
bills, Kite-Powell said. It was reincorporated in 1887.
At the time the note
was issued,
Tampa
was a tiny town with about 800 residents, city limits that included just a portion
of downtown. It also was home to
Fort
Brooke , where local
Confederate soldiers were stationed.
Biddle's
great-grandfather, Thomas Pugh Kennedy, was one of the city's most significant
pioneers, Kite-Powell said.
He operated a store
with business partner John Darling.
"Merchants are
always important because they're the way people get stuff — from cannons to
clothing and food," he said. "People really relied on these early
merchants to supply people with what they needed."
Joan Kennedy Biddle
grew up on
Davis
Islands
and attended
Plant
High School . She moved to
east Hillsborough in the 1960s and ran a lumber business with her late husband.
She now owns a three-bedroom home in
Brandon .
Biddle said she's known
about the note since she was a little girl. "I showed it to the attorney,
and he said it looked very interesting," she said. "It's strange that
the thing has never been collected."

Judge awards
Heather Mills £24.3 million in divorce from Paul McCartney
LONDON :
Heather Mills won a final settlement of 24.3 million pounds (€31 million;
US$48.6 million) on Monday in her divorce from former Beatle Paul McCartney,
and said the ruling had secured the future for herself and her daughter.
A Family Court judge awarded Mills a lump sum of 16.5
million pounds (€21.5 million; US$33 million) plus the assets she currently
holds worth 7.8 million pounds (€10 million; US$15.6 million), according to a
court-released document.
"I'm so, so happy with this," Mills said at an
impromptu news conference on the steps of Royal Courts of Justice after the
closed hearing. "I'm so glad it's over."
"It was an incredible result in the end to secure
mine and my daughter's future and that of all the charities that I obviously
plan on helping and making a difference with — because you know it has been my
life for 20 years."
While
pleased with the financial settlement, Mills intends to appeal the decision to
publish the full judgment, including details concerning the couple's 4-year-old
daughter, Beatrice. Only a summary of the judgment was released Monday.
McCartney, 65, and Mills, 40, went to court last month to
decide on Mills' share of his fortune, which had been estimated at as much as
825 million pounds (US$1.6 billion; €1 billion).
Judge Hugh Bennett, however, found that the total value
of McCartney's assets, including his business assets, was about 400 million
(€523 million US $800 million). He said there was no evidence to support the
widely published figure that was more than twice as high.
Mills said the settlement vindicated her decision to fire
her lawyers. The legal fees, she said, instead "could easily go to
charity."
"Obviously the court do not want a litigant in
person to do well, it's against everything that they ever wish, so when they
write the judgment up they're never going to make it look in favor," she
said.
The settlement was higher than what McCartney had said
his estranged wife should receive — 15.8 million pounds (around US$31.6 million
or €20.3 million) including her own assets.
Mills, however, had sought almost 125 million pounds (around
US$250 million; €160 million).
"Paul was offering a lot less" than what was
awarded, Mills said.
She had harsh words for McCartney's lawyer, Fiona
Shackleton, who was well known for representing Prince Charles in his divorce
from Princess Diana.
"She has called me many, many names before even
meeting me when I was in a wheelchair," said Mills, a former model whose
left leg was amputated below the knee after a 1993 motorcycle accident.
The court ruled that the couple's daughter should receive
a "periodical payments order" of 35,000 pounds (around US$70,000 or
€45,000) a year. On top of that, McCartney will pay for the child's nanny and
school fees.
The settlement has been a long time coming for the
couple, who separated two years ago, after four years of marriage. At the time
they said the parting was "amicable" and insisted "both of us
still care about each other very much."
But the split has grown fractious since McCartney filed
for divorce alleging his wife's "unreasonable behavior."
Mills claimed McCartney failed to protect her and their
daughter from slander, death threats and other abuse, and accused the media of
persecuting her. In November, Mills said she had been "treated worse than
a murderer or a pedophile," despite years of work for land mine victims
and animal welfare charities.
When the couple and their lawyers appeared for a six-day
hearing last month, photographers craned to catch a glimpse of them entering
the grand, neo-Gothic court building. Reporters huddled outside the courtroom
door, but few details emerged.
Legal experts said the fact that the couple had a child
would have been taken into account — but so would the relative brevity of the
marriage and the fact that most of McCartney's wealth was generated beforehand.
McCartney met Mills in 1999, the year after the death
from breast cancer of his first wife, Linda. That marriage was one of rock's
most enduring unions, and produced three children, including fashion designer
Stella McCartney.
Mills and McCartney married at an Irish castle in June
2002, amid rumors the former Beatle's children disapproved of their new
stepmother. The couple's daughter was born the following year.

Bingo ( U.S. ) By Bingofest
www.bingofest.com
This article is about the American version of Bingo.
Bingo
Bingo
is a
game of chance
in which randomly selected numbers are drawn and players match those numbers to those appearing on 5x5 matrices which are printed or electronically represented and are known as "cards." The first person to have a card where the drawn numbers form a specified pattern is the winner and calls out the word "Bingo!" to alert others and inform the caller of the win. The card must first be properly checked for accuracy before the "win" is officially confirmed at which time the prize is secured and a new game is begun.
The version of the game described in this article is played in the
United States
and
Canada . A
very similar game
is played in the
United Kingdom
and in
Australia
(where it is called
housie ). These games differ only in ticket layout and calling.
Description of the game
Each bingo player is given a card marked with a grid containing a unique combination of numbers. The winning pattern to be formed on the card is announced. On each turn, a non-player known as the caller randomly selects a numbered ball from a container and announces the number to all the players. The ball is then set aside so that it cannot be chosen again. Each player searches his card for the called number, and if he finds it, marks it. The element of skill in the game is the ability to search one's card for the called number in the short time before the next number is called.
The caller continues to select and announce numbers until the first player forms the agreed pattern (one line, two lines, full house) on their card and shouts out the name of the pattern or bingo. One of the most common patterns, called full card, blackout and cover-all simply consists of marking all the numbers on the card. Other common patterns are single line, two lines, the four corners, centre cross, L, T, Y, postage stamp (2x2 and in a corner) inner square (4 × 4), roving square (3 × 3), and roving kite (a 3 × 3 diamond). Lines can be made horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Inner and roving squares and kites must be completely filled; roving squares and kites may be made anywhere on the card.
Bingo cards
A typical American bingo card
Bingo cards
are flat pieces of cardboard or non-reusable paper which contain 25 squares arranged in five vertical and five horizontal rows; Dual dab, or "double-action" cards have two numbers in each square. Each space in the grid contains a number, except for the center square, which is considered filled. The highest number used is 75. The letters B, I, N, G, O are pre-printed above the five vertical columns, with one letter appearing above each column. The center space is marked "free." The printed numbers on the card correspond to the following arrangement: 1 to 15 in the B column; 16 to 30 in the I column; 31 to 45 in the N column; 46 to 60 in the G column and 61 to 75 in the O column.
There are about 5.52*10 26 , (exactly 15 5
× 14 5
× 13 5
× 12 5
× 11 4 ) possible arrangements of the numbers on a bingo card.
The most chips one can place on a Bingo board without having a Bingo is 19, not counting the free space. In order for this to happen, only one empty cell can reside in each row and each column, and at least one empty cell must be in each diagonal, for instance:
O O _ O O O _ O O O O O F O _ O O O _ O _ O O O O
Note: in addition to a straight line, many bingo halls consider other patterns as a valid "bingo." For example, in the illustration above, the 2x2 square of marked squares in the upper right-hand corner would be considered a "postage stamp."
Equipment
Most bingo halls have 1-2 bingo blowers and 1-2 flashboards. The blowers all have four features, a chamber to blow the balls from, a tube to permit 1 ball at a time, a master board, and a way to return the balls from the board to the chamber. Most modern blowers have a simple computer, that can be programmed to display certain games, in a certain order, called a session. Some new blowers run off standard household computers, and have their own GUI or Graphical User Interface, to operate the blower.
Culture
A typical bingo dauber, which is also used for housie tickets
Games often have multiple bingos — for example, the players may first play for a single line, then after that is called continue playing for a full card, then for a consolation full card.
Players often play multiple cards for each game; thirty is not an unusual number. Because of the large numbers of cards played by each player, most halls have the players sit at tables to which they often fasten their cards with adhesive tape. To mark cards faster the players usually use special markers called daubers. At commercial halls, after calling the number the caller then displays the next number on a television monitor; bingo cannot be called until that number is called aloud, however.
Bingo is often used as an instructional tool in American
primary schools
and in
teaching English as a foreign language
in many countries. Typically, the numbers are replaced with beginning reader words (such as those drawn from the
Dolch word lists ), pictures, or unsolved math problems. Recently many teachers have taken to using software to automate the creation of bingo cards, as it is slow and laborious to do it by hand for large numbers of cards.
Terminology: Being Ready – When someone only needs one number in order to complete the Bingo pattern, he/she is considered to “be ready”.
Breaking the Bubble – The bubble is the minimum number of balls required to complete the Bingo pattern. This is the earliest point anyone could have a valid bingo. Example: Winning pattern is 1 hard way bingo, a straight line without the free space. The minimum number of called numbers is 5 although it is not considered “Breaking the Bubble” until 1 number in each column or 5 numbers in a single column have been called.
Etiquette – It is considered rude to carry on conversations with others or on cell phones during an active game. Making excess noises with daubers or allowing your cell phone to ring is also considered rude.
Jumping the Gun – One who calls bingo before having a valid bingo. The most common situation is someone calling bingo using the next number in the screen before it has been called.
Wild numbers – Many bingo halls will have certain games with a wild number. Wild numbers allow bingo players to start with multiple called numbers. Typically the first ball drawn is the determining factor. Standard – All numbers ending with the second digit of the first number. Example: First ball is 22. All numbers ending in a 2 including B2 is considered a called number. Forwards/backwards – All numbers beginning or ending with the wild number. Example: First ball is 22. All numbers beginning or ending with a 2 is considered a called number. If the first ball ends with an 8, 9 or 0, another number may be drawn as there are no numbers starting with a 8 or 9 and only 9 numbers starting with a zero. Some halls will also redraw a number ending with a 7 as there are only 5 numbers beginning with a 7.
History
Bingo can be traced back to a
lottery
game called "Lo Giuoco Code Loto" played in
Italy
in 1530. By the eighteenth century, the game had matured, and in
France , playing cards, tokens, the reading out of numbers had been added to the game. In the nineteenth century, Bingo was widely used in
Germany
for educational purposes to teach children spelling, animal names, and
multiplication tables .
At a
travelling carnival
near
Atlanta
in 1929,
Beano
was being played with dried beans, a rubber stamp and cardboard sheets.
Edwin Lowe , was watching this game and noticed how engaged the players were. The Carnival worker had to kick the players out at 3 am. Lowe, took the idea with him to
New York
where he introduced the game to his friends. He conducted bingo games similar to the ones he had witnessed, using dried beans, a rubber numbering stamp and card board. His friends loved the game. It is said that one of his players made bingo history when he was so excited to have won that he yelled out “Bingo” instead of “Beano." The Lowe Bingo Game had two versions; the first a 12-card set for $1.00, the second a $2.00 set with 24 cards. Bingo was a wild success. By the 1940s Bingo games were all over the country. Lowe had many competitors and all he asked was that they pay $1.00 a year to conduct the games and of course to use the name Bingo.
[ edit ]
The business of Bingo
In the
US , the game is primarily staged by churches or charity organizations. Their legality and stakes vary by state regulation. In some states, bingo halls are rented out to sponsoring organizations, and such halls often run games almost every day. Church-run games, however, are normally weekly affairs held on the church premises. These games are usually played for modest stakes, although the final game of a session is frequently a coverall game that offers a larger
jackpot
prize for winning within a certain quantity of numbers called; a progressive jackpot may increase per session until it is won.
Commercial bingo games in the
US
are primarily offered by
casinos
(and then only in the state of
Nevada ), and by
Native American
bingo halls, which are often housed in the same location as Indian run casinos. In
Nevada , bingo is usually offered only by casinos that cater to local gamblers, and not the famous tourist resorts. They will usually offer several two-hour sessions daily, with relatively modest stakes except for coverall jackpots.
Station Casinos , a chain of locals-oriented casinos in
Las Vegas , offers a special game each session that ties all of its properties together with a large progressive jackpot. Native American games are typically offered for only one or two sessions a day, and are often played for higher stakes than charity games in order to draw players from distant places. Some also offer a special progressive jackpot game that may tie together players from multiple bingo halls.
As well as bingo played "in house", the larger commercial operators play some games linked by telephone across several, perhaps dozens, of their clubs. This increases the prize money, but greatly reduces the chance of winning due to the much greater number of players.
Bingo halls are sometimes linked together (as by
Loto Quebec
in
Canada ) in a network to provide alternative winning structures and bigger prizes.
Bingo is also the basis for online games sold through licensed lotteries. Tickets are sold as for Lotto, and the players get receipts with their numbers arranged as on a bingo card. The daily or weekly draw is normally broadcast on TV. These games offers higher prizes and it is typically more difficult to win.
The Bingo logic is frequently used on
scratch card
games. The numbers are pre-drawn for each card and hidden until the card is scratched. In lotteries with online networks the price is electronically confirmed to avoid fraud based on physical fixing.

People and dogs
Dogs are highly
social animals . This can account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations. These attributes have earned dogs a unique position in the realm of interspecies relationships despite being one of the most effective, voracious, and potentially dangerous predators. Dogs and humans at times co-operate in some of the most effective
hunting
in the animal world; in that context, dogs are
superpredators .
The loyalty and devotion that dogs demonstrate as part of their natural instincts as pack animals closely mimics the human idea of love and friendship, leading many dog owners to view their pets as full-fledged family members. Conversely, dogs seem to view their human companions as members of their pack, and make few, if any, distinctions between their owners and fellow dogs. Dogs fill a variety of roles in
human society
and are often trained as
working dogs . For dogs that do not have traditional jobs, a wide range of
dog sports
provide the opportunity to exhibit their natural skills. In many countries, the most common and perhaps most important role of dogs is as
companions .
Dogs have lived and worked with humans in so many roles that their loyalty has earned them the unique
sobriquet
"man's best friend". However, some cultures consider dogs to be
unclean . In some parts of the world, dogs are raised as
livestock
to produce
dog meat
for human consumption. In many places, consumption of dog meat is discouraged by social convention or
cultural taboo .

Peach-Mustard Pork Chops
Recipe Summary Difficulty:
Easy
Prep Time:
25 minutes
Inactive Prep Time:
25 minutes
Cook Time:
23 minutes
Yield:
4 servings
4 (1 1/2-inch thick) pork chops
Safflower or corn oil, for brushing
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Peach-Mustard BBQ Sauce, recipe follows
Prepare an outdoor grill with a high heat for both direct and indirect grilling. Position a drip pan under the grate on the cooler side of the grill.
Brush the pork chops on both sides with oil and season with salt and black pepper to taste. Set aside for 15 minutes.
Grill the chops over the heat until brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Move them to the cool side of the grill and brush with some of the Peach-Mustard BBQ Sauce. Cook the chops, covered, turning and basting with sauce every 5 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted crosswise into the chops registers 140 degrees F, about 15 minutes more. Let rest for 10 minutes.
To serve: Drizzle the chops with more sauce and serve.
Peach-Mustard BBQ Sauce
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons minced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons cider vinegar
1/2 cup whole-grain mustard
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
3/4 cup peach jam or preserves
1 tablespoon bourbon
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the vinegar and boil until almost completely reduced and the mixture looks like wet sand, about 4 minutes. Whisk in both mustards and the jam or preserves. Simmer, whisking, until jam melts, about 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the bourbon and salt.
Cook's Note: The bourbon is stirred in at the end--uncooked--to give a genuine jolt to the sauce. This Southern blend goes great with pork but is also a good finisher for chicken, duck, or veal.
Yield: about 1 1/4 cups

Champagne
prawns with cocktail sauce
Preparation time 30 mins to 1 hour
Cooking time less than 10 mins
Ingredients 16 large raw prawns, shelled, with tails attached 150-175ml/5-6fl oz chilled champagne or sparkling wine
oil, for deep frying 100g/4oz self-raising flour, plus 2 tbsp for dusting salt and freshly ground black pepper lemon wedges, to serve For the cocktail sauce: 3 heaped tbsp mayonnaise 1 tablespoon tomato ketchup 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce few drops of Tabasco sauce few drops of soy sauce squeeze of lemon juice celery salt and freshly ground black pepper
Method 1. First of all, make the cocktail sauce. This is best done with your partner - although it may take twice as long! One of you drops the mayonnaise, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce,
Tabasco , soy and lemon juice into a bowl while the other mixes to a smooth consistency. Season with celery salt and pepper. Have a taste and add any extras if you both agree on it, then transfer to a small bowl and put to one side while you prepare the prawns. 2. If you've bought the prawns with the head and shell attached, prepare them between you - this is real teamwork, and although it may not be sensual, it will take half the time. Place the prepared prawns with about 2-3 tbsp of the champagne or sparkling wine in a non-metallic bowl to marinate for about 30 minutes.
3. Place enough oil in a wok, large saucepan or deep-fat fryer to come halfway up the pan. Place over a medium heat. If you're using a deep-fat fryer or have a thermometer, heat the oil to 180C/350F. If not, check the oil is at the right temperature by dropping a 2-3cm/¾-1¼in cube of bread into it. It should become golden and crispy in 1 minute. 4. Sift the flour and a generous pinch of salt into a large bowl. Whisk in enough of the champagne or sparkling wine to give a thick batter. Add the remaining liquid if it seems too gluey. The best way to do this is if one of you pours while the other whisks. 5. Remove the prawns from the marinade and pat dry with kitchen paper. Season with salt and pepper and lightly toss in the 2 tbsp of flour. Holding the tail, dip each prawn into the batter to coat and place into the hot oil. Keep hold of the tail for a couple of seconds before letting go. This will stop them sticking to each other or the base of the pan. Continue with the remaining prawns. Allow them to cook for about 6-7 minutes until golden and crispy, turning in the oil halfway through to ensure even cooking. 6. Once they are cooked, carefully remove the battered prawns from the oil and sit on kitchen paper to allow any excess oil to drain away. Sprinkle with salt and serve on one plate to share with the cocktail sauce and lemon wedges.

Coffee
Coffee
is a widely consumed
stimulant   beverage
prepared from roasted
seeds , commonly called
coffee beans , of the
coffee plant . Coffee was first consumed in the 9th century, when it was discovered in the highlands of
Ethiopia . From there, it spread to
Egypt
and
Yemen , and by the 15th century had reached
Persia ,
Turkey , and
northern Africa . From the
Muslim world , coffee spread to
Italy , then to the rest of
Europe
and the
Americas . Today, coffee is one of the most popular beverages worldwide.
Coffee berries, which contain the coffee bean, are produced by several species of small evergreen bush of the
genus
Coffea . The two most commonly grown species are
Coffea canephora
(also known as
Coffea robusta ) and
Coffea arabica . These are cultivated in
Latin America ,
southeast Asia , and
Africa . Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. The seeds are then roasted, undergoing several physical and chemical changes. They are roasted to various degrees, depending on the desired flavor. They are then ground and
brewed
to create coffee. Coffee can be prepared and presented by a variety of methods.
Coffee has played an important role in many societies throughout modern history. In Africa and
Yemen , it was used in religious ceremonies. As a result, the
Ethiopian Church
banned its consumption until the reign of Emperor
Menelik II of Ethiopia . It was banned in
Ottoman
Turkey in the 17th century for political reasons, and was associated with rebellious political activities in
Europe . Coffee is an important export commodity: in 2004, coffee was the top agricultural export for 12 countries, and in 2005, it was the world's seventh largest legal agricultural export by value. Some controversy is associated with coffee cultivation and its impact on the environment. Many studies have examined the relationship between coffee consumption and certain medical conditions; whether the effects of coffee are positive or negative is still disputed.
Etymology
The
English
word
coffee
first came to be used in the early- to mid-1600s, but early forms of the word date to the last decade of the 1500s. It comes from the
Italian
caffè . This, in turn, was borrowed from the
Ottoman Turkish
kahveh , and the
Arabic
qahwa
(قهوة) collectively. The origin of the Arabic term is uncertain; it is either derived from the name of the
Kaffa
region in western
Ethiopia , where coffee was cultivated, or by a truncation of
qahwat al-būnn , meaning "wine of the bean" in Arabic. In
Eritrea , "būnn" (also meaning "wine of the bean" in
Tigrinya ) is used. The
Amharic
and
Afan Oromo
name for coffee is
bunna .
History
Coffee use can be traced at least to as early as the 9th century, when it appeared in the
highlands of Ethiopia . According to legend, Ethiopian
shepherds
were the first to observe the influence of the
caffeine
in coffee beans when the goats appeared to "dance" and to have an increased level of energy after consuming wild coffee berries. The legend names the shepherd "Kaldi." From
Ethiopia , coffee spread to
Egypt
and
Yemen ., It was in
Arabia that coffee beans were first roasted and brewed similarly as they are today. By the 15th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East,
Persia ,
Turkey , and
northern Africa .
In 1583,
Leonhard Rauwolf , a German physician, gave this description of coffee after returning from a ten year trip to the
Near East :
“A beverage as black as ink, useful against numerous
illnesses , particularly those of the stomach. Its consumers take it in the morning, quite frankly, in a porcelain cup that is passed around and from which each one drinks a cupful. It is composed of water and the fruit from a bush called bunnu”
From the
Muslim
world, coffee spread to
Italy . The thriving trade between
Venice
and
North
Africa ,
Egypt , and the
Middle East
brought many goods, including coffee, to the Venetian port. From
Venice
, it was introduced to the rest of
Europe
. Coffee became more widely accepted after it was deemed a Christian beverage by
Pope Clement VIII
in 1600, despite appeals to ban the "Muslim drink". The first European coffee house opened in
Italy
in 1645. The
Dutch
were the first to import coffee on a large scale, and they were among the first to defy the Arab prohibition on the exportation of plants or unroasted seeds when Pieter van den Broeck smuggled seedlings from
Aden
into Europe in 1616. The Dutch later grew the crop in
Java
and
Ceylon . Through the efforts of the
British East India Company , coffee became popular in
England
as well. It was introduced in
France
in 1657, and in
Austria
and
Poland
after the 1683
Battle of Vienna , when coffee was captured from supplies of the defeated
Turks .
When coffee reached
North America
during the colonial period, it was initially not as successful as it had been in
Europe . During the
Revolutionary War , however, the demand for coffee increased so much that dealers had to hoard their scarce supplies and raise prices dramatically; this was partly due to the reduced availability of tea from
British
merchants. After the
War of 1812 , during which Britain temporarily cut off access to
tea
imports, the Americans' taste for coffee grew, and high demand during the
American Civil War
together with advances in brewing technology secured the position of coffee as an everyday commodity in the United States.
Noted as one of the world’s largest, most lawfully valuable traded commodity after oil, has become a vital “cash crop” for many
Third World countries. Over one hundred million people in developing countries have become dependent on coffee as the primary source of income. Coffee has become the primary export and backbone for African countries like
Uganda ,
Burundi ,
Rwanda , and
Ethiopia as well as other Central American countries
Coffee price deregulations had a negative effect on oversupply in the coffee industry. The failure to renew regulatory agreements brought extreme and unstable changes in coffee pricing, which impacted negatively farm-workers. Some countries went into financial crisis and/or debt and their citizens were forced into poverty. After studying coffee price deregulation, one can easily conclude that it has been disastrous for many national economies. The simple comparison between the price of a pound of coffee sold in a store and the actual cost for a farmer to produce the pound of coffee is an appropriate topic of introduction. “If a store is selling a 1lb bag of coffee for $4.99lb. - when approx. actual cost for 1lb should be $1.68 to the farmer; $1.82 for sorting, packaging, equipment cost, overhead; $1.05 mark-up; $1.40 for shipping = $5.95 - this is the what the wholesale cost to retailers for 1lb of coffee should be under Fair Trade principles” then by having retailers mark up their prices would require the to sell the pound of coffee for $11.90 instead of $4.99 The numbers show that coffee is undervalued which results in the underpayment of farmers. This comparison is important for understanding fair pricing of coffee.
Biology
A flowering
Coffea arabica
tree in a Brazilian plantation
The
Coffea
plant is native to subtropical
Africa
and southern
Asia . It belongs to a
genus
of 10 species of
flowering plants
of the family
Rubiaceae . It is an
evergreen
shrub or small tree that may grow 5 meters (16 ft) tall when unpruned. The leaves are dark green and glossy, usually 10–15 centimeters (3.9–5.9 in) long and 6.0 centimeters (2.4 in) wide. It produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom simultaneously. The fruit berry is oval, about 1.5 centimeters (0.6 in) long, and green when immature, but ripens to yellow, then crimson, becoming black on drying. Each berry usually contains two seeds, but from 5 to 10 percent of the berries have only one; these are called
peaberries . Berries ripen in seven to nine months.
Cultivation
Coffee is usually propagated by seed. The traditional method of planting coffee is to put 20 seeds in each hole at the beginning of the rainy season; half are eliminated naturally. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice, during the first few years of cultivation.
The two main cultivated species of the coffee plant are
Coffea canephora
and
Coffea arabica . Arabica coffee (from
C. arabica ) is considered more suitable for drinking than robusta coffee (from
C. canephora ); robusta tends to be bitter and have less flavor than arabica. For this reason, about three-fourths of coffee cultivated worldwide is
C. arabica . However,
C. canephora
is less susceptible to disease than
C. arabica
and can be cultivated in
environments
where
C. arabica
will not thrive. Robusta coffee also contains about 40–50 percent more caffeine than arabica. For this reason, it is used as an inexpensive substitute for arabica in many commercial coffee blends. Good quality robustas are used in some
espresso
blends to provide a better foam head and to lower the ingredient cost. Other cultivated species include
Coffea liberica
and
Coffea esliaca , believed to be indigenous to
Liberia
and southern
Sudan , respectively.
Most arabica coffee beans originate from either
Latin America ,
eastern Africa , Arabia, or
Asia . Robusta coffee beans are grown in western and
central Africa , throughout
southeast Asia , and to some extent in
Brazil . Beans from different countries or regions usually have distinctive characteristics such as flavor, aroma,
body , and acidity. These taste characteristics are dependent not only on the coffee's growing region, but also on genetic subspecies ( varietals ) and processing. Varietals are generally known by the region in which they are grown, such as
Colombian ,
Java , or
Kona .
Ecological effects
Originally, coffee farming was done in the
shade
of trees, which provided habitat for many animals and insects. This method is commonly referred to as the traditional shaded method. Many farmers (but not all) have decided to modernize their production methods and switch to a method where farmers would now use sun cultivation, in which coffee is grown in rows under full sun with little or no forest canopy. This causes berries to ripen more rapidly and bushes to produce higher yields but requires the clearing of trees and increased use of fertilizer and pesticides. Traditional coffee production, in the other hand, caused berries to ripen more slowly and it produced lower yields compared to the modernized method but the quality of the coffee is superior. In addition, the traditional shaded method is environmentally friendly and serves as a habitat for many species.Opponents of sun cultivation say environmental problems such as deforestation, pesticide pollution,
habitat destruction , and soil and water degradation are the side effects of these practices. The
American Birding Association
has led a campaign for "shade-grown" and organic coffees, which it says are sustainably harvested. While certain types of shaded coffee cultivation systems show greater biodiversity than full-sun systems, they still compare poorly to native forest in terms of habitat value, and while this may be true they are still the next best thing, considering how in many places native forests no longer exist.
Economics
Brazil
remains the largest coffee exporting nation, but in recent years
Vietnam
has become a major producer of robusta beans.
Colombia
is the third exporter and the largest producer of washed arabica coffee. Robusta coffees, traded in
London at much lower prices than
New York 's arabica, are preferred by large industrial clients, such as multinational roasters and instant coffee producers, because of the lower cost. Four single roaster companies buy more than 50 percent of all of the annual production:
Kraft ,
Nestlé ,
Procter & Gamble , and
Sara Lee . The preference of the "Big Four" coffee companies for cheap robusta is believed by many to have been a major contributing factor to the crash in coffee prices, and the demand for high-quality arabica beans is only slowly recovering. Many experts believe the giant influx of cheap green coffee after the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement of 1975–1989 led to the prolonged price crisis from 1989 to 2004. In 1997 the price of coffee in
New York broke
US$ 3.00/ lb , but by late 2001 it had fallen to US$0.43/lb. In 2007, wholesale coffee was about US$1/lb (e.g. 69 cents in
London in March to 134 cents in
New York in October), with robusta being about 70% of the price of arabica. Retail prices varied from an average of $3 in
Poland to $3.50 in the
US to $17 in the
UK .
The concept of
fair trade
labeling, which guarantees coffee growers a negotiated pre-harvest price, began with the
Max Havelaar Foundation 's labelling program in the
Netherlands . In 2004, 24,222 metric tons out of 7,050,000 produced worldwide were fair trade; in 2005, 33,991 metric tons out of 6,685,000 were fair trade, an increase from 0.34 percent to 0.51 percent. A number of studies have shown that fair trade coffee has a positive impact on the communities that grow it. A study in 2002 found that fair trade strengthened producer organizations, improved returns to small producers, and positively affected their
quality of life . A 2003 study concluded that fair trade has "greatly improved the well-being of small-scale coffee farmers and their families" by providing access to credit and external development funding and greater access to training, giving them the ability to improve the quality of their coffee. The families of fair trade producers were also more stable than those who were not involved in fair trade, and their children had better access to education. A 2005 study of Bolivian coffee producers concluded that
Fairtrade certification
has had a positive impact on local coffee prices, economically benefiting all coffee producers, Fairtrade certified or not.
The production and consumption of "Fair Trade Coffee" has grown in recent years as some local and national coffee chains have started to offer fair trade alternatives.
Preparation
Espresso brewing, with dark reddish-brown
crema
Coffee beans must be ground and
brewed
in order to create a beverage. Grinding the roasted coffee beans is done at a roastery, in a grocery store, or in the home. They are most commonly ground at a roastery then packaged and sold to the consumer, though "whole bean" coffee can be ground at home. Coffee beans may be ground in several ways. A
burr mill
uses revolving elements to crush or tear the bean, an electric grinder chops the beans with blades moving at high speeds, and a mortar and pestle grinds the beans to a powder. The type of grind is often named after the brewing method for which it is generally used.
Turkish grind
is the finest grind, while
coffee percolator
or
French press
are the coarsest grind. The most common grinds are between the extremes; a medium grind is used in most common home coffee brewing machines.
Coffee may be brewed by several methods: boiled, steeped, or pressured. Brewing coffee by boiling was the earliest method, and
Turkish coffee
is an example of this method. It is prepared by powdering the beans with a
mortar and pestle , then adding the powder to water and bringing it to a boil in a pot called a
cezve
or, in Greek, a briki. This produces a strong coffee with a layer of foam on the surface.
Machines such as
percolators
or
automatic coffeemakers
brew coffee by gravity. In an automatic coffeemaker, hot water drips onto coffee grounds held in a
coffee filter
made of paper or perforated metal, allowing the water to seep through the ground coffee while absorbing its oils and essences. Gravity causes the liquid to pass into a carafe or pot while the used
coffee grounds
are retained in the filter. In a percolator, boiling water is forced into a chamber above a filter by pressure created by boiling. The water then passes downwards through the grounds due to gravity, repeating the process until shut off by an internal timer.
Coffee may also be brewed by steeping in a device such as a
French press
(also known as a
cafetière ). Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a coffee press and left to brew for a few minutes. A plunger is then depressed to separate the coffee grounds, which remain at the bottom of the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the beverage, making it stronger and leaving more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine.
The
espresso
method forces hot, but not boiling, pressurized water through ground coffee. As a result of brewing under high pressure (ideally between 9-10 atm) the espresso beverage is more concentrated (as much as 10 to 15 times the amount of coffee to water as gravity brewing methods can produce) and has a more complex physical and chemical constitution. A well prepared espresso has a reddish-brown foam called
crema
that floats on the surface. The drink " Americano " is popularly thought to have been named after American soldiers in
WW II
who found the European way of drinking espresso too strong. Baristas would cut the espresso with hot water for them.
Presentation
Once brewed, coffee may be presented in a variety of ways. Drip brewed, percolated, or French-pressed/cafetière coffee may be served with no additives (colloquially known as black) or with either sugar, milk or cream, or both. When served cold, it is called
iced coffee .
Espresso-based coffee has a wide variety of possible presentations. In its most basic form, it is served alone as a "shot" or in the more watered down style
café américano —a shot or two of espresso with hot water. [57]
The Americano should be served with the espresso shots on top of the hot water to preserve the crema. Milk can be added in various forms to espresso: steamed milk makes a
cafè latte , equal parts espresso and milk froth make a
cappuccino , and a dollop of hot, foamed
milk
on top creates a
caffè macchiato .
A number of products are sold for the convenience of consumers who do not want to prepare their own coffee.
Instant coffee
is dried into soluble powder or
freeze dried
into granules that can be quickly dissolved in hot water.
Canned coffee
has been popular in Asian countries for many years, particularly in
Japan
and
South Korea .
Vending machines
typically sell varieties of flavored canned coffee, much like brewed or percolated coffee, available both hot and cold. Japanese convenience stores and groceries also have a wide availability of bottled coffee drinks, which are typically lightly sweetened and pre-blended with milk. Bottled coffee drinks are also consumed in the
United States . Liquid coffee concentrates are sometimes used in large institutional situations where coffee needs to be produced for thousands of people at the same time. It is described as having a flavor about as good as low-grade robusta coffee and costs about 10 cents a cup to produce.

Social aspects
A coffeehouse in
Palestine
(1900)
Coffee was initially used for spiritual reasons. At least 1,000 years ago, traders brought coffee across the
Red Sea
into Arabia (modern day
Yemen ), where Muslim monks began cultivating the shrub in their gardens. At first, the Arabians made wine from the pulp of the fermented coffee berries. This beverage was known as
qishr
( kisher
in modern usage) and was used during religious ceremonies. [ citation needed ]
Coffee became the substitute beverage in place of wine in spiritual practices where wine was forbidden. Coffee drinking was briefly prohibited to Muslims as
haraam
in the early years of the 16th century, but this was quickly overturned. Use in religious rites among the
Sufi
branch of Islam led to coffee's being put on trial in
Mecca , accused of being a heretic substance, and its production and consumption was briefly repressed. It was later prohibited in
Ottoman Turkey
under an edict by the
Sultan Murad IV . Coffee, regarded as a Muslim drink, was prohibited to Ethiopian Orthodox Christians until as late as 1889; it is now considered a national drink of
Ethiopia for people of all faiths. Its early association in Europe with rebellious political activities led to its banning in
England , among other places.
A contemporary example of coffee prohibition can be found in
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , a religion with over 13 million followers worldwide, which calls for coffee abstinence. The organization claims that it is both physically and spiritually unhealthy to consume coffee. This comes from the Mormon doctrine of health, given in 1833 by Mormon founder
Joseph Smith , in a revelation called the
Word of Wisdom . It does not identify coffee by name, but includes the statement that "hot drinks are not for the belly", which has been interpreted to forbid both coffee and
tea .
