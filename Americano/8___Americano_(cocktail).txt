The Negroni
A little less than a year ago, we spent a long weekend in Charleston, South Carolina. Amazing place. The food is incredible. The people are wonderful. It seemed like many of the people with whom we interacted were actually from somewhere else, and purposely moved to Charleston because they loved it so much.
One of the places we visited was a restaurant called
Fig .
This is where I was introduced to the Negroni. In fact, their
cocktail menu
has several versions of the Negroni.
I had the classic. According to my copy of Williams-Sonoma 1999 Bar Guide, the cocktail was named after Count Negroni, an aristocrat from Florence. He supposedly created it in the late 19th century by adding gin and an orange slice to an
Americano , a popular drink in Italy at that time.
The Negroni
2 T good gin
2 T sweet vermouth
2T Campari
1 orange wheel to garnish
Can be served on the rocks, or straight up.

Delicious?
A waste of good gin?
Don't drink this because you will want it every night?
:) Reply Delete Replies Karen August 12, 2012 at 6:33 PM Oh, it's good. Not a waste of good gin. It makes the perfect pre-dinner cocktail. I had to put the Campari up high so I won't drink one every night. Delete Reply Ali B August 13, 2012 at 5:24 PM I almost forgot about the Negroni... gin and campari and two of my favorite things! I might have to try it with a splash of champagne :) Reply Delete Replies Karen August 13, 2012 at 6:13 PM That sounds interesting!
