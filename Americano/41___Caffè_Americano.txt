Coffee-Filter
Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world. It is prepared from the roasted seeds – commonly referred to as beans – of the coffee plant, and is usually served hot but can also be served cold.
Coffee, along with tea and water, is one of the most frequently-drunk beverages, its volume amounting to about a third that of tap water.

Moka Express
The Moka Express is a stovetop coffee maker. It was created by
Alfonso Bialetti
in
1933 . It is made from
aluminium
with
bakelite
handles. In
Italy , where Bialetti (the manufacturer) is based, the Moka Express (or cheaper imitations) is in almost every home. Brewing coffee with a Moka Express
First
water
is poured in the boiler (marked A on Fig.1), then the
funnel -shaped metal filter (B) is inserted. Ground
coffee
is thereupon added, and the upper part (which has a second metal filter at the bottom) is tightly screwed on the base. By placing the pot on a
heat
source, the water is brought close to
boiling point
creating
steam
in the boiler. The steam eventually reaches a high enough
pressure
to gradually force the surrounding water up the funnel through the grounds and into the upper chamber (C), where the coffee is collected. A
gasket
ensures a tightly closed unit and allows for pressure to safely build up in the lower section, and a
safety valve
provides a necessary release if this pressure gets too high. Mokas come in different sizes, and can brew from one up to eighteen cups with the biggest
Bialetti
model on the market.
Moka coffee vs. drip coffee Due to the higher pressures involved, the mixture of water and steam reaches temperatures well above 100 °C, causing a more efficient extraction of
caffeine
and flavours from the grounds, and resulting in a much stronger brew when compared to that obtained by drip brewing. However, since a typical moka cup is about 20 ml, the actual amount of caffeine per serving is smaller. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_Express

French press
A French press, also known as a press pot, coffee press, coffee plunger or cafetière, is a
coffee
brewing device popularized by the
French . Its operation is simple and it produces a stronger coffee than other devices. A French press consists of a narrow
cylindrical
jug
usually made of
glass
or clear
plastic , equipped with a lid and a "plunger" which fits tightly in the cylinder and which has a fine wire or
nylon
mesh acting as a filter. Coffee is brewed by placing the coffee and water together, leaving to brew for a few minutes, then depressing the plunger to separate the coffee at the bottom of the jug. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the brewing water, coffee brewed with the French press captures more of the coffee's flavour and
essential oils , which would become trapped in a traditional
drip brew
machine's paper filters. French pressed coffee is usually stronger and thicker and has more sediment than drip-brewed coffee. Because the used grounds remain in the drink after brewing, French pressed coffee should be served immediately so as to not become bitter from over-extraction. Coffee for use in a French press should be of a consistent, coarse grind. The use of a
burr mill
grinder gives a more consistent grind than the whirling blade variety. The ground coffee should be more coarse than that used for a drip brew
coffee filter , and far coarser than that used for
espresso , as anything other than a coarse grind will seep through the press filter and into the coffee.
Some studies have found that drinking large amounts of coffee made by the French press method increases
LDL
("bad")
cholesterol
levels, while drinking filtered, percolated, or drip coffee does not
[1] . The French press method allows certain
Diterpenes , such as
Cafestol
and
Kahweol , to remain in the coffee while other brewing methods either remove or limit these chemicals. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press

Cafestol
Cafestol is a
diterpene
molecule
present in
coffee . A typical bean of
Coffea arabica
contains about 0.6% cafestol by weight. Cafestol is present in highest quantity in unfiltered coffee drinks such as
French press
coffee or
Turkish coffee . In filtered coffee drinks such as
drip brewed
coffee, it is present in only negligible amounts. Studies have shown that regular consumption of boiled coffee increases serum cholesterol by 8% in men and 10% in women. For those drinking filter coffee, the effect was only significant for women. Cafestol has also shown
anticarcinogenic
properties in rats. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafestol

Cowboy Coffee
Cowboy Coffee is
coffee
brewed without special devices, filters, or tools. Because no special equipment is needed to brew this type of coffee, it is often made by
campers .
In general,
water
is heated to near boiling temperature, ground coffee is added, and the mixture is stirred. When the grounds sink, the unfiltered product is consumed. The amount of coffee added largely depends upon the strength desired, the amount of water added to it, and the size of the vessel used. Additionally, the coffee grounds tend to absorb a small amount of water while settling. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coffee

Long black
A long black is a style of
coffee , most commonly found in
Australia
and
New Zealand , made by pulling a double-shot of
espresso
over hot
water
(usually the water is also heated by the espresso machine). A long black is similar to an
Americano , which is a weaker version of a long black, made with a single shot of espresso and more hot water. The order in which a long black is made (water first, espresso second) is important; reversing the steps will destroy the crema and often 'burn' the espresso, giving it an unpleasant taste. However, there are many different variations on this method and it is not uncommon to find
cafés
that create long blacks slightly differently. A short black is a half-sized long black - a single shot of espresso with a very little hot water.

Irish coffee
A classic Irish coffee (Irish: Caife Gaelach) consists of hot
coffee ,
Irish whiskey , and
sugar , with double
cream
whipped until it begins to stiffen, floated on top. Irish coffee can be considered to be a variation on the
hot toddy . The following variations substitute Irish whisky for some other spirit: Scotch coffee ( Scotch whisky ) French coffee ( brandy
or
Cognac ) Spanish coffee ( sherry ) Russian coffee ( vodka ) Jamaican coffee ( dark rum , sometimes also with
Tia Maria )
The cocktail known as the Dutch coffee is made slightly differently. Instead of pouring cream on top of a coffee, sugar, and whiskey mix, simply stir a shot of
advocaat
into a cup of warm black coffee, adding sugar to taste.

Cafe mocha
A Café Mocha is a variant of a cafe
latte . Like a latte it is typically one third
espresso
and two thirds steamed
milk , but a shot of
chocolate
is added. Typically the chocolate is in the form of an
Italian syrup , although less sophisticated vending systems use instant chocolate powder. Whipped cream, dustings of cocoa and marshmallows may also be added on top for flavour and decoration. Contrary to cappuccinos, cafe mochas do not contain the well known milk froth on top, usually whipped cream and a dusting of either cinnamon or cocoa powder. This being an American invention, it is mostly unknown in Italy and other continental European countries. Mocha was originally a particular variety of coffee from
Mocha, Yemen , made without cocoa, but which tasted as if it had cocoa in it, and modern usage usually refers to an imitation of it using other coffee varieties and cocoa. A variant is white café mocha, instead made with a shot of
white chocolate . There are also variants of the drink that mix the two syrups. A term moccaccino is used in some regions of Europe and the Middle East to describe Café Latte with cocoa or chocolate. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe_mocha
