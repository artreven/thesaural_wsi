The last time we played
The Pittsboro General Store , it began to snow just as we started our set and by song five, we had to wrap it up. We are playing
The Store
again this Friday night, the 18th! If it snows this go round, I say we all doff our garb and make snow angels! Who is with me, people?!
On Friday, if you find yourself pulled to the realm of Pittsboro, or are already in that dimension, come to the store for some great food, awesome people, and our show!! Bring your DAD…or some other fatherly figure (it is Father’s Day on the 19th, BTW)!
Come out, you guys! We start around 8pm and will be playing two sets with a short break.
Mmmmm - Energy Bowl!
