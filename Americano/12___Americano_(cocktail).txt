While the drink's origins are unknown, the most widely reported account is that it was invented in
Florence ,
Italy
in 1919, at Caffè Casoni, ex
Caffè Giacosa , now called Caffè Cavalli.
Count
Camillo Negroni invented it by asking the
bartender , Fosco Scarselli, to strengthen his favorite cocktail, the
Americano ,
by adding gin rather than the normal soda water. The bartender also
added an orange garnish rather than the typical lemon garnish of the
Americano to signify that it was a different drink. After the success of the cocktail, the Negroni Family founded Negroni Distillerie in
Treviso ,
Italy, and produced a ready-made version of the drink, sold as Antico
Negroni 1919. One of the earliest reports of the drink came from
Orson Welles
in correspondence with the
Coshocton Tribune
while working in Rome on
Cagliostro
in 1947, where he described a new drink called the Negroni, "The
bitters are excellent for your liver, the gin is bad for you. They
balance each other."
According to the Corsican newspaper
Nice Matin Corse
of 1980,
Pascal Olivier Count de Negroni
is among those whom it is believed invented the drink.
As with the Martini cocktail, the trend in recent years has been to
use a larger proportion of gin, mainly because the quality of the spirit
is a lot better than it used to be, meaning there is less need to
dilute the gin to make it more palatable. Most bars today will serve the
drink with double the quantity of gin.
A recent trend is to treat the Negroni as a template, involving a
base spirit, a bitters and a vermouth. Bars such as Amor y Amargo in New
York, Mauro's Negroni Club in Munich, Germany, and Ohla in Barcelona,
Spain among others, do this.
The 'Negroni sbagliato' ("wrong Negroni" in Italian) uses sparkling
wine (e.g., prosecco) instead of gin. 'Negroski' is a recipe with vodka
again as substitute for gin. 'Cardinaloski' is a Negroski with some
angostura drops. Punt e Mes Negroni instead replaces standard red
vermouth with a specific, distinctively more bitter-tasting brand called
Punt e Mes. The 'Cin Cyn' uses
Cynar
instead of Campari. Pinkish Negroni: with pinkish wine (instead gin). A "Raultini" is a variation using
Aperol
instead of Campari, giving its distinctive orange color, lighter alcohol content, and a bit of sweetness.
