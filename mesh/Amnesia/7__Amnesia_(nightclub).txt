Contents [ show ]
History
Edit
Early career (1979–1984)
Edit
Paul Oakenfold's career was set to be a chef, after having hopes of becoming part of a band. He describes his early life as a "bedroom deejay" in a podcasted interview with
Vancouver 's 24 Hours, stating he grew up listening to
The Beatles . Later 21-year-old Paul Oakenfold and Ian Paul moved to 254 West 54th Street.
Studio 54 's
Steve Rubell
ran the place and only allowed popular people inside. Oakenfold and Paul used fake passes to sneak into places in
New York
where they met
Maze , Bobby Womak and
Bob Marley , whom they also interviewed, as they said to be
NME
and
Melody Maker
journalists. Other people were
Brooke Shields ,
Cher ,
Donald Trump
and Bianca Jagger,
Warhol ,
Dali
and
Yves Saint Laurent .
Paul Oakenfold's musical career began in the late '70s, when he started playing
soul
in a
Covent Garden
wine bar. Here, he met Trevor Fung as well as
Rumours
in
London
where he played
Earth, Wind and Fire
and popular
British
bands . In 1984 he spent several months in
New York City 's West
Harlem . During this time
hip-hop
was the most popular sound in the area (see
1984 in music ).
Larry Levan , one of the early
deejays
during this period performed at the
Paradise Garage . He began breaking into the mainstream as he was working as an
A&R
man for
Champion Records . At that time, he signed
DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince , as well as
Salt-n-Pepa . He also appeared on the
Blue Peter
BBC
programme for children with a breakdancing crew. He also became promoter and British agent for the
Beastie Boys
and
Run-D.M.C. ; Since then, he began his presentations at The Project in
Streatham
playing soul and
jazz
music.
Perfecto and fame (1985–1991)
Edit
In 1985, Oakenfold traveled to the island of
Ibiza
for a week to celebrate his birthday. Trevor Fung, Nicky Holloway, Ian Saint Paul, Danny Rampling and Johnny Walker accompanied him. It was during this time when playing at
Amnesia
that Oakenfold demonstrated the balearic
trance
sound that he would later become known for. The event marked his career as a producer as he convinced the owner to host an "Ibiza Reunion" party after-hours. He had previously made an attempt, but it failed as the crowd was not prepared for the
acid house
style until 1987 when the party was successful. Since then, the night became a classic and became one of the UK's major acid house nights, known as "Spectrum at Heaven in Charing Cross". Spectrum became popular in The Sanctuary. As a bigger space was required, it turned into the Heaven club, which was run by Oakenfold and Paul. The party was best known for the "Theatre of Madness", as more than 1,500 people were present on Monday nights, until it went down; with the financial issues it changed its name to the "Land of Oz". Artists like
Alex Paterson
DJ'd in the VIP
chillout
area known as the "White Room", which gave Paul more free time, and then he began producing music under the alias "Electra" in 1988 with his friend
Steve Osborne . In 1988 he decided to create a place where new artists could develop their careers. At that moment,
Perfecto Records
was born.
In 1990, he worked with Terry Farley,
Andrew Weatherall
and Osborne on two remixes for
The Happy Mondays . The remixes of "Rave On" and "Hallelujah" were released on the
Madchester Rave On
EP, as well as "Step On", a covered version adapted from
John Kongos ' 1971 hit "He's Gonna Step On You". The song reached the Top 5 position in the UK. He was invited as a guest DJ to
Spike Island , a
gig
with
The Stone Roses . Pleased with the last single, the Happy Monday's gave Paul and Osborne the opportunity to produce their third studio album,
Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches . The album entered the UK charts at #1 with pre-sales of 150,000. The album was named
NME 's "1990 Album of The Year", and both Paul and Osborne won the 1991
Brit Award
for "Best Producer".This is a tremendous record and a gauntlet chucked at all the other would-be legends in town... Wild, brash, corrosive funk rock, grimly northern and yet pan-cultural in a Tesco's shoplifter kind of way. As they continued releasing only four singles as Electra, in Full Frequency Range Recordings (FFRR) founded and run by
Radio 1's
Pete Tong , the duo created a new alias under the name Perfecto. They remixed
Massive Attack 's "Safe From Harm" as well as many others.
Grace
was formed in the late 1990s, consisting of Oakenfold and Osborne and various singers, including jazz singer
Dominique Atkins
and Patti Low.
Tours and nightclubs (1992–2000)
Edit
In 1992, when
U2
released their song " Even Better Than the Real Thing ", the Perfecto remix reached a higher charted position than the original song. In 1993 with the success of his last remix as Perfecto, he was hired by
U2
to provide the warm-up sonics to their
Zoo TV
world tour, and replaced
BP Fallon
on the 1993 legs in
Europe
and
Australia ,
New Zealand , and
Japan , with more than fifty shows in Zooropa '93 and Zoomerang from to of the same year.He began producing his own tracks as well, continuing to remix songs from popular artists. He began using
Goa music , something he discovered on the beaches of
Goa
in
India , fusing it with similar sounding European tracks to create his own distinct sound. He took this to the mainstream in 1994 he created a two-hour set for
BBC Radio 1 's
Essential Mix . In 1995, he became the first DJ to play on the main stage at the
Glastonbury Festival
for 90,000 people, which he considers his favorite
gig . His album
Perfecto Fluoro
became the #1 essential dance collection of Boston Beat during 1996 with
Jamiroquai 's
Travelling Without Moving . The group Grace dissolved in 1997 as Oakenfold was touring as a performance DJ more frequently and could not commit to recording.
On June 9, 1997 Oakenfold created
Global Underground 004: Paul Oakenfold, Live in Oslo
(GU004) which is a double mix CD in the
Global Underground
series, compiled and mixed by Oakenfold; it is the first work he created for GU. The mix was recorded live at Cosmopolite Club in
Oslo ,
Norway , as part of the official launch of the
Quart Festival . It showcases Oakenfold's eclectic taste in music at the time, as the mix combines
drum and bass ,
progressive house
&
progressive trance , and
goa trance . In 1997, Oakenfold mixed one disc of the double album
Fantazia
House Collection 6 , a UK
house music
compilation series. Oakenfold became Cream's resident DJ from 1997 - 1999. During this time, he began to concentrate on the release of
Tranceport
in 1998.
In 1998 and 1999, Oakenfold took the first place in "DJmag's Top 100 DJs". With the two-year contract as a resident in
Liverpool 's Cream, it was in 1999 that he released
Resident. Two Years of Oakenfold at Cream.
on
Virgin .
Thrive Records , the US distributor for early
Global Underground
releases had a different numbering scheme for the Global Underground albums, due to this
Global Underground 007: Paul Oakenfold, New York
(GU007) was released as (GU002) in the United States only. The compilation was released on May 25, 1998, with the US release on Jan 19, 1999. This was the second production from Oakenfold with GU and it contained trance,
drum and bass , progressive house, progressive trance,
breakbeat
and
Downtempo . This became his last work with GU.
In 1999, he left the
UK
and
Europe
and moved to the
USA
where he went on tour. A
In 2000 he created fourteen tracks of jazz, soul, house and goa based styles with Mitchell Oakenfold. Twenty-four
FX
and scratches
loops and sounds were included too, each consisting of six seconds; the album cover says
"Only for DJs and Producers"
and was released on Music of Life. It is not considered his first studio album, as it only included useful tools for deejays.
In September 2000 he opened the new
Digital Radio
station
Ministry of Sound Radio
with a live mix from the famous London club .
Deals and barriers (2000–2001)
Edit
Oakenfold's next project took him to club
Pacha
in
Ibiza
for the summer, before returning to America for the
Burning Man
festival in August; Even though he had spoken extensively to the press about breaking barriers with the US, the DJ/producer said he felt his "Stateside" ambitions were not unique. Together with drum and bass maestro
Aphrodite , he sold out the 10,000 capacity of the
Red Rocks Amphitheatre
in
Colorado . He continued to present the Perfecto Nights for a year in Pacha, but he decided to host for a second year; he recruited
Hernan Cattaneo
as his co-resident at the club, which has a capacity of 3,500 guests.With the success of
Tranceport
and the mix compilations he created for GU, he released two
DJ Mixes
known as
Perfecto Presents: Travelling
and
Perfecto Presents: Another World , both released in 2000 as
double disc
albums. The compilation traces Paul's hip-hop sense as well as underground
disco , and includes Quiver's remix of
Led Zeppelin 's " Babe I'm Gonna Leave You " with a passive rock feel to it. The compilation sold 13,000 copies at counter sales in its first week, and over 80,000 copies were shipped to stores across the US. While in the US he met actor
Jack Nicholson
at a
Lakers
game; it was Paul's first
Basketball
game.
Paul joined
Seb Fontaine
and
Timo Maas
for Cream's event at
Nation
before travelling to play at the
Ministry of Sound
event at the
Millennium Dome ,
London . He performed with The Dreem Team, who broadcasted live on
BBC Radio 1
from 1:00 am to 3:00 am. In 2001, Oakenfold took part in the first
Area Festival
tour. This tour featured
Incubus ,
Carl Cox ,
Orb ,
OutKast , and
The Roots . He later released a new
compilation album ,
Perfecto Presents: Ibiza ; The album features the essence which has inspired his dance music focused on
Ibiza .
Global Underground sold over 150,000 copies of Paul Oakenfold's previous
Global Underground: New York . A spokesperson for the label revealed that in the US, demand for UK dance music had been increasing in the past couple of years, and now made up over two-thirds of the label's sales. The Global Underground New York office opened in on
Ninth Avenue
in
Manhattan . The Mekka Electronic Music Festival, otherwise known as the "electronic
Lollapallooza " took place in ten cities in the US and
Canada
during August and September, including

Josh Wink ,
Derrick Carter ,
Roni Size ,
Deep Dish ,
BT ,

and
Überzone . Since Oakenfold had been working in the American market for a long time especially during 2001, he moved to
Los Angeles
to work on film soundtracks and to intensify his DJing commitments Stateside. In 2001 he created the soundtrack for the film
Swordfish ,
Swordfish: The Album
contained a transformation of "Planet Rock" into a seven minute
breakbeat
trance anthem. Most of the tracks are collaborations with
Andy Gray , the remix of
N.E.R.D. 's "Lapdance" which gained total notability from other tracks. The soundtrack was produced under
Village Roadshow
and
Warner Bros.
and distributed through
London-Sire Records . Paul recorded a track with
Crazy Town
vocalist
Shifty Shellshock
at the end of the year for his new album. In an interview with
Rolling Stone
in the US, Shellshock said that the track known as " Starry Eyed Surprise " was created after the pair met at a Crazy Town show.
Bunkka (2002–2004)
Edit
In 2002,
Bunkka
became his first official studio album when he signed to
Maverick . Bunkka is a compilation of styles which Paul has learned to mix throughout his career; the blending in of progressive trance with goa makes the album different from other conventional dance album. The name
Bunkka
comes from
Peter Gabriel 's studio in the UK, where the album was recorded. An extended play was released featuring live versions of four songs under Peoplesound Records. It is also Oakenfold's best selling album to date, with sales largely exceeding 1,000,000 (1 million) copies worldwide.For the past 10 years I've been creating music under various different names, but I was never comfortable with putting out an Oakenfold record... It was, however, an idea that I'd been thinking about for a long time and
Steve Osborne , my colleague in some of the production work I was doing at the time, kept putting pressure on me, saying
"you should do it, you should do it" . So eventually I felt it was time to make that record The album features the vocals from singers from Jane's Addiction vocalist
Perry Farrell
on "Time of Your Life" and
Shifty Shellshock
of
Los Angeles
rock and rap band
Crazy Town
on "Starry Eyed Surprise" with popular

dyslexia
as a child and announced his intention to help dyslexic children.

David Arnold 's widely popular " James Bond Theme ", the song was released under
Warner Bros. Records

Carla Werner
was first issued as a
B-Side

Tiësto 's
