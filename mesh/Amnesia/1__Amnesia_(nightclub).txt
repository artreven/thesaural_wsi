The Cook Islands
The Cook Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean, north-east of New Zealand, between French Polynesia and American Samoa. There are fifteen major islands, spread over 2.2 million square
kilometres of ocean, divided into two distinct groups: the Southern Cook
Islands, and the Northern Cook Islands of coral atolls. They have a total land area of 240 square
kilometres (92.7 sq mi), but the Cook Islands Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) covers
1.8 million square kilometres (0.7 million sq mi)
of ocean.

The Cook Islands were first settled in the 6th century CE
by Polynesian people who
migrated from nearby Tahiti, to the southeast.
British navigator Captain James
Cook arrived in 1773 and 1777
and named the islands the
Hervey Islands ; the name "Cook
Islands", in honour of Cook, appeared on a Russian naval chart published
in the 1820s.

Despite some 100,000 visitors a year to the capital island –
Rarotonga
– the Cooks
are largely unspoiled by tourism.
They offer a rare opportunity for
people from the cities of the world to experience a different type of
vacation.
There are no high-rise hotels, only four beach buggies and
very little hype. Ideal for travellers seeking more than the usual
clichés associated with the South Seas, each island has its unique
qualities and offers the visitor a special experience.

Mu Koh Poda or Poda Group Islands is located in the west of Ao Nang.
The wonderful beach in the nort of Koh Poda is fascinating with white fine sand and crystal clear sea. It is undoubtedly one of the most favorite beaches for tourists who visit Ao Nang.
