Ibiza
Ibiza
( Catalan :
Eivissa ) is one of the
Balearic Islands
located in the
Mediterranean Sea , belonging to
Spain . With
Formentera , it is one of the two
Pine Islands . Major cities are
Ibiza ,
Santa Eulària des Riu
and
Sant Antoni de Portmany .
The name Ibiza is derived from the Original Arabic word “Yabisah” (”يابسة”) meaning ‘Land’ or ‘Landward’ in English.
Eivissa
is the official
Catalan
name
pronounced
[əj'vi.sə] ; but the name in
Spanish
is Ibiza (usually pronounced using the
Castilian
variation
[iˈβ̞i.θa] , often manifested by English speakers
[ɪˈbi.t͡sa] ).
The Island of Ibiza is most famously known for its summer parties, with thousands of people flooding in for the big summer club nights. Famous clubs include
Space ,
Pacha ,
Privilege
(ex Ku),
Amnesia ,
DC10 ,
Eden
and
Es Paradis . They are hosts to parties of international fame such as
Cream , Manumission, etc. It is also home to the ‘West End’ party district of Sant Antoni, a rite of passage for many partygoers.
Climate
The climate of Ibiza is
Mediterranean
and has milder winters and slightly cooler summers than
Mallorca . The winters are mild with temperatures around 15°
Celsius
(60°
Fahrenheit ) and some rain. The hot summer season lasts from June to September inclusive with temperatures regularly reaching 30°C (85°F), lots of sunshine and very little rain. Frost and snow are very rare.
