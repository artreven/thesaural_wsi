About Ibiza: Ibiza
( Catalan :
Eivissa ) is an island in the
Mediterranean Sea
79 km off the coast of the city of Valencia in
Iberian Peninsula ,
Spain . It is the third largest of the
Balearic Islands , a neighbour of Spain. With
Formentera , it is one of the two
Pine Islands
or
Pityuses . Its largest cities are
Ibiza Town
(Catalan: Vila d’Eivissa
or simply
Vila ),
Santa Eulària des Riu
and
Sant Antoni de Portmany . The official name is the
Catalan
Eivissa
( Catalan pronunciation:
[əiˈβisə] , locally
[əiˈvisə] ). The name in
Spanish
is
Ibiza
[iˈβiθa] . In
British English , the name is usually pronounced in an approximation of the Spanish ( /ɪˈbiːθə, ɪˈviːθə/ ), [1]
while in
American English
the pronunciation is more anglicized ( /ɪˈbiːzə/ , [2] /iːˈbiːsə/ [3] ). [4] [5] The island is well-known for its summer club parties which attract large numbers of tourists, but the island and the Spanish Tourist Office have been working in order to promote more family-oriented tourism. [6]
Noted clubs include
Space ,
Pacha ,
Privilege
(ex Ku),
Amnesia ,
DC10 , Eden, El Divino,
Es Paradis , and
Café del Mar . [7]
It is also home to the legendary “port” in the district of Ibiza, a popular stop for many tourists. [7] History View of the port from the ramparts. For other uses, see

Region as classified by UNESCO. In
654 BC
Phoenician
settlers founded a port in the Balearic Islands, as
Ibossim
(from the Phoenician
iboshim
dedicated to the god of the music and dance
Bes ). [8]
It was later known to Romans as “Ebusus”. The
Greeks , who came to Ibiza during the time of the Phoenicians, were the first to call the two islands of Ibiza and Formentera the
Pityûssai
( Πιτυοῦσσαι , “pine-covered islands”; a translation of the Phoenician name). [9]
With the decline of
Phoenicia
after the
Assyrian
invasions, Ibiza came under the control of
Carthage , also a former Phoenician colony. The island produced dye, salt, fish sauce ( garum ), and wool. A shrine with offerings to the goddess
Tanit
was established in the cave at
Es Culleram , and the rest of the Balearic Islands entered Eivissa’s commercial orbit after
400 BC . Ibiza was a major trading post along the Mediterranean routes. Ibiza began establishing its own trading stations along the nearby Balearic island of
Majorca
such as
Na Guardis , from which large quantities of renowned Balearic slingers were hired as mercenaries who fought for Carthage. During the
Second Punic War , the island was assaulted by the two
Scipio
brothers in
209 BC
but remained loyal to Carthage. With Carthaginian military luck running out on the
Iberian
mainland, Ibiza was last used by the fleeing Carthaginian General Mago to gather supplies and men before sailing to
Minorca
and then to Liguria. Ibiza negotiated a favorable treaty with the
Romans , which spared Ibiza from further destruction and allowed it to continue its Carthaginian-Punic institutions well into the Empire days, when it became an official Roman municipality. For this reason, Ibiza today offers excellent examples of late Carthaginian-Punic civilization. During the Roman Empire, the island became a quiet imperial outpost, removed from the important trading routes of the time. After the fall of the Roman empire and a brief period of first
Vandal
and then
Byzantine
rule, the island was conquered by the
Moors , as well as much of the Iberian peninsula. Under Islamic rule, Ibiza came in close contact with the city of
Dénia
(the closest port in the nearby Iberian peninsula, located in the
Valencian Community ) as the two areas were administered jointly by the same
taifa . Moreover, the tribes who lived in Ibiza and Denia during the period 1060–1085 were Moorish tribes named Bno-Alaglab & Bano-Mujahed. The island was reclaimed for Christendom by Aragonese King
James I of Aragon
in 1235. Since then, the island has had its own self-government in several forms but in 1715 King
Philip V of Spain
abolished the local government’s autonomy. The arrival of democracy in the late 1970s led to the Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands. Today the island is part of the Balearic Autonomous Community, along with
Majorca ,
Minorca
and
Formentera .
