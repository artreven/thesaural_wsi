Book Review - Before I Go to Sleep by S.J. Watson
Synopsis :  'As I sleep, my mind will erase everything I did today. I will wake up tomorrow as I did this morning. Thinking I'm still a child. Thinking I have a whole lifetime of choice ahead of me ...' Memories define us. So what if you lost yours every time you went to sleep? Your name, your identity, your past, even the people you love - all forgotten overnight. And the one person you trust may only be telling you half the story. Welcome to Christine's life.
First Line :  "The bedroom is strange."
Random Quote :  "Dr. Nash called me almost as soon as Ben left for work.  He reminded me about my journal and then - once he had told me that he would be picking me up later to take me for my scan - I read it.  There were a few things I could perhaps recall, and maybe whole passages I could remember writing.  It was as if some residue of memory had survived the night."
Greta Garbo in
As You Desire Me
Review :
Amnesia
is a classic condition for a thriller.  What would it be like to wake up every day and know nothing about who you are, what's in your past, where you live, your husband's name (assuming he is your husband), your age - everything up for grabs every morning?  This is scary for a lot of reasons, including the level of dependency it would inflict upon its sufferers.
S.J. Watson's debut thriller,
Before I Go to Sleep , mines this territory for all its worth.  The suspense is tightly woven, the writing is quite good, it all works in all the ways a good thriller should.  Best of all, is the overwhelming sense of paranoia that the book creates from the very first words - a sense that ratchets up throughout the book until by the end you're still not really sure what is real and what's fabricated.
Watson takes a familiar theme and turns out a well-written character study filled with suspense, paranoia, and pure terror.  Be forewarned, once you start reading this you won't be able to put it down.  I missed
BART
stops twice while reading this and had to get off and take the train back to my destination.  Great read.

Beth(bookaholicmom) 9/29/2011 1:28 PM I am glad to see you liked this book. One of my Goodreads groups is reading it next month and I am hoping I get the chance to read it then. If it made you miss your BART stop, it must be good. I hope it the trip back to your original destination wasn't too long.

Reply Delete samantha.1020 9/29/2011 7:03 PM I too could not put this book down!
It was a book that left me thinking about it for a couple days afterwards and I couldn't wait to hand off my copy to my Mom.
I can't wait to hear what she thinks when she finishes :)
