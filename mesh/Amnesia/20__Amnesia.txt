Redmount Rehabilitation Center is a place for those with nowhere else. Nestled in a corner of Ohio, far from anywhere, Redmount is where you will find your favorite Glee characters living from day to day... but not as you knew them. The center was built to help those with unstable minds, issues no one else could help them deal with, and pasts too painful to bear while still helping the kids to continue their high school education. The Glee kids all have some reason to be here - will they remain helpless; unable to break free of the prison of their minds? Who will escape their demons, fight their battles, and survive?
