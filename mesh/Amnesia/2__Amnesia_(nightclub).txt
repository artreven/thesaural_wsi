trance
producer and DJ. He was born in
Leiden, Netherlands , but grew up in
Koudekerk aan den Rijn . In 2007 and 2008, he was voted number one DJ in
DJ Mag 's annual Top 100 vote Biography Armin van Buuren pursued his career as a professional musician despite the promise of a career in law in his native country, where he completed his law degree in 2004. Armin started working as a DJ in a local night club called Nexus, finished high school in 1995 and went on to university to study law. Meanwhile, he moved his studio equipment from his bedroom to a 'real' studio.The first tracks he produced in his new studio were, among others, tracks like "Touch Me" and "Communication". Armin van Buuren has been quoted as saying, "Don't be a prisoner of your own style." He has described his musical style as "liberating, euphoric, uplifting, melodic and energetic." He hosts a weekly radio show
A State of Trance , which mostly consist of trance and other genres. The show completed its 350th episode in May 2008, running for over 7 years. In October 2002, van Buuren was voted Number 5 in the
DJ Magazine
100 top DJs. The following year, he jumped up to the #3 spot, and held 3rd place for the next 3 years. His work left him at the #2 spot, just below
Paul van Dyk
in the 2006 polls, and in 2007 Armin reached Number 1, heading the 2007 DJ Mag Top 100. He was voted number 1 again in 2008.
As a producer Van Buuren has always had his own studio and works alone the majority of the time. He has never employed an
engineer , claiming he does not want the music to be altered by one. Since 1995, van Buuren has released many tracks on different labels with increasing success. His first big success was "Blue Fear" on
Cyber Records
at the age of 19. This 'Euro Trance blueprint' made it into the UK Chart. "Communication" was released on the same label, and had a huge impact on
Ibiza ,
Spain
in the summer of 1999. After being signed to
AM PM Records , this track entered the UK Chart at #18 in 2000. As of September 29, 2008, Armin has won the DJ Award for "Best Trance DJ" at Ibiza along with other nominees that of Tiesto, Ferry Corsten and Paul van Dyk. In the beginning of 1999, van Buuren started his label
Armind
together with
United Recordings . The first release, Gig - "One", was well received. The second release "Touch Me", under the name Rising Star was signed to
Ministry Of Sound
in the UK, before the record was released. By the time of his third release, Gimmick - "Free" was signed to
R&S Records , van Buuren had managed to make his label popular very quickly. Under the surname Gaia he released "4 Elements" on Captivating Sounds, a sub-label of
Warner Brothers . Teaming up with
DJ Tiësto , two new projects were born: Major League - "Wonder Where You Are?" was released on
Black Hole Recordings
and Alibi - "Eternity" was released on Armind. "Eternity" received club and chart success and was signed to
Paul van Dyk 's imprint
Vandit Records . Another major collaboration followed this. Together with
Ferry Corsten , van Buuren recorded a riff-classic titled "Exhale" for the System F. album. Released as a single, this track reached gold status in less than a month. In 2000 van Buuren started his own AVB compilation series. He managed to find a balance between
progressive ,
techno
and
trance music
styles. AVB001 - "A State of Trance" (not to be confused with his weekly
ASOT
radio shows) sold more than 10,000 copies and contains van Buuren's well known remix of Moogwai - "Viola." AVB002 "Basic Instinct" featured a new track: Perpetuous Dreamer - "The Sound Of Goodbye". This track entered the Dutch charts in June 2001 at number 26. Later in the year the track hit #1 on the
Hot Dance Music/Club Play
chart. AVB003 - "In Motion" was released August 6, 2001. This album contained the real trance sound and was very popular in the US. AVB004 - "Transparence" followed in 2002. In March 2001 van Buuren started his own radio show on
ID&T
Radio. In this weekly two-hour show, entitled ' A State of Trance ', he plays the latest popular trance music tracks. His show and the artists he features are popularized by publishing the artists and track titles on
his website . This radio-show/website combination has proven popular internationally. When ID&T Radio changed genres in 2004, van Buuren left and took A State of Trance with him. The show then moved to Fresh FM, a Dutch radio station. It is now a weekly feature on SLAM!FM, another Dutch radio station, DI.FM, an online radio station, and on
XM Satellite Radio
channel 82 in the
United States
and
Canada . A complete list of stations that broadcast ASOT can be found at
the ASOT section of Armin's website . Also in 2004, van Buuren remixed the 24 Theme into a trance hit. In June 2005, the 200th episode was celebrated in
Amsterdam
and subsequently aired on radio. The 250th (8 hour) anniversary episode was celebrated in Club Asta in The Hague, The Netherlands, featuring van Buuren, Jonas Steur,
M.I.K.E. , John Askew,
Rank 1
and
Menno De Jong . On May 17, 2007, van Buuren began broadcasting the first of a two part series of what would become his 300th episode of
A State of Trance . He has also worked on remix projects involving tracks by Japanese superstar
Ayumi Hamasaki .

ANDRE TANNEBERGER
As both songwriter and producer, Andre Tanneberger has been living in two worlds for quite some time. One is the world of electronic music, where he has created extraordinary, melodious club tracks and played countless DJ sets all over the globe. Worldwide fame came courtesy of numerous top ten hits such as "9 PM (Till I Come)", “Don’t Stop“, “Killer“, “Let U Go“ and ”Ecstasy“. The other world is an atmospheric domain - smoother songs to lose yourself in, where you can begin to dream. On this, his seventh album ATB has succeeded in combining the two worlds, without intermingling them unnecessarily. “Trilogy“ provides the electronic and melodious ATB sound blended with a unique rock and pop crossover flavour on the first CD. The second CD, on the other hand, offers the listener 14 super smooth tracks. “Every album should have its own soul and a golden thread leading through all the songs. However, you only really feel the soul if you listen to all the songs together. If you mix up the faster and slower songs, that isn’t going to work,“ explains Andre. The golden thread he is referring to has been a feature of ATB’s career to date. Punctual as ever, he delivered an album for his fans every year. “Seven years“, released in 2005, was a mixture of new songs and a retrospective “Best Of” collection. This album formed a link between the past and future of his music. In doing so, ATB was also able to break with old habits. “Bringing a new album out every year wasn’t a deliberate plan as such, it simply happened.” Last year was the first in a long time in which I did not release a new ATB longplayer. After having played gigs all over the world in 2005 and 2006 I needed a break. I had to come to terms with new influences and jettison the old sounds. Mission accomplished - the new album presents an array of innovative styles, making use of stronger instrumentation and tools: ”In the field of dance music the ratio or influence of electronic sounds to “handmade” drums, piano and guitars is around 90/10. We wanted to break open the whole thing and go for a 60/40 split, or even 50/50. We placed great emphasis on songwriting and spent a lot of time sitting in the studio playing drums or guitar, looking for new song ideas.His productions have always been international in character. “I have never thought about territories as such, or composed a song that for a certain region or country. That never worked for me. I think people are the same all over the world. Club music is a worldwide phenomenon. People in Brazil dance to the same songs as people in Tokyo, London or South Africa. Dance music is a brilliant way to connect people all over the world.More than ten years of making electronic music and being a DJ have changed Andre, broadening his horizons. “My productions have become more adult.” Nevertheless his heart is still in electronic music, as well as being open to pop music. “You grow up and your taste in music grows with you.” Andre thinks the same is equally true for his fans. Having grown older with him, this is exactly why they can still identify with his songs.The title of the new album shows that ATB has not broken completely with past conventions, but still has an eye on his past. Two songs on earlier albums were named “Trilogy“. The third version on the current album is not only the eponymous song, but also the concluding link of the chain. There is also a welcome return for a world famous international artist with whom Andre has collaborated in days gone by – the new song with Heather Nova turned out so well, that it has been chosen as the first single of the new album. ATB also worked with Jennifer Karr, Jan Löchel, Jeppe Riddervold and Karen Ires on new album tracks. You can sense the creativity that has emerged from a concentrated phase in the studio. The many nights he spent with his team and best friend “Rhudee“, designated co-producer, proved truly inspiring. Andre points out: “We had so many songs left that we could have filled another album as well.” Having patently enjoyed his time in the studio, Andre is similarly looking forward to presenting the result to his fans. An eight gig Germany tour will be followed by shows in America, Asia, across Europe and Australia.
