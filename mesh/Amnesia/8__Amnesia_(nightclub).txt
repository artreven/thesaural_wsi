The official name is the
Catalan
Eivissa
( Catalan pronunciation:  [əiˈβisə] , locally
[əiˈvisə] ). The name in

approximation of the Spanish ( /ɪˈbiːθə, ɪˈviːθə/ ), [ 1 ]

the pronunciation is more
anglicized, or closer to
Latin-American Spanish
( /ɪˈbiːzə/ , [ 2 ]
/iːˈbiːsə/ [ 3 ] ). [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
The island is well-known for its summer club parties which attract
large numbers of tourists, but the island and the Spanish Tourist Office
have been working in order to promote more family-oriented tourism. [ 6 ]
Noted clubs include
Space ,
Pacha ,
Privilege
(ex Ku),
Amnesia ,
DC10 , Eden, El Divino,
Es
Paradis , and
Café del Mar . [ 7 ]
It is also home to the legendary "port" in the district of Ibiza, a
popular stop for many tourists. [ 7 ]
