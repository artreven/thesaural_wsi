Biography
Personal life
Armin van Buuren was born in
Leiden ,
Netherlands
on December 25, 1976 but grew up in
Koudekerk aan den Rijn . He finished
high school in 1995, and left for college to study law. While studying
law, van Buuren's interest for making music blossomed, and he began
working as a DJ in a local club called Nexus. As his musical career
began to take off, he put his law degree on hold, although he finished
law school eventually.
On 18 September 2009 Armin married Erika van Thiel in
Wassenaar ,
Netherlands .
They met during a vacation on
Crete , and
had been together for 9 years prior to the marriage.
As a producer
van Buuren has always had his own studio and worked alone in the
beginning of his career. Since the release of his third studio album
Imagine
from
2008
he has
been working with
Benno de Goeij
of
Rank 1
on
all solo productions and remixes.
Since 1995, van Buuren has released many tracks on different labels
with increasing success. His first big success was "Blue Fear" which was
on Cyber Records at the age of 19.
This 'Euro Trance blueprint' made it
into the UK Chart. "Communication" was released on the same label, and
had a huge impact on
Ibiza ,
Spain
in the summer of 1999.
After being signed to
AM
PM Records , this track entered the UK Chart at #18 in 2000. As of
29 September 2008, Armin has won the DJ Award for "Best Trance DJ" at
Ibiza along with other nominees, that of
Tiësto ,
Ferry Corsten
and
Paul
van Dyk .
In the beginning of 1999, van Buuren started his label
Armind
together with United Recordings. The first release, Gig - "One", was
well received.
The second release "Touch Me", under the name
Rising
Star
was signed to
Ministry of Sound
in the UK, before the record was released.
By the time of his third release, Gimmick - "Free" was signed to
R&S Records , van Buuren had managed to make his label
popular very quickly.
Under the surname
Gaia
he released "4
Elements" on Captivating Sounds, a sub-label of
Warner Brothers .
Teaming up with
Tiësto ,
two new projects were born:
Major League
- "Wonder Where You
Are?"
was released on
Black Hole Recordings
and
Alibi
- "Eternity"
was released on Armind. "Eternity" received club and chart success and
was signed to
Paul van Dyk 's imprint
Vandit Records . Another major
collaboration followed this. Together with
Ferry
Corsten , van Buuren recorded a riff-classic titled "Exhale"
for the
System F. album. Released as a single, this track reached gold status
in less than a month.
In 2000, van Buuren started his own Armin van Buuren compilation
series. He managed to find a balance between
progressive ,
techno
and
trance music
styles. His first compilation album,
A State
of Trance
(not to be confused with his weekly
A State of Trance
radio shows), sold more than 10,000 copies
and contains van Buuren's well known remix of
Moogwai , "Viola."
His second album,
Basic
Instinct
featured a new track: "Perpetuous Dreamer" - "The Sound of
Goodbye".
This track entered the Dutch charts in June 2001 at number 26.
Later in the year, the track hit #1 on the
Hot Dance
Music/Club Play
chart. The third album,
In Motion
was released 6
August 2001.
This album contained the real trance sound and was very popular in the
United
States . A fourth album,
Transparence , followed in 2002. In
2003, he worked with such artists such as DJ Seth Alan Fannin throughout
a global tour on Dance Revolution in
Europe ,
selling out to crowds of 20,000 people in Armin's home country of the
Netherlands.
In March 2001, van Buuren started his own radio show on
ID&T
Radio. In this weekly two-hour show, entitled
A State of Trance , he plays the latest popular trance
music tracks. His show and the artists he features are popularized by
publishing the artists and track titles on
his website . This radio-show/website combination has
proven popular internationally. When ID&T Radio changed genres in
2004, van Buuren left and took
A State of Trance
with him. The
show then moved to Fresh FM, a Dutch radio station. It is now a weekly
feature on SLAM!FM, another Dutch radio station, DI.FM, an online radio
station, and on
XM Satellite Radio , channel 82 in the
United
States
and
Canada . A complete list of stations that broadcast
A
State of Trance
can be found at the ASOT section of Armin's
website. Also in 2004, van Buuren remixed the
24
theme song into a trance hit.
In June 2005, the 200th
episode was celebrated in
Amsterdam
and subsequently aired on radio. The 250th (8 hour) anniversary episode
was celebrated in Club Asta in
The
Hague ,
Netherlands , featuring van Buuren, Jonas Steur,
M.I.K.E. ,
John Askew,
Rank 1
and
Menno de Jong .
