The Long Awaited Second Year Batch Trip to Hanthana

Aah...! I'm back at my blog for the first time in 2012.. wow! what should I say?  :O  Once again I proved to myself to be a genius at doing LONG-WAY-BACKS. Really for the last few months It was like I was suffering from
Amnesia . I had almost forgotten about the blog, but thanks to our second year batch trip I was cured :-)
So just like our first year batch trip, this was also a hike. Our journey started from the uni of Pera after having listened to both presidents of the students' union and the explorers' club and blah blah blah (most of us considered the speeches were more like something close to greasy liquid fatty stuff 8-) ) it was about 11.00am when we started our journey.
Actually something important was done before starting the hike which we hadn't done last time. Some of us were separated into two groups as head and tail of the hike and were assigned specific tasks. I became one of the tail guys. We were supposed to maintain our formation till the end of the hike.
Oh.. Man!! So much to tell.. I'm gonna make this real short..!
Hanthana is a mountain range which consists of 7 mountains and out of that 7 we were supposed to climb 5 of them. We were able to go half way of the first mountain by the bus and then on foot. Unfortunately we didn't reach the peak of first mountain since our guides thought it would pass midnight to climb down considering our pace (That wasn't quite true u know). So we just went round to the first mountain when the peak was even clearly visible and reached  the second where there was a tea plantation. From there on it was a peak to peak journey.
Have a look at some of the photos of the journey. Some of them were taken by my friends.
Up there is the peak of the second mountain......
Walk through the peaks....
From the peak of the fourth mountain....
This is one hell of a sight!!
It's the tail baby ya hoo!!

At the last peak we spent a restful relaxing moment with a freezing wind (felt like almost minus Celsius). It was about 6pm. Then started descending from the peak where there were radio towers(Those radio towers are clearly visible to Kandy town). It was about 8.30 when we, the tail people finished climbing down.
So there goes our hike. To be honest this was not so tough as the last time when we climbed Haagala mountains and not to mention but being the tail people we were a bit unable to enjoy the scenery and the nature. And of course there were no quitters as the last time; one of the duties of the tail guys was to make that happen. Oh! there were some girls whom to be reminded of using common sense to dress properly to a hike
: D and that's it, one successful enjoyable batch trip....
PS:
Oh no! I almost forgot about the rain and the leeches. Guys from the explorers' club said we were so damn lucky that it didn't rain very much as other days, just had a few drops for a minute or two. And leeches, they didn't give us any trouble at all, well few of them did but it was not so serious. There's one thing I would never ever forget, one guy from the explorers' club who happened to be with us, in the tail took one of the vampire like blood sucking wormy creatures and kept it on his palm and said this one looks really beautiful :P  (He really meant it u know) man...! I felt like throwing up :D

I wanted to get lost there too u know!! :D :D Actually we were supposed to go there in first year, but there was something to do with our seniors with Pera. Instead we climbed Haagala mountains which is located in Sabaragumawa(owned by the uni of Sabare) ans it was really awesome too u know! Delete Reply Dude July 18, 2012 at 9:26 PM Kasun. This is cool.

All we got in Colombo is buildings with concrete and cement :'(
I wish i could be there too... But on second thought, it says admiration from a distance adds more value than being close :) Delete Reply Add comment Load more...
