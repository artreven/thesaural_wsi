Monthly Reading Roundup
River Thames
(Morning September)
Buscot , Gloucestershire - Charles Neal
Here we are headed into October (one of my favorite months).  It's hard to believe.  Here in
Berkeley
the summer was long and cool and foggy, but September has been day after day of hot weather.  I'm glad it's winding down and looking forward to rain this weekend.
I read a lot of great stuff this month and reviewed much of it, although I'm still a bit behind on reviews - hoping to catch up before I deluge you all with an end of the year torrent of reviews.  Work has been intense the past few months and cutting into my writing time.
In the meantime, here's what I reviewed in September:
Book Review - Before I Go to Sleep by S.J. Watson
Book Review - Mice by Gordon Reece
Book Review - The Most Dangerous Thing by Laura Li...
Book Review - Winter's Bone by Daniel Woodrell
Book Review - Ready Player One by Ernest Cline
Book Review - Welcome to Hoxford by Ben Templesmit...
Book Review - The Midnight Gate by Helen Stringer
Book Review - A Dance with Dragons by George R.R. ...
I also talked a lot about food:
Let's Talk about Pig - Pork Schnitzel
Let's Talk about Mussels
Let's Talk about Corn
Let's Talk about Watermelon
Standout books reviewed in September are
Winter's Bone ,
Welcome to Hoxford , and
George R.R. Martin 's latest - if you haven't read him you're missing out.
Here's to the true arrival of Fall - one of my favorite seasons.

Book Review - Before I Go to Sleep by S.J. Watson
Synopsis :  'As I sleep, my mind will erase everything I did today. I will wake up tomorrow as I did this morning. Thinking I'm still a child. Thinking I have a whole lifetime of choice ahead of me ...' Memories define us. So what if you lost yours every time you went to sleep? Your name, your identity, your past, even the people you love - all forgotten overnight. And the one person you trust may only be telling you half the story. Welcome to Christine's life.
First Line :  "The bedroom is strange."
Random Quote :  "Dr. Nash called me almost as soon as Ben left for work.  He reminded me about my journal and then - once he had told me that he would be picking me up later to take me for my scan - I read it.  There were a few things I could perhaps recall, and maybe whole passages I could remember writing.  It was as if some residue of memory had survived the night."
Greta Garbo in
As You Desire Me
Review :
Amnesia
is a classic condition for a thriller.  What would it be like to wake up every day and know nothing about who you are, what's in your past, where you live, your husband's name (assuming he is your husband), your age - everything up for grabs every morning?  This is scary for a lot of reasons, including the level of dependency it would inflict upon its sufferers.
S.J. Watson's debut thriller,
Before I Go to Sleep , mines this territory for all its worth.  The suspense is tightly woven, the writing is quite good, it all works in all the ways a good thriller should.  Best of all, is the overwhelming sense of paranoia that the book creates from the very first words - a sense that ratchets up throughout the book until by the end you're still not really sure what is real and what's fabricated.
Watson takes a familiar theme and turns out a well-written character study filled with suspense, paranoia, and pure terror.  Be forewarned, once you start reading this you won't be able to put it down.  I missed
BART
stops twice while reading this and had to get off and take the train back to my destination.  Great read.

Book Review - Mice by Gordon Reece
Synopsis :  Shelley and her mom have been menaced long enough. Excused from
high school
where a trio of bullies nearly killed her, and still reeling from her parents' humiliating divorce, Shelley has retreated with her mother to the quiet of Honeysuckle Cottage in the countryside. Thinking their troubles are over, they revel in their cozy, secure life of gardening and books, hot chocolate and Brahms by the fire. But on the eve of Shelley's sixteenth birthday, an unwelcome guest disturbs their peace and something inside Shelley snaps. What happens next will shatter all their certainties-about their safety, their moral convictions, the limits of what they are willing to accept, and what they're capable of.
First Line :  "My mum and I lived in a cottage about half an hour outside town."
Random Quote :  "He walked past us, carrying the red sports bag, its sides straining to contain all the objects he'd stuffed inside.  It seemed he'd grabbed anything that had come to hand - I could even see the family-sized bottle of shampoo from the bathroom protruding from one of the zippered side pockets."
Review :  I wanted to like
Mice
a whole lot more than I did.  It starts out well with a well-paced inexorable description of a high school girl being
bullied
- from verbal abuse to
physical assault .  This piece of the book felt connected and real - you could sense the emotional involvement of the writer.  The bullying is the preceding set of events that lead to the out of the way cottage and the events that follow.  It's when we get to the cottage that things become dull and disconnected.  You can feel the author stepping back.
English Cottage
The
violence
in the book is extreme.  I don't mind violence in a book, but I want it to be necessary to the story.  The violence in the first part of the book is necessary, the violence in the second part of the book trips over into the unnecessary category quickly.
There is an attempt at a connection between the violence experienced by the young Shelley and the violence that she and her mother go on to commit, but the connection is tenuous, at best.  There is plenty of suspense and horror, but mostly of the direct-to-video
slasher movie
variety.  Overall the book stands on the sidelines, shows us the icky stuff it found under the rock in the playground, and wanders off with neither commitment nor context.

In My Mailbox Monday
Mailboxes -
Long Island, NY
In September, Mailbox Monday is hosted by
Amused by Books . In My Mailbox is hosted by
The Story Siren .  These are the places where we
brag about
share the books that arrived in our mailboxes each week.  As always, I try to find a mailbox that is somehow associated with what I'm reading right now.  I'm reading Holy Ghosts by Gary Jensen, a book about a haunting that takes place in
Rockville Centre, NY
on Long Island.  The mailboxes are from
Long Island City, New York .  For some reason this is what Long Island looks like in my head (I've never been there), even though I know that the area is very picturesque.  I guess I find urban picturesque.
Once again my books came from publishers:
Darwen Arkwright and the Peregrine Pact
by
A.J. Hartley .  Eleven-year-old Darwen Arkwright has spent his whole life in a tiny town in
England . So when he is forced to move to
Atlanta, Georgia , to live with his aunt, he knows things will be different - but what he finds there is beyond even his wildest imaginings!  Darwen discovers an enchanting world through the old mirror hanging in his closet - a world that holds as many dangers as it does wonders. Scrobblers on motorbikes with nets big enough to fit a human boy. Gnashers with no eyes, but monstrous mouths full of teeth. Flittercrakes with bat-like bodies and the faces of men. Along with his new friends Rich and Alexandra, Darwen becomes entangled in an adventure and a mystery that involves the safety of his entire school. They soon realize that the creatures are after something in our world - something that only human children possess.
Pharmacology
by Christopher Herz .  1993.
San Francisco . The digital and pharmaceutical industries are booming. They're looking for the young, the hip, and those on the counterculture fringe to be both the face and consumer of their new world order. Recruited by an advertising agency focused on targeting a new drug to her own age demographic, Sarah Striker is grateful for the steady income, but begins to question the side effects of the products she's pushing.  Sarah begins publishing an underground 'zine to expose the secrets behind the pharmaceutical industry's aims. Fulfilled by her quest to spread the truth, her new life seems to be working out perfectly—until she realizes that she herself is perilously close to becoming a victim of this new corporate world.
Holy Ghosts
by Gary Jensen .  In this extraordinary true story, the haunting of a Long Island household forces a respected writer and editor to reevaluate the mysteries of life and death as he struggles with the frightening truths of his childhood home and his town's past.
Miller, Bukowski & Their Enemies:  Essays on Contemporary Culture
by Guillermo O'Joyce.   An extraordinary collection of essays on literature and contemporary culture. Gripping, irreverent, smart and entirely original. Passionate about literature, O'Joyce frequently goes out of his way to antagonize a literary establishment that places profit and political correctness before artistic vision.

Let's Talk about Pig - Pork Schnitzel
Piglet
Ah, the pleasures of the pig - from snout to tail this noble beast provides us with delicious eating.  Bacon,
pork
belly, pork loin, pork chops, hams of all kinds, ribs, sausages - the bounty is endless.  One of the more unfortunate things in recent times is the tendency for corporate farming to breed pigs lean, thus removing much of its flavor.
My husband teases me about my wanting to only eat the piggies that were kissed on their noses every morning, but as with vegetables so with pork - that raised in sustainable ways, raised on the open on the food they regularly eat, and with no hormones and antibiotics just tastes better.  And yes, at the very least I hope they all had their noses kissed daily.
Schnitzel is a traditional Austrian dish made with boneless meat thinned with a mallet.  The Viennese typically use veal ( Wiener Schnitzel ), although pork is used more and more and is most common in Germany.  There are many variations all over the world, but perhaps the best way to think of it in American terms is as breaded pork cutlets.
I get really hungry for these year-round.  The preparation is messy, but simple and there's something so very comforting about them.  The last time I made them we ate steamed broccoli and baked sweet potatoes as sides, but they're great with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut or
German potato salad , spaetzle, herbed egg noodles, sweet and sour red cabbage - the list goes on and on.
Pork cutlets
Some people claim that schnitzel is heavy, but I've never found it to be so.  It's even less likely to be heavy if you substitute regular
bread crumbs
with
panko .  Here's the recipe I use (it's from the
75th Anniversary Edition of The Joy of Cooking ):
Schnitzel!
Schnitzel
Preheat the oven to 180 degrees.  Have ready an ovenproof platter.  Season:
1 lb. cutlets pounded to slightly less than 1/4 inch thick
with:
Salt and
black pepper
Spread on a plate:
1/2 cup
all-purpose flour
Beat together in a shallow bowl:
2 large eggs
1 tbs milk
Spread on another plate:
2 cups bread crumbs (any kind will do, but I like panko)
Dredge the meat lightly in the flour mixture and shake off the excess.  Dip into the egg mixture, then coat with the crumbs, pressing down on the crumbs slightly to help them adhere to the veail.  Heat in a large skillet over medium-high heat:
3 tbs vegetable or butter or a combination or as needed
Cook the cutlets in batches, being careful not to crowd the pan, until nicely browned, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes each side.  Remove to paper towels to drain as they brown, then keep warm on the platter in the oven, and add more oil or butter to the pan as needed.  Sprinkle the cutlets with:
Salt and pepper to taste
Serve with:
Lemon wedges
You can make these with veal or pork.  If you add a fried egg on top they become Schnitzel a la Holstein.  Use beef round and they become
Chicken Fried Steak
(don't forget to make
white gravy
with lots of pepper for these).  The kitchen will be a mess, but it'll be worth it.

Book Review - The Most Dangerous Thing by Laura Lippman
Synopsis :  Some secrets can’t be kept. . .
Years
ago, they were all the best of friends. But as time passed and
circumstances changed, they grew apart, became adults with families of
their own, and began to forget about the past—and the terrible lie they
all shared. But now Gordon, the youngest and wildest of the five, has
died and the others are thrown together for the first time in years. And
then the revelations start. Could their long-ago lie be the reason for
their troubles today? Each one of these old friends has to wonder if
their secret has been discovered—and if someone within the circle is out
to destroy them.
First Line :  " They throw him out when he falls off the barstool. "
Random Quote :  "Anyway, the primary rule, in those days before cell phones, was that we had to stay within shouting distance of Gwen's house.  But what was shooting distance?  How far could sound carry?  Whose lung power dictated the range?  We would sometimes tell Go-Go to let the rest of us walk ahead for five minutes or so, then bellow.  We could always hear Go-Go, so we kept going."
Review :
The Most Dangerous Thing
is a weekend kind of book.  It's the kind of book you want to pick up on Friday after work so you can read late into the night and through the weekend.  Ms.
Lippman
is a dependable writer of thrillers set in the
Baltimore
area - from her Tess Monaghan series to her many standalones.  She writes well, her stories are always interesting and filled with questions.  These are the things I want from a thriller - lots of questions and don't let me figure out the ending within ten pages.
Ms. Lippman has said this is the most autobiographical of her novels.  Within it a car wreck brings childhood friends from the seventies back together in their Baltimore neighborhood.  Theirs was a childhood of independence, games, and playing in the large wood in Leakin Park behind their neighborhood.  Anyone who has read
Little Red Riding Hood
knows that woods always contain the potential for serious danger and this wood is no exception.
Hodnot Spring House, Leakin Park, Baltimore, MD
In the aftermath of the death of one their number, these friends must come to terms with each other, their choices, and their paths.  Whether or not they do so is up for grabs.  The story and the relationships are compelling, although the pace loses some momentum as the book progresses.  One clear and very sad thing that this books explicates is the consequence of compromise - of settling for less in life, of doing what is expected, of using up all your ability to take risk too soon in life.  These are adults who settled for adulthood rather than choosing to take the risks to be happy in their lives.
This book and the tangled sad lives within it make me think back to a quote from
Fight Club
by
Chuck Palahniuk
- "This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time."  Words to live by if you want to keep a healthy perspective on the consequences of your choices (or lack of choosing).  One minute at a time.

In My Mailbox Monday
Venetian Palace Mailbox circa 1600s
In September, Mailbox Monday is hosted by
Amused by Books . In My Mailbox is hosted by
The Story Siren .  These are the places where we
brag about
share the books that arrived in our mailboxes each week.  As always, I try to find a mailbox that is somehow associated with what I'm reading right now.  I'm just finishing
The Lies of Locke Lamora
by Scott Lynch.  It has a world built on a sort of alternate universe/alternate history Venice, so I found a Venetian mailbox today.
Both books this week came from publishers:
The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes
by
Arthur Conan Doyle .  Sherlock Holmes, the world's best-known and most-loved fictional detective, is more popular today than ever. This collection presents many of the most familiar cases Holmes and his assistant,
Dr. Watson , ever solve, including "Silver Blaze," "The Greek Interpreter," and " The Musgrave Ritual ." As Holmes's fame grows, it brings him notoriety that piques the ire of London's criminal underworld, who begin to scheme against him. It is in " The Final Problem " that Dr. Watson relates the grisly, fatal, and shocking tale of how Holmes finally meets his match, encountering the diabolical Professor Moriarty in a terrible struggle at
Reichenbach Falls .
Harbor
by
John Ajvide Lindqvist .  From the author of the international and
New York Times bestseller
Let the Right One In (Let Me In)
comes this stunning and terrifying book which begins when a man's six-year-old daughter vanishes.One ordinary winter afternoon on a snowy island, Anders and Cecilia take their six-year-old daughter Maja across the ice to visit the lighthouse in the middle of the frozen channel. While the couple explore the lighthouse, Maja disappears -- either into thin air or under thin ice -- leaving not even a footprint in the snow. Two years later, alone and more or less permanently drunk, Anders returns to the island to regroup. He slowly realises that people are not telling him all they know; even his own mother, it seems, is keeping secrets. What is happening in Domaro, and what power does the sea have over the town's inhabitants?
What came in your mailbox this week?  Did you buy yourself any presents or get any presents from the literary dieties?

Abandonment Issues
Krampnitz Russian Barracks in
Germany
(a tank training school - now abandoned)
This is a semi-regular feature where I confess to the books I put down.  In a way it's celebratory because it's taken me most of my adult life to give myself permission not to read every word of every book that comes into my hands.  It's liberating to stop doing that because the reading experience becomes even more personal and pleasurable as you sift through what works for you and what doesn't.  I hate a lot of things other people love and love a lot of things that a lot of people love, and a fair amount of things that most people wouldn't spend 10 minutes with - that's the cool thing about reading - it's a constant choose your own adventure game.
So, here's what I put down recently:
Death in the City of Light:  The Serial Killer of Nazi-Occupied Paris by David King .  I was excited to get this book with its comparisons to the writing of
Erik Larson .  I really like quality true crime where the crime is placed within the context of its place and time.  Erik Larson does this really well so I was really hoping that was another author in the same genre.  Plus
serial killer
in Nazi-occupied Paris - how cool and eerie is that?  The crimes and the search for the serial killer are definitely detailed with some additional information about the place and time.  However, the writing was so dry that I just couldn't care and abandoned about a third of the way in.  Very disappointing.
The Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollock .  This book definitely suffered because I read it right after
Winter's Bone .  I was still looking for something redneck (for lack of a better term) and this seemed a good prospect.  Well-written, but too disjointed to really hold together as a novel.  It's dark and violent (that's not a problem), but I need a novel to hang together as a novel and this just didn't.  Ultimately its brutality was just boring for me.
At the Devil's Table:  The Untold Story of the Insider Who Brought Down the Cali Cartel by William C. Rempel .  This should have been a fast-paced popular history book on the
Cali Cartel
side of the
Colombian
drug wars and I suppose it must have been, although it wasn't fast-paced enough to keep my attention.  It's decent narrative, but it sort of plods along and definitely suffers from being nowhere near as good as
News of a Kidnapping
by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.  It's probably not fair to compare the two, but I've decided that for me,
News of a Kidnapping
is the definitive word on the predations and destructiveness of the Colombian drug war.  Just not the book for me.

Let's Talk about Mussels
Mussels
clinging to tidal rocks -
Cabrillo National Monument
I am a huge fan of just about everything shellfish - oysters, clams, cab, lobsters, and definitely mussels.
Mussels are in the clam family, but have an elongated and asymmetrical shell.  The exterior of the shell is black and the interior is silvery and pearl-like.  Mussels are eaten all over the world in many different ways.  In Belgium and France with
french fries
or bread.  In
The Netherlands
they are fried.  In Italy they are mixed with other seafood (think fruit de mers) or with pasta.  In Spain they are mostly steam-cooked.  In Turkey they are covered in flour and fried or stuffed with rice and served cold.  In Ireland they boil them and season with vinegar.  In the Cantonese parts of China they cook in a broth of garlic and fermented black bean.  In New Zealand they're served with spicy vinaigrettes.  As you can see they are adaptable to almost any cuisine or cooking methodology.  Most popular are smoking, boiling, steaming, roasting, barbecue, and fried in butter.  Personally, I'm on board with all these methodologies.
Mussels steaming in a pan
There are some important things to know when dealing with mussels because they require a bit of work.  Mussels must be thoroughly cleaned and rinsed several times before cooking.
Wild mussels will need to be scrubbed with a stiff brush to remove any barnacles, sand or grit and their beard must also be removed. This can be done by giving the beard a forceful tug with your fingers and pulling it away or by cutting it off with a small and sharp knife.
Rinse the wild mussels several times but do not let them sit in water, as freshwater will kill them.
Farmed mussels will have already been prepared for cooking and it will suffice to just give them a quick rinse under a running tap of cold water.
Once the mussels have been thoroughly cleaned, remove and discard any
shells that are open or broken and that do not close when tapped. When mussels are taken out of water their shells close tight, those who have open shells before being cooked are dead and unpalatable.  As you cook mussels the shells open revealing the gorgeous flesh inside.
Mussels don't need a lot of liquid for steaming and cook quickly.  When cooking, add at the last moment, in order to
prevent over-cooking. Over cooked mussels are quite tasteless, rubbery
and a bit of a let down.
Classic French mussels with saffron and
white wine
sauce
I've always eaten mussels.  I've eaten them in many different ways, but my favorite is the way the French cook them - steaming them with wine, garlic, shallots, parsley, and butter.  My favorite version of this adds heavy cream and is divine.
When I was living in Seattle I was very broke most of the time.  A treat for me was a bottle of cheap nail polish in some silly color (it's amazing how indulged this can make you feel).  I used to set aside a little money and once a month I would go to a restaurant near work and have raw oysters or I would go to a restaurant near where I lived and have mussels in the cream sauce with crusty
French bread
for dipping.  They were always amazing.
Here's a recipe for the mussels I like - the recipe and photo is courtesy of
The Food Network :
Classic French Mussels
Classic French Mussels Ingredients 3 tablespoons
extra-virgin olive oil
2 shallots, finely chopped
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 pounds mussels, cleaned
1 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup heavy cream
4 tablespoons
unsalted butter , cut into pieces
1/2 bunch fresh parsley, chopped
Kosher salt
Crusty bread , to serve
Directions Heat the olive oil in a large pot over
medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic and cook until softened,
about 5 minutes. Add the mussels, wine, cream, butter, and parsley and
season well with salt. Give it a good stir, cover the pot, and cook
until mussels open and are cooked through, about 10 to 15 minutes.
Divide the mussels and the juices between 2 bowls and serve with the
crusty bread.
A variation on this is to flavor with saffron and mint rather than parsley. Replace the parsley with 1 pinch of saffron threads, soaked for 30 minutes in 1 tbs of water and 25 fresh mint leaves.  Saffron always makes me think of fennel and you could definitely add a bit, as well.
This is very easy to make, is absolutely wonderful and comforting, and easy to vary as noted above.  You can even add bacon and who doesn't love that?  Try it - you won't be sorry!

Book Review - Winter's Bone by Daniel Woodrell
Synopsis :  The
sheriff's deputy
at the front door brings hard news to Ree Dolly. Her father has skipped bail on charges that he ran a
crystal meth
lab, and the Dollys will lose their house if he doesn't show up for his next court date.
Ree's father has disappeared before. The Dolly clan has worked the shadowy side of the law for generations, and arrests (and attempts to avoid them) are part of life in Rathlin Valley. But the house is all they have, and Ree's father would never forfeit it to the bond company unless something awful happened. With two young brothers depending on her and a mother who's entered a kind of second childhood, Ree knows she has to bring her father back, dead or alive, or else see her family turned out into the unforgiving cold.
Sixteen-year-old Ree, who has grown up in the harsh poverty of the
Ozarks , learns quickly that asking questions of the rough Dolly clan can be a fatal mistake. She perseveres past obstacles of every kind and finally confronts the top figures in the family's hierarchy.
Along the way to a shocking revelation, Ree discovers unexpected depths in herself and in a family network that protects its own at any cost.
First Line :  "Ree Dolly stood at break of day on her cold front steps and smelled coming flurries and saw meat. "
Random Quote :  "Jessup, her father, had not set by a fat woodpile nor split what there was for the potbelly before he went down the steep yard to his blue Capri and bounced away on the rut road. He had not set food by nor money, but promised he’d be back soon as he could with a paper sack of cash and a trunkload of delights. Jessup was a broken-faced, furtive man given to uttering quick pleading promises that made it easier for him to walk out the door and be gone, or come back inside and be forgiven."
Review :  I came to this book in a roundabout way.  Usually I read books, they make movies, and I might or might not watch them.  In the case of
Winter's Bone , I heard a lot about the
movie
and kept thinking, "I should see that," and then never getting around to it.  It's that whole life thing, it can really get in the way.
I was listening to
NPR
and a feature they've run all summer about memorable movie locations.  On the Friday afternoon that I was listening, I heard this gorgeous mountain music coming from the headphones into my ears.  It was pure and hardscrabble, assured and heartfelt and I fell in love in an instant.  So I paid attention to the story.  It was about the movie
Winter's Bone
and the location where it was filmed including lots of interviews with the man who made filming there possible.  It was beautiful and I played it twice more before deciding that I was going to go home, find out if the movie was streaming on
Netflix , and watch it that very night.  It was and I did and I loved it - loved the way it captured the life of the rural poor and the community and just the look and feel of the Ozarks - a place that is in many ways off the maps, out of time, and unapproachably gorgeous.
When I finished watching the movie I got up from the couch and ordered the book immediately because I knew I had to read it and I really wanted to own it.  It came and I devoured it with equal parts joy and sadness.
Winter's Bone has it all as a novel - a young woman's coming of age in harsh surroundings, a mystery that is dangerous to discover, a desperate quest for answers, and an extended family that epitomizes the
Southern Gothic .  These are desperate people doing this best they can with what they've got.  First it was moonshine, then it was pot, and these days methamphetamine - the cooking, using, and distributing of it with all the danger and sadness that marks communities touched by its crystal fingers.
Ree and Uncle Teardrop (Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes)
The main character, Ree, is absolutely admirable and completely compelling in her desperation.  Her choices may seem unwise, but within the context of her place, her time, and the reality of her situation she doggedly does what needs to be done, even when it's ugly, even when it's life-threatening.  There are no real heroics here, at least not in the sense that we usually think of heroics.  Instead there is cold-eyed pragmatism at the heart of all of the choices available to all of the characters in this book and that feels real.  This isn't a message book, it isn't feel-good, it's an unalloyed tale of troubles brought down on a family with very few options.
Daniel Woodrell
is a fine craftsman with both language and storytelling.  He is spare and judicious and there are passages in this book that give me goosebumps even thinking about the way they are written and the utter simple beauty of the craft even when the telling isn't so pretty.  Woodrell evokes the sense of place and outside of time and harsh reality within the broader storytelling tradition that is as old as we've been upright.  This book is pitch perfect.
Best of all is the relationship that develops between Ree and her Uncle Teardrop - her father's older brother.  He's the quiet frightening one with the reputation that delivers on the promise his looks make.  Ree is scared of him and should be.  He's a scary man.  Best of all is that he is a scary man who is also a tragedy.  The waste of potential and ability that is set upon people with no options is writ large across his life.  I couldn't help but fall in love with him a little even as I knew what a bad idea that would be.
People within this community earn and keep their place the hardest way.  The rules are set in stone and the myth of family and family honor is locked into life, even though it isn't always evident in reality.  Everyone here is trapped and surviving.  Everyone here has hundreds of years of tradition that dictates how to do that.  Everyone here has honor so long as you can see that through the context of the community and its traditions.
Meerab (played by Dale Dickey) - One of the community's three Fates
I wouldn't say this book is necessarily uplifting or inspiring or ends on a bright note with a hopeful future.  Its clear ties to
Antigone 's tale telegraph to the reader that the story won't be pretty and it won't end the way you'd like.  Like
Sophocles , Woodrell draws the reader into the heart of tragedy and doesn't let go.  There is no looking away.  There is what's there in all its tragic, heartbreaking glory.
One of the best books I've read in years.  Brilliant, beautiful, and harsh as ice.
FTC Disclosure :  I bought it and I'm keeping it.

Book Review - Ready Player One by Ernest Cline
Synopsis :  It’s the year 2044, and the real world is an ugly place.
Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets.
And like most of humanity, Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this
virtual world . For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune—and remarkable power—to whoever can unlock them.
For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday’s riddles are based in the
pop culture
he loved—that of the late twentieth century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday’s icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes’s oeuvre, playing
Pac-Man , or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig.
And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle.
Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt—among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to life—and love—in the real world he’s always been so desperate to escape.
A world at stake.
A quest for the ultimate prize.
Are you ready?
First Line :  "Everyone my age remembers where they were and what they were doing when they first heard about the contest."
Random Quote :  "At a time of drastic social and cultural upheaval, when most of the world's population longed for an escape from reality, the OASIS provided it, in a form that was cheap, legal, safe, and not (medically proven to be) addictive.  The ongoing energy crisis contributed greatly to the OASIS's runaway popularity."
Review :
Ready Player One
is a gamer book.  It's full of '80's trivia and particularly old gaming trivia, but you don't have to be a gamer to enjoy it.  I say this because I am a lifelong gamer and I am instantly suspicious of anything that purports to be about gaming because 99.9% of the time there are fundamental things wrong that glare out in distracting ways and ruin the whole experience.  I know, very doctrinaire, but it's gaming - it's a way of life.  Seriously.
Ready Player One
delivers the pop culture geeky punch and does a good job of talking about what it's like in big virtual reality communities - whether
MMORPG 's or
Second Life
or the old school (and much smaller) environments of
MUDs
and MOOs.  I found all of these elements in the book spot-on and I loved the gamer history and all the '80's references.
Star Wars Arcade
Game (1983)
All gaming has some basic commonalities.  I often use these to try to help people I work with who don't game understand why I do.  It rarely works, but I keep trying.
Most gaming experiences run along a similar trajectory.  There are quests, some of which add to the storyline and some that drop great loot - if you're lucky, you get a quest that does both.  You do quests to gain experience and gear so you can level up.  It's a very goal oriented activity.  You have objectives, you complete them, you get rewarded.  It gets more and more fun as you level up and then you hit top level and in most games there's not really anything left to do.
Gaming is great for hand/eye coordination, great experience to take into work or school.  It often requires teamwork with people you don't like, helps your strategic and tactical thinking, and gets you through the work day because everything becomes a quest/mission if you have the right kind of imagination.  "Today I will do the leadership presentation quest so I can continue to level up my charisma, endurance, wisdom, and intelligence."  However, like work when you hit the top level of whatever job you're in it gets boring and you're ready to move on.
Space Invaders
(1978)
In many ways
Ready Player One
follows the gaming trajectory and that's kind of unfortunate.  The first half of the book is an outstanding read.  I loved the setup and really loved the interaction between the players and the sense of competition that happens when everyone is pretty low level and still trying to figure out how to survive.  It was sharp, funny, and spoke to my heart.
Unfortunately everyone has to level up and when they do the story gets much less interesting to me.  Yes, there's still a lot of fun in that second half, but it's just not satisfying in the way the first half is.  It's kind of like superheroes - lots of them are really boring because they just don't have enough vulnerabilities and you know they're going to win the day.  There are
big
exceptions to this statement, but ultimately most superheroes are kind of boring to me.
Water rift in
Rifts of Telara
(MMORPG - 2011)
Overall an excellent and fun book.  Mr. Cline can write and his pop culture trivia/history, even in the arcane world of gaming, is spot on.  He gets special props because he's great at covering
all
gaming - single player, pen-and-paper, arcade games, shooters, and virtual reality games of various kinds.  This is a big field and anyone with this much knowledge is probably a serious gamer.
If you're trying to place the book in a genre category, fantasy and/or science fiction and/or dystopian probably work.  Personally, I thought it sounded awesome, but I'm a gamer geek.  We all want more time off from work to play our games so this future sounds pretty perfect.
