0 Attachment Nisar Sahib,
Hayat Sahib,   May Allah Keep you happy for ever,
the beautiful words written by you have strengthened my heart. Around my mother, I am enjoying the
best part of my life these days & the best Ramadan I ever had, and I
told my family members that her sickness is a blessings, it has come down
to purify her & those who are looking after the patient.   After 3 days of terrible stress /
grief at our house when we saw her in
Amnesia , Masha'Allah
that today she asked to pray & it is the most beautiful sign of improvement,
we took her for Wazoo and she prayed Fajar by her own effort.   I am treating her with the
top-ordered medicine of this world, ZamZam, Sadaqah, Duaas, Barley Water,
Frankincense, Barley bread, Olive Oil, Senna+Sanoot, Henna water, and yesterday,
I also performed Hijamah on her head.   Re: My mother
