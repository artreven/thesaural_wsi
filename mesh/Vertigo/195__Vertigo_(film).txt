Tonight, Friday the 13th, is the opening for Hitchcock themed show “Suspense & Gallows Humor” at
Gallery1988
Venice. I’ve always loved the movie
Vertigo
for many reasons, including all of the San Francisco backdrops. Look at all them Jimmy Stewarts.

My piece for the Marvelous Humans show at
Articulated Gallery
in SF. I’ve tackled
ectrodactyly
and the mythology of
Lobster
Boy
before, but I went for a different angle this time. The show is curated by
Creep Machine , and runs until May 3rd.

Catching up!!!
Friday, April 13th, 2012
It’s been a busy couple of months and I’ve been lagging on the news section here, let’s try to catch up eh?
First off, although the show has already passed, here is my piece for the 2nd annual “Is This Thing On?” show at
Gallery1988 . The show is dedicated to comedic talents, and I chose
Howard
and
Kulap
from the hilarious podcast, “ Who Charted? “. It’s one of my favs. If you are not listening to it, you should. It will make your day.
