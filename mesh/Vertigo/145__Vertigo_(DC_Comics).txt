FABULOUS - GRANT MORRISON
fabulous , originalmente cargada por
istolethetv . Grant Morrison  (born January 31, 1960) is a  Scottish   comic book  writer and artist. He is best-known for his  nonlinear   narratives  and counter-cultural  leanings. In 2000, Morrison's graphic novel  JLA:Earth 2  was released with art by  Frank Quitely . It was Morrison's last mainstream work for DC for a while, as he moved to  Marvel Comics  to take over the writing of  X-Men  (which was renamed  New X-Men  for his run), with Quitely providing much of the art. Again, Morrison's revamping of a major superhero team proved to be a critical and commercial success [ citation needed ] . However, his penultimate arc, 'Planet X', is the subject of much controversy [ citation needed ] . In it he depicted the classic villain Magneto infiltrating, in the guise of new character  Xorn , and defeating the X-Men, as he became a raving lunatic (the result of an addiction to the power-enhancing drug "Kick"). This has since been  retconned  by other writers and Morrison's Xorn is said to be a new character distinct from Magneto. Morrison in 2006 Morrison had one more project for Vertigo during this time:  The Filth , drawn by  Chris Weston  and  Gary Erskine , a 13-part mini-series, said by Warren Ellis to be heavily influenced by  Chris Morris 's  Blue Jam  radio series. Morrison also wrote the six-part  Marvel Boy  series, as well as  Fantastic Four: 1234 , his take on another major superhero team. Morrison helped challenge Marvel's reputation for being closed to new ideas [ citation needed ] , but after finishing his  New X-Men , he returned to DC Comics to work on several titles and help revamp the DC Universe. Starting in 2004, Vertigo published three Morrison mini-series.  Seaguy ,  We3  and  Vimanarama  involve, respectively, a  picaresque  hero in a post-utopian world that doesn't need him; cyber-enhanced pets running from their captors in what Morrison calls his "western manga"; and ancient  Hindu / Pakistani myths translated into  Jack Kirby -style adventures.  We3  came in for particular praise for its bold storytelling techniques and artwork by Frank Quitely. Morrison also returned to the JLA with the first story in a new anthology series,  JLA Classified , tales set within the JLA mythos by various creative teams. In 2005, DC Comics started publishing what was dubbed the first ever "megaseries". The Grant Morrison-scripted  Seven Soldiers  features both new characters and reimagined obscure DC characters:  The Manhattan Guardian ,  Mister Miracle ,  Klarion the Witch Boy ,  Bulleteer ,  Frankenstein ,  Zatanna and  Shining Knight . The maxi-series consists of seven interlinked four-issue  miniseries  with two "bookend" volumes — 30 issues in all. Dan DiDio  (current editorial vice president of DC Comics) was impressed with Morrison's ideas for revamped characters. Giving him the unofficial title of "revamp guy", DiDio asked him to assist in sorting out the DC Universe in the wake of the  Infinite Crisis . Morrison was also one of the writers on  52 , a yearlong weekly comic book series that started in May 2006 and concluded in May 2007. In November 2005, DC started publishing a new  ongoing   Superman  series, starting with a twelve-issue story arc by Morrison and Frank Quitely. Called  All Star Superman , the series is not so much a revamp or  reboot  of Superman, but presents an out-of-continuity "iconic" Superman for new readers. All Star Superman won the 2006 Eisner Award for Best New Series, the Best Continuing Series Eisner Award in 2007 and several Eagle Awards in the UK. It also won 3 Harvey Awards in 2008 and is nominated for another Eisner in 2009. In the same year, Morrison and Quitely worked on pop star  Robbie Williams ' album  Intensive Care , providing intricate  Tarot  card designs for the packaging and cover of the CD. In  2006  Morrison was voted as the #2 favorite comic book writer of all time by  Comic Book Resources , beating  Neil Gaiman  at #3. (Alan Moore was #1.) That same year, Morrison began writing  Batman  for DC with  issue #655 , continuing to be the series writer into 2008. As well, he authored the relaunches of  The Authority  and  Wildcats  (with the art of  Gene Ha  and  Jim Lee respectively) for DC's  Wildstorm  imprint. However, neither have seen a release for several years and are still on hiatus, with a fill in Authority mini-series having been run. At the  2007   San Diego Comic-Con , DC Comics announced that Morrison would write  Final Crisis , a seven issue mini-series slated to appear in 2008. Artist  J. G. Jones  will draw the series. Morrison also says that later in 2008 he will hand over the follow-up to 2004's  Seaguy  called  Seaguy 2: The Slaves of Mickey Eye , the second part of a planned three part series (now released from April 2009). At the "Spotlight on Grant Morrison" panel, part of the 2008  New York Comic Con , Morrison revealed that  Wildcats  would continue when Jim Lee was ready but  The Authority' s future is less certain: "Authority was just a disaster." It was running late and conflicted with the start of  52  but the last straw was when he read the reviews: "I said fuck it." Wildstorm editor  Ben Abernathy  has said the problems were caused by a perfect storm of events, but both series will get finished -  Keith Giffen  will be completing the twelve-issue run on  The Authority . At NYCC Morrison also announced a new title coming in 2009,  War Cop , which he says is "a very psychedelic thing and it'll be a little bit more back to being me again." At NYCC it was also revealed Morrison would working with  Virgin Comics  to produce "webisodes" (short animated stories) based on the  Mahābhārata ; he said it wouldn't be a direct translation but "Like the Beatles took Indian music and tried to make psychedelic sounds… I'm trying to convert Indian storytelling to a western style for people raised on movies, comics, and video games."   Other upcoming work includes  The New Bible , a creator-owned title for  Vertigo , with artist  Camilla D’Errico , and a Vertigo title, with  Sean Murphy , going by the working name of  Joe the Barbarian . Morrison is also a fan of Geoff Johns' current work with the Green Lantern mythos, and thus made certain to reserve a significant role for the Corps in  Final Crisis . In particular, one of the new Alpha Lanterns features prominently in the early issues of  Final Crisis . The fallout of those events will reverberate back through the upcoming event  The Blackest Night  in 2009. Morrison is currently working with  Frank Quitely  on the new  Batman and Robin  title, which will be published in June 2009 after the  Battle for the Cowl  event. He has also revealed that his next major project will be, "Multiversity", a metaseries of eight one-shots set in some of the 52 worlds in the DC Multivers Grant Morrison first appeared as a comics character with a cameo in  Animal Man  #14. He made a full appearance at the end of issue #25, and spent most of #26 in a lengthy conversation with the comic's title character, particularly on the topic of how realism has to be part of comic books somewhere. Nevertheless, in the end, Animal Man's family returned from the dead due to 'his' influence. Shortly afterwards, a Morrison-resembling character called "The Writer" appeared in issue 58 of the  DC Comics  title  Suicide Squad  (written by  John Ostrander ). This issue was part of the  War of the Gods  storyline. He was seen protesting that other "writers" had taken control of his fate now that he was part of "the continuity". He demonstrated his skills by writing down dialogue onto a laptop. This text was attributed to specific, gathered, super-hero allies. Moments later, the allies then said those very words. He then participated in the attack on the stronghold of  Circe . He eliminated a few enemies by writing of their deaths, which then happened.  Writer's block  then hit and he was killed by a bestial humanoid. Morrison would later be counted among the Seven Unknown Men of Slaughter Swamp, the body of "reality engineers" seen throughout the  Seven Soldiers  miniseries event, all of whom look exactly like him. During the series, one of these - referred to as the "Eighth of Seven" - went rogue, consolidating magical power for himself, releasing the Sheeda warrior-race on their Twenty-First Century ancestors, and becoming the silver-age character Zor, "The Terrible Time Tailor", a figure who looks exactly like Morrison but also wears a magician's outfit, as well as sporting dark hair and a self-described 'magnificent beard'; this Zor was introduced in the original Spectre adventures in  More Fun Comics  #55 before he was re-invented in  Seven Soldiers . Zor is conquered by Zatanna and captured by his fellow Time Tailors who 'Judge' him; Morrison himself, bearing a Dc Comics-logo  tie-clip  becomes the narrator of the final chapter, treating the reader as if they were Zor himself. Zor is eventually dressed to resemble a pedophiliac miser named Cyrus Gold, killed by an angry mob. He has also appeared in an issue of  Simpsons Comics , where he is seen fighting with Mark Millar over the title of "Writer of  X-Men ". [ 24 ] In the notes to the Absolute Edition of  DC: The New Frontier , writer  Darwyn Cooke  mentioned that this version of  Captain Cold  was visually based upon Morrison. In the  Doctor Thirteen  story found in  Tales of the Unexpected , Thirteen encounters the self-proclaimed Architects of the DC Universe. This foursome wear Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and Flash masks, and could be interpreted as the writers of DC's  52 . The Batman mask-wearer bears more than a passing resemblance to Grant Morrison. In  Mad Magazine , he is referred to as  Jim Morrison  in a review for a comic book he supposedly wrote. [ citation needed ] It has also been suggested the near-future Batman depicted in issue #666 of the comic book of the same name is based on Morrison: "Oddly, the shaved-headed Batman in the trench coat looks a bit like Grant Morrison and he has a cat named Alfred. In other words, it looks like Morrison (who is known to love cats) made himself Batman in this story. Of course, in Animal Man, Morrison appeared as himself as the teller of tales of Animal Man's life; in Seven Soldiers, the tailors who tell the tales of the universe looked like Morrison; and now he seems to be the Batman of the not-too-distant future." However, Morrison has stated that the decision to base the appearance of the future Batman on him was one taken solely by the artist, "I had written him as having a buzz cut, I think, but Andy drew him bald. I think a lot of people just assumed that I stuck myself into a comic again, but that was never intended." Similarly, in Morrison's  The Filth , the central character, named Greg Feely, becomes acutely physically similar to Morrison at the exact same time that his cat dies under the care of a malicious body double of his; Feely's care for the cat mirrors that which Morrison has claimed he felt for it. Morrison has received praise for his works' various portrayals of  Lex Luthor  - a character who is bald, and often wears clothing with a high collar, similar to his signature trench coat - in particular  All-Star Superman , wherein the iconic elements of the character such as his insanity, genius and representation of infinite human potential are highly emphasized. Morrison has become more involved in  screenwriting  and has written numerous scripts and treatments. His screenplays include  Sleepless Knights  for Dreamworks and  WE3  for New Line (both in development with  Don Murphy  producing, John Stevensonis  attached as Director for WE3). Most recently he wrote the adaptation of the video game  Area 51  home console game  for Paramount (in development with  CFP Productions  producing). Morrison provided outline story and script work for two video games ( Predator: Concrete Jungle  and  Battlestar Galactica ) both by  Vivendi Universal , though the finished products often didn't contain all his contributions. He has also been a successful  playwright , with two plays written for and performed by Oxygen House at the  Edinburgh Fringe . The first was  Red King Rising  in 1989, about the (partly fictional) relationship between  Lewis Carroll  and  Alice Liddell  and the second in 1990,  Depravity  about  Aleister Crowley . Both plays were critically acclaimed and won between them a Fringe First Award , the  Independent Theatre Award  for 1989 and the  Evening Standard Award for New Drama . A film adaptation of  Red King Rising  is in discussion. Both plays were collected in his collection of prose,  Lovely Biscuits  released in 1999. Aztek  is a  fictional  character, a superhero in the  DC Universe . Based out of the fictional  Vanity City , Aztek is the champion of the Aztec god  Quetzalcoatl . The character first appeared in  Aztek, The Ultimate Man #1  in August 1996, created by  Grant Morrison  and  Mark Millar . Following the short run series, Aztek appeared in several issues of  JLA  also written by Morrison Uno is raised from childhood by the Q Society, a secret organization, to be the champion of the  Aztec  god  Quetzalcoatl  to battle their enemy, the Aztec god,  Tezcatlipoca . He is given a magical suit of armor that bestows many abilities, complementing Uno's peak human mental and physical abilities. Aztek later joins the  Justice League , but resigns when it is revealed that one of the mysterious benefactors of the Q Society is supervillain   Lex Luthor . He is later blinded helping the League save the Earth in a battle against the planet-destroying machine  Mageddon , (apparently, the 'Tezcatlipoca' that the cult was referring to all along.) Aztek, ultimately sacrifices himself to allow Superman the chance to destroy Mageddon/Tezcatlipoca, during the  World War III . Aztek has peak human physical and mental conditioning. He wears an ancient helmet and armor (powered by a "four-dimensional mirror"), from which he derives flight, infrared and X-Ray vision, invisibility, intangibility, bodyheat camouflage, entrapment nets, plasma beams and density manipulation, as well as augmenting his peak physical abilities to superhuman levels. The four-dimensional power source could self destruct in a highly explosive manner. [ A younger black female Aztek, with the same abilities, was seen in Grant Morrison's run on JLA during " The Rock of Ages " storyline in which the JLA traveled to an  alternate future  overrun by  Darkseid . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Morrison http://www.grantmorrison.com http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Morrison_bibliography http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztek_(comics)

The Flower of Life (FOL) is a geometrical figure composed of multiple evenly-spaced, overlapping circles, that are arranged so that they form a flower-like pattern with a sixfold symmetry like a hexagon. Leonardo da Vinci has studied the Flower of Life's form and its mathematical properties. He has drawn the Flower of Life itself, as well as components therein, such as the Seed of Life. He has drawn geometric figures representing shapes such as the platonic solids, a sphere, a torus, etc., and has also used the golden ratio of phi in his artwork; all of which may be derived from the Flower of Life design.

Monad being the source or the One meaning without division.
Monism is often erroneously seen in relation to pantheism, panentheism, and an immanent God. However, the concepts of absolutism, the monad, and the "Universal substrate" are closely related.
