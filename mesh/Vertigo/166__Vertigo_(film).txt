Study of a Single Film: Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo
Finding Equilibrium in Hitchcock's Vertigo
Roundtable discussion at the
Philoctetes Center , New York, on November 6, 2010, with Richard Allen, John Belton, Joe McElhaney, Edward Neresessian, and Brigitte Peucker
Vertigo
(1958) is the
Hitchcock
film in which the confusion of
ontological registers—of reality with illusion—takes center stage.
Indeed, it’s a case study of someone for whom this confusion is nearly
pathological. The
James Stewart
character, Scottie, is duped by a
performance with criminal intent, as he falls for a woman he believes to
be Madeleine, but who in reality is a woman named Judy (played by
Kim
Novak ) perpetrating a masquerade. Around this “false” Madeleine, a
narrative is created that's designed to ensnare Scottie. The film
concerns a mysterious case of “possession”—a staged fascination with
death—played out in a series of silent tableaux, each of which
aestheticizes and eroticizes the Madeleine figure. The film's narrative
structure is circular and repetitive; it's been suggested that the film
itself represents a distinct form of madness. " Vertigo
is just a movie," writes
Stanley Cavell
in
The World Viewed ,
"but no other movie I know so purely conveys the sealing of a mind
within a scorching fantasy." What is the role of psychoanalysis in
Hitchcock's work? Is psychoanalysis merely one "surface feature" of
Hitchcock's work, as Richard Allen has suggested, subject to irony like
all the others? What draws psychoanalytic critics to Hitchcock's work,
and how, if at all, is this phenomenon related to its modernism? [ Philoctetes Center ] Film Studies For Free
brings you one of its regular link-fests pertaining to the study of a single film: today, it's the turn of
Alfred
Hitchcock 's truly magical thriller
Vertigo
(1958) .
The below list of openly-accessible resources was very much inspired by the recent posting of a hugely entertaining, and vertiginously brilliant, discussion on this film between some of
the most able Film Studies academics and writers of their generation
(see above). The discussion was hosted by the wonderful people at the
Philoctetes Center
in New York City. Thanks so much to them for making this video available for all to watch and learn from.
