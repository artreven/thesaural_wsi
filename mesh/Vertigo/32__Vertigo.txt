Where In The World Is JAX?
Sorry I've been missing in action the past few days. I started feeling weirdly dizzy and nauseated on Tuesday morning. I decided to go in to work anyway and by 2 pm it was pretty apparent that something was wrong.
Everytime I stood up I felt severely faint, nauseated,
and the room started spinning.
I figured it was just the stomach flu. I grabbed my car keys and was saying bye to co-workers when a sudden wave of nausea washed over me. I spent 15 minutes in the bathroom being sick and another 15 in head spinning agony on the couch in my office. I told my co-workers that I'd be fine and to just call me a cab, but It was pretty obvious that I needed to go to the emergency room. Diagnosis: Severe
Vertigo
caused by inflammation in my inner ears. My ears have been giving me trouble for the past few weeks but I never thought it was a big deal and never took care of it. I spent pretty much all day yesterday asleep. The medicine they gave me does little more than knock me out cold. Im starting to feel better but still not 100%
the room feels like its moving and shifting around me even though I'm completely and totally stationary. It's surreal and straight out of a hitchcock movie. I have a Dr. Appt tomorrow for my ears. Hopefully he can get to the root of all this so my topsy turvy world will come to an end.. Ill be back in action hopefully next week. JAX
