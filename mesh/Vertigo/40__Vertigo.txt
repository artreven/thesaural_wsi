THINGS THAT MAKE ME VERY UPSET
Elliott Smith Tribute Wall Defaced |
photo by Sonny I. LaVista for LAist When I saw this image I seriously wanted to puke. Some inconsiderate prick DEFACED the
Elliott Smith Tribute Wall
in Silverlake.
Elliott Smith
shot the cover for his 2000 release
Figure 8
in front of this wall. After his shocking death in 2003 fans turned it into a memorial writing well wishes, poetry, and other inspirational messages in homage of the  singer/songwriter.
The wall is the storefront of Solutions Audio at 4334 W Sunset Blvd. Smith called the east side of Los Angeles his home during the last years of his life. Given the size of the graffiti its pretty obviously that whoever did this knew EXACTLY what they were doing. It makes me absolutely sick to my stomach.

PETITION! Bring You Say Party! We Say Die! To The States!
Bring YSP!WSD! To The States!
Haha
Bronson
I apologize in advance for all the exclamation marks in this post.
You Say Party! We Say Die ! - One of my favorite new music discoveries of 2007, just released a new video for the song "Opportunity." The track is off their explosive album,
Lose All Time , which is in stores now.
I have been dying to see this band for months now, but the band was banned from the US for attempting to cross the border without the appropriate visas.
The band started a petition on their
myspace page
to get their visas reinstated. If you have a spare moment please sign so we can bring this band to LA. They kick so much ass and LA is in sore need of some music with energy for a change.
Note from the band:
Hey everybody! So as most of you know, we were banned from the USA last October for attempting to cross the border when our visas had already been denied (mainly because we were "not making enough money" on the tour). Our hearts were in the right place... we just didn't want to disappoint our fans and record label by canceling the tour. Anyway, we've been talking with immigration lawyers and the musician's federation in attempt to rectify this. So far nothin, but we think it will help if we can get a bunch of signatures on this petition: www.petitionspot.com/petitions/YSPUSA You Say Party! We Say Die! - Opportunity

LA CONCERT PICKS FOR WED. AUG. 29th
Mae's new album, Singularity, is out now!
Mae, As Tall As Lions, Dear and the Headlights
@ The Roxy
TONIGHT! I love
Mae . I don't say it nearly enough (or at all) on this site. I worked with the band while I was still at Capitol Records. I was a HUUUUUUGE fan of their first album,
Destination: Beautiful , which came out while I was DJing at my college radio station in podunk UTAH.
I think I spun "Embers and Envelopes" every single day for two solid months. The band just released a new album called
Singularity . It is definately more modern rock and a far departure from their
Tooth and Nail
days. I still love it, although a lot of fans seem on the fence about it. Give it a good listen and make up your own mind. You can pick up the record on
iTUNES . ALSO TONIGHT:
Far Away Places @
The Echo Wrong Way Driver, Scott Watson, Love Lies Sleeping
@ The Silverlake Lounge Dub Club @
Echoplex Saint Motel, Voxhaul Broacast, Tar Volts
@ Bordello The Midnight Shakes, The King Cheetah, The Waking Hours, Steel
@ El Cid Club NME w/ The Like, Chow Nasty

A small addiction...Skybox at The Keyclub tonight FREE
I caught
Skybox
last time they came through town when they played at the Keyclub at the stage below and now they're back doing the upstairs mainstage where they freaking belong. Such energy and such solid talent, though they had a small audience last time they rocked the crap out of the place. They've been quietly getting great writeups from all kinds of people (just check their "space"). If you're on the West side just pop on it and if you're on the East side fight your lameness to to approach the West and catch one of the better bands to pass through here.
A long while ago I sent this to Jax at her job and told her to listen to it 3 times and tell me it was absolutley addicting. She did and passed it around her job and everyone agreed unanimously. SO now it's your turn. Skybox-

Last night's rehashing of The Section Quartet's CD Release
Last night at
The Section Quartet's
CD release at The Troubadour was a night of exquisite beauty.
On a new label (Decca) with a new disk, these guys just killed it in front of the almost capacity crowd at The Troubadour. Joining them for the evening was, as announced,
Linda Perry ,
Grant Lee Phillips
and
Sam Phillips
and as a special unannounced guest was LA's own favorite,
Jon Brion
(in some kind of leg brace) who came out early in the show for a rendition of David Bowie's "Life on Mars" with the Section. The show opened up with
Sam Phillips
coming out and with a personal pocket tape player accompanied herself in a song of devilishly sweet whimsy. Right up afterwards was Grant Lee Phillips who serenaded the crowd with such sincerity it's easy to see why he's such a fixture at
Largo . After a brief film interlude by filmmaker Carlos F. Grasso the Section came out and opened up with a rocking rendition of Juicebox. IN-FREAKING-CREDIBLE! Some of the sickening highlight songs from last night were
Yeah Yeah Yeah's
Phenomena,
Bowie's
"The Man Who Sold the World", Sound Garden's "Black Hole Sun", Zeppelin's "Heartbreaker" featuring Linda Perry and
Queens of the Stone Age's
"No One Knows". Here's some media to immortalize the night: Sam Phillips joining in with the Section Life on Mars with Jon Brion Paranoid Android Heartbreaker with Linda Perry And let me turn your attention to one final thing that was worth mentioning. They covered a now defunct band by the name of
Failure
and the song was called The Nurse Who Loved Me. Absolutely beautiful. Lets take a listen to them side by side. First Failure playing it live in '97. and let's listen to the Section's Album version: The Section Quartet-

I tell you the truth and you shall be free...at least tonight at the Troubadour that is.
Been a while and it means I suck when it comes to posting cause writers block and being swamped are to blame for a a disappearance (Jax if you're reading I swear I'm not avoiding you!!!!). An incredible show is happening tonight and as stated free is a good price to see an incredible show.
The Section Quartet
with friends will be hitting the stage at 8 tonight for their new record release
Fuzz Box . Who are these friends that will join them you ask? These friends be Grant Lee Phillips, Sam Phillips,and Linda Perry. If you don't know who the Section Quartet are you've probably heard them and didn't know it. They're a string quartet that plays with just about everyone. Besides accompanying everyone under the sun they also do string renditions of amazing albums of today. Jax, myself and a group of others caught them when they did their string vesion of the OK Computer album and it was practically spiritual. This is a brilliant time to catch them as it really is a gift to LA that we get to see them for free (unless you're under 21 and then it's $3).

New Music For The Mundays - Jenn Grant
Halifax, Nova Scotia's Jenn Grant
[MP3]
Jenn Grant
-
Dreamer
I am absolutely in love with
Jenn Grant ' s awe-inspiring voice and amazing lyrics. I only discovered the Eastern Canadian songstress this morning and instantly went on an odyssey to find every bit of information I could find about her. I only found a few articles. I simply can't believe more people haven't discovered her. One blog listed her as "Eastern Canada's answer to
Feist ."  I do see the simalarities between the two but quite honestly Grant's quiet yet assurtive voice is in a class of her own.
Her new album
Orchestra For The Moon
is one of the strongest collections folk pop I've heard in quite sometime. The tunes are simply gorgeous. I have a feeling it's not going to leave my stereo for quite sometime.
Watch Jenn Grant's video for "Dreamer" below.

Where In The World Is JAX?
Sorry I've been missing in action the past few days. I started feeling weirdly dizzy and nauseated on Tuesday morning. I decided to go in to work anyway and by 2 pm it was pretty apparent that something was wrong.
Everytime I stood up I felt severely faint, nauseated,
and the room started spinning.
I figured it was just the stomach flu. I grabbed my car keys and was saying bye to co-workers when a sudden wave of nausea washed over me. I spent 15 minutes in the bathroom being sick and another 15 in head spinning agony on the couch in my office. I told my co-workers that I'd be fine and to just call me a cab, but It was pretty obvious that I needed to go to the emergency room. Diagnosis: Severe
Vertigo
caused by inflammation in my inner ears. My ears have been giving me trouble for the past few weeks but I never thought it was a big deal and never took care of it. I spent pretty much all day yesterday asleep. The medicine they gave me does little more than knock me out cold. Im starting to feel better but still not 100%
the room feels like its moving and shifting around me even though I'm completely and totally stationary. It's surreal and straight out of a hitchcock movie. I have a Dr. Appt tomorrow for my ears. Hopefully he can get to the root of all this so my topsy turvy world will come to an end.. Ill be back in action hopefully next week. JAX

My Private Show With Seymore Saves The World
[MP3]
Seymore Saves The World
-
Summer 2005 [MP3]
Seymore Saves The World
-
Love Song Sorry about the blog silence this weekend. I was in San Francisco attending the 2nd annual
Bandwidth Music and Technology Conference . I will write more on that later. Today's New Music pick is
Seymore Saves The World
- a delightful pop rock band from Minneapolis, MN.
You might recognize bassist Sean Neary from his stint in the band
Tapes N' Tapes
[ SEE PHOTOS HERE ] . The band played the Sunset Junction After Party at Spaceland on Sunday. My flight in from the bay didn't get in til 9:30 so I ended up booking it to the venue suitcase in tow. When I arrived I found the club completely and totally EMPTY.
The oppressive heart and general exhaustion of the weekend kept the throngs of party goers away. The audience consisted of me, the bartender, and the sound guy. NO JOKE. Still the band played on - having fun, cracking jokes, thanking the wonderful audience, and rocking out like it was a packed house.
Seymore Saves The World 's songs are upbeat and so much fun. After a long arduous day of traveling stress they were just the right medicine. The sound guy even turned on the smoke machine for a song and did a full light show. By the end of their seven song set the audience had doubled thanks to a random drunkard who stumbled into the venue. He offered to buy me a drink. When I declined he bought me one anyway and proceeded to drink them both.
Haha at the end of the night he asked me out on a date. I told him I was exclusively not dating.
The drunkard jeered the band and screamed for an encore - to which the band obliged. What could have been a horrible night turned out to be one of the most fulfilling shows I've ever seen. Seymore Saves The World
are currently on a short US Tour.
Click here for dates . I highly recommend catching their live show when they come to your hometown.

Hot Hot Heat - Let Me In
On the night of June 30th bloggers and hipsters alike converged on your favorite east side venue and mine
The Echo
to see
The Henry Clay People ,
Tigers Can Bite You ,
Molecules , and
Radars To the Sky
[ See poster here ]. It was bound to be a stellar show and one I had been looking forward to for quite some time. When my friend and I arrived at the venue we found the entrance to the club completely closed off and a film crew very pubicly running the show. The mess at the door was more than a bit irritating and put me in a pissy mood for most of the evening. Nobody likes seeing JAX pissy. It doesn't happen very often and it tends to hover somewhere between koala bear cute and "oooh somebody take her home." I later found out the reason for the mess was they were filming a music video for
Hot Hot Heat' s new single "Let Me In." The video features Vocalist/Keyboardist Steve Bays wandering around Hollywood trying to talk his way into clubs and ultimately taking a service entrance to get in and rock the heck out. The video was actually shot in my neighborhood of Echo Park. The band are frequent visitors of The Echo and have been seen hovering in the corners at a few
Hell Ya! shows.
It was quite fitting for them to shoot a video there. Despite the headache the video turned out pretty good and has a lot of footage from inside the newly opened
Echoplex . Hot Hot Heat 's latest album,
Happiness LTD , hits stores Sept 11th on Sire Records. Note:
The band will also be playing
Sunset Junction
this Saturday. Find them on the Bates Stage (4200 Sunset) at 5:15 PM SHARP! VIDEO: Hot Hot Heat

Junior Senior

Can I Get Get Get Jesper and Jeppe aka the danish duo
Junior Senior
will play their first show in Los Angeles in over 2 years TONIGHT at The Roxy. Their album,
Hey Hey My My Yo Yo,
finally saw its US release yesterday via Crunchy Frog. The record was actually put out overseas in 2005 but after label issues and serious car accident (Jeppe was struck by a car while crossing Alvarado in 2006) the band took a hiatus. Jeppe (Senior) is a constant figure of LA's eastside scene. It's good to see them back in action.

Agent Ribbons - On Time Travel and Romance
Teh delightful ladies of Agent Ribbons [MP3]
Agent Ribbons
-
Birds and Bees [MP3]
Agent Ribbons
-
Obituary I met up with a friend for an afterno0n matinée show at the Silverlake Lounge on Sunday.
I had no idea who was playing; therefore no idea what to expect. I walked in to find a flurry of red hair prancing wildly on stage. It was
Agent Ribbons
- an unexpected duo from Sacramento's burgeoning folk scene. Needless to say I was ABSOLUTELY BLOWN AWAY. I'm a huge sucker for singers with personality. Songstress Natalie Gordon not only had the audience eating out of the palm of her hand, but had the vocal chops to take out a T-Rex across the street. Her voice boomed over the audience and she always seem to have a delightful quip or taunting inflection. She's a born performer. After the show I immediately went up to the band and picked up their CD -
On Time Travel and Romance . Agent Ribbons
sound is solidly held in all things retro. The duo sound like they belong in a 1940s cabaret over some of the dive bars and punk venues their playing. The songs on their debut CD are charming, witty, and so much fun. "Obituary" is a delightful ragtime inspired tune about a woman mourning her love life; while "Birds And Bees" is a tongue in cheek song about use of the word "Honey." This band is freakin' fantastic. If you need an escape today download the tunes above. Agent Ribbons
are currently in the middle of a US Tour. They still need help with some tour dates. Take a look at their
myspace page
and if you can help them out please send them a message. VIDEO:

Friday Guilty Pleasures: Melee
Orange County Cuties: Melee
I have known the gentlemen of
Melee
for years. Almost as long as I've known
The Valley Arena .
Back in the day I even set up an online street team for
Melee . The band has become well known for their fantastic piano driven pop tunes as well as their quirky sense of humor. Whenever my co-worker Cat and I are having a bad day we always throw in these boys and instantly feel better. Melee
recently released
Devils and Angels
- Their first full length on Warner Bros. They are not of the severely indie vein but I still highly enjoyable. Put your music snobbery aside and check out their video for "Built To Last" below. PS. You can see the band on tour this fall with
Bowling For Soup
and later on with
Matt Nathanson .

From A Tower [MP3]
Lovelikefire
-
Unlighted Shadow I was going to post these new
Lovelikefire
tracks next week, but I just couldn't wait. They're just too darn good.
The San Francisco based dreamy indie rock quartet won me over with their
Bed Of Gold EP
last year ( read my review here ). The new songs are stronger, fuzzier, and come loaded with a lot more rock n' roll fervor. The band will be self releasing a new seven song EP at the end of the month entitled
An Ocean In the Air . The two tracks above will appear on the release. Pre-order the EP now in the band's
online store .

Mezzanine Owls Last Night + JAX TRAX
Mezzanine Owls [MP3]
Mezzanine Owls
-
Lightbulb Today's a bit hectic. Not a whole lot of time to post. Just know that
Mezzanine Owls
last night at the troubadour were fantastic. They had some technical difficulties but still came out stupendous. 1990s
also opened and were great. Very fun party band if you ask me. Singer Jackie McKeown's teeth were the star of the night. Instead of going into great time consuming detail I've decided to post an obligatory
Blog Mixtape
of tracks I have been listening to a lot lately. Take me at my word and download the tracks to listen for yourself. I've posted short descriptions below but I'm leaving it up to you to do research into the bands. Think of it as a scavenger hunt. JAX TRAX - August 8th, 2007 [MP3]
Epo-555

Grisslappan I've seriously become obsessed with this Danish band in recent weeks. Ambient guitars and soaring melodies. Their new record

is eerily fantastic in a 2001: A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick kind of way. [ myspace ] [MP3]

Rest In Peace JaxDrive (2006-2007)
Today we mourn the loss of a truly talented and exceptionally hardworking MacBook Hard Drive. My trustworthy friend I dubbed
JaxDrive
went out in a blaze of glory this past weekend taking with him pretty much every computer program on the system. I have all my art files and music saved on an external hard drive but didn't think to save my programs because I didn't have the DMG files or
install disks. If any of you have Photoshop, Dreamweaver, or Microsoft Office install discs and want to ummm graciously let me borrow them please email me at
jax@rockinsider.com JaxDrive
leaves behind a CD/DVD Burner, several usb ports,
and a very lonely exclamation mark.

New Young Pony Club - Fantastic Playroom
[MP3]
New Young Pony Club
-
Grey I got a pretty lil' package from
Modular
the other day which included
Fantastic Playroom
- the debut album from
New Young Pony Club . Their previous EPs and singles made them seem like yet another dime a dozen electro-pop band in a sea of eighties throwback electro-pop bands. I loved their video for "Ice Cream" but didn't feel compelled to do more research into them. I'll admit it. My preconceptions were totally wrong. The UK quintet remind me of
Luscious Jackson
more than anything - who I absolutely love. Fantastic Playroom
is an energetic album that still manages to maintain a laid back coolness throughout. Not easy to do.
The album won't see its U.S. release until August 28th
but you can pick it up now on
HMV
or pre-order it through
Amazon . VIDEO:

Undiscovered LA: Meho Plaza - "Let's Play Police"
Meho Plaza

Meho Plaza

Let's Play Police My friend Chris has been a fan of the indie-tronic stylings of
Meho Plaza
since I can remember. His excitement and admiration towards the band definitely wore off on me. I always thought they were great, but must admit I lost touch with them a while back. Thanks to
la-underground
(GREAT L.A. SITE FYI) I rediscovered the band and learned that they not only have new songs - which are much noisier than their previous stripped down electronic tunes, but they're also putting out a full length on
Better Looking Records
(home to
The Album Leaf ,
Electric Soft Parade ) next year. I'm really diggin' the new tracks. "Let's Play Police" is a favorite of mine and has worked its way into my daily listening rotation. Be sure to catch
Meho Plaza
live at Rock Insider's

The Compromise I love
The Format . I don't just love
The Format

I WUBBBBBB The Format. Nothing gets me and my co-worker Cat dancing around the office faster than the opening refrain of "Time Bomb." Call them "emo" if you must (they're so not), but know right now I have been a huge fan of these gentlemen since their TREMENDOUS yet ill fated Atlantic debut
Interventions and Lullabies . I have no problem slapping people who call them "emo." After a very public battle with Atlantic over their follow up record the band were dropped from the label. All looked lost for The Format but instead of wallowing in self pity they opted to put the record out
on their own through
Nettwerk
- their managements company. Very smart move.
2006's
Dog Problems
was well received by the press and went on to sell 12K copies in its first week alone.
Dog Problems
easily made my top albums of the year list and still refuses to leave my car stereo. This album is pure happiness. To celebrate the one year anniversary of
Dog Problems
release; the band made the entire record available for download in their website COMPLETELY FREE OF CHARGE. That deal ended on July 16th (sorry for the late news reporting)
but be sure to download my two favorite tracks from the album above. The Format
are in the midst of their summer tour with
Limbeck ,
Steel Train ,
The Honorary Title , and
Reubens Accomplice .
Click here
for dates. LA Readers can catch
The Format
live TONIGHT at the Avalon in Hollywood Tonight. You can also pick up
