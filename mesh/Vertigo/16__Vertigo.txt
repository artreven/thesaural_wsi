London Fashion Week: See You Next Season
So that’s my  London Fashion Week
recap, I did have more images to show but the quality isn’t too good, sadly over exposure from the runway lights caused the models to look like balls of energy…literally.
On another disappointing note I seemed to have lost my pictures from  Todd Lynn,  I wanted to
show you all when I sat across from
Janet Jackson,
but they’ve disappeared along with the video footage I took mysteriously *annoyed face*.
But anyway…
I hope you’ve all enjoyed the fabulous things I saw during AW10 of
London Fashion Week , I can’t wait til next season I’m sure I’ll have even more to tell you, but till then enjoy my forthcoming posts, I’ve just been
dying
to write about all the latest happenings.
Full Steam Ahead.
-xoxo
Thanks to Amelia of

Janet Jackson covers Wonderland Magazine UK – February/March Issue 2010
R&B & Pop Goddess
Janet Jackson
covers
Wonderland
Magazine for their February/March issue, the mag recently shot the pics sometime before christmas but this is the only image to be fully revealed since the news broke of this issue.  I’m loving the top with the shoulder blades complete fierceness, also I’m glad were seeing Janet on a lot of fashion magazine’s again I’ve always loved her style so it’s nice to se what a stylist can create for a shoot as opposed to something for a music video.  Eagerly awaiting to see the rest of the shots as well as read the interview. The magazine hits newsstands on
February 5th.

Why Did I Get Married Too? (2010) – Official Extended Full-Length Trailer
Such a great film
Janet Jackson  fans enjoy as this one is focused a lot more on her character. Sadly I doubt it will make its way to UK Cinema’s as the first film wasn’t released over here , however
Tyler Perry
did a great job casting and directing this so if you can somehow get to see it you really should. It’s funny, witty, and the drama leaves you wanting more, fingers crossed that this film debuts at No.1 like the first, always wanting the best for Janet!
Why Did I get Married Too?  is scheduled to be released at US Theatres on
April 2, 2010

Janet Jackson: All For You & Make Me – X Factor Performance HERE
For those of you who missed it, watch it here:
Miss Jackson, cracked the whip as usual, it was a nice set too.
Has anyone noticed Janet does not age, she looks the same as she did when she was 20, her face does not age.
I wish the camera people stopped cutting the angles so much we didn’t get to see the choreography as much as we should have but still. Loved it!

Janet Jackson Perfoming Today On X-Factor & At The Jingle Bell Ball
Superstar
Janet Jackson  is set to tear up the stage tonight performing on
X- Factor
and at the
Capital FM’s Jingle Bell Ball.
So far from what my sources have told me she will perform 2 songs on X-Factor, the new single
“Make Me”
and
“All For You”  off of the new greatest hits
“The Best”.
I tried to push for more information, but my friend wants me to be surprised. lol
and
Straight after the
X-Factor
performance she will be going directly to the
Jingle Bell Ball
to close the show with an apparent 30 min performance of
Rhythm Nation, All For You, Again, Escapade, Make Me and What Have You Done For Me Lately . So it’s set to be a hot night, I cannot wait. *Screams*.
*EDIT*: I will post the videos as soon as they are available so keep checking back.

Justin Timberlake Regret’s Not Supporting Janet After SuperBowl
Justin Timberlake  recently spoke out in an interview with
Entertainment Weekly
after being asked whats your biggest regret of this decade, he stated:
“I wish I had supported Janet more (during the 2004 wardrobe malfunction Super Bowl controversy). I’m not sorry I apologized, but I wish I had been there more for Janet”
All I can say is it’s about time he said something, but its way too late, 5 years in fact; he left Janet out there
high
and
dry  with not a care only for what it was going to do to his upcoming career. The most annoying thing is that Janet’s career did take a knock after the wardrobe malfunction and affected her subsequent album releases. Not to say Justin was the only culprit of turning his back on her, MTV, CBS, Virgin Records, Radio, anything basically owned by Viacom shunned her. It’s only recently that the dust has settled and these relationships have started to rekindle the main one being MTV which is about time her, Michael and a few others helped make that station.
However what I find crazy is that it wasn’t even Janet who ripped the top it was Justin so how did she manage to take all the flack?
Anyway enough said on 2004 Janet doesnt talk about it anymore so neither will I, but check out the AMAZING performance that was put on that day, the choreography is MAD!!!, staging, pyro fx, the whole spectacle, had it gone differently that would have been one of Janet’s biggest performances ever.

Janet Jackson: The Best/Number Ones – My Album Review
So last week one of the CD’s I picked up was
Janet Jackson’s: The Best , her latest greatest hits LP replacing
“Design of Decade 1986/1996”
and covering all her hits from the
“Control”
album all the way up to 2008’s
“Discipline”.  The CD also includes new single
“Make Me”  which was dubbed as
“A Gift for the Fans”.
I love the CD which is no surprise considering I have all the songs already, but what makes this one different is that you have all the classic songs over two discs rather than having to chop and change over 6 or 7 albums. Also some of the earlier songs sound exceptionally crisp which I love, no guess some remastering was done to bring it up to par with the newer tracks.
What I love about this greatest hits has to be the varation of song styles and topics that span through the 2 discs, something which I find can only be rivaled by possibly
Madonna . Both artists have re-invented themselves throughout the years and manged to have careers that spans over 2 decades. Moving more towards my point, its listening to the CD from start to finish that makes you realise how creative Janet as an artist is before even looking at her music videos. I truly think the real artistry of perfecting your craft was left in the 80s as star’s these days seem to be hooked on talking about the same things and then at last resort sampling something that was more than likely conceived in the 80s.
You have people talking about, money, cars, and sex, or to pin point it more to female artists, going to the club, getting a man, keeping your man, leaving your man and then telling all your girls about it, but what else?, where’s the substance?. Then of course you have a real artist like Janet who writes their own songs, and yes maybe covers some of those topics but also talks about the more important things in life racism, spousal abuse, children, getting a education,  depression, empowering women, taking control of your life, the death of loved ones and several other things. So what astound’s me is when people come to the assumption that all Janet talks about is sex? bullsh*t. Buy the cd’s, buy this cd, listen to the messages, then talk otherwise. Cut it, keep it, seal it, get your facts
in order.
Track List
DISC 1
1. What Have You Done for Me Lately
2. Nasty
3. When I Think of You
4. Control
5. Let’s Wait Awhile (Single Remix Version)
6. The Pleasure Principle
7. Diamonds (Herb Alpert with Janet Jackson)
8. Miss You Much
9. Rhythm Nation
10. Escapade
11. Alright 7” (Video Version with Rap)
12. Come Back to Me
13. Black Cat (Video Mix/Short Solo Single Version)
14. Love Will Never Do (Without You)
15. The Best Things in Life Are Free (Luther Vandross and Janet Jackson with BBD and Ralph Tresvant)
16. That’s the Way Love Goes
DISC 2
1. If
2. Again
3. Because of Love
4. Any Time, Any Place
5. Scream (Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson)
6. Runaway
7. Got ’Til It’s Gone featuring Q-Tip and Joni Mitchell
8. Together Again
9. I Get Lonely featuring BLACKstreet
10. Go Deep
11. What’s It Gonna Be?! (Busta Rhymes featuring Janet Jackson)
12. Doesn’t Really Matter

14. Someone to Call My Lover
15. All Nite (Don’t Stop)
16. Call on Me featuring Nelly
17. Feedback

This CD highlights music history and shows you what true artistry and originality is. Be sure to get yours, Number Ones/The Best in stores now.
All we need now is a DVD version to complete the package.

The Sunday Sessions: Whats Playing in my iPod?
Each week I will be posting the top 5 songs I’ve listened to for that week, hopefully you will like it and go check out some of the songs yourself, anyway check out the tracks after the cut. This week my Top 5 are:
1. Janet Jackson  – Make Me (DJ Dan Vocal Edit)
LISTEN
2. Rihanna – Rockstar 101
LISTEN
3. Lady Gaga – So Happy I Could Die
LISTEN
4. Chris Brown – Crawl
LISTEN
5. Jennifer Lopez – Fresh Out The Oven (RE-ENTRY)
LISTEN
This weeks top 5 was a little harder than usual but in the end I got my top 5. Still Janet’s
“Make Me”
is at the top of my list but this time the vocal club remix by DJ Dan, the space like rhythms along with  Janet’s catchy lines has me hooked as I can only think of her dancing while I listen. I also think and hope she performs a club remix of
“Make Me”
on the X-Factor next week to add an extra bit of buzz and exclusivity for the UK
Coming in 2nd is Rihanna’s
“Rockstar 101 ” featuring none other than the legendary
Slash
as guitarist, it’s RiRi’s bad girl lyrics like “6 inch walker, big sh*t talker” and ” baby frisk me good check my panties and my bra” which has got me playing this day and night.

Janet Jackson Readies European Tour For 2010
Pop & RnB Goddess
Janet Jackson
has revealed in an interview with the
The Times
newspaper (UK) that she is planning a European tour in 2010.  It has been over 9 years since Janet has embarked on a European leg, the last time was for
“The Velvet Rope”
tour in 1998. Her last tour
“Rock Witchu”  for 2008’s LP
“Discipline”  was planned to be worldwide but was cancelled due to her coming down with
Vertigo , an illness which could be detrimental for a performer who dances around as much as she does.
As mega Janet fan I’m sure you know I’m screaming right now, really and truly this is what Janet needs I think
f*ck
the US they dont even know good music anymore, all their wrapped up in is whose shaking there
coochie
in a video. Tut!.
Funny enough I’m not too surprised shes taking it over here I’ve noticed a lot of US artists are starting to promote overseas more than their home country, and to be honest it’s better, expand your market, improve your fan base and reach out to people who arent lucky enough to visit your shows in the states.
It’s been way too long since Janet’s rocked this side of the pond we all await her return,  That’s the way love goes.
