Outdoor Cinema Food Fest
When you start writing for LAist, you sign a pact in soy chorizo to promote the sacred order of the food truck whenever possible. But so many theaters prohibit bringing in outside food! What to do? If you're the
Outdoor Cinema Food Fest , you bring the film outside to the food! LAist's own Farley Elliot
posted an overview of the fest a few weeks back , and here's this week's delectable details: in celebration of
International Dance Day ,
Moulin Rouge!
screens downtown at Grand Hope Park, accompanied by local piano-rock quartet
The Quiet , free coffee from
Don Francisco's
and
The Buttermilk Truck ,
Calbi BBQ ,
Lake Street Creamery
and
Uncle Lau's BBQ ! Follow
Outdoor Cinema Food Fest on Twitter
for late breaking updates!
Pay tribute to the man who saved the Hollywood sign AND your dad's lonely weekend nights, when
Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and Rebel
screens at the
Nuart
all week. The doc's director and sensational subject will appear at the 7:15 showing on Saturday. Should you require a classy dame to go with the gent, the
Egyptian
hosts
Kim Novak
on Friday as part of their "Platinum Career" tribute series with brand-spankin'-new restorations of
Bell Book & Candle ,
Pal Joey ,
Picnic ,
Middle of the Night , and a gorgeous 70MM print of
Vertigo . Ms. Novak's cinematic costars for the weekend include
Jimmy Stewart ,
Jack Lemmon
and
Ol' Blue Eyes . Or indulge in the classic that never was, when
Laemmle's Sunset
plays the unfinished psychedelic thriller
Henri-Georges Clouzot's "Inferno" .
Full list appears below. Note the asterisks before each title - hopefully this makes the listing easier to read on mobile phones. If so (or if not) let me know. See you at the movies!
