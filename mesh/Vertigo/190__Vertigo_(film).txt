Succes 2011: Clint Eastwood, american film actor, director, producer, composer and politician. Won Academy Awards for Best Director and Producer of the Best Picture, as well as receiving two nominations for Best Actor
Clinton
" Clint "
Eastwood, Jr.
(born May 31,
1930) is an American film actor, director, producer, composer and
politician. Eastwood first came to prominence as a supporting cast
member in the TV series
Rawhide
(1959–1965). He rose to fame for playing the
Man with No Name
in
Sergio Leone 's
Dollars
trilogy
of
spaghetti westerns
( A Fistful of Dollars ,
For a Few Dollars More , and
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly ) during the 1960s, and as
San Francisco Police Department
Inspector
Harry Callahan
in the
Dirty Harry
films ( Dirty Harry ,
Magnum Force ,
The Enforcer ,
Sudden Impact , and
The Dead Pool )
during the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, along with several others in
which he plays tough-talking no-nonsense police officers, have made him
an enduring
cultural icon
of
masculinity .
Eastwood won Academy Awards for
Best Director
and Producer of the
Best Picture , as well as receiving nominations for
Best Actor , for his work in the films
Unforgiven
(1992) and
Million Dollar Baby
(2004). These films in particular, as well as others including
Play Misty for Me
(1971),
The Outlaw Josey Wales
(1976),
Pale Rider
(1985),
In the Line of Fire
(1993),
The Bridges of Madison County
(1995), and
Gran Torino
(2008), have all received commercial success and critical acclaim. Eastwood's only comedies have been
Every Which Way but Loose
(1978), its sequel
Any Which Way You Can
(1980), and
Bronco Billy
(1980); despite being widely panned by critics, the "Any Which Way"
films are the two highest-grossing films of his career after adjusting
for inflation.
Eastwood has directed most of his own
star vehicles , but he has also directed films in which he did not appear such as
Mystic River
(2003) and
Letters from Iwo Jima
(2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations and
Changeling
(2008), which received Golden Globe Award nominations. He has received
considerable critical praise in France in particular, including for
several of his films which were panned in the United States, and was
awarded two of France's highest honors: in 1994 he received the
Ordre des Arts et des Lettres
medal and in 2007 was awarded the
Légion d'honneur
medal. In 2000 he was awarded the Italian
Venice Film Festival
Golden Lion
for lifetime achievement.
Since 1967, Eastwood has run his own production company,
Malpaso , which has produced the vast majority of his films. He also served as the nonpartisan mayor of
Carmel-by-the-Sea, California , from 1986 to 1988. Eastwood has seven children by five different women, and has married twice.
In late 1963 Eastwood's co-star on
Rawhide ,
Eric Fleming , rejected an offer to star in an Italian-made western called
A Fistful of Dollars ; to be directed in a remote region of Spain by
Sergio Leone
who was relatively unknown at the time.
Other actors, including
Charles Bronson ,
Steve Reeves ,
Richard Harrison , Frank Wolfe,
Henry Fonda ,
James Coburn , and
Ty Hardin ,
were also considered for the role. Knowing that he could play a cowboy
convincingly Harrison suggested Eastwood, who in turn saw the film as an
opportunity to escape from
Rawhide . He signed a contract for $15,000 (US$106,211 in 2011 dollars ) in wages for eleven weeks' work with a bonus of a
Mercedes
automobile upon completion and arrived in Rome in May 1964
Eastwood later spoke about the transition from a television western to
A Fistful of Dollars : "In
Rawhide
I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero
who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I decided it
was time to be an anti-hero." Eastwood was instrumental in creating the
Man with No Name
character's distinctive visual style and although a non-smoker, Leone
insisted he smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the "mask" he was
attempting to create with the loner character.
Some interior shots for
A Fistful of Dollars
were done at the
Cinecittà
studio on the outskirts of Rome, before production moved to a small village in
Andalusia ,
Spain .
The film became a benchmark in the development of
spaghetti westerns ,
with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than in
traditional westerns; meanwhile challenging stereotypical American
notions of a western hero by replacing him with a morally ambiguous
antihero . The film's success meant Eastwood became a major star in Italy
and he was re-hired by Leone to star in
For a Few Dollars More
(1965), the second film of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter
Luciano Vincenzoni , the rights to the film and the final film of the trilogy ( The Good, the Bad and the Ugly ) were sold to
United Artists
for roughly $900,000 (US$6.26 million in 2011 dollars.
Eastwood's career reached a turning point in 1971.
Before Irving Leonard died he and Eastwood had discussed the idea of Malpaso producing
Play Misty for Me , a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired and his debut as a director. The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave (Eastwood) who has a casual affair with Evelyn ( Jessica Walter ), a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night asking him to play her favorite song— Erroll Garner 's " Misty ". When Dave ends their relationship the fan becomes violent and murderous.
Filming commenced in
Monterey
in September 1970 and included footage of that year's
Monterey Jazz Festival .
The film was highly acclaimed with critics such as
Jay Cocks
in
Time ,
Andrew Sarris
in the
Village Voice , and Archer Winsten in the
New York Post
all praising the film, as well as Eastwood's directorial skills and performance.
Walter was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress Award (Drama) for her performance in the film.
The script for
Dirty Harry
(1971) was written by
Harry Julian Fink
and Rita M. Fink. It is a story about a hard-edged New York City (later changed to San Francisco) police inspector named
Harry Callahan
who is determined to stop a psychotic killer by any means.
Dirty Harry
is arguably Eastwood's most memorable character and has been credited
with inventing the "loose-cannon cop genre", which is still imitated to
this day.
Author Eric Lichtenfeld argues that Eastwood's role as Dirty Harry
established the "first true archetype" of the action film genre.
His lines (quoted at left) have been cited as among the most memorable
in cinematic history and are regarded by firearms historians, such as
Garry James and Richard Venola, as the force which catapulted the
ownership of
.44 Magnum
pistols to unprecedented heights in the United States; specifically the
Smith & Wesson Model 29
carried by Harry Callahan. Dirty Harry
proved a phenomenal success after its release in December 1971, earning some $22 million (US$119 million in 2011 dollars ) in the United States and Canada alone.
It was Siegel's highest-grossing film and the start of a series of
films featuring the character of Harry Callahan. Although a number of
critics praised his performance as Dirty Harry, such as
Jay Cocks
of
Time
magazine who described him as "giving his best performance so far,
tense, tough, full of implicit identification with his character",
the film was widely criticized and accused of
fascism .
Following
Sean Connery 's announcement that he would not play
James Bond
again Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down because he believed the character should be played by an English actor
He next starred in the loner Western
Joe Kidd
(1972), based on a character inspired by
Reies Lopez Tijerina
who stormed a courthouse in
Tierra Amarilla ,
New Mexico , in June 1967. Filming began in
Old Tucson
in November 1971 under director
John Sturges . During the filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks. [ 114 ]
Joe Kidd
received a mixed reception, with
Roger Greenspun
of
The New York Times
writing that the film was unremarkable, with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing, although he praised Eastwood's performance.
In 1973 Eastwood directed his first western,
High Plains Drifter , in which he starred alongside
Verna Bloom ,
Marianna Hill ,
Billy Curtis ,
Rawhide' s
Paul Brinegar
and
Geoffrey Lewis . The film had a moral and supernatural theme, later emulated in
Pale Rider .
The plot follows a mysterious stranger (Eastwood) who arrives in a
brooding Western town where the people hire him to defend the town
against three felons who are soon to be released. There remains
confusion during the film as to whether the stranger is the brother of
the deputy, whom the felons lynched and murdered, or his ghost. Holes in
the plot were filled with black humor and
allegory , influenced by Leone.
The revisionist film received a mixed reception from critics, but was a
major box office success. A number of critics thought Eastwood's
directing was "as derivative as it was expressive", with
Arthur Knight
of the
Saturday Review
remarking that Eastwood had "absorbed the approaches of Siegel and
Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society".
John Wayne ,
who had declined a role in the film, sent a letter of disapproval to
Eastwood some weeks after the film's release saying that "the
townspeople did not represent the true spirit of the American pioneer,
the spirit that made America great".
Eastwood was then offered the role of
Benjamin L. Willard
in
Francis Coppola 's
Apocalypse Now , but declined as he did not want to spend weeks on location in the
Philippines .
He also refused the part of a platoon leader in
Ted Post 's
Vietnam War
film
Go Tell the Spartans
and instead decided to make a third
Dirty Harry
film
The Enforcer . The film had Harry partnered with a new female officer ( Tyne Daly ) to face a San Francisco Bay area group resembling the
Symbionese Liberation Army . The film, culminating in a shootout on
Alcatraz
island, was considerably shorter than the previous
Dirty Harry
films at 95 minutes, but was a major commercial success grossing $100 million (US$386 million in 2011 dollars ) worldwide to become Eastwood's highest-grossing film to date.
In 1977 he directed and starred in
The Gauntlet
opposite Locke,
Pat Hingle ,
William Prince ,
Bill McKinney , and
Mara Corday .
He portrays a down-and-out cop who falls in love with a prostitute that
he is assigned to escort from Las Vegas to Phoenix, to testify against
the mob. Although a moderate hit with the viewing public critics had
mixed feelings about the film, with many believing it was overly
violent. Eastwood's longtime nemesis
Pauline Kael
called it "a tale varnished with foul language and garnished with
violence". Roger Ebert, on the other hand, gave it three stars and
called it "...classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny."
In 1978 Eastwood starred in
Every Which Way but Loose
alongside Locke, Geoffrey Lewis,
Ruth Gordon
and
John Quade .
In an uncharacteristic offbeat comedy role, Eastwood played Philo
Beddoe, a trucker and brawler who roams the American West searching for a
lost love accompanied by his brother and an
orangutan
called Clyde. The film proved a surprising success upon its release and
became Eastwood's most commercially successful film at the time. Panned
by the critics it ranked high amongst the box office successes of his
career and was the second-highest grossing film of 1978.
Eastwood starred in the atmospheric thriller
Escape from Alcatraz
in 1979, the last of his films to be directed by Don Siegel. It was based on the true story of
Frank Lee Morris
who, along with
John
and
Clarence Anglin , escaped from the notorious
Alcatraz
prison in 1962. The film was a major success and marked the beginning of a period of praise for Eastwood from the critics;
Stanley Kauffmann
of
The New Republic
lauding it as "crystalline cinema"
and
Frank Rich
of
Time
describing it as "cool, cinematic grace"
Eastwood directed and scored the crime drama
Mystic River
(2003), a film about murder, vigilantism, and sexual abuse, set in
Boston . Starring
Sean Penn ,
Kevin Bacon , and
Tim Robbins ,
Mystic River
was lauded by critics and viewers alike. The film won two Academy Awards,
Best Actor
for Penn and
Best Supporting Actor
for Robbins, with Eastwood garnering nominations for
Best Director
and
Best Picture .
Eastwood was named Best Director of the Year by the
London Film Critics Circle
and the
National Society of Film Critics . The film grossed $90 million (US$107 million in 2011 dollars ) domestically on a budget of $30 million (US$35.8 million in 2011 dollars ).
The following year Eastwood found further critical and commercial
success when he directed, produced, scored, and starred in the boxing
drama
Million Dollar Baby , playing a cantankerous trainer who forms a bond with female boxer ( Hilary Swank ) who he is persuaded to train by his lifelong friend ( Morgan Freeman ). The film won four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (Swank), and Best Supporting Actor (Freeman).
At age 74 Eastwood became the oldest of eighteen directors to have directed two or more Best Picture winners. [ 216 ] [ 217 ]
He also received a nomination for Best Actor and a
Grammy
nomination for his score.
A. O. Scott
of
The New York Times
lauded the film as a "masterpiece" and the best film of the year.
In 2006 Eastwood directed two films about World War II's
Battle of Iwo Jima . The first,
Flags of Our Fathers , focused on the men who raised the American flag on top of
Mount Suribachi
and was followed by
Letters from Iwo Jima , which dealt with the tactics of the Japanese soldiers on the island and the letters they wrote home to family members.
Letters from Iwo Jima
was the first American film to depict a war issue completely from the view of an American enemy.
Both films received praise from critics and garnered several nominations at the
79th Academy Awards , including
Best Director ,
Best Picture , and
Best Original Screenplay
for
Letters from Iwo Jima . At the
64th Golden Globe Awards
Eastwood received nominations for
Best Director
in both films.
Letters from Iwo Jima
won the award for
Best Foreign Language Film .
Eastwood next directed
Changeling
(2008), based on a true story set in the late 1920s.
Angelina Jolie
stars as a woman who is reunited with her missing son only to realize that he is an impostor.
After its release at several film festivals the film grossed over $110 million (US$112 million in 2011 dollars ), the majority of which came from foreign markets. The film was highly acclaimed, with Damon Wise of
Empire
describing
Changeling
as "flawless".
Todd McCarthy of
Variety
described it as "emotionally powerful and stylistically sure-handed" and stated that
Changeling
was a more complex and wide-ranging work than Eastwood's
Mystic River , saying the characters and social commentary were brought into the story with an "almost breathtaking deliberation".
Film critic Prairie Miller said that, in its portrayal of female
courage, the film was "about as feminist as Hollywood can get" whilst
David Denby
argued that, like Eastwood's
Million Dollar Baby , the film was "less an expression of feminist awareness than a case of awed respect for a woman who was strong and enduring."
Eastwood received nominations for
Best Original Score
at the
66th Golden Globe Awards ,
Best Direction
at the
62nd British Academy Film Awards
and director of the year from the London Film Critics' Circle.
After four years away from acting Eastwood ended his "self-imposed acting hiatus"
with
Gran Torino , which he also directed, produced, and partly scored with his son Kyle and
Jamie Cullum .
Biographer Marc Eliot called Eastwood's role "an amalgam of the Man
with No Name, Dirty Harry, and William Munny, here aged and cynical but
willing and able to fight on whenever the need arose."
Eastwood has said that the role will most likely be the last time he acts in a film
It grossed close to $30 million (US$30.6 million in 2011 dollars ) during its wide release opening weekend in January 2009, the highest of his career as an actor or director. Gran Torino
eventually grossed over $268 million (US$274 million in 2011 dollars ) in theaters worldwide becoming the highest-grossing film of Eastwood's career so far, without adjustment for
inflation .
His 29th directorial outing came with
Invictus , a film based on the story of the
South African
team at the
1995 Rugby World Cup , with
Morgan Freeman
as
Nelson Mandela
and
Matt Damon
as rugby team captain
François Pienaar . Freeman had bought the film rights to John Carlin's book on which the film is based. The film met with generally positive reviews; Roger Ebert gave it three
and a half stars and described it as a "very good film... with moments
evoking great emotion",
while
Variety ' s
Todd McCarthy wrote, "Inspirational on the face of it, Clint Eastwood's
film has a predictable trajectory, but every scene brims with
surprising details that accumulate into a rich fabric of history,
cultural impressions and emotion."
Eastwood was nominated for
Best Director
at the
67th Golden Globe Awards .

King Michael of Romania, the last surviving head of state from World War II. His Majesty is 90 years old today
Michael (Romanian: Maiestatea Sa Mihai I Regele Românilor, literally "His Majesty Michael I King of the Romanians", born 25 October 1921) was the last King of Romania, reigning from 20 July 1927 to 8 June 1930, and again from 6 September 1940, until forced to abdicate by the communists backed up by orders of Joseph Stalin to the Soviet armies of occupation on 30 December 1947. In addition to being the current holder of the dis-established throne of Romania, he was also a Prince of Hohenzollern until 10 May 2011, when he renounced this title. A great-great-grandson of Queen Victoria by both of his parents, and a third cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, he is one of the last surviving heads of state from World War II, the others being the former King Simeon II of Bulgaria and the former King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia.
Michael was born in the
Foişor Castle
or
Peleş Castle ,
Sinaia , Romania, the son of
Carol II of Romania
(then
Crown Prince
of Romania) and
Princess Elena of Greece . He was born as the grandson of the then-reigning King
Ferdinand of Romania . When Carol II eloped with his mistress
Elena "Magda" Lupescu
and renounced 'temporarily' his rights to the throne in December 1925, Michael was declared the
heir apparent . He succeeded to the throne upon Ferdinand's death in July 1927.
A
regency , which included his uncle,
Prince Nicolae , Patriarch
Miron Cristea , and the country's Chief Justice ( Gheorghe Buzdugan , from October 1929 on
Constantin Sărăţeanu ) functioned on behalf of the 5-year-old Michael during the 1927–1930 period. [10]
In 1930,
Carol II
returned to the country at the invitation of politicians dissatisfied with the Regency, and was proclaimed king by the
Parliament , designating Michael as
Crown Prince
with the title "Grand
Voievod
of
Alba-Iulia ". In November 1939, Michael joined the
Romanian Senate , as the
1938 Constitution
guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching the age of eighteen. In September 1940, the pro- German
anti- Bolshevik
régime of Prime Minister Marshal
Ion Antonescu
staged a
coup d'état
against Carol II, whom the Marshal claimed to be 'anti-German'. Antonescu suspended the Constitution, dissolved the Parliament, and re-installed the 18-year-old Michael as King by popular acclaim. (Although the Constitution was restored in 1944 and the Romanian Parliament in 1946, Michael did not either subsequently take a formal oath or have his reign approved retroactively by Parliament.) Michael was
crowned
with the
Steel Crown
and
anointed
King of Romania by the
Orthodox
Patriarch
of Romania,
Nicodim Munteanu , in the
Patriarchal Cathedral
of
Bucharest , on the day of his accession, 6 September 1940.Although King Michael was formally the Supreme Head of the Army and entitled to appoint the
Prime Minister
with full powers named 'Leader of the people' (" Conducător "), in reality he was forced to remain only a figurehead until August 1944.
In 1944, World War II was going badly for the Axis powers, but the military dictator Prime Minister Marshal Ion Antonescu was still in control of Romania. As of August 1944, the Soviet conquest of Romania had become inevitable, being expected in a few months. On 23 August 1944, Michael joined the pro-Allied politicians, a number of army officers, and armed communist-led civilians in staging a coup against Antonescu, whereas it was recognized in the late 1970s that King Michael ordered his arrest by the Royal Palace Guard. On the same night, the new Prime Minister, Lt. General Constantin Sănătescu—who was appointed by King Michael—gave custody of Antonescu to the communists (in spite of alleged instructions to the contrary by the King), who delivered him to the Soviets on 1 September. In a radio broadcast to the Romanian nation and army, Michael issued a cease-fire just as the Red Army was penetrating the Moldavian front, proclaimed Romania's loyalty to the Allies, announced the acceptance of the armistice offered by Great Britain, the United States, and the USSR, and declared war on Germany. However, this did not avert a rapid Soviet occupation and capture of about 130,000 Romanian soldiers, who were transported to the Soviet Union where many perished in prison camps.Although the country's alliance with the Nazis was ended, the coup sped the Red Army's advance into Romania.The armistice was signed three weeks later on 12 September 1944, on terms the Soviets virtually dictated. Under the terms of the armistice, Romania recognized its defeat by the USSR and was placed under occupation of the Allied forces with the Soviets, as their representative, in control of media, communication, post, and civil administration behind the front. The coup effectively amounted to a "capitulation", an "unconditional" "surrender". It has been suggested that the coup may have shortened World War II by six months, thus saving hundreds of thousands of lives. King Michael was the last monarch behind the Iron Curtain to lose his throne. At the end of the war, King Michael was awarded the highest degree (Chief Commander) of the Legion of Merit by U.S. President Harry S. Truman. He was also decorated with the Soviet Order of Victory by Joseph Stalin "for the courageous act of the radical change in Romania's politics towards a break-up from Hitler's Germany and an alliance with the United Nations, at the moment when there was no clear sign yet of Germany's defeat," according to the official description of the decoration. He is the only surviving recipient as of 2011.
In March 1945, political pressures forced King Michael to appoint a pro-Soviet government dominated by the Romanian Communist Party. Under the communist régime King Michael functioned again as little more than a figurehead. Between August 1945 and January 1946, during what was later known as the "royal strike," King Michael tried unsuccessfully to oppose the first communist government led by the communist Prime Minister Petru Groza, by refusing to sign its decrees. In response to Soviet, British, and American pressures, King Michael eventually gave up his opposition to the communist government and stopped demanding its resignation. He did not pardon former Marshal Antonescu, who was sentenced to death "for betrayal of the Romanian people for the benefit of Nazi Germany, for the economic and political subjugation of Romania to Germany, for cooperation with the Iron Guard, for murdering his political opponents, for the mass murder of civilians and crimes against peace". Nor did King Michael manage to save such leaders of the opposition as Iuliu Maniu and the Bratianus, victims of communist political trials, as the Constitution prevented him from doing so without the counter-signature of communist Justice Minister Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu (who was, himself, later eliminated by Gheorghiu-Dej's opposing communist faction). The memoirs of King Michael's aunt Princess Ileana quote Emil Bodnăraş—her alleged lover,Romania's communist minister of defense, and a Soviet spy—as saying: "Well, if the King decides not to sign the death warrant, I promise that we will uphold his point of view." Princess Ileana was skeptical: "You know quite well (...) that the King will never of his free will sign such an unconstitutional document. If he does, it will be laid at your door, and before the whole nation your government will bear the blame. Surely you do not wish this additional handicap at this moment!"
In November, 1947 King Michael traveled to London for the wedding of his cousins, The Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and The Duke of Edinburgh, an occasion during which he met Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma (his second cousin once removed), who was to become his wife. According to unconfirmed claims by so-called Romanian 'royalists', King Michael did not want to return home, but certain Americans and Britons present at the wedding encouraged him to do so; Winston Churchill is said to have counseled Michael to return because "above all things, a King must be courageous." According to his own account, King Michael rejected any offers of asylum and decided to return to Romania, contrary to the confidential, strong advice of the British Ambassador to Romania. On 30 December 1947 the royal palace was surrounded by the Tudor Vladimirescu army units loyal to the Communists. Michael was forced at gun point (by either Petru Groza or Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, depending on the source) to abdicate Romania's throne. Later the same day, the Communist-dominated government announced the 'permanent' abolition of the monarchy and its replacement by a People's Republic, broadcasting the King's pre-recorded radio proclamation of his own abdication. On 3 January 1948, Michael was forced to leave the country, followed over a week later by Princesses Elisabeth and Ileana, who collaborated so closely with the Soviets they became known as the King's "Red Aunts." According to Michael's own account, the Communist Prime Minister Petru Groza had threatened him at gun point and warned that the government would shoot 1,000 arrested students if the king didn't abdicate. In an interview with The New York Times from 2007, Michael recalls the events: “It was blackmail. They said, ‘If you don’t sign this immediately we are obliged’ — why obliged I don’t know — 'to kill more than 1,000 students' that they had in prison.”According to Time magazine, the communist government threatened Michael that it would arrest thousands and steep the country in blood if he did not abdicate.
However, according to the autobiography of the former head of the Soviet intelligence agency NKVD, Major General Pavel Sudoplatov, the Deputy Soviet Foreign Commissar Andrey Vyshinsky personally conducted negotiations with King Michael for his abdication, guaranteeing part of a pension to be paid to Michael in Mexico. According to a few articles in Jurnalul Naţional, Michael's abdication was negotiated with the Communist government, which allowed him to leave the country with the goods he requested and by some of the royal retinue.
According to the Albanian communist leader Enver Hoxha, who recounts his conversations with the Romanian Communist leaders on the monarch's abdication, King Michael was threatened with a pistol by the Romanian Communist Party leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej rather than Petru Groza so as to abdicate. He was allowed to leave the country accompanied by some of his entourage and, as confirmed also by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev recounting Dej's confessions, with whatever properties he desired, including gold and rubies. Hoxha does say in his book that the Romanian communist leaders had threatened King Michael with their loyal army troops, which had encircled the royal palace and its troops loyal to King Michael.
According to Time magazine, in early 1948 there had been negotiations between King Michael and the communist government over the properties he left behind in Romania and those negotiations delayed his denunciation of the abdication as illegal.
There are reportsthat Romanian communist authorities, obedient to Stalin, allowed King Michael to part with 42 valuable Crown-owned paintings in November 1947, so that he would leave Romania faster. Some of these paintings were reportedly sold through the famed art dealer Daniel Wildenstein. One of the paintings belonging to the Romanian Crown which was supposedly taken out of the country by King Michael in November 1947, returned to Romania in 2004 as a donation made by John Kreuger, the former husband of King Michael's daughter Princess Irina. In 2005 Romanian Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu denied these accusations about King Michael, stating that the Romanian government has no proof of any such action by King Michael and that, prior to 1949, the government had no official records of any artwork taken over from the former royal residences. However, according to some historians, such records existed as early as April 1948, having been, in fact, officially published in June 1948. According to Ivor Porter's authorized biography, Michael of Romania: The King and The Country (2005), which quotes Queen-Mother Helen's daily diary, the Romanian royals took out paintings belonging to the Romanian Royal Crown on their November 1947 trip to London to the wedding of the future Queen Elizabeth II; two of these paintings, signed by El Greco, were sold in 1976. According to recently declassified Foreign Office documents, when he left Romania, the exiled king Michael's only assets amounted to 500,000 Swiss francs. Recently declassified Soviet transcripts of talks between Joseph Stalin and the Romanian Prime-Minister Petru Groza show that shortly before his abdication, King Michael received from the communist government assets amounting to 500,000 Swiss francs. King Michael, however, repeatedly denied that the communist government had allowed him to take into exile any financial assets or valuable goods besides four personal automobiles loaded on two train cars.
In January 1948, Michael began using one of his family's ancestral titles, "Prince of Hohenzollern,"instead of using the title of "King of Romania." After denouncing his abdication as forced and illegal in March 1948, Michael resumed use of the kingly title.
On 10 June 1948 in Athens, Greece, he married Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma (b. Paris, 18 September 1923). They lived first in Britain and later settled in Switzerland. The Communist Romanian authorities illegally stripped him of his Romanian citizenship in 1948. He became a commercial pilot and worked for an aircraft equipment company. He and his wife have five daughters. In 1992, three years after the revolution which overthrew the Communist dictatorship, the Romanian government allowed Michael to return to his country for Easter celebrations, where he drew large crowds. In Bucharest over a million people turned out to see him. Michael's popularity alarmed the government of President Ion Iliescu, so Michael was forbidden to visit Romania again for five years. In 1997, after Iliescu's defeat by Emil Constantinescu, the Romanian Government restored Michael's citizenship and again allowed him to visit the country. He now lives partly in Switzerland at Aubonne and partly in Romania, either at Săvârşin Castle in Arad county or in an official residence in Bucharest—the Elisabeta Palace—voted by the Romanian Parliament by a law concerning arrangements for former heads of state. According to the succession provisions of the Romanian kingdom's last democratically approved monarchical constitution of 1923, upon the death of King Michael without sons, the claim to the Crown devolves once again upon the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family (see "Line of succession to the Romanian throne"). However, on 30 December 2007, on the 60th anniversary of his abdication, King Michael signed the Fundamental Rules of the Royal Family of Romania, by which he designated Princess Margarita as heiress to the throne with the titles of "Crown Princess of Romania" and "Custodian of the Romanian Crown." This act is, during the republican form of government and in the absence of approval by the Parliament, considered to be null and void.On the same occasion, Michael also asked the Romanian Parliament that, should it consider restoring the monarchy, it should also abolish the salic law of succession. Michael participated in the Victory parade in Moscow in 2010 as the only living Supreme Commander-in-Chief of a European State in the Second World War. The name of Michael I is listed on the memorial in the Grand Kremlin Palace as a recipient of the Order of Victory. On 10 May 2011, on a background of lawsuits in Germany brought against his family by his German relatives regarding the former name Hohenzollern-Veringen of his son in law, Radu, and of fears expressed by some that the German Hohenzollerns may claim succession to the headship of the Romanian royal house, Michael severed all of the dynastic and historical ties with the princely house of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, changed the name of his family to "of Romania", and gave up all princely titles conferred to him and to his family by the German Hohenzollerns.
Michael cannot be said to have encouraged monarchist agitation in Romania and royalist parties have made little impact in post-communist Romanian politics. He takes the view that the restoration of the monarchy in Romania can only result from a decision by the Romanian people. "If the people want me to come back, of course, I will come back," he said in 1990. "Romanians have had enough suffering imposed on them to have the right to be consulted on their future." King Michael's belief is that there is still a role for, and value to, the monarchy today: "We are trying to make people understand what the Romanian monarchy was, and what it can still do" (...for them). According to a 2007 opinion poll conducted at the request of the Romanian Royal House, only 14% of Romanians were in favour of the restoration of the monarchy.Another 2008 poll found that only 16% of Romanians are monarchists. Michael has undertaken some quasi-diplomatic roles on behalf of post-communist Romania. In 1997 and 2002 he toured Western Europe, lobbying for Romania's admission into NATO and the European Union, and was received by heads of state and government officials.
In December 2003, allegedly to the "stupefaction of the public opinion in Romania", Michael awarded the "Man of The Year 2003" prize to the then Prime Minister Adrian Năstase, leader of the PSD party, on behalf of the tabloid VIP. The daily Evenimentul Zilei subsequently complained that 'such an activity was unsuited to a king and that Michael was wasting away his prestige', with the majority of the political analysts 'considering his gesture as a fresh abdication'. On October 25, 2011, on the occasion of his 90th birthday, Michael is invited to deliver a speech before the assembled chambers of the Romanian Parliament.
Michael has had a reputation for taciturnity. He once said to his grandmother, "I have learned not to say what I feel, and to smile at those I most hate." Before getting to know his future wife, Anne of Bourbon-Parma, Michael had a romantic relationship with, among others, a Greek woman, Dodo Chrisolegos, a protégée of the former Romanian Communist Party leader Ana Pauker. Some claim that political influences had been exerted upon King Michael through this liaison. Michael was head of the Romanian Boy Scouts in the 1930s. Michael is passionate about cars,especially military jeeps. He is also interested in aircraft, having worked as a commercial flight pilot during his exile.
On 10 May 2007, King Michael received the Prague Society for International Cooperation and Global Panel Foundation's 6th Annual Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award, previously awarded to Vladimir Ashkenazy, Madeleine Albright, Václav Havel, Lord Robertson, and Miloš Forman. On 8 April 2008, King Michael and Patriarch Daniel were elected as Honorary Members of the Romanian Academy.

Succes 2011: Simona Amânar,
romanian gymnast, seven-time Olympic medalist and a ten-time world medalist. A vault element is named after her, the "Amanar"
Simona Amânar
( born October 7, 1979 in
Constanţa ) is a
Romanian
gymnast . She is a seven-time Olympic medalist and a ten-time world medalist. Amânar helped
Romania
to win four consecutive world team titles (1994–1999) as well as the
2000 Olympic team title. She has a vault named after her, the
Amanar . She was inducted into the
International Gymnastics Hall of Fame
in 2007.
In 1994, her first year on the senior national team, she was known
primarily as a team player and contributed to the 1994 World and
European Romanian team titles.
She began to excel as an individual performer at the 1995 European Cup, placing 2nd all-around behind
Svetlana Khorkina ,
as well as winning gold on both vault and floor. She continued her
success at the World Championships that year, helping to secure the
second consecutive World team title for Romania, and became co-world
champion on vault (with all-around champion
Lilia Podkopayeva ).
Amânar had a powerful floor routine and huge vaults that put her in the
lead after two rotations. However, she dropped to fourth overall after
an average bar routine and a shaky beam routine.
Amânar won the silver medal on vault at the individual apparatus at the World Championships behind teammate
Gina Gogean
and ahead of Cuban
Annia Portuondo-Hatch .
At the
1996 Summer Olympics ,
Amânar was one of the front-runners to contend for several individual
medals. However, her Olympics started inauspiciously as she fell off the
beam during the compulsories. Though she would later post the highest
all-around score during the optionals (39.387), she still only placed
fourth amongst her teammates and did not qualify for the all-around
finals. In a scenario similar to the 1992 Olympic substitution by the
Unified Team of
Tatiana Gutsu
for
Rozalia Galiyeva , Amânar replaced her teammate
Alexandra Marinescu ,
which was legal according to the rules at the time. Head coach Octavian
Belu stated that Amânar deserved to compete because she worked harder
and was a better athlete than Marinescu. The decision proved to be sound
as Amânar shared the bronze medal with teammate
Lavinia Miloşovici , behind her other teammate
Gina Gogean .
In both the 1996 Olympic All-Around and the 1995 World Championship
All-Around, Amânar failed to score over the 9.800 mark on the
floor exercise
despite well-executed and extremely difficult tumbling. In Atlanta, she
scored a 9.887 in Optionals (the highest score of the entire Olympics,
on any event, for men or women) and only a 9.737 in the All-Around. She
did not start from a 10.0 in the All-Around despite having the most
tumbling bonus of anyone at the Games (.6 in D and E elements, and .3 in
Connection Value) because her tour-jete half (Strug), a C element, was
not completed or credited. Thus, she did not have enough simple A, B,
and C skills to fulfill her value part requirements and much of her D
and E rated tumbling had to count as these easier elements to fulfill
requirements.
The requirements for the 9.4 Base Score, for each level of
competition, were as follows: Comp I (team optionals): 3-As, 3-Bs, 2-Cs;
Comp II (all-around): 3-As, 3-Bs, 2-Cs, 1-D; Comp III (event finals):
3-As, 3-Bs, 2-Cs, 2-Ds.
Amanar did not perform a double turn in either the team optionals or
the all-around because it was not necessary as long as she completed her
Strug. She included few A, B, and C skills in her routine because her
excess D and E tumbling bonus could count to fulfill these simpler
element requirements. However, when she failed to complete her Strug,
four of her six tenths in D and E elements had to count towards
fulfilling requirements, which left her with only .2 counting towards
her bonus. In that Code of Points, gymnasts needed .3 in D and E skill
bonus, and .3 in Connection Value bonus to start from a 10.0. Without
the error, Amânar would have finished well ahead of her more established
compatriots Gogean and Milosovici. Her failure to score well on the
floor was also evident when she failed to medal on floor at the 1995
Worlds or qualify for the event finals on floor at the 1997 Worlds.
In the event finals in Atlanta, Amânar completed her Strug, added a
double turn to fulfill the more stringent Competition III (event final)
requirements, and earned a 9.850 and the silver medal behind
Lilia Podkopayeva
and just ahead of
Dominique Dawes .
She won the Olympic vault event the day before largely due to a 9.875
for an enormous double-twisting Yurchenko vault. She left the 1996
Olympics with four total medals, including Romania's team bronze.
Amânar would again replace a higher performing Marinescu in the 1997
World All-Around Championships. She won the silver medal behind
Svetlana Khorkina
of Russia. She actually performed better and scored higher than
Khorkina on three of the four pieces, but the discrepancy between their
bars performances gave the title to Khorkina. Amânar's vaulting score
was not as high as in previous all-around competition due to a rule
change that required the athletes to perform two different vaults in
all-around competition. Her second vault—a Phelps—was a considerable
weakness for her due to failing to remain in layout position. She did,
however, unlike most of her competitors, complete the required half turn
onto the horse, twist in the same direction off the horse as she
twisted onto the horse, and twist early enough off the horse to perform
an Arabian front. (Her teammate, 1997 World bronze vault medalist Gina
Gogean, who also won several World and Olympic vault medals, not only
twisted in two different directions, but completed her second half twist
far too late for it to be a true Arabian to front salto; rather than
perform the Phelps with which she was credited, she performed a layout
tsukahara with a half twist). Nevertheless, Amanar won the vault title,
and the victory made her a two-time World champion and Olympic champion
on the event. Romania also won its third straight team title.
In the 1999 World Championships, Amânar lead the team to a fourth
consecutive team title, but fell off the bars during the all-around and
placed well out of the medals. She lost her vaulting title to Russia's
Elena Zamolodchikova , who dominated that event in the following years due to a more difficult second vault - a double twisting
Tsukahara .
Amânar eventually learned this vault by 2000, but only completed it at
the European Championships. Amânar's younger teammates carried the
banner for the Romanians.
Maria Olaru
won the all-around, and
Andreea Răducan
won the title on floor exercise. Amânar won her first ever (and only)
World Championship medal on the floor, taking home the silver behind
Raducan.
At the
2000 Summer Olympics ,
the Romanians once again edged out the Russians to take the team
title—their first since 1984 and their first ever in a non-boycotted
Olympics. The vaulting horse was set too low by the Olympic organizers
before the Women's All-Around. The undisputed favourite for the
all-around title,
Svetlana Khorkina , fell on her signature vault. Several other gymnasts in the competition met peril because of this same
scenario .
Many went on to their next event knowing their medal chances were gone,
only later to be informed of the error and their chance to vault again.
By that point, it was too late. The three Romanian women managed either
to vault well on the faulty vault or to vault after the mistake had
been corrected. They swept the medals, with Răducan winning the title,
followed by Amânar and Olaru.
Răducan had used a cold medicine containing a banned substance.
Although she was not banned and her results in other events were allowed
to stand, Răducan was stripped of her gold medal which went to Amânar.
Initially, Amânar refused to accept the medal, insisting that Răducan
had rightfully earned the title. Teammate
Maria Olaru
took the same stance when the silver was awarded to her, as well. The
two eventually reconsidered, deciding instead to bring the medals home
to Romania as symbolic victories of the team. Amânar later returned the
gold medal to her teammate Răducan. Although Răducan intends to file
paperwork with the
IOC ,
Amanar is still credited as the 2000 All-Around champion. To this day,
Amânar has stated that she firmly believes that Răducan is the true
All-Around Olympic champion and refuses to acknowledge herself as the
winner.
In the event finals, Amânar had the opportunity to defend her Olympic
title from four years earlier. However, she stumbled badly while
debuting a new vault—a 2 1 ⁄ 2
twisting laid-out
Yurchenko ,
which was then named after her, and her medal hopes were erased. She
won the bronze on floor exercise, losing points for a step out of bounds
on her last tumbling pass.
Throughout her career, Amânar was criticized for her stoicism and the robotic qualities to her gymnastics. She did not possess the same elegant style that favored her longtime nemesis
Svetlana Khorkina ,
and perhaps prevented her from ever winning a major all-around title.
She was a power athlete, showing exceptional difficulty on vault and
floor but with less strength on bars and beam. She maintained a hugely
successful career at the highest ranks of the sport for over five years.
Amânar ranks highly on the list
of most medaled gymnasts ever, with 17 World and Olympic medals. Amânar
played a crucial role in the four straight World team titles and
Olympic title which firmly stamped Romania as the number one ranked team
in the world.
A vault element is named after her, the " Amanar ".
Amânar retired in 2000 shortly after the Olympic Games, saying it was
the right time to retire.

Succes 2011: Vera Miles, an american film actress who gained popularity for starring in films such as Psycho, The Searchers, The Wrong Man, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance
Vera Miles
(born August 23, 1930) is an American film actress who gained popularity for starring in films such as
The Searchers ,
The Wrong Man ,
The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance ,
Psycho
and
Psycho II .
Miles was born as
Vera June Ralston
in
Boise City, Oklahoma , the daughter of Burnice ( née
Wyrick) and Thomas Ralston.
She grew up in
Pratt, Kansas , and later, in
Wichita, Kansas , where she worked nights as a
Western Union
operator-typist and graduated from
Wichita North High School
in 1947. She was crowned
Miss Kansas
in 1948, placing third in the
Miss America
contest.
She appeared on the April 4, 1951, edition of the Groucho Marx quiz series
You Bet Your Life
described as "a beauty contest winner". Groucho asks her, "What are
some of the beauty titles you've held?" and she replies, "I was first
Miss Chamber of Commerce and then Miss Wichita and then Miss Kansas and
Miss Texas Grapefruit and recently I've been chosen Miss New Maid
Margarine and I had the honour to represent Kansas in the Miss America
pageant."
She moved to
Los Angeles
where, in 1950, she landed small roles in film and television. These included a minor part as a chorus girl in
Two Tickets to Broadway
(1951), a musical starring
Janet Leigh , with whom Miles would go on to co-star nine years later in the classic
Alfred Hitchcock
film,
Psycho .
Attracting the attention of several producers, the actress was put
under contract at various studios where she posed for cheesecake and
publicity photographs, as was standard procedure for most up-and-coming
Hollywood starlets of the era.
Under contract to
Warner Bros. , Miles was cast in films such as
The Charge At Feather River
in
3-D , but lost out on doing a big 3-D hit starring
Vincent Price ,
House of Wax , for which she was considered. She once recalled: "I was dropped by the best studios in town." In
Tarzan's Hidden Jungle , filmed in 1954 and released in 1955, she played
Tarzan 's love interest (not named "Jane" in this film). In 1954, she married her
Tarzan
co-star,
Gordon Scott ; they divorced in 1959.
Film director
John Ford
chose Miles to star as
Jeffrey Hunter 's love interest in
The Searchers
(1956), starring
John Wayne .
A year later, Miles began a five-year personal contract with Alfred
Hitchcock and was widely publicized as the director's potential
successor to
Grace Kelly . Miles' new mentor directed her in the role of the emotionally troubled new bride of
Ralph Meeker
in the pilot episode of his popular television series
Alfred Hitchcock Presents
(titled "Revenge"). Suitably impressed, Hitchcock directed her on the big screen alongside
Henry Fonda
(who played a New York musician falsely accused of a crime) in
The Wrong Man
(1956).
New York Times
film critic
Bosley Crowther
singled out Miles' performance, writing that she "does convey a
poignantly pitiful sense of fear of the appalling situation into which
they have been cast". Hitchcock undertook a reinvention of his new star
through grooming and wardrobe supervised by
Oscar -winning costume designer
Edith Head .
Production delays and her pregnancy (a son, Michael, with then-husband Gordon Scott) cost Miles the dual leading role opposite
James Stewart
in
Vertigo
(1958), the project Hitchcock designed as a showcase for his new star. The director replaced Miles with
Kim Novak , with whom he had clashed. When asked several years later about Miles by director
François Truffaut
for the book
Hitchcock/Truffaut ,
Hitchcock explained their professional falling-out this way: "She
became pregnant just before the part that was going to turn her into a
star". "After that, I lost interest. I couldn't get the rhythm going
with her again." Miles reflected, "Over the span of years, he's had one
type of woman in his films,
Ingrid Bergman , Grace Kelly and so on, before that, it was
Madeleine Carroll .
I'm not their type and never have been. I tried to please him but I
couldn't. They are all sexy women, but mine is an entirely different
approach".
In 1959, Miles and
Van Johnson
worked together again in
Web of Evidence , which was adapted from
A. J. Cronin 's novel,
Beyond This Place . A year later, Hitchcock cast her as
Lila Crane
in
Psycho
(1960), in which her character discovers the truth about
Norman Bates
and his mother. Miles, while making the thriller, called it "the weirdy of all times".
In 1957, Miles guest starred on
NBC 's
The Steve Allen Show . On January 9, 1958, Miles appeared on NBC's
The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford .
On January 7, 1960, Miles appeared as Jenny Breckenridge in the "Miss Jenny" episode of
Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater
Western
television series on
CBS , opposite
Ben Cooper
in the role of Darryl Thompson and
Jack Elam
as Little Jimmy Lehigh. [3]
The following month she starred in the classic
Twilight Zone
episode " Mirror Image ".
She co-starred with
Susan Hayward
and
John Gavin
in a glossy remake of the melodrama about
adultery ,
Back Street
(1961), directed by
David Miller
and based on the much-filmed 1931 novel by
Fannie Hurst .
Then came another role in a
John Ford
western,
The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance
(1962), with Stewart and
John Wayne
(who compete for her attention). Miles won a Bronze Wrangler citation
from Western Heritage Awards, which she shared with director Ford,
writer James Warner Bellah and her fellow actors, including
Lee Marvin
and
Edmond O'Brien . She would play opposite Wayne again in
Hellfighters
(1968). She also appeared in the TV Western
The Virginian .
In 1966, she would co-star in the movie
Follow Me, Boys!
alongside
Fred MacMurray .
In 1962 and 1963, she appeared on
NBC 's medical drama about
psychiatry ,
The Eleventh Hour ,
in two episodes entitled "Beauty Playing a Mandolin Underneath a Willow
Tree" as Kate Sommers and in "Ann Costigan: A Duel on a Field of White"
as the title character.
She also appeared in an episode of
The Outer Limits
(" The Forms of Things Unknown ") in 1964.
She did a great deal of television work, including a wife being stalked by an abusive husband in the premier episode of
The Fugitive , as an amnesiac in an episode of
Ironside
("Barbara Who", 1968) and as a homicidal beauty-products mogul in one of the
Columbo
episodes, before reprising her most famous role of
Lila Crane
in
Psycho II
(1983). Throughout the 1980s and thereafter, Miles continued to work in both television and film until her retirement in 1995.
Miles resides in
California
and refuses any public relations offers, including interviews and
public appearances and has maintained a low profile since her
retirement.
Miles' first husband was Bob Miles; they were married from 1948–1954
and had two daughters: Debra Miles, born in 1950, and Kelley Miles, born
in 1952.
After their divorce, she was married to
Gordon Scott
from 1954 until 1959, and they had one son, Michael Scott, born in 1957.
After their divorce, she was married to actor
Keith Larsen
from 1960 until 1971, and they had one son, Erik Larsen, born in
Burbank, California
on April 30, 1961. Keith remarried after their divorce in 1971, but Vera remains single.
