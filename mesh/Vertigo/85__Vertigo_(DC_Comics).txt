Quality Comics' guarantee that the partisan superpowers of comics are present in legion:
DC
and
Marvel ’s most recent crops are stocked in abundance, and for the veteran poacher, there’s a gaudy filing system of back issues - everybody from Batman to
Lobo . They even keep their Facebook page updated with  weekly notes
on the state of their collected comicverse; if you can’t find anything immediately, your missing edition is never more than a couple of days away.
Equally notable is QC's dedication to the sharp end of the medium through the
Vertigo
DC imprint and its avant-garde parallels. Barons like Neil Gaiman, Alan Moore and Grant Morrison's latest work is regularly on promenade, and you'll almost always be able to pick up collected editions of '90s essentials like Garth Ennis’
Preacher
and Warren Ellis'
Transmetropolitan .
Cutting-edge cult British weekly
2000AD
even cracks a shelf or two's mention (zarjaz, earthlets!). Sure, QC's manga section is a little skint, but face it: unless you dig schoolgirls, manga's getting
kinda weird
these days anyways.
