Classic
film noir
developed during and after World War II,
taking advantage of the post-war ambience of anxiety, pessimism, and suspicion, and possibly reflecting male fears of female liberation and independence during the war years.
Film noirs first evolved in the 1940s, became prominent in the post-war era, and lasted in a classic "Golden Age" period until about 1960.  A
film noir
story was often developed around a cynical, hard-hearted, disillusioned male character [e.g., Robert Mitchum, Fred MacMurray, or Humphrey Bogart] who encountered a beautiful but promiscuous, amoral, double-dealing and seductive
femme fatale
[e.g., Mary Astor, Veronica Lake, Jane Greer, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Bennett or Lana Turner were the most prominent].
Femme fatale
literally means "killer (or deadly) woman."
The females in
film noir
were either of two types (or archetypes) - dutiful, reliable, trustworthy and loving women; or
femmes fatales
- mysterious, duplicitous, subversive, double-crossing, gorgeous, unloving, predatory, tough-sweet, unreliable, irresponsible, manipulative and desperate women.  Usually, the male protagonist in film noir wished to elude his mysterious past, and had to choose what path to take (or have the fateful choice made for him).
Invariably, the choice would be an overly ambitious one, to follow the dangerous but desirable wishes of these dames.  It would be to follow the goadings of the traitorous, self-destructive
femme fatale
who would lead the struggling, disillusioned, and doomed hero into committing murder or some other crime of passion coupled with twisted love.  When the major character was a detective or private eye, he would become embroiled and trapped in an increasingly-complex, convoluted case that would lead to fatalistic, suffocating evidences of corruption, irresistible love and death.  The
femme fatale , who had also transgressed societal norms with her independent and smart, menacing actions, would bring both of them to a downfall.

Barbara Stanwyck starred as Phyllis Dietrichson in
Double Indemnity
(1944).  Directed by Billy Wilder, it "a cynical, witty, and sleazy thriller about adultery, corruption and murder."  Stanwyck's
character
was based on the true story of murderer Ruth Snyder.  Photo credit:

Why aren't more such movies being made in recent years?  This article in
The Independent
(U.K.) newspaper
looked at the reasons
Sultry, smouldering temptresses lit up the screen in cinema's golden age -- but where are they now?
They came prowling out of the shadows, wreathed in smoke, wisecracks and stolen mink; women no better than they should be, with only trouble in mind. They never needed to diet, displayed but a flickering interest in men for money, power and meaningless sex, and were more likely to accessorise with a gun than a Chihuahua...
Woman wield power now in more direct -- but perhaps more mundane -- ways.
"Maybe you could argue that it's a good thing there aren't so many femmes fatales, because they are so much defined by their relationship to men," Billson says.  "Their entire
raison d'etre
is to seduce and destroy them.  I know one whose whole life was based on making erotic conquests.  Because she was so beautiful, she never needed to work on her skills, or personality, or interests, or independence."  Still, Billson agrees, the world is a less exciting place without such seductresses.
Rita Hayworth in
Gilda
(1946), a black-and-white film noir directed by Charles Vidor, in which Hayworth performed a legendary one-glove striptease that made her into a cultural icon as the ultimate femme fatale.  Article and Photo credit:
The Independent, U.K.
In addition to the classic
femme fatale
movies from the 1940's and 1950's, I have also included several made in later decades.  In no particular order, here are some of the better-known movies in this genre:
Double Indemnity
(1944),
Body Heat
(1981),
The Postman Always Rings Twice
(1946),
Chinatown
(1974) ...
Body Heat
(1981) is a dramatic, modern day film noir, set in the hot atmosphere of Miranda Beach, Florida.
The alluring, crafty, and sultry femme fatale "Matty Walker" (Kathleen Turner, who spoofed her own role in The Man With Two Brains (1983)) seduces corruptible, dim-witted, naive, and incompetent attorney Ned Racine (William Hurt), to convince him to kill her husband Edmund (Richard Crenna). She is interested in Ned because he isn't very intelligent:
You're not too smart, are you?  I like that in a man.
She uses everything as an instrument of seduction, including incredibly sweaty and sexy love-making and lewd suggestive dialogue, to manipulate his emotions so that he will help plot the murder:  "Do it!"  "I need you so badly."  "I want you right now more than I ever have!"  "I'd kill myself if I thought this thing would destroy us."  He complains: "I'm red; I'm sore." "You shouldn't wear that body!"
link
Body Heat
was Kathleen Turner's film debut.  Her voice
was described
by an interviewer as "filled with the low timbre of temptation that it could... drive a bishop to kick out a stained-glass window".  Photo credit:
The Independent, U.K.
The Postman Always Rings Twice
(1946) is one of the best
film noirs
of all time - and one of the earliest prototypes of today's 'erotic thrillers.'  The screenplay (by Harry Ruskin and Niven Busch) was based on the controversial first novel/pot-boiler (1934) of the same name by notorious writer James M. Cain.  Cain was known for novels with forbidden lust, love triangles, brutal, raw sexiness, and adultery-motivated murder. Two previous, sexually-charged classic
film noirs
adapted from Cain's novels had met with both critical and box-office success: MGM's
Double Indemnity
(1944) and Warner Bros.'
Mildred Pierce
(1945).
This fatalistic film from director Tay Garnett is best known for one of the hottest portrayals of a sultry and seductive
femme fatale
- it is one of Lana Turner's finest performances.  The film was advertised with posters that described the illicit passion between a drifter (Garfield) and a married-unsatisfied waitress (Turner) in a roadside cafe: "Their Love was a Flame that Destroyed!"  Their killing of the woman's husband ultimately leads to their mutual destruction in unexpected ways.   This great and sexy
film noir , however, received not even one Academy Award nomination.
link
Chinatown
(1974) is a superb, private eye mystery and modern-day film noir thriller.  Its original, award-winning screenplay by Robert Towne is
a throwback that pays homage to the best Hollywood film noirs from the pens of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler in the 30s and 40s.
The film declined to provide a tagline, instead choosing imagery over words on its poster, which featured in 40's art deco, the detective - his back facing the viewer, smoking a cigarette, with the smoke emanating from it forming the visage of the heroine, signifying the setting, the mood, and symbolism of the film without uttering a single phrase...
The film marked French-born Polish director Roman Polanski's return to Hollywood five years after the gruesome 1969 Manson murders that took the life of his actress wife Sharon Tate.  Polanski opted to use a bleak ending rather than the more hopeful finale in the original screenplay, presumably because of his life's tragedies.  Only a few years later, in 1978, he would be indicted and convicted with the 1977 statutory rape (and drugging) of a 13 year-old girl (later identified as Samantha Geimer) while at the home of star/actor Jack Nicholson (absent at the time), and had to flee to Europe as a fugitive.  This was Polanski's last film made on location in the US.

More Tagging tips:
A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?
Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.
If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the office.
CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.
Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably not meaningful.
Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary:
Civil Rights ,
Community ,
Congress ,
Culture ,
Economy ,
Education ,
Elections ,
Energy ,
Environment ,
Health Care ,
International ,
Labor ,
Law ,
Media ,
Meta ,
National Security ,
Science ,
Transportation , or
White House .
If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
( California ,
Texas , etc).
Keep in mind, though, that there are many wonderful and important diaries
that don't fit in any of these tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:
Are you sure you want to remove this diary from your hotlist?

... in
an earlier era?
The femme fatale is perhaps the earliest example of Hollywood portraying a strong female character.  Rather than be at the mercy of their leading men these ladies were willing to use their sexuality and charm to outwit and overpower even the strongest of masculine wills. While initially they were merely the punch line in morality tales around the evil perversive power of women, they
evolved to show that being tough-ass and smoking hot are not mutually exclusive.
Tips and the like here.  Thanks.

As you all probably know by now, film noir is my thing. Everything that happened to film making since the breakdown of the studio system and the complete dominance of method acting just kills my buzz. I like the old school: well-practiced stares...dramatic turns...dialogue meant to tell a story rather than convince me that what I'm seeing is real.
I voted for Barbara Stanwyck, naturally. When she and Fred McMurray have it out in their final scene and she's sitting there smoking...man...now thats FILMMAKING.
I could throw in a few others, like Marilyn Monroe in Niagra (that bell tower scene!!! MASTERPIECE!!!), or Mary Astor in The Maltese Falcon, but this diary deserves all the shine.

"Yanna knock him off dontcha?" (kill your husband)
"Listen up baby....you can't get away with it"
And then she looks and him and says "get out."
"you bet I'll get out of here baby. I'll get out of here but quick!"

I've seen some of these so many times that I quit watching the film for the big stuff and just pick an actor and watch for the small stuff.  Had a discussion about Marilyn's acting with Himself ("good" or "bad") when I pointed out the scene in
Niagra
where all the folks get together to play their favorite albums.  Notice what Marilyn does with the scene.  Her character is so jumpy that she's drumming her fingers in her vinyl.  No one does that to their favorite record!

I detest most special effects.  The only films in which special effects work are the Harry Potter series because the films follow the books.
Car crashes and explosions and bodies blowing up and blood spurting is NOT necessary to carry a storyline along!  They're just time-wasters and fillers to carry a boring script.  The crashes and explosions could be done away with by inserting one or two sentences in the dialogue.
I much prefer the ancient
plot/dramatic structure
as defined by Aristotle in
Poetics
(ca 335 BCE).
" A whole is what has a beginning and middle and end ."
Aristotle
Give me Shakespearean classics any day of the week!  Now
there's
plot structure!

The obsession about wanting to recapture what is lost. What an incredible insight into the human psyche. The scene in Judy's hotel where she becomes Madeleine..no words spoken..just the theme music Scene D'Amour.
But I'm not sure I see it as a femme fatale movie.

I always liked
Kim Novak .  She is one of the actresses with those classic good looks and the fantastic bone structure that photographs well from any angle...!  She married a veterinarian and they moved to Oregon where she also does her painting.  She's still beautiful, even in her old age.
Ditto classical good looks for my all-time favorite
Audrey Hepburn .  The woman could not take a bad photo if she tried.
I loved Kim Novak in
Bell, Book and Candle .  The link is to the preview of the movie which has James Stewart and Jack Lemmon in it, too.
Here's the " spell scene " where Kim Novak - with Pyewacket, the Siamese cat - puts a spell on Jimmy Stewart....
The full movie of
Bell, Book, and Candle
is on YouTube in sixteen parts if anyone wants to go through all the links....

... for
her role in
Vertigo
In 1958, Novak starred in the Alfred Hitchcock-directed classic thriller
Vertigo , playing the roles of a brunette shopgirl, Judy Barton, and a blonde woman named Madeleine Elster.
Today, the film is considered a masterpiece of romantic suspense, though Novak's performance has received mixed reviews.  Critic David Shipman thought it "little more than competent", while David Thomson sees it as "one of the major female performances in the cinema". Hitchcock, rarely one to praise actors, dismissed Novak in a later interview. "You think you're getting a lot," he said of her ability, "but you're not."

' Fatal Attraction ' is an interesting one in that for two-thirds of the film the protagonist is arguably the asshole of the picture.
Michael Douglas' character cheats on his wife with a disturbed woman that he wants to ditch & forget about almost as soon as he screwed her. Glenn Close's Alex is nuts, but she does have a reason to " not be ignored " since she's pregnant with his kid.
However, whatever sympathy the audience might have for the character goes out the window as soon as the rabbit ends up on the stove.
At that point, she's the villain of the picture & the audience wants her dead.

so I didn't feel I could vote, but Linda Fiorentino in "The Last Seduction" was even more evil than the other flicks I HAVE seen. I am a big fan of the old "studio system" movies as BBB refers to them, but Fiorentino actually had me ROOTING for her in spite of her malevolence. I think that's what did it for me.
All excellent films, though and some stunning women!

I think part of the reason people can root for Fiorentino's character in that movie is that almost every other character is arguably as bad as she is... just dumber.
Peter Berg's character is almost " too dumb to live ."

but
Vertigo
is a masterpiece, arguably Hitchcock's best, and even though Kim Novak definitely fits the
fatale
mode, the film's many great qualities (that music!) transcends genres.
Kudos for including
Last Seduction
though. Linda Fiorentino absolutely burns through the screen (though Dahl's
Red Rock West
is even better).
I'd also say that
Play Misty
and
Fatal Attraction
are kind of a sub-genre.  In classic Fatale noir, like
Body Heat
and Double Indemnity, the woman is a cool killer, using the guy as her weapon and always keeping her cool.  In Misty and Attraction, the women are out-of-control psychos.
If you want to go way back, you might include
Pandora's Box , with the dazzling
Louise Brooks.
Thanks for reminding me how much I love movies.

She had to have been among the very first screen femme fatales.

N by NW is great
( 2+ / 0- )
Recommended by:

but for sheer structure, end-to-end suspense, great lurid color and the amazing score, not to mention the way it compels suspension of disbelief, I have to go with Vertigo.  N by NW is leavened with more humor, but while that adds something, it dampens the suspense.  On the other hand, it deserves points for casting the young Martin Landau as a thug.

The old attention span problem for our youth doesn't apply to this classic. The action is non-stop here.

John Huston plays one of the most evil characters ever.
And for high impact scenes, Nicholson and Dunaway's "my sister, my daughter" is unsurpassed.

between
Body Heat
and
The Last Seduction .  Both femme fatale leads are incredibly strong and smart.  I had to go with
Body Heat
just because of that singular scene where William Hurt breaks into her house to be with her.  So incredibly hot!

has got to be a two-timing, double-dealing, back-stabbing murderess. They've gotta have brains.
She also has to be ridiculously sexy. But she can't just be a run of the mill slut. Not at all. The femme fatale is selective. In fact, the femme fatale doesn't really care about sex at all, except as means to get something they really want. Mainly "the dough." But that doesn't stop them from being good at it!
She's also got to be a good actress, so that she can convince even tough-minded. Guys who can clearly see what they're all about still get sucked into go along with their schemes.
