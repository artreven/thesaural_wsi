This is the 100 Bullets thread.
Stolen from Wikipedia.
100 Bullets
is an
Eisner
and
Harvey Award -winning
comic book
written by
Brian Azzarello
and illustrated by
Eduardo Risso . It is published by
DC Comics
under its
Vertigo
imprint and is slated to run for 100 issues.
The plot of
100 Bullets
hinges on the question of whether people would take the chance to get away with revenge. Occasionally in a given story arc, the mysterious
Agent Graves
approaches someone who has been wronged in some way, and gives them the chance to set things right in the form of a nondescript
attachÃ© case
containing a
handgun , 100 bullets, the identity of the person who ruined their life and irrefutable evidence of this. He informs the candidate that the bullets are completely untraceable, and any police agency that recovers these bullets as part of an investigation will, through some unexplained process, immediately drop that investigation and ignore any transgressions related to it.
Though all of the murders enabled by Agent Graves are presented as justifiable, the candidates are neither rewarded nor punished for taking up the offer, and appear to receive nothing other than closure for their actions. Several people have declined the offer.
Agent Graves was the leader of a group known as "The Minutemen", the enforcers and assassins for the shadowy organization known as " The Trust ". The Trust was originally formed by the heads of 13 powerful European aristocratic families who offered to the kings of
Europe
to abandon the " Old World ", where they had considerable influence and holdings, in exchange for complete autonomy in the still unclaimed portion of the " New World ". When England ignored this proposition and colonized
Roanoke Island
late in the 16th century, the Minutemen were formed. The original Minutemen, seven vicious killers, eradicated the colony and left behind the message " Croatoa " as a warning. Since that time, the Minutemen's charge has been to protect the 13 Trust families from outside threats as well as from each other. They were betrayed by the Trust and disbanded after Agent Graves refused to re-enact "The Greatest Crime in the History of Mankind". Some of the former Minutemen had their memories wiped for their protection and were living normal, if lackluster, lives at the beginning of the story.
Many of those who are offered the chance for vengeance by Graves are actually former Minutemen, or people who have been wronged by the Trust or its agents. Trusting to luck and the importance of his "experiment", Agent Graves goes on to reactivate several former Minutemen and recruit potential new members during the course of the series, with the tentative help of the Trust's warlord, the shady and double-dealing
Mr. Shepherd .
I stopped reading this series for a while, mainly because of a lack of money. However, in the past week I've bought a few more trades so I can continue on.
I just finished The Counterfifth Detective, and to be honest, I have no real concrete idea of what was happening in that story arc. I enjoyed reading it, but the plot itself seemed to be very scattered. Anyone care to summarize it for me?

I've not read them all yet myself (Trades 1-3 and 6... don't ask), but I think it's along these lines:
Spoiler:
After being betrayed by the Trust during the fiasco in Atlantic City, Graves is now planning his revenge upon the heads of the families running the Trust by either reactivating the Minuteman (such as the case was with Cole), or recruiting new ones (Dizzy and Loop).
However, when he does present someone with an attache case, it does not necessarily mean that they are to join the Minutemen or that they were one - he also uses it as a way of clearing out some of the Trust members (though I'm not too sure about Heartbreak, Sunnyside Up).
Unfortunately, his right-hand man, Sheppard, is playing both sides, and possibly influencing several of the people Graves is recruiting.

the gist is that
Spoiler:
milo used to be a minuteman.
he was there in atlantic city, shut down like all the other minutemen and then reactivated when he saw the painting megan had.
graves was trying to bring him back, but milo decided he hated his old life and was so angry that he wouldn't be able to live out his new life as a detective (which he really enjoyed) that he let his former best friend kill him.
that's why he left the bandages on when he didn't really need to, so lono wouldn't recognize him.
milo decided to die.
basically there wasn't a LOT of connection with the bigger storyarc (beyond some minor trust stuff).
it was mostly just about the one minuteman who didn't want his job anymore.
and the actual mystery itself isn't necessarily meant to make sense.
that particular storyarc was a noir pastiche.
often in noir the mystery itself is really an afterthought, a reason to meet all these shitty people in this shitty place and see all the shitty things they do to their souls.

100 bullets is really awesome, especially the art. I have been reading it very slowly, as I own I think four of the trades and I have borrowed three or four more from the library. The individual stories are generally awesome, but I have a hell of a time keeping the bigger plots straight. Reading the books in such a spread out fashion probably doesn't help.
