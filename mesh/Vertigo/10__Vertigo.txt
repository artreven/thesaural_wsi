Janet Jackson Readies European Tour For 2010
Pop & RnB Goddess
Janet Jackson
has revealed in an interview with the
The Times
newspaper (UK) that she is planning a European tour in 2010.  It has been over 9 years since Janet has embarked on a European leg, the last time was for
“The Velvet Rope”
tour in 1998. Her last tour
“Rock Witchu”  for 2008’s LP
“Discipline”  was planned to be worldwide but was cancelled due to her coming down with
Vertigo , an illness which could be detrimental for a performer who dances around as much as she does.
As mega Janet fan I’m sure you know I’m screaming right now, really and truly this is what Janet needs I think
f*ck
the US they dont even know good music anymore, all their wrapped up in is whose shaking there
coochie
in a video. Tut!.
Funny enough I’m not too surprised shes taking it over here I’ve noticed a lot of US artists are starting to promote overseas more than their home country, and to be honest it’s better, expand your market, improve your fan base and reach out to people who arent lucky enough to visit your shows in the states.
It’s been way too long since Janet’s rocked this side of the pond we all await her return,  That’s the way love goes.
