Rooftopping Toronto: Spadina & Front, an Unfinished View

Quite early one Sunday morning, we traveled down to the base of the city where Spadina and Front Street collide. Cautiously, we made our way around,
then over, and finally up our incomplete playground. Hanging over the street on an unfinished balcony, we snapped a few images before making our laborious ascent.
Continuing onward and upward, something seemed off; although my aching legs told me otherwise, it didn't seem as though we were as high as we ought to have been. The sight of a vertical ship-ladder, usually a sign that our work was about to pay off, informed us instead of what I had feared - we were on the wrong roof.
After a few more quick snaps, it was time to re-trace our steps in order to achieve our lofty goal...
Peering over the edge of yet another balcony, I couldn't help but feel a bit of
Vertigo ...
As we surpassed adjacent condominiums, floor after floor, an absolutely stunning view of the city slowly began to emerge.
Finally at the (then) unfinished summit, we took a look at our old pointy friend to the east...
More stunning still was the westward view. This area seemed so beautifully under-developed and natural; the highway and train-tracks snaked their way into the horizon, and the clang of a streetcar could be heard as it crossed a bridge on Bathurst, far off in the distance.
After one last pause to cast a final westward eye, we made our hasty exit.
(To see the rest of the set of photos from this amazing height, as well as high-resolution versions of the images above, you may view the slide show below.)

ForeveR: Did you ever play the video-game DOOM II? It's IDCLIP to get into the place, and then IDFA for keys

Thanks for sharing Jonathan. Great story.
You said it best too when you wrote: " This area seemed so beautifully under-developed and natural".
Unfortunately, this area will all be condo-ized(or is now)

I suppose that IDKFA gives you all the lenses? :)

Any indication as to whether any of the roofs of these new condo developments will be green, with either some sort of grass covering, to keep heat from leaking out and absorbing moisture build up, thus preventing deterioration from water buildup caused by rainfall, or solar collectors?

Sniderscion: hahahahah - I'm glad someone got that one; all of the shots were actually taken with a canon SD750...you know, 'those cameras that bitches be pullin' out in bars and shit'; I cannot wait for good weather so that I can use some decent lenses on my DSLR at locations like this...
Christopher: it's funny, it turns out I know someone who lives in the building now - ha - anyhow, I would love to see more rooftop green-space; people don't 'use' roofs, and yet they take up so much space (just ask birds); the building is still incomplete, but I believe that the penthouses will have shared gardens.
