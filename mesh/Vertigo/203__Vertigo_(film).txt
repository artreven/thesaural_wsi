Study of a Single Film: Forbidden Planet (in memory of Leslie Nielsen)
Leslie Nielsen
and
Anne Francis
star in
Forbidden Planet
( Fred M. Wilcox , 1956)
Film Studies For Free
was
sad to hear
that the king of
deadpan movie humour , actor
Leslie Nielsen , has died at the age of 84. Of all the films he starred in, the one that has most often been the subject of scholarly studies was the hugely influential science fiction movie
Forbidden Planet , a film in which Nielsen played a sincerely serious role.
In (metonymic) memory of Nielsen's wonderful career (the straight part standing for the mostly comic whole),
FSFF
has assembled a list of links to openly accessible academic studies of this 1956 film. With its groundbreaking electronic music score by
Louis and Bebe Barron , its
highly personable robot
character, its loose adaptation of a high culture text ( Shakespeare 's
The Tempest ), and its well elaborated allusions to classical (and post-classical) mythology, as well as to
Freud
(the
Id monster ),
Forbidden Planet
will probably keep film academics in business for quite some time. But,
FSFF
hopes some will also turn their attention to Nielsen's comic performances, before too long.
Shirley , they merit that, at the very least.

Wide Screen Journal on Film Production Studies
Javier Casanova in
Vainilla Chip
(Erik Knudsen, 2009) Watch
this film here
(or
here ) and read
Knudsen's article
on his work
Set in the small Cuban town of San Antonio de los Baños, just outside
Havana,
Vainilla Chip
tells the story of an ordinary day for an elderly
ice cream maker, Javier Rodriguez Casanova. An ordinary day which, like
all the other ordinary days, has become painfully pierced by an acute
sense of longing for his deceased wife.
This film is an intimate portrait of a hard working man in a
contemporary Cuba far removed from clichés of The Revolution and
romanticised memories of Cuban music.
Vainilla Chip
brings the
musicality of one ordinary man’s life to the fore to reveal a universal
struggle affecting many people across cultural and political divides. [ Erik Knudsen ] We
often hear that the power of films lays in their emotional impact. In
recent years, some corners of film studies have been preoccupied with
the
investigation of the senses and the body, which could be related
to
the view of films in terms of emotions and affect. Much of the
filmmaking process rests on creating and
communicating this emotional
power of the films. Instead of thinking,
like
Powdermaker did, that
the film workers are collectively involved in
story-telling, or like
Bordwell, Thompson and Staiger, that they are
preoccupied
with the
generation of a particular style of filmmaking, we would like
to argue
that films are collectively involved in generating, assembling
and
crafting the emotion of the film.

New Screening the Past
Image from
The Portraitist / Portrecista
( Ireneusz Dobrowolski , 2005),  Read
Frances Guerin's essay
on this film.
The developments of new digital technologies and representational forms have revived interest between photography and cinema, an interest that is both creative and critical. Independent filmmakers are availing themselves of alternative exhibition formats and spaces for their work, and moving image experimentation is now commonplace in the fields of contemporary fine art, design, music, and theatre.
For this Special Issue of
Screening the Past , guest editors Des O’Rawe and Sam Rohdie bring together a collection of original articles on the aesthetic and institutional relations between film, photography, and the visual arts, in particular writing that is attentive to cinematic forms and their recon­figuration within the contemporary visual arts.
As always,
Film Studies For Free 's little beating heart almost leapt out of its digital body at the news that a new issue of the
Screening the Past
journal had hit the e-stands. It's a special issue, the theme of which is
Cinema/Photography: Beyond Representation   (Issue 29, 2010 ).  Below is the table of contents:
George Kouvaros: He’s Not There: Robert Frank’s Me and My Brother.
Lara Thompson: Monochrome Now: Digital Black and White Cinema and the Photographic Past.
Sarinah Masukor: The Album of Everyday Life: The Photograph in the Films of Nuri Bilge Ceylan.

Study of a Single Film: Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo
Finding Equilibrium in Hitchcock's Vertigo
Roundtable discussion at the
Philoctetes Center , New York, on November 6, 2010, with Richard Allen, John Belton, Joe McElhaney, Edward Neresessian, and Brigitte Peucker
Vertigo
(1958) is the
Hitchcock
film in which the confusion of
ontological registers—of reality with illusion—takes center stage.
Indeed, it’s a case study of someone for whom this confusion is nearly
pathological. The
James Stewart
character, Scottie, is duped by a
performance with criminal intent, as he falls for a woman he believes to
be Madeleine, but who in reality is a woman named Judy (played by
Kim
Novak ) perpetrating a masquerade. Around this “false” Madeleine, a
narrative is created that's designed to ensnare Scottie. The film
concerns a mysterious case of “possession”—a staged fascination with
death—played out in a series of silent tableaux, each of which
aestheticizes and eroticizes the Madeleine figure. The film's narrative
structure is circular and repetitive; it's been suggested that the film
itself represents a distinct form of madness. " Vertigo
is just a movie," writes
Stanley Cavell
in
The World Viewed ,
"but no other movie I know so purely conveys the sealing of a mind
within a scorching fantasy." What is the role of psychoanalysis in
Hitchcock's work? Is psychoanalysis merely one "surface feature" of
Hitchcock's work, as Richard Allen has suggested, subject to irony like
all the others? What draws psychoanalytic critics to Hitchcock's work,
and how, if at all, is this phenomenon related to its modernism? [ Philoctetes Center ] Film Studies For Free
brings you one of its regular link-fests pertaining to the study of a single film: today, it's the turn of
Alfred
Hitchcock 's truly magical thriller
Vertigo
(1958) .
The below list of openly-accessible resources was very much inspired by the recent posting of a hugely entertaining, and vertiginously brilliant, discussion on this film between some of
the most able Film Studies academics and writers of their generation
(see above). The discussion was hosted by the wonderful people at the
Philoctetes Center
in New York City. Thanks so much to them for making this video available for all to watch and learn from.

On Jean-Luc Godard's Sauve qui peut (la vie)
Film Studies For Free
is delighted to pass on word of an excellent
new
website dedicated to the study of
Jean-Luc Godard 's 1980 film
Sauve qui peut (la vie)/ Every Man for Himself / Slow Motion
(co-scripted by Godard with
Jean-Claude Carrière
and
Anne-Marie Miéville ). The website joins existing, brilliant, online Godard resources, like
Glen W. Norton's
Cinema = Godard = Cinema , first established in 1996.
The new site is the
Every Man For Himself Resource Archive
that gathers links to (almost) every online item of note pertaining to this film in one, elegant, supremely useful space. This is a must-visit recommendation, especially given that this film has just been
re-released in some cinemas
( in a new 35mm print)
in the USA.
Here are direct links to two articles on the film that
EMFH
doesn't yet list (but which
FSFF
is hopeful that it will add!)
James Roy MacBean, 'Sauve qui peut (la vie): An Open Letter to Godard', Jump
Cut, no. 31, March 1986, pp. 7-12
Richard Morris, '"To Realise the Ideal": Miscellaneous Remarks on Godard's Conceptual Processes Apropos of
Sauve qui peut (la vie) ', Film Studies, Vol. 5 (Winter 2004),
(pp 1-7)
There is also a really interesting discussion by David Bordwell of studies of Godard's film online here: David Bordwell, 'Historical Poetics of Cinema', in The Cinematic Text: Methods and Approaches, ed. R. Barton Palmer ( (New York: AMS Press, 1989 ) [scroll to p. 383]
There are also numerous references to Godard's film in the following online book (just search " Sauve " in your browser's "Find [on page]" facility:  Robert Philip Kolker, The Altering Eye:
Contemporary International Cinema
(1983)
Below are all the excellent scholarly essays that

Great e-Books on British and American cinema, and film theory and history
Image from
Pleasantville
( Gary Ross , 1998) [Read Paul Grainge's wonderful essay
'Colouring the past:
Pleasantville
and the textuality of media memory' linked to below]
Film Studies For Free
today sings the praises of the
very
marvellous
Manchester University Press .
MUP
has an excellent record in
Open Access publishing , and especially in
Film Studies OA journal publishing , as
previously reported
by
FSFF . But it is also in the process of making some of its full-length film books freely accessible.
So far, there are two books available, one
on British cinema
and one on
memory and popular cinema .
Direct links to the PDF files of both books and full tables of their contents and contributors are given below. These links have also been added to
FSFF 's  permanent, and frequently updated, listing of
Open Access film and moving image studies e-books , which now links to
90
free, scholarly tomes.
Paul Grainge (ed.), Memory and Popular Film (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2003)
'Memory and popular film' uses memory as a specific
framework for the cultural study of film. Taking Hollywood as its focus,
this timely book provides a sustained, interdisciplinary perspective on
memory and film from early cinema to the present. Considering the
relationship between official and popular memory, the politics of
memory, and the technological and representational shifts that have come
to effect memory's contemporary mediation, the book contributes to the
growing debate on the status and function of the past in cultural life
and discourse. By gathering key critics from film studies, American
studies and cultural studies, 'Memory and popular film' establishes a
framework for discussing issues of memory IN film and of film AS memory.
Together with essays on the remembered past in early film marketing,
within popular reminiscence, and at film festivals, the book considers
memory films such as
Forrest Gump ,
Lone Star ,
Pleasantville ,
Rosewood
and
Jackie Brown . 'Memory and popular film' provides a wide-ranging
analysis that will benefit both students and critics of popular culture,
film studies and the past.

In the Hands of Fate: Existentialism in Film
Image from
I’m a Fugitive from a Chain Gang
( Mervyn LeRoy , 1932) [See Sam Mithani's thesis,
The Hollywood Left: Cinematic Art and Activism in the 1930s
for reflections on the existentialism of this film's director]
Viewing (30:43): In the Hands of Fate: Existentialism in Film (October 18, 2010) Cinema condenses actions and their consequences. It puts
the viewer into someone else's shoes. Dilemmas tend to be urgent,
up-close and personal: ergo, all films are existential. But several
films in this year's [ London Film Festival ] programme specifically emphasise philosophical
struggles with circumstance.
Veiko Õunpuu 's
The Temptation of St Tony
makes drama out of the very discourse of
existential
thought.
Xavier Beauvois '
Of Gods and Men
follows monks whose faith is shaken by fear of execution.
Michelangelo Frammartino 's
Le Quattro Volte
links a dying man's end, to the fate of a lost kid (as in goat) and a
felled tree. Finally, the dying man in
Apichatpong Weerasethakul 's
Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives
accepts his fate yet the past makes its own demands on him. It's more
than just mortal thoughts that brings these films together; it's a
heightened sensitivity to our sense of purpose. We are very excited that
directors
Apichatpong Weerasethakul
and
Michelangelo Frammartino
[joined]
Dr David Sorfa
(Senior lecturer in Film Studies at Liverpool John
Moores University and managing editor of the journal,
Film-Philosophy ) on
a panel
chaired by
Ian Haydn Smith , Editor of
International Film Guide . Film Studies For Free
wanted to alert its readers to the
above linked-to, wonderful BFI video
on the topic of  existentialism and cinema. In its usual
good faith , and as a perfect accompaniment,
FSFF
also brings you a little list of links to great, openly accessible, scholarly reading, much of it book-length, on the very same theme.
