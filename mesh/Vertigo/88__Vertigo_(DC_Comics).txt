Exclusive Interview with Rick Veitch about War Comics
At Bristol Comic
Expo last year I managed to briefly interview one of my comic book heroes,
Rick Veitch . Veitch has been at the forefront of experimental comics for over 25
years, consistently pushing the boundaries of the medium, in terms of subject
matter, art and design. I first discovered his work in the pages of
Epic Illustrated
with his
psychedelic retelling of
Moby Dick ,
Abraxas and the Earthman . Then I devoured his “trilogy” of
deconstructions of the superhero genre;
The One
(which predated
Watchmen
by a year);
Brat Pack   (an examination of sidekick culture); and
Maximortal
(a vicious
Superman satire). And yet these are often unjustly forgotten and left of the
lists of important graphic novels and I urge everyone interested in the comics
medium to seek them out and buy them.
Another
criminally overlooked book of Veitch’s is the 2007-2008 series,
Army@Love
and the 2008-2009 sequel,
Army@Love: The Art of War , both inked by my good friend Gary Erskine, and
published by
Vertigo .

The story told the misadventures of a unit of
New Jersey
National Guard
in "Afbaghistan," a fictional Middle Eastern country based on Iraq/ Afghanistan . It was a
savage satire on the futility of war and how it could become comodified in the
future and sold as a desirable, sexy career move to a US public. The title is
obviously a spin on DC Comics’
Our Army at War —which
became
Sgt. Rock
in 1977—and this war comic was a strong influence on Veitch who explained to
me, “ To some extent, me and war comics go back to my
beginnings…”
At the time of
this interview (15 May 2011) US troops were still in Iraq. Since then, the last
of the armed forces have left the country, although there are still US forces
active in Afghanistan and Pakistan at time of writing. I originally was looking
to use the interview as part of a paper I presented at the
Imperial War Museum
about comic creators and personal experiences of war, but sadly it was never
used. So, never wanting to waste anything, here it is…
Army@Love
was a return to war comics for Veitch,
who grew up reading and loving them, “[ Sgt. Rock
artist, Joe] Kubert’s work was incredibly important
to me. I sort of understood it was on simplistic level, but his illustrations
were so gritty and what he was able to do with a pen and brush was so
interesting to me. I studied it and I worked from it, even before I went to his
school. And Russ Heath’s work, he just knocked me out, what that guy could do.
The tightness of it all, and the savage beauty he could make from a tank.
Really, really great stuff.”

But Veitch was
equally enamoured with the writing as well as the art, “[Robert] Kanigher was
the writer of it all, of course. I got to meet him when I was at Kubert School
[Kanigher taught for a year there in 1977]. He’s a really interesting hidden
cultural figure, because a lot of his panels were picked up by Roy Lichtenstein
and became these well-known images, but they came right out of Kanigher. So he
was like this underground poet whose thoughts and images ended up out in the
world. When I met him in person, I was struck by how much he was like [his DC
character] Hans Von Hammer,
Enemy Ace . His character was like that, and the whole schtick
of Von Hammer—he doesn’t have any friends and he’s a lone wolf…he’s out there…
he’s a killing machine—that’s a metaphor for Kanigher.” Coincidentally this year is the 10th anniversary of Kanigher's death.

“Because I
studied with
Joe Kubert at his school
[Veitch was in the first class to
graduate, alongside
Stephen R. Bissette
and
TomYeates
in 1978]
some of my first professional jobs were drawing
back-up stories for
Sgt. Rock
comics. There’s a
certain way that a Kubert/DC war comic is structured and I assimilated that
organically at a very young age.”
Many comics
historians have discussed the anti-war sub-texts in Kanigher and Kubert’s work,
but Veitch remains sceptical, “I don’t know how anti-war he was. They did
plenty of flag-waving, let’s-throw-ourselves-on-the-grenade-and-save-everybody
type stories. I knew people in Vietnam who used the slang ‘Sgt. Rock’ for an
idiot. The kind of person who’d do something stupid, like run in front of a
machine gun because they’d read too many
Sgt. Rock
comics. They just didn’t know any better.
It just seemed like ‘Well, this is what we do.’ And they’d run into the fire,
because it worked for Sgt Rock.” The thought that Kanigher and Kubert may have
been indirectly responsible for young, naïve men dying in a South East Asian
jungle is a sobering one, to say the least.
Rick’s older
brother, Tom Veitch, wrote many left-leaning, anti-Vietnam War underground
comix—most notably
Legion of Charlies , drawn by Greg Irons— in the late
Sixties/early Seventies and was a strong influence on his younger sibling. “I
was inspired by him. Interestingly enough he’s become extremely right wing in
his old age. So he and I are always in conflict [laughs]. We never stop
bickering!”

Legion of Charlies

Regardless, of
the misinterpreted jingoism in
Our Army at War , Kanigher and Kubert’s work had an important
grounding on Veitch’s own, later work, “By the time I reached
Army@Love
I was much more advanced, and my thinking
was progressively leftist. I was outraged at how the American government had
pushed the war [the 2003-2011 Iraq War] and created it out of false
information. It was around 2005/2006 and the war was going really badly, there
were lots of bombings, civilians being killed right and left, and I was
outraged by it. So I wanted to speak to it through my art form, which is
comics, and through satire. I think I was trying to do a
Catch-22 ,
but about a war that was going on, rather
than doing it 10 years later, which is what most people do. So it might have
been a little too early for people to digest, because the experience was just
too horrible, and the political confrontation in the Untied States was still
ongoing. There were these ‘cultural wars’ going on about what the ‘truth’ was… If
you didn’t believe the right-wing politicians you were considered a traitor!
Really strange times. So I felt I had to stand up and speak with my voice.”
Certainly, this
climate of ‘My country, right or wrong’ succeeded in drowning out many liberal,
more temperate, voices at the time, and almost certainly affected
Army@Love ’s sales. No one wanted to look at the
current situation and ask the awkward question, ‘Is this war justified?’ when
it was so evidently not.
How Veitch
started exploring the modern military and the war in Iraq was typically
unconventional. “I started researching the weapons themselves and the research
that was being done into weapons of the future—because
Army@Love
was actually set five years in the
future, that’s the schtick. So I thought it would be interesting to imagine how
those weapons would change combat and the culture of people who were in it. It
also looked, at the time, as if no one would ever join the army again, because
it was such a mess in 2005, so I was imagining what kind of marketing the
military would have to do, to bring young people into it. So
Army@Love
is as much about public relations and
marketing as it is about combat.”
Above: Army@Love #9 cover. Name that homage!
As the series
progressed troops serving in Iraq started contacting Veitch, “I got letters from
people who were serving there. They would say I somehow caught exactly what
they were feeling. I don’t know how I did that, because I hadn’t spoken to any
of them, it was all imaginary, it came out of me! At one point I was contacted
by the guys who publish the U.S. military’s newspaper, Army Times, who said,
‘This is exactly what’s going on over there. You really caught it! I don’t know
how you did it!’
They did a whole write-up of me . They sent it to Joe Kubert
and I don’t think he liked it. He’s a staunch believer in the Government. When
we were all at school [another classmate was John Totleben], we were young and
didn’t believe what the government was telling us, whereas he [Kubert] was
staunchly establishment, so there was that conflict. Not that it destroyed our
friendship or anything, but there was always a friendly conflict of ideas and
I’m sure he wondered what he let loose by sending us out to do war comics!”
[Laughs]

I queried whether
Veitch had enough information to be able to write accurately about a war that
was happening thousands of miles away, and whether he’d considered visiting, as
Joe Sacco did . “I’m sure it would’ve been a much deeper piece of work if I’d be
out there, and at the same time I might have come back traumatised and unable
to work it up.
Army@Love
is a work of the imagination by a civilian looking in horror at what we were
seeing at the time. Literally, everyday there would be these bombings of
civilians—hundreds of people being killed. I still don’t understand what it was
all about. Who these guys were who were fighting for power and using the
civilian population as innocent victims? But I wish the people who started the
war, the Bush Administration, had thought about
that . Or if they
had
thought about it, and still let it
happen, then I consider
that
a war crime. I think the lower estimates of civilian deaths in Iraq are
100,000. Some of the higher estimates are half a million people.” [Note: The
Iraq Body Count and Iraq War Logs combined give a figure of 128,842, whereas
the British medical journal,
The Lancet
put the figure at 654,965 civilians dead.]
Yet, however
critical Veitch is of the architects of the Iraq War, he is more respectful of
those that actually had to fight it, “I wasn’t trying to criticise the soldiers
or the military itself, rather the situation that I found intolerable, and how
we got there.”

The writer/artist
mused of the nature of conflict in general, and tying in with the theme of the second series,
Army@Love: The Art of War , “War is the ultimate surrealism in
a modern civilisation, because it takes all these things we’ve built—these
products and these architectural structures—and it blows them to shit. And so,
to walk into a city square that’s just been bombed and all the products thrown
and ripped all over it, it’s surreal. It
is
surreal.”
“It’s outside the
‘norm’,” I ventured.
“Except the
‘norm’ is false. It’s consumer products. These structures, that are not
organic, are false and then it all gets blown up. Maybe it’s the ultimate art
form, I dunno.” We both paused to consider the massive ramifications of that
statement, that war could be the final nihilistic/artistic endeavour, and sadly
we realised that we didn’t have the time to fully explore it.
There’s a
much-lauded phrase “Never meet your heroes, they’ll only disappoint you.”
However, just like his comics work, I’m very glad that Rick flew in the face of
this, and so many other perceived wisdoms. He was an absolute gent and a
friendly, intelligent and fascinating interviewee, and I only wish we’d had
more time and that I was better prepared! His latest attack on the Neo-Cons of
America,
The Big Lie , published in September 2011, is an  interesting examination of the 9/11 conspiracy theories. Here’s
hoping well see a lot more intriguing and groundbreaking work from Mr Veitch in
the next few years.

I'm a big fan of Rick Veitch. I wrote a review about The Big Lie, and also about Brat Pack. I feel ashamed to admit this, but I still haven't read his Vertigo titles.

Aha! Then I've done my job! Add Army@Love to your wish list!
Great review of Enigma, BTW, although I think you big me up a tad too much! Need to tell Duncan about it. Will let him know.

Oh, how modest of you! It'd be great if Duncan reads my Enigma review.
