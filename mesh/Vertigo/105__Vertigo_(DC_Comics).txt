Super Mario Galaxy 2: I finished it and here’z what I think

Background and intro
Originally, the game released as
Super Mario Galaxy 2
was going to be called
More Super Mario Galaxy
and would basically be the Wii’s equivalent of the Japan-only 1986 Famicom title,
Super Mario Bros. 2
(aka
Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels ).
However, Nintendo decided to pour a couple of years of development into it and make it a new game re-using the “outer space” motif.
General producer Shigeru Miyamoto compared it to the Nintendo 64’s
The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask , which re-used the game engine from the previous title,
Ocarina of Time .
However, let me assure you that there is way more difference between
Oracle
and
Majora
than there is between
Galaxy
and
Galaxy 2 .
In fact, in spite of the seemingly long development time, it really does come across as a
More Super Mario Galaxy
type game.
Considering the whole space setting was used again,
Galaxy 2
was a golden opportunity to shake up some other boring/cliche/haggard Mario elements.
MAYBE it would have helped to have a villain other than Bowser this time around, doing something other than kidnapping Peach.
During the closing cinematic scene I was thinking how much fun it would have been to play as Peach in all of her floatiness.
Wouldn’t that have been a pretty cool reward for beating the game?
Nintendo seems to think there’s a lot of brand new content in this game but I’ve played downloadable expansions for other games that had just as much “new” material involving equipment, setting, characters, etc.
Galaxy 2
is basically a gigantic expansion pack for
Galaxy 1 .
I’ve beaten the main story but that’s only about 30% of the actual content of the game
One thing that
Galaxy 2
does not skimp on is content.
As in all of the other 3D Mario games there are 120 standard stars for Mario to retrieve.  Once you’ve obtained all 120 stars, there are an
additional 120 stars
that become available.  However, out of the 71 stars I’ve earned so far, I kind of wonder how valid those additional stars will be.  Several of the missions I’ve beaten were just re-treads of missions I’d beaten earlier.  It’s a bit more egregious in this case than in, say,
Super Mario 64 , because in that game each area had 7 stars, so a re-tread or two within an area isn’t a big deal.  In
Galaxy 2 , most areas only have 2 or 3 stars, 1 of which is often a re-tread.  Still, there are many hours of content here.  When I beat
Super Mario Sunshine
and
Super Mario Galaxy , I pretty much went straight to work collecting all of the stars.  However, this time out I don’t feel as motivated, and will probably give the game a break before I pick it up to do more re-treads.
A really annoying thing about Yoshi and power-ups
Galaxy 2
clearly has a “more is better” philosophy regarding power-ups but many of them are fairly lame or forgettable.  Most of them are mission-specific and mandatory, basically the opposite of their usage in the old side-scrolling games.  What I mean to say is that many missions require a power-up to complete; they’re not just cool add-on abilities.  Additionally, if you lose the power-up they usually reappear where you originally located them, taking away their special spontaneity.  I know this approach dates all the way back to
SM64
but in that game power-ups occurred sparingly.  In this game they’re all over the place.
The most annoying aspect of the power-ups is that they cannot be maintained from one mission to another.  Being able to keep power-ups when you avoid taking damage would have made the game a lot crazier and a lot more fun for me.  Yoshi makes a return in this game he’s the same way – if you finish a level with Yoshi he does not come with you, just like last years
New Super Mario Bros. Wii .  That’s just lame and it makes him feel tacked on.  Luigi’s in the game, too.  Occasionally he can be seen standing around at the beginning of a mission.  On these occasions you have the option of switching to him as your playable character.  As usual, his footing is slippery but his jumps are impressive.
Lots of references to past games
For some reason, there are many references in visual, audio, and level design that harken back to earlier games.  Oddest of all is an area that is a remake of the Whomp Fortress from
SM64 .  Another area is basically a tribute to the overall look and feel of
Super Mario Sunshine .  Musical themes from old games are used more than in most recent Mario games.  Boss levels re-use the boss level music from
SM64 .  I must admit to some hypocrisy as I had previously hoped for this sort of thing but in practice it seems a bit too much like fan-service or a lack of ideas.  As I mentioned earlier, considering the very premise of this game is a re-hash it would have been cool have some really simple, easy, but wacky ideas to make the whole thing fresh.
New Mario games are just not the creme de la creme for me anymore
The main Mario series has always been my favorite video game series but I can think of a few console releases of this hardware generation that I enjoyed more than
Galaxy 1
&
2 , including
Metroid Prime 3 ,
Grand Theft Auto IV ,
BioShock
and even the somewhat uninspired
New Super Mario Bros. Wii .
Galaxy 2
is a really well-made game but the reviews have been ridiculously positive.  Please, Nintendo, give the next game a new setting and some much, much more innovative ideas.

Good Lord: Red Dead Redemption looks awesome/great/fun

If you’re unfamiliar,
Red Dead Redemption
is basically “Grand Theft Auto in the Old West” or, more specifically, a Sergio Leone-ish Old West.
The early reviews for the game have been great, averaging 9.5 (wow!).
What has me really excited is the portrayal of the desolate, western landscapes and small, dusty towns.
Sometimes when I watch Sergio Leone movies my heart aches as I calmly lust after the wild, expansive deserts and plains with views that stretch for miles and miles.
I’m almost tempted to buy this game new . . .

JORDI BERNET
From Wikipedia:
Jordi Bernet Cussó
(born June 14, 1944,
Barcelona )
is a
Catalan
comics
artist , best known for the gangster comics series
Torpedo .
The son of a famous Spanish comic book artist, Miguel (Miguel or Miquel
Bernet), he made his debut in comics at fifteen, continuing his father’s
humorous series
Doña Urraca
( Mrs. Magpie ) after his death
in 1960, under the
pseudonym
“Jordi”.
Turning to the German market, in the 1970s he collaborated with
Cussó to
create
Wat 69 , a sexy and humouristic heroine for the
magazine
Pip ,
and
Andrax , a science fiction series
for
Primo , which
both became successful in Germany.
After the fall of
Franco , Bernet
returned to Catalonia and Spain and worked
for several Spanish comics
magazines such as
Creepy ,
Metropol
and
Cimoc ,
eventually meeting three writers with whom he would
form productive
partnerships. With
Antonio Segura
he
created the amazone fantasy series
Sarvan ,
and the
series
Kraken ,
depicting a sewer monster terrorizing a
futuristic fascist society.
Bernet first collaborated with
Enrique
Sánchez Abulí
on several short
stories, collected in
Historietas
negras . When
Alex
Toth , after
producing two stories of
Torpedo 1936
in 1981,
decided he did
not share Abulí’s darkly humorous view of mankind and
parted with the
project, Bernet was asked to continue the work. [4]
This became the beginning of a long-lasting series, which became a
popular success and was awarded at the
Angoulême
International
Comics Festival . It eventually formed the basis of
its own
magazine,
Luca Torelli es Torpedo
in 1992. [3]
Later collaborations with Abulí include
De vuelta a casa ,
La
naturaleza de la bestia: Ab Irato
and
Snake: por un puñado de
dolares .
Bernet’s more recent publications include several albums for the
Italian western character
Tex
Willer , and
a run of work for the U.S. comics market, including a
Batman
story, and a trilogy detailing “the shocking origin” of
Jonah
Hex . [5]
Bernet has later continued to work with Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray
on
Jonah Hex .
Will Eisner
described his impression of Bernet’s work in an
anthology preface: [6]
Here was a man who was producing pure story-telling
art. That is
art that uses the kind of minimalism so singular to his
draftsmanship
that is actually a narrative device in itself. This fit
into my own
philosophy of sequential narrative art. I pursued the
progress of his
work with great interest.
—Will Eisner
I’m a little ashamed to admit my overall ignorance of Mr. Bernet’s
work…really, my only exposure to it thus far has been in the pages of
Solo #6, which contains the Batman story this renowned artist
illustrated. As mentioned by Will Eisner, Bernet’s storytelling skills
are superlative and his cartoony-realistic style even reminds me of the
amazing Eisner. I’d love to know more about the world of European
comics, so maybe the work of Jordi Bernet is a a good place to start.
Also, I recommend trying to track down Solo #6….I  can attest that it’s a
great introduction to the man’s work.

RAFAEL GRAMPA
From Wikipedia:
Rafael Grampá
is a
Brazilian
comic
book
artist and writer. The comics anthology
5 created by
Grampá along with
Gabriel Bá ,
Becky
Cloonan ,
Fábio Moon
and
Vasilis Lolos
won the 2008
Eisner
Award
for Best Anthology. He is author and artist of the Mesmo
Delivery comic. [1]
I don’t have much to say about Rafael Grampa, because I don’t know much about him! I do know he’s from Brazil, and that he’s awesome. He hasn’t done much American comic work, as far as I know…he did a short story in
Hellblazer
a little while ago, and his creator-owned
Mesmo Delivery
is amazing. I love his Frank Quitely meets Geoff Darrow style. I have no idea where the above picture is from, but it makes me wish some editor at DC would assign Grampa a Bat-project pronto.

New arcade games: Pac-Man & Terminator

Here are a couple of possibly cool new arcade games that I would be pleased to play.
Pac-Man Battle Royale
This is basically a four-player version of the game
Pac-Man Championship Edition
that was released on Xbox Live Arcade in 2006 (I think) with new maze layouts (I think) and some cool features.  There can now be up to 4 Pac-Men playing at once, free to cooperate, compete, or ignore each other.  When a Pac-Man eats a power pellet he becomes big like in
Super Pac-Man
(1982) and he can even eat the other Pac-Men in addition to the ghosts.  Also of interest is that a Pac-Man can only eat ghosts if he’s currently big, even if some other Pac-Man has eat a power pellet and made all the ghosts blue/vulnerable.
Terminator Salvation
This game is being released by Raw Thrills, the company that is basically the successor to Midway’s arcade division.
If you’ll recall, way back in the day, Midway made a cool arcade shooter based on
Terminator 2 .  But aside from that, this game looks pretty bad-ass and fun.

KATSUHIRO OTOMO
From Wikipedia:
Katsuhiro Otomo
(大友克洋,
Ōtomo
Katsuhiro ? ,
born April 14, 1954) is a Japanese
manga
artist,
film director , and
screenwriter .
He is perhaps best known for being the creator of the manga
Akira
and
its anime adaptation , which are extremely famous and
influential. Otomo has also directed several
live-action
films, such as the 2006 feature film adaptation of the
Mushishi
manga.
Otomo’s Batman has only appeared once, in an 8-page story featured in
Batman: Black & White
from 1996. The story features Otomo trademarks like psychic battle and crazed psychos…I can’t admit I actually completely
understand
it, but it’s interesting and looks like great and is, thus far, his only foray into American comics. The image above is the only one I could find online, but it gives you an idea. Even though his Batwork is limited to one picture here, I wanted to include Otomo because of his impact on world comic culture, and my own love of his work. It would be lovely to have another Batstory from this influential artist (or another comic story in general), but I’m not holding my breath. I guess we’ll just have to be happy with what we have.

JOCK
From Wikipedia:
Mark Simpson , known by the pen name
Jock , is a British
comics
artist, best known for his work in
2000 AD
and on
The Losers . [1]
Jock began his professional career at
2000 AD , on series including
Judge
Dredd
and
Lenny Zero [2] .
He has worked in the American comic book market at
DC
Comics
and their
Vertigo
imprint.
Like most American comic enthusiasts, I first saw the work of Jock in the pages of Vertigo’s
Losers
comic, which was recently adapted into a feature film. Since then, he’s become one of the industry’s go-to guys for memorable cover art…most of the images in this post come from a stint he did as the cover artist for
Batman . Recently he added some interior Bat-work to his resume with a
Detective Comics
arc written by
Greg Rucka .
His work has also appeared in other media, including the package art for the Criterion Collection’s release of Akira Kurosawa’s
Drunken Angel .
