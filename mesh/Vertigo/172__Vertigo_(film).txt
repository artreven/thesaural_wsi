Melvin Kaminsky ; June 28, 1926) [1]
is an American
film director ,
screenwriter ,
composer ,
lyricist ,
comedian ,
actor
and
producer . He is best known as a creator of broad film
farces
and comic
parodies . He began his career as a stand-up comic and as a
writer for the early TV variety show
Your Show of Shows . He became well known as part of the
comedy duo with
Carl Reiner ,
The 2000 Year Old Man . In middle age he became one of the most
successful film directors of the 1970s, with many of his films being
among the top ten money makers of the year that they were released.
His most well known films include
The Producers ,
Blazing Saddles ,
Young Frankenstein ,
History of the World, Part I
and
Spaceballs . More recently he has had a smash hit on Broadway
with the musical adaptation of his first film,
The Producers . He was married to the actress
Anne Bancroft
from 1964 until her death in 2005.
Brooks is a member of
the short list of entertainers
with the distinction of having
won an
Emmy , a
Grammy , an
Oscar
and a
Tony
award. Three of his films ranked in the
American Film Institute 's list of the
top 100 comedy films of all-time :
Blazing Saddles
at number 6,
The Producers
at number 11, and
Young Frankenstein
at number 13. [2]
Early
life
Brooks was born
Melvin Kaminsky
in
Brooklyn ,
New
York , a son of Maximilian Kaminsky and his wife Kate (née
Brookman). [3]
His father's family were
German Jews from the Baltic Sea port of Danzig
(the modern
Polish port of
Gdansk ); his mother's family were Ukrainian Jews from
Kiev . [4]
He had three older brothers, Irving, Lenny and Bernie. His father
died of kidney disease at 34 when Brooks was only two years old. [5]
Brooks has said of his father's death that "there's an outrage
there. I may be angry at God, or at the world, for that. And I'm
sure a lot of my comedy is based on anger and hostility. Growing up
in Williamsburg, I learned to clothe it in comedy to spare myself
problems - like a punch in the face." [6]
Brooks was a small, sickly boy who was often
bullied and picked on by his classmates. [7]
He was taught by
Buddy Rich
(who had also grown up in Williamsburg) to learn how
to play the drums and started earning money at it when he was
fourteen. [6]
After graduating from Abraham Lincoln High School, [ citation

he spent a year at Brooklyn College as
a psychology major before being drafted into the army. [6]
He attended the
Army Specialized Training Program [8]
conducted at the
Virginia Military Institute [9]
(although not actually as a VMI cadet) and served in the
United States Army
as a corporal during
World War II , arriving in France weeks after the
Battle of the Bulge . [10]
Career
Early career and
Your Show of Shows
After
World War II , Brooks started working in various
Borscht Belt
resorts and nightclubs in the
Catskill Mountains
as a drummer and pianist. Around this time he
changed his professional name to "Mel Brooks" after being confused
with the well-known Borscht Belt trumpet player Max Kaminsky. [6]
After a regular comic at one of the nightclubs was too sick to
perform one night, Brooks started working as a stand-up comic,
telling jokes and doing movie-star impressions. He also began acting
in summer stock in Redbank, New Jersey and did some radio work. [6]
He eventually worked his way up to the comically aggressive job of
Tummler
(master entertainer) at
Grossinger's , one of the Borscht Belt most famous resorts. [6] [11]
Brooks found more rewarding work behind the
scenes, becoming a comedy writer for television. In 1949 his friend
Sid Caesar
hired Brooks to write jokes for the NBC series
The Admiral Broadway Revue , paying him $50 a week. In 1950,
Caesar created the revolutionary variety comedy series
Your Show of Shows
and hired Brooks as a writer along with
Carl Reiner ,
Neil Simon ,
Danny Simon , and head writer
Mel Tolkin . [6]
The show was an immediate hit and has been influential to all
variety and sketch-comedy TV shows since. Carl Reiner, as creator of
The Dick Van Dyke Show , based
Morey Amsterdam 's character Buddy Sorell on Brooks. Likewise the
1982 film
My Favorite Year
is loosely based on Brooks' experiences as
a writer on the show and an encounter with aging Hollywood actor
Errol Flynn . Neil Simon's 1993 play
Laughter on the 23rd Floor
is also loosely based on the
production of the show, and the character Ira Stone is based on
Brooks.
Your Show of Shows
would end in 1954 when performer
Imogene Coca
left to host her own show. Caesar then created
Caesar's Hour
with most of the same cast and writers
(including Brooks and adding
Larry Gelbart ).
Caesar's Hour
ran from 1954 until 1957.
In 1957 Brooks wrote the book for his first
Broadway musical
Shinbone Alley .
The 2000 Year Old Man and
Get Smart
Brooks and co-writer Reiner had become fast
friends and began to casually improvise comedy routines when they
weren't working. Reiner would play the straight man interviewer who
would set Brooks up as anything from a Tibetan Monk to an astronaut.
As Reiner explained, "In the evening we'd go to a party and I'd pick
a character for him to play. I never told him what it was going to
be." [6]
On one of these occasions Reiner's suggestion was a
2000 Year Old Man
who had witnessed the crucifixion of Jesus
Christ (who "came in the store but never bought anything"), had been
married several hundred times and had "over forty-two thousand
children, and not one comes to visit me." At first Brooks and Reiner
would only perform the routine for friends but by the late 1950s had
gained a cult status in New York City.
Kenneth Tynan
saw the
comedy duo
perform at a party in 1959 and wrote that Brooks "was
the most original comic improvisor I had ever seen." [6]
In 1960, Brooks moved from New York to Hollywood.
He and Reiner began performing the 2000 Year Old Man act on the
Steve Allen Show . Their performances led to the release of the
comedy album
2000 Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks
that
sold over a million copies in 1961. [6]
They eventually expanded their routine with two more albums in 1961
and 1962, a revival in 1973, a 1975 animated TV special and a
reunion album in 1998.
Brooks adapted the 2000 Year Old Man character to
create the 2500 Year Old Brewmaster for Ballantine Beer in the
1960s. Interviewed by
Dick Cavett
in a series of ads, the Brewmaster (in a German
accent, as opposed to the 2000 Year Old Man's Yiddish accent) said
he was inside the original Trojan horse and "could've used a
six-pack of fresh air." [12]
In 1962 Brooks wrote the Broadway musical
All American . Brooks wrote the play with lyrics by
Lee Adams , and music by
Charles Strouse . The show starred
Ray Bolger
as a southern science Professor at a large university
who uses the principles of engineering on the college's football
team and the team begins to win games. The show was directed by
Joshua Logan , who script doctored the second act and added a gay
subtext to the plot. The show ran for 80 performances and received
two
Tony Award
nominations.
In 1963 Brooks was involved in the animated short
film
The Critic , a satire of arty, esoteric cinema, conceived by
Brooks and directed by
Ernest Pintoff . Brooks supplied running commentary as the
baffled moviegoer trying to make sense of the obscure visuals. The
short film won the
Academy Award for Animated Short Film .
In 1965, Brooks teamed up with comedy writer
Buck Henry
to create a comedic TV show about a bumbling
James Bond
inspired spy. Brooks explains, "I was sick of looking
at all those nice sensible situation comedies. They were such
distortions of life...I wanted to do a crazy, unreal
comic-strip
kind of thing about something besides a family. No
one had ever done a show about an idiot before. I decided to be the
first." [13]
The show that Brooks and Henry created was
Get Smart , starring
Don Adams
as Maxwell Smart, Agent 86. This series ran from 1965
until 1970, although Brooks was not involved with its production
after the pilot episode. [14]
Get Smart
was highly rated for most of its production and won
seven
Emmy Awards , [15]
including Outstanding Comedy Series in 1968 and 1969.
Brooks had married actress
Anne Bancroft
in 1964 and the two lived together in New York
City.
Early career as a film director
For several years Brooks had been toying with a
bizarre and unconventional idea about a musical comedy of
Adolf Hitler . Brooks explored the idea as a novel and a play
before finally writing a script. [6]
Eventually he was able to find two producers to fund the show,
Joseph E. Levine
and
Sidney Glazier , and made his first feature film,
The Producers , in 1968. The film starred
Zero Mostel ,
Gene Wilder ,
Dick Shawn ,
Kenneth Mars ,
Christopher Hewett ,
Andréas Voutsinas
and
Lee Meredith
with music by
John Morris .
The Producers
begins
when Max Bialystock (Mostel), a once-successful Broadway producer
who whores himself out to elderly women in order to make ends meet
and produce plays, meets Leo Bloom (Wilder), a lonely and
hyper-hysterical accountant. While Leo is looking over Max's books,
he realizes that a producer could make more money producing a flop
than a hit simply by raising more money than needed and then
ensuring the play would not make any profits to pay back the
backers. Max and Leo search for the worst play ever written, which
turns out to be
Springtime for Hitler
by Franz Liebkind (Mars). The play is
described as "a gay romp with Adolph and Eva through Berchtesgaden".
It turns into a musical comedy under Max and Leo's leadership. After
assembling an equally abysmal director, Roger De Bris (Hewett), and
a brain-dead hippie to play Hitler (Shawn), Max and Leo expect to
become rich with the anticipated flop. However, the audience
interprets the play as a satire making it a huge comedic hit. Not
wanting to go to jail, Max, Leo and Franz decide to blow up the
theater but are caught in the explosion and sentenced to prison,
where they promptly produce a musical revue using the prison
inmates. [6]
The Producers
was so
brazen in its satire that major studios would not touch it, nor
would many exhibitors. Brooks finally found an independent
distributor who released it as an art film, a specialized
attraction. In 1968 Brooks received an Oscar for
Best Original Screenplay
for the film beating such writers as
Stanley Kubrick
and
John Cassavetes .
The Producers
became a smash underground
hit, first on the nationwide college circuit, then in revivals and
on home video. Brooks later turned it into a
musical , which became hugely successful on Broadway receiving an
unprecedented twelve Tony awards.
With the moderate financial success of the film
The Producers , Glazier financed Brooks' next film in 1970,
The Twelve Chairs . Loosely based on a Russian 1928 novel
The Twelve Chairs
by
Ilf and Petrov
about greedy materialism in post-Revolutionary
Russia, the film stars
Ron Moody ,
Frank Langella
and
Dom DeLuise
as three men individually searching for a fortune in
diamonds hidden in a set of twelve antique chairs. Brooks himself
has a cameo as an alcoholic ex-serf who "yearns for the regular
beatings of yesteryear." The film was shot in Yugoslavia with a
budget of $1.5 million. The film received poor reviews and was not
financially successful. [6]
Success as a Hollywood director
Brooks then wrote an adaptation of
Oliver Goldsmith 's
She Stoops to Conquer , but was unable to sell the idea to
any studio and believed that his career was over. In 1972 Brooks met
agent
David Begelman
who helped him set up a deal with
Warner Brothers
to hire Brooks (as well as
Richard Pryor ,
Andrew Bergman , Norman Steinberg and Al Uger) as a script doctor
for an unproduced script called
Tex-X . Eventually Brooks was
hired as director for what would become
Blazing Saddles , his third film. [6]
Blazing Saddles
starred
Cleavon Little ,
Gene Wilder ,
Harvey Korman ,
Slim Pickens ,
Madeline Kahn ,
Alex Karras
and Brooks himself with cameos by
Dom DeLuise
and
Count Basie . The film had music by Brooks and
John Morris
and received a modest budget of $2.6 million. This
film is a satire on the
Western film
genre and references older films such as
Destry Rides Again ,
High Noon ,
Once Upon a Time in the West
and
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre
as well as a surreal scene
towards the end of the film referencing the extravagant musicals of
Busby Berkeley .
In the film, the small town of Rock Ridge is in
the pathway of the new railroad being built. In order to buy the
land on the route more cheaply, the corrupt State Attorney General
Hedley Lamarr (Korman) and the dim-witted State Governor (Brooks)
plot to drive the townspeople out by appointing as their new sheriff
a black man, Bart (Little). The racist townspeople are slow to
accept Sheriff Bart, but with the help of the drunken ex-gunslinger
the Waco Kid (Wilder) he is able to rid the town of all crime and
problems and wins the people over. Realizing that they have to do
something to destroy Bart's reputation, Lamarr sends the saloon
singer Lili von Shtupp (Kahn) to seduce and corrupt Bart. However,
she ends up falling in love with him, so as a final effort to drive
the townspeople away, Lamarr organizes a raid to burn the town to
the ground. But, under Bart's leadership, the townspeople are able
to fight off Lamarr's men, and in the ensuing fight the film itself
spills over into other films being shot on the Warner brother lot,
such as a musical directed by the temperamental Dom DeLuise
character. In the end the townspeople are saved and Sheriff Bart
rides off into the sunset.
Upon its release,
Blazing Saddles
was the
second highest grossing film, domestically, of 1974 earning $119.5
million worldwide. Despite mixed reviews, the film was a success
with younger audiences. It was nominated for three
Academy Awards :
Best Actress in a Supporting Role
for
Madeline Kahn ,
Best Film Editing , and
Best Music, Original Song . The film won the
Writers Guild of America Award
for " Best
Comedy Written Directly for the Screen " [16]
and in 2006 it was deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically
significant" by the
Library of Congress
and was selected for preservation in the
National Film Registry . [17]
Brooks has said that the film "has to do with love more than
anything else. I mean when that black guy rides into that Old
Western town and even a little old lady says 'Up yours nigger!', you
know that his heart is broken. So its really the story of that heart
being mended." [6]
When
Gene Wilder
replaced
Gig Young
as the Waco Kid, he did so only if Brooks agreed that
his next film would be an idea that Wilder had been working on: a
spoof of the old
Universal
Frankenstein
films. [18]
After the filming of
Blazing Saddles
was completed, Wilder
and Brooks began writing the script for
Young Frankenstein
and shot the film in the spring of 1974.
It starred Wilder,
Marty Feldman ,
Peter Boyle ,
Teri Garr ,
Madeline Kahn ,
Cloris Leachman
and
Kenneth Mars
with
Gene Hackman
in a memorable cameo role. Composer
John Morris
again provided the music score and
Universal Monsters
film special effects veteran
Kenneth Strickfaden
worked on the film.
Young Frankenstein
stars Wilder as the young American scientist Dr. Frederick
Frankenstein (pronounced "Fronk-en-steen") who travels to
Transylvania to visit his famous grandfather's castle and
laboratory. With the help of hunchback servant Igor (Feldman),
beautiful assistant Inga (Garr) and suspicious housekeeper Frau
Blücher (Leachman), Frankenstein discovers his grandfather's
notebooks and attempts to continue his work in reanimation. He
builds his creation, the monster (Boyle) but Igor accidentally
obtains an abnormal brain making the monster violent and
uncontrollable. When the monster escapes, he terrorizes the
countryside before Dr. Frankenstein can lure him back to the castle
and civilize him, ending in a sophisticated and humorous rendition
of
Irving Berlin 's " Puttin'
on the Ritz ". The monster's violent tendencies come back and he
is put in jail by Inspector Kemp (Mars). In the meantime, Dr.
Frankenstein has begun a relationship with Inga just before his
insufferable fiance Elizabeth (Kahn) arrives at the castle. The
monster escapes from jail, kidnaps Elizabeth and seduces her to her
great satisfaction. Dr. Frankenstein is able to get the monster back
again and attempts a dangerous experiment sharing part of his own
brain with the monster, which succeeds in civilizing him. In the end
Frankenstein and Inga are happily married, as are Elizabeth and the
monster.
Young Frankenstein
was the third highest grossing film domestically of 1974, just
behind
Blazing Saddles . It earned $86 million worldwide and
received two
Academy Award
nominations:
Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay
and
Academy Award for Best Sound . It received some of the best
reviews of Brooks' career and even critic
Pauline Kael
liked the film, saying that "Brooks makes a leap up
as a director because, although the comedy doesn't build, he carries
the story through...Brooks even has a satisfying windup, which makes
this just about the only comedy of recent years that doesn't
collapse." [6]
In 1975, at the height of his movie career, Brooks
tried TV again with
When Things Were Rotten , a
Robin Hood
parody that lasted only 13 episodes. Nearly twenty
years later, in response to the 1991 hit film
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves , Brooks mounted another Robin
Hood parody with
Robin Hood: Men in Tights . Brooks's film resurrected several
pieces of dialog from his TV series, as well as from earlier Brooks
films.
In 1976, Brooks followed up his two hit films with
an audacious idea: the first feature-length silent comedy in four
decades.
Silent Movie
was written by Brooks and
Ron Clark , starring Brooks in his first leading role,
Dom DeLuise ,
Marty Feldman ,
Sid Caesar ,
Bernadette Peters
and, in cameo roles playing themselves:
Paul Newman ,
Burt Reynolds ,
James Caan ,
Liza Minnelli ,
Anne Bancroft
and ironically,
Marcel Marceau , who uttered the film's only word of audible
dialogue: "Non!"
In the film Brooks plays Mel Funn, a recovered
alcoholic and once successful director, who convinces the Chief of
his studio (Caesar) that a
silent film
could still be profitable and will save the studio
from being taken over by the evil conglomerate Engulf & Devour (a
thinly disguised reference to
Gulf+Western 's takeover of
Paramount Pictures ). With help from his two assistants, DeLuise
and Feldman, Funn enlists several well known movie stars to appear
in the film thus assuring its success. Worried that Funn's success
will prevent their takeover, Engulf & Devour send the sexy nightclub
singer Vilma Kaplan (Peters) to seduce and distract Funn. But Kaplan
and Funn fall in love with each other and Funn is able to complete
the film. In the end the film is a hit with audiences. [6]
Although not as successful as his previous two
films,
Silent Movie
was a hit and grossed $36 million. Later
that year Brooks was named number 5 on a list of the Top Ten Box
Office Stars. [6]
In 1977, Brooks made a parody of the films of
Alfred Hitchcock
in
High Anxiety . The film was written by Brooks, Ron Clark,
Rudy De Luca
and
Barry Levinson
and was the first movie produced by Brooks
himself. It starred Brooks,
Madeline Kahn ,
Cloris Leachman ,
Harvey Korman ,
Ron Carey ,
Howard Morris
and
Dick Van Patten . The film satirizes such Hitchcock classic films
as
Vertigo ,
Spellbound ,
Psycho ,
The Birds ,
North by Northwest ,
Dial M for Murder
and
Suspicion .
Brooks stars as Professor Richard H. (for Harpo)
Thorndyke, a
Nobel Prize
winning psychologist who also happens to suffer from
high anxiety. Thorndyke is appointed the director of the
Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very,
Very
Nervous, which
also employs sadistic Nurse Diesel (Leachman) and masochistic Dr.
Montague (Korman). Things at the hospital are not what they seem and
as Thorndyke becomes increasingly suspicious of Diesel and Montague,
he is approached by the mysterious Hitchcockian-blonde Victoria
Brisbane (Kahn), whose father is a patient at the hospital.
Thorndyke and Brisbane uncover a plot by Diesel and Montague to
imprison wealthy patients for profit with Thorndyke framed for a
murder. On the run as a Hitchcockian Wrong Man, Thorndyke is able to
rescue Brisbane's father and clear himself of all crimes, marrying
Brisbane in the end. [6]
The film was another modest hit for Brooks, earning $31 million and
received mixed reviews.
Later film
career
Brooks in c. February 1984
By 1980,
Siskel and Ebert
called Mel Brooks and
Woody Allen
"the two most successful comedy directors in the
world today ... America's two funniest filmmakers." [19]
That year, Brooks produced the dramatic film
The Elephant Man
(directed by
David Lynch ). Knowing that anyone seeing a poster reading "Mel
Brooks presents
The Elephant Man " would expect a comedy, he
set up the company Brooksfilms. Brooksfilms has since produced a
number of non-comedy films, including
David Cronenberg 's
The Fly ,
Frances , and
84 Charing Cross Road , starring
Anthony Hopkins
and
Anne Bancroft , along with comedies, including
Richard Benjamin 's
My Favorite Year , which was partially based on Mel Brooks'
real life. Brooks sought to purchase the rights to
84 Charing Cross Road
for his wife,
Anne Bancroft
for many years. He successfully obtained the
rights to the movie and presented them to her as an anniversary
gift.
In 1981 Brooks joked that the only genres that he
had not spoofed were historical epics and Biblical spectacles. [6]
History of the World Part I
was a tongue-in-cheek look at
human culture from the
Dawn of Man
to the
French Revolution . The film was written, produced and directed
by Brooks with narration by
Orson Welles . It starred Brooks,
Dom DeLuise ,
Madeline Kahn ,
Harvey Korman ,
Cloris Leachman ,
Ron Carey ,
Gregory Hines ,
Mary-Margaret Humes ,
Pamela Stephenson ,
Spike Milligan ,
Sid Caesar
and
John Hurt .
The episodic film begins with "The Dawn of Man"
starring Sid Caesar as a Caveman who discovers fire and music. Next
it covers "The Old Testament" where Brooks plays a bumbling Moses
who breaks one of God's tablets thus denying humans of 5 of the
original 15 commandments. In "The Roman Emperor", Brooks plays a
stand-up philosopher who, along with a Vestal Virgin (Humes) and a
slave (Hines), gets into trouble with Emperor Nero (DeLuise) and
Empress Nympho (Kahn) but they manage to escape unharmed. Eventually
Brooks gets a job as the waiter at the Last Supper of Jesus (Hurt).
In "The Spanish Inquisition", Brooks portrays the violent and tragic
Inquisition of Jews as a grandiose
Busby Berkeley -like musical number. In "The French Revolution"
Brooks plays both King Louis and the King's look-a-like "piss boy".
He manages to help Mademoiselle Rimbaud (Stephenson) save her father
(Milligan) from prison. The film's final section, "Coming
Attractions", is a fake trailer for the sequel to the film and
includes "Hitler on Ice" and "Jews in Space".
This film was another modest financial hit,
earning $31 million. It received mixed critical reviews. Critic
Pauline Kael, who for years had been critical of Brooks, said
"Either you get stuck thinking about the bad taste or you let
yourself laugh at the obscenity in the humor as you do Bunuel's
perverse dirty jokes." [6]
As part of the film's soundtrack, Brooks, then
aged 55, recorded a rap entitled
"It's Good to Be the King" ,
a parody of
Louis XVI
and the
French Revolution . It was released as a single and became a
surprise dance hit in the United States.
In 1983 Brooks produced and starred in (but did
not write or direct) a remake of the classic 1942
Ernst Lubitsch
film .
To Be or Not to Be
was directed by
Alan Johnson
and starred Brooks,
Anne Bancroft ,
Charles Durning ,
Tim Matheson ,
Jose Ferrer
and
Christopher Lloyd . The film was not a financial success, earning
only $13 million.
The film spawned a highly controversial single
that was featured as part of the film's soundtrack album (although
not in the film itself) - " To
Be Or Not To Be" (The Hitler Rap) . The song - satirizing German
society in the 1940s with Brooks playing Hitler - was an unlikely
hit, peaking at #12 on the UK Singles Chart in February 1984 and #3
on the Australian Singles Chart (Kent Music Report) that same year.
The second movie Brooks directed in the 80s came
in 1987 in the form of
Spaceballs , a parody of
science fiction , mainly
Star Wars . The film starred
Bill Pullman ,
John Candy ,
Rick Moranis ,
Daphne Zuniga ,
Dick Van Patten ,
Joan Rivers ,
Dom DeLuise
and Brooks himself.
In the 1990s Brooks directed
Life Stinks
in 1991,
Robin Hood: Men in Tights
in 1993 and
Dracula: Dead and Loving It
in 1995.
Life Stinks
was
a financial and critical failure, but is notable as being the only
film that Brooks directed that is neither a parody nor a film about
other films or theater ( The Twelve Chairs
was a parody of the
original novel). It is also notable as being Brooks' last leading
role in a film (as of 2011).
Gene Siskel
put
Robin Hood: Men in Tights
on his "Worst
of 1993" list, saying that Brooks has "clearly lost his way" in
comedy.
Brooks also had a vocal role in the 2005 animated
film
Robots . He then worked on an
animated series
sequel
to
Spaceballs
called
Spaceballs: The TV Series , which premiered on September 21,
2008 on
G4 TV .
Musicals
One of his most recent successes has been the
transference of his film
The Producers
to the
Broadway
stage. The show broke the Tony record with 12 wins, a
record that had previously been held for 37 years by
Hello, Dolly!
at 10 wins. Such success has translated to a
big-screen version of the Broadway adaptation/remake with actors
Matthew Broderick
and
Nathan Lane
reprising their stage roles, in addition to new cast
members
Uma Thurman
and
Will Ferrell . In early April 2006, Brooks began
composing
the score to a Broadway
musical adaptation of
Young Frankenstein , which he says
is "perhaps the best movie [he] ever made." The world premiere was
performed at Seattle's most historic theater (originally built as a
movie palace), The Paramount Theater, between August 7, 2007, and
September 1, 2007 after which it opened on Broadway at the former
Foxwoods Theater
(then the Hilton Theater), New York, on October
11, 2007. It earned mixed reviews from the critics.
Brooks joked about the concept of a musical
adaptation of
Blazing Saddles
in the final number in
Young
Frankenstein , in which the full company sings, "next year,
Blazing Saddles !" In 2010, Mel Brooks confirmed this, saying
that the musical could be finished within a year. No creative team
or plan has been announced. [20]
Legacy
Brooks in April 2010
Brooks is one of the
few artists
who have received an
Oscar ,
Emmy ,
Tony , and
Grammy . He was awarded his first Grammy for Best Spoken Comedy
Album in 1999 for his recording of
The 2000 Year Old Man in the
Year 2000
with Carl Reiner. His two other Grammys came in 2002
for Best Musical Show Album for the soundtrack of
The Producers
and for Best Long Form Music Video for the DVD "Recording the
Producers - A Musical Romp with Mel Brooks". He won his first of
four Emmy awards in 1967 for Outstanding Writing Achievement in
Variety for a
Sid Caesar
special and went on to win three consecutive Emmys in
1997, 1998, and 1999 for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series
for his role of Uncle Phil on
Mad About You . He won his three Tony awards in 2001 for his
work on the musical,
The Producers
for Best Musical, Best
Original Musical Score, and Best Book of a Musical. Additionally, he
won a
Hugo Award
and a
Nebula Award
for
Young Frankenstein . In a 2005 poll to
find
The Comedian's Comedian , he was voted #50 of the top 50
comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. Three of
Brooks's films are on the
American Film Institute 's list of
funniest American films :
Blazing Saddles
(#6),
The
Producers
(#11), and
Young Frankenstein
(#13).
Brooks developed a repertory company of sorts for
his film work: performers with three or more of Brooks' films ( The
Producers, The Twelve Chairs, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein,
Silent Movie, High Anxiety, History of the World: Part I,
Spaceballs, Life Stinks, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, and Dracula:
Dead and Loving It ) to their credit include
Gene Wilder ,
Dom DeLuise ,
Madeline Kahn ,
Harvey Korman ,
Cloris Leachman ,
Ron Carey ,
Dick Van Patten
and
Andréas Voutsinas .
Dom DeLuise
appeared in six of Brooks's 11 original films, the
only person with more appearances being Brooks himself.
Brooks and his wife
Anne Bancroft
acted together in
Silent Movie
and
To Be
or Not to Be
and Bancroft also had a bit part in the 1995 film
Dracula: Dead and Loving It . Years later, the couple
appeared as themselves in the fourth season finale of
Curb Your Enthusiasm , spoofing the finale of
The
Producers . It is reported that Bancroft encouraged Brooks (after
an idea suggested by David Geffen) to take
The Producers
to
Broadway where it became an enormous success.
In interviews broadcast on WABC radio, Brooks has
discussed with NYC radio personality
Mark Simone
the possibilities of turning other works from his
creative oeuvre (such as the movie
Blazing Saddles ) into
future musical productions. Specifically, in a conversation airing
March 1, 2008, he and Simone speculated on what show tunes might be
incorporated into a theatrical adaptation of the
Get Smart
property.
On December 5, 2009 Brooks was one of five
recipients of the 2009
Kennedy Center
Honors at the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. [21]
On April 23, 2010 Brooks was awarded the 2,406th
star on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame . [22]

Brooks was married to Florence Baum from 1953 to
1962. Their marriage ended in divorce. Mel and Florence had three
children, Stephanie, Nicky, and Eddie. [ citation

Brooks was married to the actress
Anne Bancroft
from 1964 until her death from uterine cancer on
June 6, 2005. They met at a rehearsal for the
Perry Como
Variety Show
in 1961 and married three years later, August 5, at
the
Manhattan Marriage Bureau . Their son,
Max Brooks , was born in 1972. In 2010, Brooks credited Bancroft
as being the guiding force behind his involvement in developing
The Producers
and
Young Frankenstein
for the musical theater, citing an early
meeting as "From that day, until her death on June 5, 2005, we were
glued together." [23]
