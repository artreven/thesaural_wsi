A
film score
is essentially the background music of a film (which is generally categorically separated from songs used within a film). The term
soundtrack
is often confused with
film score , but a soundtrack also includes anything else audible in the film such as sound effects and dialogue. Soundtrack albums may also include
songs
featured in the film as well as previously released music by other artists. A score is written specifically to accompany a
film , by the original film's composer(s). [ 1 ]
Each individual piece of music, within a film's score, is called a cue and is typically a composition for instruments (e.g.
orchestra ) and/or non-individually featured voices. Since the 1950s, a growing number of scores are electronic or a hybrid of orchestral and electronic instruments. [ 2 ]
Since the invention of
digital technology
and
audio sampling , many low budget films have been able to rely on digital samples to imitate the sound of real live instruments.

Process of creation
Usually, after the film has been shot (or some shooting has been completed), the composer is shown an unpolished "rough cut" of the film (or of the scenes partially finished), and talks to the director about what sort of music (styles, themes, etc.) should be used — this process is called "spotting." [ 3 ]
More rarely, the director will talk to the composer before shooting has started, so as to give more time to the composer or because the director needs to shoot scenes (namely song or dance scenes) according to the final score. Sometimes the director will have edited the film using "temp (temporary) music": already published pieces that are similar to what the director wants. Most film composers [ who? ]
strongly dislike temp music, as directors [ who? ]
often become accustomed to it and push the composers to be imitators rather than creators. [ citation needed ]
On certain occasions, directors have become so attached to the temp score that they decide to use it and reject the score custom-made by a composer. One of the most famous cases is
Stanley Kubrick 's
2001: A Space Odyssey , where Kubrick opted for existing recordings of classical works rather than the score by
Alex North , [ 4 ]
which eventually led to a law suit by composer
György Ligeti
when he was surprised to hear his compositions in a motion film; [ 5 ]
though one should note Kubrick hired two composers (the other Frank Cordell) to do a score, and while North's
2001
is indeed a famous example, it is not the sole example of well-known rejected scores. Others include
Torn Curtain
(Bernard Herrmann), [ 6 ]
Troy
(Gabriel Yared), [ 7 ]
Peter Jackson's
King Kong
(Howard Shore) [ 8 ]
and the
The Bourne Identity
(John Powell). [ 9 ]
Once a composer has the film, they will then work on creating the score. While some composers prefer to work with traditional paper scores, many film composers write in a computer-based environment. [ 10 ]
This allows the composer and
orchestrator
to create MIDI-based demos of themes and cues, called
MIDI mockups , for review by the filmmaker prior to the final orchestral recording. Some films are then re-edited to better fit the music. Instances of this include the collaborations between filmmaker
Godfrey Reggio
and composer
Philip Glass , where over several years the score and film are edited multiple times to better suit each other. [ 11 ]
Similar to these are the associations between
Sergio Leone
and
Ennio Morricone . In the finale of
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly , Morricone had prepared the score used before and Leone edited the scenes to match it. [ 12 ]
His other two famous films,
Once Upon a Time in the West
and
Once Upon a Time in America , were completely edited to Morricone's score as the composer had prepared it months before the film's production. Another example is the famous chase scene in
Steven Spielberg 's
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial . The score, composed by long-time collaborator
John Williams , proved so difficult to synchronize in this specific scene during the recording sessions that, as recounted in a companion documentary on the DVD, Spielberg gave Williams
carte blanche
and asked him to record the cue without picture, freely; Spielberg then re-edited the scene later on to perfectly match the music.
When the music has been composed and
orchestrated , the orchestra or ensemble then performs it, often with the composer conducting. Musicians for these ensembles are often uncredited in the film or on the album and are contracted individually (and if so, the orchestra contractor is credited in the film or the soundtrack album). However, some films have recently begun crediting the contracted musicians on the albums under the name
Hollywood Studio Symphony
after an agreement with the
American Federation of Musicians . Other performing ensembles that are often employed include the
London Symphony Orchestra , the
City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra
(an orchestra dedicated exclusively to recording), and the
Northwest Sinfonia .
The orchestra performs in front of a large screen depicting the movie, and sometimes to a series of clicks called a "click-track" that changes with
meter
and tempo, assisting the conductor to synchronize the music with the film. [ 13 ]
Films often have different themes for important characters, events, ideas or objects, taking the idea from
Wagner 's use of
leitmotif . [ 14 ]
These may be played in different variations depending on the situation they represent, scattered amongst incidental music. A famous example of this technique is
John Williams ' score for the
Star Wars
saga, and the numerous themes associated with characters like
Darth Vader ,
Luke Skywalker , and
Princess Leia Organa
(see
Star Wars
music
for more details). [ 15 ]
The Lord of the Rings trilogy
uses a similar technique, with recurring themes for many main characters and places. Others are less known by casual moviegoers, but well known among score enthusiasts, such as Jerry Goldsmith's underlying theme for the
Borg
in
Star Trek: First Contact , or his Klingon theme from
Star Trek: The Motion Picture
which other composers carry over into their Klingon motifs, and he has brought back on numerous occasions as the theme for
Worf ,
Star Trek: The Next Generation's
most prominent Klingon.
Most films have between 40 and 120 minutes of music. However, some films have very little or no music; others may feature a score that plays almost continuously throughout.
Dogme 95
is a genre that has music only from sources within a film, such as from a radio or television. This is called "source music" because it comes from an on screen source that can actually be seen or that can be inferred (in academic
film theory
such music is called " diegetic " music, as it emanates from the " diegesis " or "story world"). [ 16 ]
A famous example of "source music" is the use of the
Frankie Valli
song "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" in
Michael Cimino 's " The Deer Hunter ".
Alfred Hitchcock's
1963 thriller
The Birds
is a rare example of a Hollywood film with no
non-diegetic
music whatsoever.
In 1983 a non-profit organization, the
Society for the Preservation of Film Music , was actually formed to preserve the "byproducts" of creating a film score: [ 17 ]
the music manuscripts (written music) and other documents and studio recordings generated in the process of composing and recording scores which, in some instances, have been discarded by the movie studios. The written music must be kept to perform the music on concert programs and to make new recordings of it. Sometimes only after decades has an archival recording of a film score been released on CD.

Historical notes
Before the age of recorded sound in motion pictures, great effort was taken to provide suitable music for films, usually through the services of an in-house pianist or organist, and, in some cases, entire orchestras, typically given
cue sheets
as a guide. In 1914,
The Oz Film Manufacturing Company
sent full-length scores by
Louis F. Gottschalk
for their films. Other examples of this include
Victor Herbert 's score in 1915 to
Fall of a Nation
(a sequel to
Birth of a Nation ) and
Camille Saint-Saëns ' music for
L'Assassinat du duc de Guise
in 1908 — arguably the very first in movie history. It was preceded by
Nathaniel D. Mann 's score for
The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays
by four months, but that was a mixture of interrelated stage and film performance in the tradition of old
magic lantern
shows. Most accompaniments at this time, these examples notwithstanding, comprised pieces by famous composers, also including studies. These were often used to form catalogues of film music, which had different subsections broken down by 'mood' and/or genre: dark, sad, suspense, action, chase, etc. This made things much easier for the in-house pianists and orchestras to pick pieces that fitted the particular feel of a movie and its scenes.
German cinema, which was highly influential in the era of silent movies, provided some original scores. Fritz Lang's movies
Die Nibelungen
(1924) and
Metropolis
(1927) were accompanied by original full scale orchestral and leitmotific scores written by Gottfried Huppertz, who also wrote piano-versions of his music, so that it could be played in smaller cinemas, too. Friedrich W. Murnau's movies
Nosferatu
(1922 - music by Hans Erdmann) and
Faust – eine deutsche Volkssage
(1926 - music by Werner Richard Heymann) also had original scores written for them. Other films like Murnaus's
Der letzte Mann
contained a mixing of original compositions (in this case by Giuseppe Becce) and library music / folk tunes, which were artistically included into the score by the composer. Nevertheless fully developed original scores were quite rare in the silent movie era. It should also be noted that as soon as sound had come to movies, director Fritz Lang barely used musical scores in his movies anymore. Apart of Peter Lorre whistling a short piece from Edvard Grieg's
Peer Gynt , Lang's movie
M - Eine Stadt sucht einen Mörder
was lacking musical accompaniment completely and
Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse
only included one original piece written for the movie by Hans Erdmann played at the very beginning and end of the movie. One of the rare occasions on which music occurs in the movie is a song one of the characters sings, that Lang uses to put emphasis on the man's insanity, quite similar to the use of the whistling in
M .
Though "the scoring of narrative features during the 1940s lagged decades behind technical innovations in the field of concert music," [ 18 ]
the 1950s saw the rise of the
modernist
film score. Director
Elia Kazan
was open to the idea of jazz influences and dissonant scoring and worked with Alex North, whose score for
A Streetcar Named Desire
(1951) combined dissonance with elements of blues and jazz. Kazan also approached
Leonard Bernstein
to score
On the Waterfront
(1954): the result was reminiscent of earlier works by
Aaron Copland
and
Igor Stravinsky
with its "jazz-based harmonies and exciting additive rhythms." [ 19 ]
A year later,
Leonard Rosenman , inspired by
Arnold Schoenberg , experimented with atonality in his scores for
East of Eden
(1955) and
Rebel Without a Cause
(1955). In his ten-year collaboration with
Alfred Hitchcock ,
Bernard Herrmann
experimented with daring musical endeavors in
Vertigo
(1958),
Psycho
(1960)--and
The Birds
(1963). The use of non-diegetic jazz was another modernist innovation, perhaps most notably in jazz star
Duke Ellington 's score for
Otto Preminger 's
Anatomy of a Murder
(1959).
A full film score widely regarded as the first made by a popular artist came in 1973 with the film
Pat Garret and Billy the Kid , by
Bob Dylan . However the album received very little critical acclaim. This had not been done before in popular film history: any featured band had films written around the music (notably
The Beatles
with
Yellow Submarine ).
[ edit ]
Television score
A
television score
is a broad term referring to the music in a television programs which is generally categorically separated from songs used within a television.
The term
television score
is frequently synonymous with
television soundtrack , though a soundtrack may also include the
songs
used in the television program while the score does not. A score is sometimes written specifically to accompany a
television program , but may also be compiled from previously written
musical compositions .
Each individual piece of music within a television's score is called a cue, and is typically a composition for instruments (e.g.
orchestra ) and/or non-individually featured voices. Since the 1950s, a growing number of scores are electronic, or a hybrid of orchestral and electronic instruments. Since the invention of
digital technology
and
audio sampling , many low-budget television programs have had to rely on digital samples to imitate the sound of live instruments. [1]

Non-orchestral film scores
Non-orchestral film music includes any genre of music not associated with classical music or orchestral performance. Composers that use the orchestra for experimental composition are usually noted as experimental composers rather than orchestral ones. Other genres of film scores include, but are not limited to
Rock ,
Pop ,
Folk ,
Blues ,
Experimental ,
Electronic ,
Hip hop ,
Heavy metal ,
Jazz ,
musicals
and
World music . Some of the orchestral composers listed above also compose in these genres although they are usually noted for their orchestral music. Fewer composers are noted for both their orchestral and non-orchestral compositions and most non-orchestral film composers are noted for the specific genre they compose in. Some non-orchestral composers are also noted artists with their own compositions.

Production music
Main article:
production music
Many companies such as Associated Production Music and Extreme Music provide music to various film, TV and commercial projects for a fee. Sometimes called library music, the music is owned by production music libraries and licensed to customers for use in film, television, radio and other media. Unlike popular and classical music publishers, who typically own less than 50 percent of the copyright in a composition, music production libraries own all of the copyrights of their music, meaning that it can be licensed without seeking the composer's permission, as is necessary in licensing music from normal publishers. This is because virtually all music created for music libraries is done on a
work for hire
basis. Production music is therefore a very convenient medium for media producers — they can be assured that they will be able to license any piece of music in the library at a reasonable rate.
Production music libraries will typically offer a broad range of musical styles and genres, enabling producers and editors to find much of what they need in the same library. Music libraries vary in size from a few hundred tracks up to many thousands. The first production music library was setup by De Wolfe in 1927 with the advent of sound in film, the company originally scored music for use in silent film. [ 20 ]
Another music library was set up by Ralph Hawkes of Boosey & Hawkes Music Publishers in the 1930s. [ 21 ]
APM, the largest US library, has over 250,000 tracks. [ 22 ]
