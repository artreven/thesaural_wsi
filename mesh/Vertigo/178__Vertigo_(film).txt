Melancholia  is a 2011 film written and directed by  Lars von Trier , starring  Kirsten Dunst ,  Charlotte Gainsbourg  and  Kiefer Sutherland . The narrative revolves around two sisters during and shortly after the wedding party of one of them, while Earth is about to collide with an approaching  rogue planet . The film prominently features music from the prelude to  Richard Wagner ‘s opera  Tristan und Isolde  (1857–59).
Trier’s initial inspiration for the film came from a depressive episode he suffered and the insight that depressed people remain calm in stressful situations. The film is a Danish production by  Zentropa , with international co-producers in Sweden, France, Germany and Italy. Filming took place in Sweden.
The film premiered in May 2011 at the  64th Cannes Film Festival . Dunst received the festival’s  Best Actress Award  for her performance.

Brazil – Terry Gilliam (1985)
June 21, 2012
by
cinecube
Brazil  is a 1985 British  science fiction   fantasy / black comedy film  directed by  Terry Gilliam .
Pitting the imagination of common man Sam Lowry (the brilliantly befuddled Jonathan Pryce) against the oppressive storm troopers of the Ministry of Information, Terry Gilliam’s  Brazil  has come to be regarded as an anti-totalitarianism cautionary tale equal to the works of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, and Kurt Vonnegut Jr. Gathering footage from both the European and American versions of this masterpiece, Gilliam has assembled the ultimate, 142-minute director’s cut of his most celebrated film.
The film stars  Jonathan Pryce  and features  Robert De Niro ,  Kim Greist ,  Michael Palin ,  Katherine Helmond ,  Bob Hoskins , and  Ian Holm .
Gilliam’s original cut of the film is 142 minutes long and ends on a dark note. This version was released internationally outside the US by  20th Century Fox .
US distribution was handled by  Universal . Universal executives thought the ending tested poorly, and Universal chairman  Sid Sheinberg  insisted on dramatically re-editing the film to give it a happy ending, a decision that Gilliam resisted vigorously. [18]  As with the cult science fiction film  Blade Runner  (1982), which had been released three years earlier, a version of  Brazil  was created by the  movie studio  with a more consumer-friendly ending. After a lengthy delay with no sign of the film being released, Gilliam took out a full-page ad in the trade magazine  Variety  urging Sheinberg to release  Brazil  in its intended version. Eventually, after Gilliam conducted private screenings (without the studio’s approval),  Brazil  was awarded the  Los Angeles Film Critics Association  award for “Best Picture”, which prompted Universal to finally agree to release a modified 132-minute version supervised by Gilliam, in  1985 .
Los Angeles Times  critic  Kenneth Turan  described the film as “the most potent piece of satiric political cinema since  Dr. Strangelove “.

Seijun Suzuki interview
June 17, 2012
by
cinecube
According to critic Manohla Dargis, “To experience a film by Japanese B-movie visionary Seijun Suzuki is to experience Japanese cinema in all its frenzied, voluptuous excess.” Suzuki played chaos like jazz in his movies, from the anything-goes  yakuza  thrillers  Tokyo Drifter  and  Branded to Kill to the daring postwar dramas of human frailty  Gate of Flesh and  Story of a Prostitute  to the twisted coming-of-age story Fighting Elegy ; he never concerned himself with moderation, cramming boundless invention into his beautifully composed frames, both color and black-and-white. Suzuki first pursued film after returning home to Tokyo from service in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II and failing university entrance exams. Following an unsatisfying stint as an assistant director at Shochiku, Suzuki was lured in 1954 to the recently reopened Nikkatsu studio, which was hiring fresh talent to appeal to a new kind of youth audience. He flourished there for years, with such films as  Take Aim at the Police Van and especially  Youth of the Beast,  a commercial breakthrough for him. Yet his bosses became more and more opposed to his increasingly surreal visual stylings and lack of attention to narrative coherence, and after he made Branded to Kill, which a superior deemed “incomprehensible,” they unceremoniously (and illegally) revoked his contract. Of course, as any true Suzuki fan (and they are legion) knows, the incomprehensibility is part of the fun, and today his sixties works are considered some of the most essential of the Japanese New Wave.

Branded To Kill – Seijun Suzuki (1967)
June 17, 2012
by
cinecube
Branded to Kill  (殺しの烙印  Koroshi no rakuin )  is a 1967 Japanese  yakuza film  directed by  Seijun Suzuki  and starring  Joe Shishido ,  Koji Nanbara ,  Annu Mari  and  Mariko Ogawa .
When Japanese New Wave bad boy Seijun Suzuki delivered this brutal, hilarious, and visually inspired masterpiece to the executives at his studio ( Nikkatsu ), he was promptly fired. Branded to Kill tells the ecstatically bent story of a yakuza assassin with a fetish for sniffing steamed rice (the chipmunk-cheeked superstar Joe Shishido) who botches a job and ends up a target himself. Seijun Suzuki’s Branded to Kill is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It is about as close to traditional Yakuza pictures as Godard’s Alphaville is to science fiction. This is Suzuki at his most extreme—the flabbergasting pinnacle of his sixties pop-art aesthetic.
The film grew a strong following, which expanded overseas in the 1980s, and has established itself as a cult classic. Film critics and enthusiasts now regard it as an absurdist masterpiece. It has been cited as an influence by filmmakers such as Jim Jarmusch, John Woo, Chan-wook Park and Quentin Tarantino. Jarmusch listed it as his favourite hitman film, alongside  Le Samouraï  (also 1967) and thanked Suzuki in the screen credits of his own hitman film  Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai  (1999). Most notably, Jarmusch mirrored a scene in which the protagonist kills a target by shooting up from a basement through a sink drain.

La Jetée – Chris Marker (1962)
June 11, 2012
by
cinecube
La jetée  is a 1962 French science fiction  featurette  by  Chris Marker .
Time travel, still images, a past, present and future and the aftermath of World War III. The tale of a man, a slave, sent back and forth, in and out of time, to find a solution to the world’s fate. To replenish its decreasing stocks of food, medicine and energies, and in doing so, resulting in a perpetual memory of a lone female, life, death and past events that are recreated on an airports jetée.
La jetée  is constructed almost entirely from  optically printed  photographs playing out as a  photomontage  of varying pace. It contains only one brief shot originating on a motion-picture camera. The stills were taken with a  Pentax Spotmatic  and the motion-picture segment was shot with a  35mm   Arriflex . The film has no dialogue aside from small sections of muttering in German. The story is told by a voice-over  narrator. The scene in which the hero and the woman look at a cut-away trunk of a tree is a reference to  Alfred Hitchcock ‘s 1958 film  Vertigo , which Marker also references in  Sans soleil .

Sans Soleil – Chris Marker (1983)
June 11, 2012
by
cinecube
Sans Soleil  ( Sunless  in English) is a  1983 French film  directed by  Chris Marker . It is a meditation on the nature of human memory, showing the inability to recall the context and nuances of memory and how, as a result, the perception of personal and global histories are affected.
Sans Soleil  is Marker’s tour de force as a cinematic essayist, all playful musings and meandering digressions, in which passing observations on such apparently banal subjects as pet cats and video games yield profound insights into the big issues of twentieth-century civilization: history, memory, political power, the function of representation, ritual and time. The premise of  Sans Soleil  is a woman reading out letters from a globe-trotting cameraman, who we learn in the closing credits is named Sandor Krasna. Krasna is drawn especially to Japan and the former Portuguese West African colonies of Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau; he also visits Iceland, Île-de-France, and San Francisco, being obsessed with Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo. We must lean on these bare coordinates all we can, since nothing can fully prepare the novice viewer for the exhilarating kaleidoscope of ideas, associations, and fleetingly gorgeous visions that  Sans Soleil  offers. Like a piece of music, it does demand (and generously repay) repeat viewings. Through Krasna—whose presence is itself filtered through the sensibility of the woman who reads, and occasionally comments upon, his letters—Marker fuses the urbane wit of his earliest travel films to the persona of the political militant, now somewhat disabused by the collapse of the struggles he has supported, but not so shortsighted as to deny the value of those who, “like Che Guevara, tremble with indignation every time an injustice is committed.”

by
cinecube
Chinatown  is a 1974 American  neo-noir  film, directed by  Roman Polanski  from a screenplay by  Robert Towne  and starring  Jack Nicholson ,  Faye Dunaway and  John Huston . The film features many elements of the  film noir  genre, particularly a multi-layered story that is part  mystery  and part  psychological   drama . It was released by  Paramount Pictures . The story, set in  Los Angeles  in 1937, was inspired by the  California Water Wars , the historical disputes over land and water rights that had raged in southern California during the 1910s and 1920s, in which  William Mulholland  acted on behalf of Los Angeles interests to secure water rights in the  Owens Valley .  Chinatown  was the last film  Roman Polanski  made in the United States before fleeing to Europe.
