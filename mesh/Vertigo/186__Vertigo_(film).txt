Good Mornin'
Good mornin', Good mornin'! We've talked the whole night through, Good mornin' Good mornin' to you. Good mornin', good mornin'! It's great to stay up late, Good mornin', good mornin' to you. When the band began to play The stars was shinin' bright. Now the milkman's on his way, It's too late to say goodnight. So, good mornin', good mornin'! Sunbeams will soon smile through, Good mornin', good mornin', to you, And you, and you, and you! Good morning, Good morning, We've gabbed the whole night through. Good morning, good morning to you. Nothin' could be grander than to be in
Louisiana In the morning, In the morning, It's great to stay up late! Good mornin', Good mornin' to you. It might be just a zippy If we was in Mississipi! When we left the movie show The future wasn't bright But came dawn The show goes on And I don't wanna say good night So say, Good Mornin'! Good Mornin'! Rainbow is shining through Good Mornin'! Good Mornin'! Bon Jour! Bon Jour! Buenos Dias! Buenos Dias! Buon Giorno! Buon Giorno! Guten Morgen! Guten Morgen! Good morning to you. from the musical
Singin in the Rain.

Celluloid
My way to deal with stress or to escape dismal reality is to watch movies. Reading home interior mags soothes too but it can also induce great sadness. Jeez. I'm being very dramatic. This is what happens when I DON"T want to touch up on my case to be presented tomorrow, and after drinking a bottle of Vanilla Coke. Yup. So , the movies. The Iron Giant
you have to have to watch. I LOVED it. A classic film even though it's pretty recent, if you count 1999 as recent. I was amazed at the level of emotion that was infused into these 2D characters. Aawww, I cried towards the end. Sigh. It's just a cartoon robot Jasveen! 4 stars. Two Hitchcock films,
39 Steps
is first. A black and white, unfortunately without subtitles so we were straining to hear the words. But it was good none-the-less. I enjoyed the witty banter, the mystery that has to be solved and the chemistry between actors was great. 3.5 out of 5. We saw
The Birds
before 39 Steps, and I liked it! 4 stars for The Birds. My sis and I saw this late evening, just the two of us in the house, in the dark, and almost freaking out! Did I mention I'm kinda scared of birds? The tension was unbearable, heightened by the lack of a music soundtrack/score. A Hitchcock film you have to see. Best in Show
came recommended by Greg. I think. Anyway, finally rented this mockumentary about dog show contestants & their owners, and I have to say, I'm surprised at the PG rating - it's certainly a bit more than that. It was definitely funny -
moments that make you go 'oh my god!' then laugh. The people are just crazy! Good watch for a lazy Sunday afternoon. 3.5 stars. 3 stars for
Sahara
which is your basic, fun-filled action adventure with the required funny sidekick, feisty woman and a bit of romance. If you are in the mood for some semi-brainless action with gorgeous scenery, if you think the desert in gorgeous, then watch this. Or if you are ovulating and want to lay eyes on Matthew "I'm too sexy for this shirt" McConaughey. Finally, French made English-spoken with a smattering of ancient Egyptian sci-fi fantasy,
Immortal
a.k.a Immortel (Ad Vitam). I have some problems with it. Okay, the good; it's pretty slick and imaginative. I appreciate a good, convulated science fiction tale. What I had trouble with was the hollow feel to it. How it tries to come across as fancy, high-brow stuff but the I just didn't feel for any of the characters. At all. In 'normal' sci-fi tales, you've got the action to distract you. Here, not much by way of guns and explosions. So a generous 3 stars from me. Funny how I always write more about films I have gripes with - but limit myself to adjectives like fabulous, great, fantastic, magnificent, good or nice for the ones I enjoyed.Couldn't run for ever. Back to the study table! Bye-bye. ----------------

Wahahahahahahaa!
A bit, just a bit
gila
at the moment. Because
aku nak tidur
and because there's a moth somewhere in the apartment. Finished Emergency Medicine today - next up, Psychiatry. Another major reason to feel a little crazed. Anyhoo, some dvds we saw. Some Like it Hot
is oodles of fun. And very sexy! This is the second film I've seen with Marilyn Monroe and I can now understand why she's a sex-symbol. Oh.My.God. You have to watch the movie to at least see that dress she wears - so daring for that time. Sheesh. I still can't get over it. Jack Lemmon was hilarious as Jerry/Daphne, as he and Joe/Josephine, played by Tony Curtis, disguise themselves as women to escape the wrath of gangsters. This is a funny, must-see classic. 4 out of 5. I've been told that
The Princess Bride
is a cult movie, something to watch. So I finally did. Unfortunately, the quality of my rented dvd sucked big time. I had to skip over several scenes. Also, the volume was off - soft during conversations and loud every other time. Which is a pity, 'cos as it got towards the end and we could really listen to the dialouge, it was funny, witty stuff. Now, it appears dated, but none-the-less, enjoyable. I'd say, 3 out of 5? Sigh. What can I say about the absolutely gorgeous Triplets of Belleville or in its original name,
Les Triplettes de Belleville ? Beautiful graphics, and even more fantastic story-line and awesome music, I highly recommend this. The story of a little old Grandmother, doing whatever it takes to save her beloved grandson. Very little dialouge, the story is told by imagery and the brilliant, subtle things that bring the characters to life. Gosh. This stands along side Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle, as cartoons that go beyond the Disney/Pixar/Dreamworks stereotype. 4.5 stars out of 5. We couldn't resist re-viewing
Hot Fuzz . It is action-packed and fuh-nee! Only the Brits can do this kind of humour ... Eunice, have you seen this? If not, the dvd is out now! Stopping here. Night-night everybody. ---------------- Now playing:

Out & About ~ 6th October 2007
Tip of the day: if you are looking for souvenirs from an exhibition, go on the last few days. The prices get chopped down quite a bit. Rathyana and me went to the Guggenheim Collection: 1940s to Now exhibition at the NGV International yesterday. I was surprised to see such a long queue of people but I guess, like us, they waited till the last minute. We spent 2 hours there - unfortunately missing out on one video/sound exhibit 'cos there was a crowd in that room. Anyway, it was a bit scary that I was standing so close to works from Warhol and Pollock. I quite like Pollock and there were two small paintings there. Too bad none of his larger pieces were here. Alright, going through a whole list of artists we found interesting: 1.
Heinz Mack
and his sculpture,
The Joy of Clavin 2.
Jesus Rafael Soto ,
Vibration
: I liked this one because when you move from side to side, you'll understand why it's called Vibration. Heh-heh, trippy. 3.
Victor Vasarely 's Cheyt - M 4.
Asger Jorn
had a wonderful
painting
which I liked 5.
Alberto Giacometti
had two sculptures, both great, The Nose and
Standing Woman . 6.
Sol LeWitt
was marvelous! His Wall Drawing #264 was a testament to patience. Google Image his name and you'll see what I mean. 7.
Dan Flavin
is famous for his use of fluorescent lights 8.
Roy Lichtenstein
had two paintings: IN and Preparedness, which was cool. Comic never looked this good. 9.
Jeff Koons
was another artist of the Pop Art movement, here with
Sandwiches
and
Mountains . 10. I loved
Dave Muller's The Northerly Set . Simple but beautiful. 11. The photograph,
Ameland Pier X, Netherlands by Elger Esser
was gorgeous. 12.
Nigel Cooke 's Mummy was eerie, especially if you look closely... 13.
Olafur Eliasson
had The Horizon Series at this exhibition which was beautiful photography. 14. Rathyana loved
Gregory Crewdson's Untitled (from the Twilight series) .
A bit jarring yet made me very curious. 15. The Asylum photographed by
James Casebere
was strangely haunting. 16.
Marina Abramovic
is an amazing female artist. Have to give her respect for using her body as art and allowing it to be used/abused by others. Also her video installation,
Cleaning the Mirror
is cool. 17. There were a few works by
Cindy Sherman
but the stand out was
Untitled #167 . It forces you to really examine the image and it felt disturbing, but you can't look away. 18.
Maurizio Cattelan
had one piece,
We are the revolution , that looks funny from side view, but when I stood face-to-face with the figurine, it gave me the creeps! 19. I was reluctant to pick up the licorice that was part of the
Felix Gonzales-Torres
piece,
untitled (Public Opinion)
but Rathyana did. I wonder if it's safe to eat. 20.
Ellsworth Kelly's Dark Blue Curve
looked beautiful on the white wall 21.
Jules Olitski
used spray-paint to create the lovely Lysander 1, which unfortunately, I can't find an image of on-line. 22. The optical illusion created by
Yaacov Agam
titled Aventure Pictural is another fave. Google Image his name to see some of his cool work. 23.
Electric Chair
by
Andy Warhol
was fascinating 24. I still can't believe I stood in front of
Jackson Pollock 's
Green Silver . Wow This is but a sample of the 68 artists and 85 works featured at this exhibition. Man, how I wish I could see them in the actual Guggenheim Museums.

Outs and Abouts

Good things
Risotto is easy and very yummy so long you have the time to stand there and stir constantly. However, the large pot in which this sticky, gooey meal was cooked in, is still in the sink. The main thing I dislike about cooking is the cleaning up after. Though that depends. Sometimes you can be in that mood where the simple, rhythmic action of washing the dishes is quite pleasant, uncomplicated and peaceful. Almost meditative.
Sometimes . Not today. Finally, I've let go. The Pandora embed I had on this page has been removed and replaced with something else: the Last.fm embed. Last.fm is a great place to listen to music and download free songs. I love their scrobbble feature that picks up songs you are listening to on your itunes or whatever. It'll even scrobble songs from your ipod. This way, you get to know the musical tastes of a person and learn about other musicians and artists. OoOo. Interesting shit happening around Nth Melbourne. A movie is being filmed around Errol Street and also saw trailers and a large truck with the sign "Racing Cars" on its side near the Nth Melbourne Station. Wouldn't it be fun if we could get a walk-on part? Though, it's about gangsters and I don't think two nerdy looking asian girls gel with the theme. The North Melbourne Town Hall is the epicenter for the
Melbourne Fringe Festival 2007
and the most amazing thing of all, a new shop selling vintage toys,
Arthur's Circus , has opened up so very near our place! Right opposite
Bethroned
that rents furniture for sets and photography. Sigh. I love this area. Free afternoons spent chatting at cafes, shops like Kids in Berlin, Meek & Folly, and Charles & Calypso to browse in. There are a few new cafes and restaurants which we haven't been to. Plus the bars, though that's unlikely a place I'd go in any time soon. Movies! Saw Vertigo and Perfect Stranger. Very briefly,
Vertigo , the 1958 classic from A. Hitchcock, was good. James Stewart is such a great actor! But mostly I like the way it was filmed. Pretty amazing shots of San Fransisco and the feel of the movie was
spot-on. The twists and turns were fascinating, kept me trying to figure out what was the play here, and Kim Novak was good. However, I have to say that Rope struck a chord much greater than this. So
Vertigo is a very close 3.75 to Rope's 4. Perfect Stranger
is a modern thriller starring Halle Berry, Bruce Willis and Giovanni Ribisi. Okay. First of all, I heard/read bad reviews about this film. And yes, the acting isn't very good, the ending is, well, weird. Not in
what
it is but
how
it got there. I don't know. I think it could have been more intelligently played out and the use of amateurish tools to throw audiences off-course is a bit annoying. Overall, this is 2.5.
And lastly, the new Real Living magazine interviewed the creative woman behind the
Absolutely Beautiful Things
blog which I have been to before. It's an amazing site, very drool worthy. Sigh. Sometimes reading these mags or visiting these sites make me feel sad 'cos I'd love to be as creative as those people. Sure, I have tremendous appreciation for such things but it would be a lot better to actually
have
talent. I wonder. If I had taken a course in this or did art in school, stuff like that, would that have helped? That's the problem isn't
it. Living in fear of failure. Right. Now I'm all chirpy. Fantabulous. :)

Gobble, Gobble
Hello, hello. Back, at last, to home, in the company of familiar people and things. It's hard to imagine life without the verbal jousting between Rathy and myself. Not for the first time, I wonder, why is it difficult to cultivate that same level of loving disdain, that easy comfort while talking of the mundane and gross, with other people. Oh well. Why give myself a headache with these questions.
Starting the emergency medicine rotation this week. It's going to be two weeks long and should be a good learning experience. Nothing too stressful, I hope. Today was spent triaging people which I enjoyed. The nurse let me triage two people. Never have I felt so important! Haha :) Though, that time when I got to see outpatients alone and write in the notes was pretty cool, too. Man, I sound like a geek but the fact that I'm here, in medicine, is testament to my geekiness and dorkism.
Moving on to Rope, a bloody good 1948 movie from Hitchcock. I came away with strong feelings. It's compelling and scary. Not axe-wielding scary but cold, callous scary. I still have a sense of disbelief about the actions of the two young men. And I don't know if it was intentional or not, but there appeared to be some homosexual vibes between them. James Stewart was good, different from what I recall in 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington' and 'It's A Wonderful Life'.
OOh, do watch this one. Very, very nice at 4 stars. We've got a few more Hitchcock's and eventually I hope to watch them all. Muahahahahaha! Also on the movie list, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. Aah, Jeff Bridges was such a joy to watch. He received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the delightful, youthful Lightfoot. While this has no mind-blowing action, it's the interaction between Clint Eastwood's character and Jeff plus the supporting cast, that makes this a good watch. 3.5 out of 5. Jeff was good. And so young! He was quite cute then. Dinner time!
