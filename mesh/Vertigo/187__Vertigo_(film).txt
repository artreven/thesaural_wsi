I love films.
I love old films.
I love old film stars.
I love old film everything.
Old = hmm…. for now I’m gonna talk about the 30’s and 40’s. But there are films I love from the 50’s, 60’s and 70’s and 80’s and 90’s so yeah, I’m not sure where ‘Old’ begins!!
Bear with me, now.
Ok, I’ll add in the 50’s for good measure. Yay!
Basically, I’m trawling those excellent Wikipedia lists at the moment, more accurately:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1930s_in_film
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940s_in_film
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950s_in_film
there that says it all really!!
Let’s start with the 30’s.
Gosh I love those beautiful 30’s film stars… But let’s save that for later shall we?
First, some context from lovely Wikipedia:
“The decade of the  1930s in film  involved many significant films. 1939 was one of the biggest years (and still is one of the greatest years) in  Hollywood .”
Oooooh!
“Many full-length films were produced during the decade of the 1930s. The 1930s were a decade of  political  turmoil and economic problems; the great depression had affected the entire world, and Europe was dealing with both the fallout of World War I and the economic hardships of the time, both of which resulted in the rise of fascist political movements. The uncertainty of the era resulted in widespread popularity of fantastical, escapist fare. Swashbuckling adventures and the safe scares of the Universal Horror films were highly successful during this period.”
Hmm. I am not acquainted with ‘Universal Horror films’.
However I know some lovely ‘swashbuckling ones’!! Cough *Errol Flynn* Cough.
“1930 also marks the beginning of what is considered to be the  ‘golden age’ of Hollywood , a period which lasted through at least the 1940s.”
Aw, that’s really sweet!! Come on Hollywood, what are you now??!!
Basically, below are all the films I have either heard about or watched. I would love to write reviews about all of these later on.
The Adventures of Robin Hood  (1938) starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland! A must see, please!! So feel good.. and um, Errol Flynn is very good looking of course..
All Quiet on the Western Front  (1930) Such a tearjerker! World War One..
Gone with the Wind  (1939) Argh!!!! I am virtually in the process of watching this one!!!! (It’s 238 minutes long…. all the better for me of course~!) Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia de Havilland… lovelovelove. Amazing filming, love it already.
Goodbye, Mr. Chips  (1939) I’ve only watched the beginning of this one, but my sisters and my b(r)other have watched it, and they all agree to it being an amazing, heartwarming and a veritable tearjerker… I think I should watch it during the holidays (Yep I’m on holiday now!! About time too~!)
Gulliver’s Travels  (1939) Oh yes, yes, YES!! Best animated Gulliver film ever (probably the only animated Gulliver film ever, but who cares??!!) Very very very funny.. We can all do imitations of all the characters. Much too unwatched for my liking. Watch it please!! Give it some well deserved love!
Oh dear, only 5 films I know from the 1930’s —– !!
However all this could change in a few years…
Now for the 1940’s. Wikipedia, come here~
“The  decade  of the  1940s in film  involved many significant films. Hundreds of full-length films were produced during the decade of the 1940s. The great actor  Humphrey Bogart  made his most memorable films in this decade.  Orson Welles ‘s masterpiece Citizen Kane  was also released. The  film noir  genre was at its height.”
Hmm.. er, what’s ‘film noir’?
“ Film noir  is a  cinematic  term used primarily to describe stylish  Hollywood   crime dramas , particularly those that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations.”
Right then!! Let’s move on… ^^;;;
Bambi  (1942) Bambi lovers, please don’t murder me when I saw I have not watched this properly… *Dodges thrown objects*…. I intend to!! Please!!
Bicycle Thieves  (1947) I watched this a while ago, it’s an Italian film. I remember being affected by the hardness of life for the unemployed.. features the stealing of a bicycle and it’s consequences… Sniff, sniff.
The Great Dictator  (1940) I haven’t seen this one (yet) but it’s a Charlie Chaplin, and Charlie Chaplin rocks!
It’s a Wonderful Life  (1946) Oh dear, how can I explain the love I have for this film??!! A must see for Christmas, everyone! How George Bailey decides not to commit suicide through his guardian angel. Intriguing, non?! J’adore ca!!
National Velvet  (1944) Haven’t seen it, it stars Mickey Rooney and a young Elizabeth Taylor.
Pinocchio  (1940) I’m serious here, what more can I say? WATCH IT. teehee
The Three Caballeros  (1944) I watched this Disney animation very young… all I remember now was that I was intrigued and enthralled by the impression of crazy nonsensical almost psychedelic coolness of it all. To be honest, I got no idea of what it was about when I was watching it.. Oh well, it has Donald Duck, right?! That should be enough. I really want to watch it again… but then I’d get a new impression of it.. but still.            Argh!!         Just had a session  of Wikipedia!!! The memories are all flooding back!! YAY.
One quote from Wikipedia: “A kiss, or several to be exact, lead to Donald going into the phrase “Love is a drug.” This scene is similar to “ Pink Elephants on Parade ,” for being a major “ drunk ” scene. Donald constantly envisions sugar rush colors, flowers, and Panchito and Jose popping in at the worst moments. The scene changes after Donald manages to dance with a woman from the  state of Oaxaca , from the  Isthmus of Tehuantepec . The two dance to the song “La Sandunga.” The woman begins by singing the song, with Donald “quacking” out the rest of the chorus. The “drunkenness” slows down for a moment, but speeds up again when a Mexican woman uses a conductor’s stick to make  cacti  do just about anything while dancing “ Jesusita en Chihuahua “, a trademark song of the Mexican Revolution. This is a notable scene for live action and cartoon animation mixing, as well as animation among the cacti.”
Is that psychedelic or not???!!!
Hmm, 7 films from the 1940’s. An improvement no doubt… but not good enough!!
Now for the 1950’s!!!!!!!
WOW, the film list just suddenly got bigger!!
Some Wikipedia for you:
“The decade of the  1950s in film  involved many significant films.”
HA.
Understatement.
Alice in Wonderland  (1951) I haven’t seen it, but would like to. Many stereotypical images of the characters are based on the way they look in this Disney animation. And besides, you hates Alice in Wonderland?
Ben-Hur  (1959) OKAY. WHERE DO I BEGIN. Actually, I’m not going to harm myself doing this. In fact, I’ll just have to write a review about it. Sorry folks. (In a nutshell, WATCH IT.)
Cinderella  (1950) Wow~ I love this Disney so much!! Watched it one Christmas with everyone.. so well made, and so pretty…
Funny Face  (1957) To my greatest regret I haven’t watched this, but it’s on my list!! Audrey Hepburn + Fred Astaire loving you!! Iconic imagery (just you know the whole ‘eye candy’ thing). I MUST HAVE..
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes  (1953) Well you don’t say…. Apart from being a little disgruntled by the title, since I’ve never seen a Marilyn Monroe before, maybe it’s the time to start.
Gigi  (1958) Well, seeing as it won 9 Oscars, it must have something appealing in it!!
The King and I  (1956) I wanna see it so bad!!! It’s just a little annoying the world and I practically already knows what will happen in it… Who cares!! Yul Brynner + Deborah Kerr, come to me!!!
Lady and the Tramp  (1955) Aw!! I had no idea it was made in the 50’s (silly me..). I don’t remember much of it, though I do remember that iconic and super sweet scene of Lady and Tramp sharing a bowl of spaghetti and accidentally kissing… My dream date of course!!
Peter Pan  (1953)
Whoever has not watched and loved Peter Pan must be fed to the ticking crocodile!!!!
Ahem. No, seriously. Watch it. It’s fantastic.
Rear Window  (1954) My sister watched this Alfred Hitchcock starring James Stewart and GRACE KELLY. Adore the woman. I want to watch it too!! Ps. the clothes are to die for?!
Roman Holiday  (1953) SUCH.A.GOOD.FILM. You have to watch it to understand why. So funny. So nicely and perfectly filmed. Love. Audrey Hepburn. Love. Gregory Peck. Love. Rome. Love. This film.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers  (1954) Oh Lord. MY CHILDHOOD!!!!!  love it love it love it!! The dancing! The music!! The songs!!! the Seven Brothers!!!!!!! Definitely a favourite of mine…
:)
The Seven Year Itch  (1955) I wanna see it. If only for the famous Marilyn Monroe flying white skirt subway thing.
Singin’ in the Rain  (1952) I wanna see it. If only for that song!!
Sleeping Beauty  (1959) Another great Disney! For once there’s a prince who actually does something useful! Properly a little scary though most people pretend not to be scared..
Some Like It Hot  (1959) Er, cos it’s a Marilyn Monroe and because it’s so famous?! Okay!
South Pacific  (1958) I need to see this!!! If only because of the music and crazy songs!!
The Ten Commandments  (1956) Charlton Heston. Yul Brynner. Charlton Heston. Anne Baxter. Charlton Heston. Charlton Heston with a beard. NEED I SAY MORE??????? Love it. Like. Crazy.
Vertigo  (1958) An Alfred Hitchcock. Watched the beginning, now want to watch the end. Unfortunately I already know what happens.. because I read the article on it from Wikipedia. Dang it!!
War and Peace  (1956) I want to watch it!! Audrey Hepburn!!! And because of the famous novel
:)
P.S. I found a film called ‘The Blob’ and another called ‘Boobs in the Woods’!!!!! HAHAHA
Well, the 1950’s went better didn’t it? 20 films!
Right, that left me exhausted…. sensory overload?
Let’s save the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s for another day.. Oh my..
Watch lots of good films in the holidays everyone!

And you are…?
A little girl in the great intellectual city of Oxford embarking on a literary odyssey from books as diverse as 'The Little Prince' to 'The Pickwick Papers' to the 'Iliad', and telling you all about it. The Book-Devourer lives!
When she is not reading, this insatiable one is also going Art, Fashion, Film and Music mad. Call her the Renaissance-Muse. 90's babe of the 21st century. She also occasionally eats, drinks and sleeps too (and she's one for milk coffee and good Lindt chocolate of course).
Occasionally dabbles in writing, liking short stories some of which she has shared with you. Is now writing an extraordinary love story...
The Me: What I Am
I like shopping, painting, make-up, designing, cool phones ^^, taking pictures, music (mostly K-pop and classical), going to the movies, white coffee :3, nail polish and daydreaming...
