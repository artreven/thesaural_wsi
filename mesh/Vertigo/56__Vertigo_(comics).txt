Jesse : One look at their faces, and I could tell the Good Lord was using my prayers to wipe his ass.
The Time of the Preacher
Tulip : The way I hear it, there's two good places to look for God: in church, or at the bottom of a bottle.
Jesse : Maybe I'll go find a liquor store, then … 'cause lemme tell you, it sure as hell ain't church.
The Time of the Preacher
Jesse : He wasn't so bad, for a beer-waterin' motherfucker.
The Time of the Preacher
About Leonard, the bartender
Jesse : You used to hate guns, Tulip.
Cassidy : I know someone who doesn't.
Jesse : Mm? Oh yeah.
Tulip : Christ, do we have to talk about him?
Cassidy : Well, he's a pretty big part of it, isn't he?
Jesse : It's his
voice
that gets me … that crawling grinding whisper … spitting hell and ghosts and cobwebs in your ear …
The Time of the Preacher
About the Saint of Killers
Jesse :
RAGE AND BLOW, YE CATARACTS AND HURRICANOES!
"King Lear." Always wanted to say it.
First Contact
Billy Baker aka Spaceman : So tell me somethin'. How come you shitheads never write?
The Land of Bad Things
Visiting the Vietnam war memorial
Jesse : I don't know if I told you, but I never really wanted to be a preacher …
Tulip : No? What did you want to be, then?
Jesse : Hell, girl. Can't you guess?
A Hell of a Vision
As the two ride off into the sunset
Jesse : I don't get what I want, me an' these goofs're gonna get to watch a fat boy try to eat his own tits off – an' if that ain't an evening's entertainment, I don't know what is.
Iron in the blood
To Allfather D'Aronique in Masada
Herr Starr : Oh, well let me see: We had an angel, a whore, an eunuch, several dozen idiots, an unkillable mick, a one-man holocaust in a duster coat, the occasional twenty-course banquet for the mother of all fat fuckers, inbreeding, family feuds, bulimia, a retarded child (always good for a laugh), and the utter destruction of our most sacred shrine and secret retreat in the detonation of a fifty-ton bomb.
Gunchicks
To Featherstone
Devil : What was that you were saying about the coming century?
Angel of Death : Well, if you think this one was bad – and it's not over yet – wait 'til you see what's coming next. The little mortal bastards come up with all manners of nastiness to use on each other.
Devil : I was at Bull Run, and the Crimea, and I've seen what the British are doing with all those herds of niggers. You're not talking to some kind of beginner here …
Angel of Death : Child's play. What about sixy thousand men mown down in an afternoon? Or a weapon that can vaporize a city? Or a
factory
set up just to kill? What about two wars that each drag in the whole wide world?
Devil :
Bollocks!
Angel of Death : I'm serious. I've seen the plans.
Preacher Special: The Saint of Killers, no. 3
The Saint of Killers : Not enough gun.
