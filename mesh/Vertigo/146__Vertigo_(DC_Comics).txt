The 25 Most Influential People in Comic Book Movies: #8 Benjamin Melniker
May 28, 2008 — sophosmoros
Former Executive Vice President at MGM and current film industry legend,
Benjamin Melniker
is the co-founder (with
#5 Michael E. Uslan ) of
Batfilm Productions, Inc . On October 3, 1979, Melniker and Uslan acquired all feature motion picture and allied rights on
Batman
from DC Comics. Since that time, this dynamic duo has executive produced  every modern Batman film , including
Batman   (heavily influenced by the work of
#7 Frank Miller ),
Batman Returns ,
Batman Forever ,
Batman & Robin ,
Batman Begins  (helmed by
#18 Christopher Nolan , co-created by
#5 David S. Goyer  and instigated in part by an early script by Frank Miller) and the immeasurably anticipated
The Dark Knight   (also directed by Nolan and co-written with Goyer), opening on July 18, 2008. Melniker and Uslan have produced or executive produced many Batman animated projects, television shows, and spinoffs, including the 1992 “ Batman ” animated TV series (with development assistance from
#13 Mike Mignola ),
Batman: Mask of the Phantasm ,
Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman ,
Batman: Gotham Knight  (written in part by David Goyer, to be released direct to DVD July 8, 2008),  Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker ,  SubZero , and
Catwoman . Other projects include their work together as producers of DC/ Vertigo ‘s
Constantine  (along with
#16 Lauren Shuler Donner  and executive producer
#15 Gilbert Adler ) which has led the two to sign on as producers of the hopefully coming sequel
Constantine 2   (also with Adler and Shuler Donner), and
The Spirit , which Melniker and Uslan will executive produce and which Frank Miller will direct, starring
Gabriel Macht
and
Samuel L. Jackson , due to be released on December 25, 2008.
Prior to Batfilm, Melniker and Uslan also notably produced
Swamp Thing
and
The Return of Swamp Thing , as well as the 1990 “ Swamp Thing ” television series, all based on DC’s
eponymous character .
