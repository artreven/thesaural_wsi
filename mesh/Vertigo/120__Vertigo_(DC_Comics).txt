Comicgate Interview about Erotic Comics
Last
March I was interviewed by the very charming Daniel Wüllner for Germany’s
Comicgate Magazin
(an excellent publication). The
interview appeared in issue 6 (you can read a very nice review of the German edition of Erotic Comics they did
online here ). But they very kindly
gave me permission to reprint the English version of the interview, so here it
is!
Comicgate:
Tim, we contacted you today,
because Comicgate is doing a special feature issue exclusively on sex. That's
why we wanted to talk to a specialist in the field. Could you tell our readers a
little bit about yourself? When did you start out reading comics?
Tim
Pilcher:  I've always read comics ever since I was a kid, like most people in Britain. I
grew up
Beano ,
Dandy ,
Krazy ,
Whizzer & Chips , and similar titles. In Britain you
could buy comics for toddlers and as they grew older there was another comic to
buy, which would be aimed at the slightly older group. You would move on
naturally to magazines like
Battle ,
Starlord , and
2000 AD , which is still going today.
In the Eighties, I discovered magazines like
Warrior
magazine – which included the
original
V for Vendetta
– and
Epic Illustrated , a marvel magazine edited by Archie
Goodwin. Afterwards, I discovered
Heavy Metal
magazine. I've always read comics and
I've always loved them and in a professional sense—I always wanted to work in
comics.
CG:
That sounds like an organic
progress?
TP:
Exactly, a very nicely tiered
structure. Sadly this is all gone now, because the British comic industry
collapsed. Today, there is a big gap between kid's stuff and adult stuff.
Nowadays, most people in Britain read up to a certain level of
2000 AD
and than jump over to
American comics.
CG:
When did you actually decide
to earn money with comics?
TP:
Probably, when I was from
about 16 or 17. I started to realize that there are people making this stuff. I
never thought I was good enough to be an artist, but maybe I could have a crack
at writing or editing.
CG:
You stuck to editing. Did you
ever write a comic book?
TP:
I never did a full-length
comic book, but I have written a few strips for The Young Telegraph, which were
biographical strips about famous people throughout history. I also put together
a package for DeAgostini UK, which was a whole load of Marvel superhero strips.
So, although I have officially written some
Iron Man
and
Spider-Man
stories,
those projects never took off! So I have written comics, but I am
primarily an editor.
CG:
How did you become an editor?
TP:
When I started working, it
was very clear from the beginning: It’s not what you know, but who you know. I
thought about how to get to know everybody. With some luck I got a job at Comic
Showcase back in 1988. My basic work included sitting in the back and bagging
comics. Very boring, but I meet a lot of professionals there. Regulars in the
shop were people like Kevin O'Neil, Dave Gibbons, Brendan McCarthy, and Neil
Gaiman.
CG:
That is quite
an impressive line-up. Is it a famous store?
TP:
It was pretty
well known, although it is no longer in existence, sadly. It shut down a few
years ago. It was well regarded, like
Gosh Comics , they were kissing cousins.
We used to hang out together a lot. But Showcase had more space and so we could
sell original art that was on display. Naturally the artists dropped by more
often. And we were certainly NOT Forbidden Planet, we had friendly staff!
CG:
How did you
change from comic clerk to comic editor?
TP:
A friend of
mine, Paul Johnson, who was a comic artist at the time, introduced me to Art
Young. At the time, Young had left DC Comics in order to build his own line at
Disney’s Touchmark comics. He was halfway through—looking for British
creators—when the whole project fell down. Right then, DC was setting up
Vertigo. So they said, bring all your projects to Vertigo and we will give you
your job back. He asked for a London office, because a lot of the creators like
Peter Milligan and Grant Morrison were from the UK. It just made more sense. He
was looking for an assistant, but he didn’t want the person he was looking to
be trained up by Marvel UK, DC, or a similar British company. He wanted
somebody with no experience, so he could train him the way he wanted. He did a
few interviews and I was just lucky enough to get the job. I was always a DC
fan. It was fantastic. It got a lot of experience there. I learned all of my
editorial skills in that time.
CG:
How long did you work there?
TP:
Unfortunately,
it lasted only 18 months, but it was a very intense. When you work with people
like Grant Morrison and Frank Quietly on a regular basis, you learn a lot. Then
the office shut down due to economic hardship. It was kind of an experiment
that did not work out. The next five years I moved on to book publishing and
did a whole range of different things: From Penguin Children’s Books to Dorling
Kindersely.
CG:
... and then you decided to
become an author?
TP:
Writing was
something I always wanted to do, but when you work with people like Grant
Morrison or Garth Ennis—one of my best friends—it is quite intimidating to do
fiction. ‘Cause you know your peers are the top of their game. And you ask
yourself, “How can I compete with them?” So I steered clear of that and went
into non-fiction. I was writing
about
comics rather than actually writing
comics per se. Just because I felt more comfortable doing that. My first book
was called
The Complete Cartooning Course
(co-written with Brad Brooks) and was
published in 2001. We explained the basic rules of cartooning like expressive
figure-work, setting up mid-grounds and backgrounds, and showed how pacing
works. We also included a lot of digital material, reproducing on the web,
before it became as prelevant as it is now. It did very well in Germany,
actually.
CG:
Tim, while
almost every teenager has his hidden stack of
Playboy s somewhere under his bed, did
you have many erotic comics on your desk? How did you decide on erotic comics
as a research project?
TP:
It was always
in the background, but not in a conscious kind of way. Comics like
Heavy Metal
or
Epic Illustrated
had an adult sensibility with
their bare-breasted women. In my time at Comic Showcase we had Richard Corben's
Den
coming
in. It was like " Conan
on Viagra". That’s slightly disingenuous, but
hopefully you know what I mean. I was aware that erotic comics were always
around. Then I came across Maurice Horn's book
Sex in the Comics . Suddenly, I realized that
nobody else examined erotica as a comic book genre, since Horn. His book was
published in 1988, when the big erotic comic explosion was just about to
happen. Fantagraphics started their Eros line (1990) and Jim Lee did his first
X-Men
(1991). Horn's book was also
quite coy.
CG:
You finally found your own
niche as an author?
TP:
I just
thought that it was a subject that was interesting enough and I was curious as
why people hadn't examined it. The starting point was the historic research and
I found a huge amount of "normal" comic artists, who have all been
touched by erotic comics. Jack Kirby, for example, did these barely erotic two-page-things,
but in the end he was obviously not comfortable with it. It was a more obvious
fit for people like Howard Chaykin and Gilbert Hernandez. Although you would
never think that Hernandez with his pro-feminist stuff, would do a hardcore
erotic comic like
Birdland .
CG:
In your first chapter of
Erotic
Comics
Vol.1 ,
entitled "foreplay", you use a different approach and show tijuana
bibles, pin-ups and Shunga-woodprints. On your blog I found pictures of Indian
statues with explicit erotic content. Are these examples similar to the
sequential art of a comic? Or let me phrase it differently, are erotic comics
comparable to any other erotic art form?
TP:
I think they are, purely on
the basis of the content, they are all forms of erotica. Just a slightly
different delivery format. A Shunga-woodprint and a erotic statue or carving
have a connection as both deal with, or express, human sexuality. Yes, comics
are an art form. Yes, they are dealing with erotica. The very reason I put in
these other art forms is because I wanted people to realize that nothing exists
in a vacuum. It shows a natural progression of this genre. The Tijuana Bibles
did not materialize out of nothing in the 1930s. You can't look at erotic
comics in isolation.
CG:
The sequential form in itself
is important to the portrayal of erotica. The sequence of images gives you the
option to show everything there is, or to hide the act in the gutter. In a
comic you don't have to actually show someone caught in the act.
TP:
Your remark touches upon the
difference between the two volumes. In the first volume the material was much
more implicit. But as time went on a vast cultural changes had begun that
didn't restrict themselves to just comics. The second volume portrays a
different time frame and shows a culture that developed towards more explicit
forms of expression. I am personally not a big fan of that. I would much rather
have a little bit more imagination left, or a little bit more subtlety. But
obviously I am in the minority!
CG : ... but you have chosen the
topic, so it is your duty to look at everything there is. Do you think that
society has developed an interest in the extreme, even in the display of
sexuality?
TP:
It depends on what sort of
time scale you put this on. If you go way back you can see that the social
morals have always evolved, altered and adapted – depending on the culture. You
can see quite explicit Indian carvings in full public view, yet you wouldn't
expect to see a similar hardcore sex act as a giant billboard today anywhere
(but I suspect that it’s only a matter of time). You can say that our ancestors
had a very liberated sense of sexuality back then. I think we go through
cycles. There were, are, and will be, periods throughout history when it is
okay to talk openly and frankly about sex. In other periods, such as the
Victorian Age, it is deeply repressed.
CG:
Let us talk about the thin
red line you are drawing between pornography and erotica in both volumes . Is
there any difference between the two terms?
TP:
I actually think there is no
real difference. Alan Moore makes that quite clear in the foreword of the
second volume. He only uses the term pornography, because it creates an
immediate reaction. The two words are certainly both loaded, but with different
meanings: If you say the word pornography, it has an implication that something
is dirty, wrong, seedy, not very nice, dangerous, and possibly even illegal. If
you put the word erotica on it has the inverse meaning: slightly romantic,
sexy, also dangerous, but in a good way, and with a little bit more class.
CG:
Isn't gender also an issue in
this debate? When you think of pornography, you have a male readership in mind,
whereas erotica denotes the female in a more positive way, especially in the
act of gazing or participating?
TP:
I think you are absolutely
right, that's a very good analogy: a split between the two terms, and
respectively the two genders. There is a difference in act of viewing these
images. When you use the word erotica it describes the upper class look at the
subject and it would be more implicit, that's why women tend to favor erotica.
Whereas, the lower the class, and the more “masculine” the reader is, the more
explicit the material subsequently is. The reason for that comes from a two-fold
thing—but these are just my generalizations: Women are mostly motivated by
suggestion, mind, and words. Men on the other hand are more aroused by visual
stimuli. The readership of erotic comics is primarily a male readership. There
are still women out there who read erotic comics and I know there are women who
create erotic comics, but the female artists are seldom that explicit in their
portrayal of erotica or they place a stronger emphasis on character and story
rather than focusing primarily on the sex act itself. It is the same with the
porn-film-industry. Women make erotic films for other women. Those films are
completely different from the sort of standard material that is created by male
producers in L.A. There are two different aesthetic approaches and you could
easily split those in "erotica" and "pornography". But
ultimately they are the same thing: They are stories and images designed to
create arousal within the reader.
CG:
In your books you address gay
and lesbian comics, too. Heterosexual female writers seem to be in the
minority. How would you explain that?
TP:
The movement is growing. The
excellent Jess Fink’s erotic graphic novel,
Chester 5000 , has just been published by
Top Shelf and there is a post-feminist erotic comics movement happening right
now in Sweden. I came across some titles, when I visited Stockholm last year,
which were really interesting. They were doing erotic comics with a strong
female slant: The female characters are pretty much in control of the
situations and they are using the men for their own gratification, throwing
them aside afterwards. It’s a very deliberate inversion of porn tropes. These
comics are very clever and very good. There is for example a good graphic novel
called
Drift
by Liv Strömquist and Jan Bileckli. It has sexual scenes in it, but is
primarily character-driven.
CG:
Sounds quite similar to
Alison Bechdel's
Fun Home ?
TP:
Yeah, exactly. When you look
in
Dykes to Watch Out For
you find sex scenes and sexual descriptions. But
ultimately, it’s about characters and shows the connection between two human
beings, rather than just people having sex. Women are much more interested in
an emotional attachment, and rightly so.
CG:
In the second volume, the
word censorship is printed in capital letters. Obviously, a quite important
issue to you, and to Alan Moore. Do you think there are still comics that
definitely cross the line of good taste?
TP:
I think there definitely are
such comics. I would not necessary want to read them.
CG:
Are some of them included in
your books?
TP:
No, if they were that bad, my
editors wouldn't have allowed me to put them in. I have read some Japanese
stuff, which has made me feel very uncomfortable—rape-fantasies and the like. I
know perfectly well that there are some people out there with such fantasies
and it is all perfectly fine in a controlled adult environment. I am not
criticizing people reading these comics, but when it is put into a certain
context, it might be damaging if that is the only information the reader gets.
I would certainly not be happy to put these in my books. I think Voltaire
apocryphally once said: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the
death your right to say it.” That is very much my attitude towards censorship.
I don't want to look at it and I don't want to read it, but I won't prevent
somebody from drawing it. There is definitely an argument for keeping certain
material from getting into certain people's hands. Kids and others who would be
disturbed by those images should not be able to get that stuff. But if you are
an adult in a sound state of mind, then you are just looking at “lines on
paper” (as Robert Crumb constantly reminds us) it should be your choice to do
so, and not the state's decision. We have some quarrels in the UK quite recently
about the Coroners and Justice Act in 2009. They passed an insane law, which we
are trying to get appealed, but that’s looking increasingly unlikely. It
basically states: It is prohibited to depict a comic character that looks under
18 – the emphasis is on the physical appearance – in a scene where two adults
are having sex. A good example for that would be the flashback-sequence from
Watchmen , when Rorschach stumbles
across his mum having sex. So, technically, it is illegal to own a copy of
Watchmen
in Britain
today.
CG:
How would the prosecution
look like?
TP:
We haven't had our test case
yet. There’s a strong likelihood that such a case could come along in the near
future. The Comic Book Alliance is already collecting money for such cases. We
are basically the British version of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund. The
sentence could be anything from a fine to at least three months in prison, or
more. It would really depend on the Judge's opinion. We are quite set up on the
legal side, but I hope we can avoid such cases.
CG:
In your second book there are
articles on Japanese censorship, on the German debate about Ralf König's
comics, and on the British censorship regarding the homophobic Clause 28. Are
erotic comics books a good parameter in order to compare different cultures
with each other?
TP:
Yes, I think
they are. It certainly gives you a good idea of country's morale and social
standpoints. If you look at the Latin-based language countries like France,
Spain, and Italy, they are much more relaxed and open about this sort of
material than puritanical UK and USA. The latter is still trying to suppress it
or ignore it. If you look in the book for the material from Spain, you will see
that there’s a huge amount of erotic comics appeared shortly after Franco died
in the ’70s. They were incredibly explicit. You won't get that stuff in
American, even nowadays.
CG:
In an interview I talked to
Max and he mentioned that he was so fed up with the Franco regime and his
catholic upbringing. He used comics as a way to express his anger.
TP:
That’s exactly what I was
trying to say! When such cultural repressions cease to exist, people are
finally free to express themselves, in a way quite similar to the 1960s
underground comix in the US. There was that sudden sense of liberation. The
technical abilities of the artists were not that great, almost like the Tijuana
Bibles. The simple concept of a penis and a vagina coming together was almost
enough. Nobody was interested in the aesthetics or how well it was drawn. But
erotic comic draftsmanship has certainly improved drastically over the last 25
or 30 years. The quality of the storytelling and artwork is generally far
higher nowadays.
CG:
I would like to come back to
something you said earlier about prudish comic book nations. Could you give us
an example?
TP:
In India, there are
interesting online web-comics, which they call "Kirtu", which is
Indian for erotic comics. Present day India—moralistically and socially—is very
much like Victorian England. They’ve kept the strict English principles, which
we have thrown out of the window and mixed that with a strong Hindu/Muslim
moralistic ethos. To actually produce erotic comics in print form would be
unthinkable in India. More than anything, pornography is technically illegal,
although it is widely available: A lot of softcore, but very little hardcore.
There is a healthy comics industry, but it’s primary target audience is a young
readership, but country is on the tip of a cultural comics revolution, where
they are starting to produce publications for an older readership.. There’s an
online webcomic called
Savita Bhabhi , about an archetypal frustrated
housewife, who has these worldly sexcapades with various men. Because she is
unhappily married, this is incredibly scandalous. That is a very revolutionary
concept for a prudish country like India. A country where no woman would wear a
bikini on the beach. Men and women swim fully clothed. It is quite bizarre,
when you see it. And they stare at Westerners stripped down to their bikinis
and swim-shorts. So
Savita Bhabhi
has caused huge scandal, and along with
that, obviously, a huge readership. They got around sixteen million visitors a
month. In 2009, the website was shut down by the Indian government, but they
reopened another, shortly afterwards. It was originally started by a British
Indian businessman—so it was actually produced in the UK, but aimed at the
Indian market. That guy knew exactly what he was doing. Culturally, he wouldn’t
have been able to do that if he was an Indian businessman in India. The shame
would be too great.
CG:
Let us jump over the ocean to
another quite prudish comic country, America. In an interview, Milo Manara
explained how he coped with the American prudishness and how he was still able
to draw the X-Women in his own fashion. He just sketched the women naked and
painted on the costumes afterwards, skintight. Is America a country that is
hiding its sexuality out in the open with their spandex-costumed superheroes?
TP:
Absolutely, when you start to
look at it, every single aspect of superheroes is about sex. The idea to
pretend it isn't, is just ridiculous. The whole concept of superheroes is
adolescent power fantasies. What do adolescents think about 95% of the time if
is not football or comics? It's sex. When you see how female superheroes are
portrayed in American comics it is in this super-porn manner: Huge tits, bums,
and long legs. They are all bending over, showing their cleavage. These are
quite provocative sexual positions. And it is done primarily for a young male
readership. I think it’s got worse in the last ten to twenty years. From the
1990s onwards, when Jim Lee's early
X-Men
came out. That was when the real
cheesecake was taking off. As Manara says, they were all just painting on
costumes. In fact, at this year’s Rio carnival there were a whole lot of women
who were "dressed" as superheroes. There was a Wonder Woman in
costume, but it was all just body paint! Look at characters like DC's
Powergirl. She is fetishised because of the fact that she has enormous tits and
that’s almost treated as her character trait! It’s the only thing anyone ever
talks about!
The
male superhero on the other hand has become this male idealised god. But they
are not drawn as being sexualized. Imagine, if they were drawn by Tom of
Finland: They would all be bending over all the time, showing their cute bubble
butts, and huge bulges in the front of their costumes! But you never get that
in superhero comics. When you look at all the things that William Moulton
Marston had Wonder Woman do. It is just pure S&M bondage. People were just
very naive and innocent back then and didn't get what he was doing. When you
look back with a bit of hindsight now it is all about sexual control and tying
people up. For example, we have Wonder Woman tying up a villainess saying
"On Paradise Island, where we play many binding games, this is considered
the safest method of tying a girl's arms." That’s something you’d expect
to see in a fetish club! It’s an instructional guide to bondage in a superhero
comic.
But
sex and superheroes have always been intertwined . There’s
Marshall Law
by Pat Mills and Kevin O'Neill
and
The Boys
Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. Particularly
The Boys ’
Herogasm
spin-off miniseries, where
you have all these superheroes going off and having sex and mass orgies on a
tropical island. It’s just the sort of thing you would suspect somebody with
that much power would do. They can, and they do. Superheroes nowadays are less
likely to play gods and are more likely to become part of the Babylonian
Hollywood system, acting like self-indulgent celebrities of the
Charlie-Sheen-cocaine-sniffing ilk. That's how superheroes are being portrayed
these days. I would definitely say that Americans hide their sex out in the open.
It seems to be okay, if you do a lot of cheesecake and soft porn as long as
they are not having sex. But even that is changing now as well. In the
Dark
Knight Returns 2
Frank Miller had Superman and Wonder Woman actually rock the
earth with their sexual antics, with the diabolically corny line, “Why Mr.
Kent, you could populate a planet.” So even DC Comics have moved into the
superhero sex area.
CG:
I had a final question
wrapping it up. You have been looking at a lot of erotic comics for your research.
But what would you say is your favorite erotic comic?
TP:
Probably my favorite artist
is Giovanna Cassotto. Because a) she is a woman, so she has a much more
intelligent approach to things b) she has a great sense of humor and c) she
draws incredibly sexy women. That seems to cover all the bases. Because it’s no
good just having a sexy picture of a woman unless there is a good storyline to
it. I mean sex is quite a ridiculous thing in a lot of ways. It’s very
important to retain a sense of humor about it all! And of course, Manara—I have
been a fan of his work for years—along with Jess Fink (another female creator)
and Franco Saudelli. Rather than one particular publication, I’d say these four
artists cover what interests me the most in erotic comics.
CG:
Thank you very much for your
time, Tim.
TP:
Thanks.
As a quick footnote. Since the ARTE documentary aired I noticed that Volume One of Erotic Comics shot to #721 in the Amazon.de charts (It has since dropped to #969) so thank you to Les Bon Clients for the sales boost, and all my German readers for picking up the book! Now go buy
Volume 2
(which is languishing at #1,518)!

Angouleme, Mon Amour (UPDATED)
Today the
Angouleme comics festival
starts. It's one of my favourite festivals of the year and I don't get to go to it nearly enough (invite me as a guest, damn you!). Typically, I'm not there now, but a lot of friends are. Sigh.
To add insult to injury, the documentary that I was
interviewed for last summer in Paris , Sex in the Comix, has a special preview tomorrow night (Friday 27 January)  at 20:00  at the festival, and airs on  on ARTE on Saturday 28 January at 22:30 in France, and at 22:00 in Germany. There's some
previews
to watch
here .
SEX IN THE COMIX - documentary
from
Les Bons Clients
on
Vimeo .
Here's what the press release has to say (badly paraphrased from the French!):
"Comics   and sex ?  There's so m uch more to the  history   of eroticism !  A   new wind is blowing   in this universe,   and  journey could   be full of surprises ...  Leafing through   the beautiful pages   of an erotic  comic ,   Molly   Crabapple , a young
New York artist,   takes us  on a  discovery  of the greatest erotic comic artists :
Milo   Manara ,  Robert   Crumb ,   Zep ,   Maruo , and also investigates  rising young talents,  such as  Aude   Picault  and  Bastien   Vives  [Whose graphic novel,
A Taste of Chlorine
came out from Jonathan Cape last year].  We discover   that sex  makes excellent bedfellows with  humour;  that erotic comics have been driven by  social protest with   artists  exploring   intimacy   and   flirting with  censorship. This examination  reveals  this art   in a new light   and  explodes some myths ,  such  as the role  played by the   women, which is more
central  than  one  might imagine."
Above: Some of Bastien Vives erotic work focuses on the manga fetish Bakunyu or "Bursting breasts."
Above:  Aude   Picault's sweet and saucy sketches are a delight!
So, if any
Erotic Comics
fans out there manage to catch this do let me know what you thought of it, as I haven't seen it myself, and I can't get ARTE in the UK!
Hopefully the lovely production team, Les Bon Clients, or director,  Joëlle  Oosterlinck, will send me a DVD. In the meantime below is the original French press release and a picture of the gorgeous Molly Crabapple (founder of
Dr. Sketchy's ) who acts as a guide for the show.
Above: The delightful Ms. Crabapple
UPDATE: I just discovered the poster advertising last night's screening on Molly's
blog
featuring me with some seriously big names! Very honoured by such company and not to end up on the cutting room floor!

Exclusive Interview with Rick Veitch about War Comics
At Bristol Comic
Expo last year I managed to briefly interview one of my comic book heroes,
Rick Veitch . Veitch has been at the forefront of experimental comics for over 25
years, consistently pushing the boundaries of the medium, in terms of subject
matter, art and design. I first discovered his work in the pages of
Epic Illustrated
with his
psychedelic retelling of
Moby Dick ,
Abraxas and the Earthman . Then I devoured his “trilogy” of
deconstructions of the superhero genre;
The One
(which predated
Watchmen
by a year);
Brat Pack   (an examination of sidekick culture); and
Maximortal
(a vicious
Superman satire). And yet these are often unjustly forgotten and left of the
lists of important graphic novels and I urge everyone interested in the comics
medium to seek them out and buy them.
Another
criminally overlooked book of Veitch’s is the 2007-2008 series,
Army@Love
and the 2008-2009 sequel,
Army@Love: The Art of War , both inked by my good friend Gary Erskine, and
published by
Vertigo .
Above:
Cover to
Army@Love
#1 by Veitch and Erskine
The story told the misadventures of a unit of
New Jersey
National Guard
in "Afbaghistan," a fictional Middle Eastern country based on Iraq/ Afghanistan . It was a
savage satire on the futility of war and how it could become comodified in the
future and sold as a desirable, sexy career move to a US public. The title is
obviously a spin on DC Comics’
Our Army at War —which
became
Sgt. Rock
in 1977—and this war comic was a strong influence on Veitch who explained to
me, “ To some extent, me and war comics go back to my
beginnings…”
At the time of
this interview (15 May 2011) US troops were still in Iraq. Since then, the last
of the armed forces have left the country, although there are still US forces
active in Afghanistan and Pakistan at time of writing. I originally was looking
to use the interview as part of a paper I presented at the
Imperial War Museum
about comic creators and personal experiences of war, but sadly it was never
used. So, never wanting to waste anything, here it is…
Army@Love
was a return to war comics for Veitch,
who grew up reading and loving them, “[ Sgt. Rock
artist, Joe] Kubert’s work was incredibly important
to me. I sort of understood it was on simplistic level, but his illustrations
were so gritty and what he was able to do with a pen and brush was so
interesting to me. I studied it and I worked from it, even before I went to his
school. And Russ Heath’s work, he just knocked me out, what that guy could do.
The tightness of it all, and the savage beauty he could make from a tank.
Really, really great stuff.”

But Veitch was
equally enamoured with the writing as well as the art, “[Robert] Kanigher was
the writer of it all, of course. I got to meet him when I was at Kubert School
[Kanigher taught for a year there in 1977]. He’s a really interesting hidden
cultural figure, because a lot of his panels were picked up by Roy Lichtenstein
and became these well-known images, but they came right out of Kanigher. So he
was like this underground poet whose thoughts and images ended up out in the
world. When I met him in person, I was struck by how much he was like [his DC
character] Hans Von Hammer,
Enemy Ace . His character was like that, and the whole schtick
of Von Hammer—he doesn’t have any friends and he’s a lone wolf…he’s out there…
he’s a killing machine—that’s a metaphor for Kanigher.” Coincidentally this year is the 10th anniversary of Kanigher's death.

“Because I
studied with
Joe Kubert at his school
[Veitch was in the first class to
graduate, alongside
Stephen R. Bissette
and
TomYeates
in 1978]
some of my first professional jobs were drawing
back-up stories for
Sgt. Rock
comics. There’s a
certain way that a Kubert/DC war comic is structured and I assimilated that
organically at a very young age.”
Many comics
historians have discussed the anti-war sub-texts in Kanigher and Kubert’s work,
but Veitch remains sceptical, “I don’t know how anti-war he was. They did
plenty of flag-waving, let’s-throw-ourselves-on-the-grenade-and-save-everybody
type stories. I knew people in Vietnam who used the slang ‘Sgt. Rock’ for an
idiot. The kind of person who’d do something stupid, like run in front of a
machine gun because they’d read too many
Sgt. Rock
comics. They just didn’t know any better.
It just seemed like ‘Well, this is what we do.’ And they’d run into the fire,
because it worked for Sgt Rock.” The thought that Kanigher and Kubert may have
been indirectly responsible for young, naïve men dying in a South East Asian
jungle is a sobering one, to say the least.
Rick’s older
brother, Tom Veitch, wrote many left-leaning, anti-Vietnam War underground
comix—most notably
Legion of Charlies , drawn by Greg Irons— in the late
Sixties/early Seventies and was a strong influence on his younger sibling. “I
was inspired by him. Interestingly enough he’s become extremely right wing in
his old age. So he and I are always in conflict [laughs]. We never stop
bickering!”

Legion of Charlies

Regardless, of
the misinterpreted jingoism in
Our Army at War , Kanigher and Kubert’s work had an important
grounding on Veitch’s own, later work, “By the time I reached
Army@Love
I was much more advanced, and my thinking
was progressively leftist. I was outraged at how the American government had
pushed the war [the 2003-2011 Iraq War] and created it out of false
information. It was around 2005/2006 and the war was going really badly, there
were lots of bombings, civilians being killed right and left, and I was
outraged by it. So I wanted to speak to it through my art form, which is
comics, and through satire. I think I was trying to do a
Catch-22 ,
but about a war that was going on, rather
than doing it 10 years later, which is what most people do. So it might have
been a little too early for people to digest, because the experience was just
too horrible, and the political confrontation in the Untied States was still
ongoing. There were these ‘cultural wars’ going on about what the ‘truth’ was… If
you didn’t believe the right-wing politicians you were considered a traitor!
Really strange times. So I felt I had to stand up and speak with my voice.”
Certainly, this
climate of ‘My country, right or wrong’ succeeded in drowning out many liberal,
more temperate, voices at the time, and almost certainly affected
Army@Love ’s sales. No one wanted to look at the
current situation and ask the awkward question, ‘Is this war justified?’ when
it was so evidently not.
How Veitch
started exploring the modern military and the war in Iraq was typically
unconventional. “I started researching the weapons themselves and the research
that was being done into weapons of the future—because
Army@Love
was actually set five years in the
future, that’s the schtick. So I thought it would be interesting to imagine how
those weapons would change combat and the culture of people who were in it. It
also looked, at the time, as if no one would ever join the army again, because
it was such a mess in 2005, so I was imagining what kind of marketing the
military would have to do, to bring young people into it. So
Army@Love
is as much about public relations and
marketing as it is about combat.”
Above: Army@Love #9 cover. Name that homage!
As the series
progressed troops serving in Iraq started contacting Veitch, “I got letters from
people who were serving there. They would say I somehow caught exactly what
they were feeling. I don’t know how I did that, because I hadn’t spoken to any
of them, it was all imaginary, it came out of me! At one point I was contacted
by the guys who publish the U.S. military’s newspaper, Army Times, who said,
‘This is exactly what’s going on over there. You really caught it! I don’t know
how you did it!’
They did a whole write-up of me . They sent it to Joe Kubert
and I don’t think he liked it. He’s a staunch believer in the Government. When
we were all at school [another classmate was John Totleben], we were young and
didn’t believe what the government was telling us, whereas he [Kubert] was
staunchly establishment, so there was that conflict. Not that it destroyed our
friendship or anything, but there was always a friendly conflict of ideas and
I’m sure he wondered what he let loose by sending us out to do war comics!”
[Laughs]

I queried whether
Veitch had enough information to be able to write accurately about a war that
was happening thousands of miles away, and whether he’d considered visiting, as
Joe Sacco did . “I’m sure it would’ve been a much deeper piece of work if I’d be
out there, and at the same time I might have come back traumatised and unable
to work it up.
Army@Love
is a work of the imagination by a civilian looking in horror at what we were
seeing at the time. Literally, everyday there would be these bombings of
civilians—hundreds of people being killed. I still don’t understand what it was
all about. Who these guys were who were fighting for power and using the
civilian population as innocent victims? But I wish the people who started the
war, the Bush Administration, had thought about
that . Or if they
had
thought about it, and still let it
happen, then I consider
that
a war crime. I think the lower estimates of civilian deaths in Iraq are
100,000. Some of the higher estimates are half a million people.” [Note: The
Iraq Body Count and Iraq War Logs combined give a figure of 128,842, whereas
the British medical journal,
The Lancet
put the figure at 654,965 civilians dead.]
Yet, however
critical Veitch is of the architects of the Iraq War, he is more respectful of
those that actually had to fight it, “I wasn’t trying to criticise the soldiers
or the military itself, rather the situation that I found intolerable, and how
we got there.”
Above:
Army@Love: The Art of War  #3's cover parodies Manet's classic  Le déjeuner sur l'herbe    painting
The writer/artist
mused of the nature of conflict in general, and tying in with the theme of the second series,
Army@Love: The Art of War , “War is the ultimate surrealism in
a modern civilisation, because it takes all these things we’ve built—these
products and these architectural structures—and it blows them to shit. And so,
to walk into a city square that’s just been bombed and all the products thrown
and ripped all over it, it’s surreal. It
is
surreal.”
“It’s outside the
‘norm’,” I ventured.
“Except the
‘norm’ is false. It’s consumer products. These structures, that are not
organic, are false and then it all gets blown up. Maybe it’s the ultimate art
form, I dunno.” We both paused to consider the massive ramifications of that
statement, that war could be the final nihilistic/artistic endeavour, and sadly
we realised that we didn’t have the time to fully explore it.
There’s a
much-lauded phrase “Never meet your heroes, they’ll only disappoint you.”
However, just like his comics work, I’m very glad that Rick flew in the face of
this, and so many other perceived wisdoms. He was an absolute gent and a
friendly, intelligent and fascinating interviewee, and I only wish we’d had
more time and that I was better prepared! His latest attack on the Neo-Cons of
America,
The Big Lie , published in September 2011, is an  interesting examination of the 9/11 conspiracy theories. Here’s
hoping well see a lot more intriguing and groundbreaking work from Mr Veitch in
the next few years.

V for Vendetta Meme
Looks like the
V for Vendetta /Occupy/Anonymous mask meme, designed by artist and Brighton resident, David Lloyd, continues to evolve and adapt. I spotted this stencil art on a bin in a park in Hove at the weekend. You don't think David's been out with his spray can do you? If so, he needs to work on his lettering.

Erotic Comics: A Graphic History Go Digital!
Well, I've finally joined the digital publishing revolution (a little late perhaps!) as both volumes of
Erotic Comics: A Graphic History 1
&
2
are now available in an electronic version on the Kindle on Amazon.com at
$18.14 for Volume 1
and   $20.27 for Volume 2 , while on Amazon.co.uk they are available for the bargain price of
£11.64
and
£13
each. The digital versions have errors corrected and updated as well! Now you can buy your comic smut even more securely, secretly and speedily!  I previewed it on my iPhone, and it didn't really work, but having seen it on an iPad and Kindle it looks pretty good. Sigh, yet another reason to get an iPad (as if I needed one!)
