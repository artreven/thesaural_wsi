The
Museum of Modern Art
is an art museum located in
Midtown
Manhattan
in
New York City , on
53rd Street
between
Fifth
and
Sixth Avenue s. It has been important in developing and collecting
modernist art , and is often identified as the most influential museum of modern art in the world. The museum's collection offers an overview of modern and contemporary art, Museum of Modern Art – New York Art World
including works of architecture and design, drawing,
painting ,
sculpture , photography, prints, illustrated books and artist's books, film and electronic media.
The Library 's holdings include approximately 300,000 books and exhibition catalogs, over 1,000 periodical titles, and over 40,000 files of ephemera about individual artists and groups.http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/library/index The archives holds primary source material related to the history of
modern
and contemporary art.http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/archives_about

History

The idea for The Museum of Modern Art was developed in 1929 primarily by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller and two of her friends,
Lillie P. Bliss
and Mary Quinn Sullivan. They became known variously as
"the Ladies" ,
"the daring ladies"
and
"the adamantine ladies" . They rented modest quarters for the new museum in the Heckscher Building at 730
Fifth Avenue
(corner of
Fifth Avenue
and
57th Street ) in Manhattan, and it opened to the public on November 7, 1929, nine days after the Wall Street Crash. Abby had invited A. Conger Goodyear, the former president of the board of trustees of the Albright Art Gallery in
Buffalo, New York , to become president of the new museum. Abby became treasurer. At the time, it was America's premier museum devoted exclusively to modern art, and the first of its kind in Manhattan to exhibit European modernism.First modern art museum featuring European works in Manhattan – Michael FitzGerald,
Making
Modernism : Picasso and the Creation of the Market for Twentieth-Century Art . New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1995. (p. 120) One of Abby's early recruits for the museum staff was the noted Japanese-American photographer Soichi Sunami (at that time best known for his portraits of modern dance pioneer
Martha Graham ), who served the museum as its official documentary photographer from 1930 until 1968.
Goodyear enlisted Paul J. Sachs and Frank Crowninshield to join him as founding trustees. Sachs, the associate director and curator of prints and drawings at the Fogg Museum at Harvard University, was referred to in those days as a collector of curators. Goodyear asked him to recommend a director and Sachs suggested Alfred H. Barr, Jr., a promising young protege. Under Barr's guidance, the museum's holdings quickly expanded from an initial gift of eight prints and one drawing. Its first successful loan exhibition was in November 1929, displaying paintings by
Van Gogh ,
Gauguin ,
Cézanne , and
Seurat .Origins of MoMA and first successful loan exhibition – see John Ensor Harr and Peter J. Johnson,
The Rockefeller Century: Three Generations of America's Greatest Family , New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1988. (pp. 217–18)
First housed in six rooms of galleries and offices on the twelfth floor of Manhattan's Heckscher Building, on the corner of
Fifth Avenue
and
57th Street , the museum moved into three more temporary locations within the next ten years. Abby's husband was adamantly opposed to the museum (as well as to modern art itself) and refused to release funds for the venture, which had to be obtained from other sources and resulted in the frequent shifts of location. Nevertheless, he eventually donated the land for the current site of the museum, plus other gifts over time, and thus became in effect one of its greatest benefactors.John D. Rockefeller, Jr. one of MoMA's greatest benefactors – see Bernice Kert,
Abby Aldrich Rockefeller: The Woman in the Family . New York: Random House, 1993. (pp. 376, 386)
During that time it initiated many more exhibitions of noted artists, such as the lone
Vincent van Gogh
exhibition on November 4, 1935. Containing an unprecedented sixty-six oils and fifty drawings from the Netherlands, and poignant excerpts from the artist's letters, it was a major public success and became "a precursor to the hold van Gogh has to this day on the contemporary imagination".Precursor to the current hold of van Gogh in public imagination – Ibid., p. 376.

The museum also gained international prominence with the hugely successful and now famous
Picasso
retrospective of 1939–40, held in conjunction with the Art Institute of Chicago. In its range of presented works, it represented a significant reinterpretation of Picasso for future art scholars and historians. This was wholly masterminded by Barr, a Picasso enthusiast, and the exhibition lionized Picasso as the greatest artist of the time, setting the model for all the museum's retrospectives that were to follow.
When Abby Rockefeller's son
Nelson
was selected by the board of trustees to become its flamboyant president in 1939, at the age of thirty, he became the prime instigator and funder of its publicity, acquisitions and subsequent expansion into new headquarters on
53rd Street . His brother,
David Rockefeller , also joined the museum's board of trustees in 1948 and took over the presidency when Nelson was elected Governor of New York in 1958.
David subsequently employed the noted architect Philip Johnson to redesign the museum garden and name it in honor of his mother, the
Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden . He and the Rockefeller family in general have retained a close association with the museum throughout its history, with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund funding the institution since 1947. Both
David Rockefeller, Jr.
and Sharon Percy Rockefeller currently sit on the board of trustees.
In 1937, MoMA had shifted to offices and basement galleries in the
Time-Life Building
in
Rockefeller Center . Its permanent and current home, now renovated, designed in the International Style by the
modernist
architects Philip L. Goodwin and Edward Durell Stone, opened to the public on May 10, 1939, attended by an illustrious company of 6,000 people, and with an opening address via radio from the White House by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt .
1958 fire

On April 15, 1958, a fire on the second floor destroyed an 18 foot long Monet Water Lilies painting . The fire started when workmen installing air conditioning were smoking near paint cans, sawdust, and a canvas dropcloth. One worker was killed in the fire and several firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation. Most of the paintings on the floor had been moved for the construction although large paintings including the Monet were left. Art work on the 3rd and 4th floors were evacuated to the
Whitney Museum of American Art
which abutted it on the
54th Street
side. Among the paintings that were moved was
A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte
which had been on loan by the Art Institute of Chicago. Visitors and employees above the fire were evacuated to the roof and then jumped to the roof of an adjoining townhouse.
1969 controversy
In 1969, the MoMA was at the center of a controversy over its decision to withdraw funding from the iconic anti-war poster
And babies .
Expansion from 1983 to present
from

by

/by-sa/3.0
In 1983 the Museum more than doubled its gallery and increased curatorial department by 30 percent, and added an auditorium, two restaurants and a bookstore in conjunction with the construction of the 53-story Museum Tower adjoining the museum.
In 1997 the Japanese architect Yoshio Taniguchi beat out ten other international architects to win the competition to execute the redesign of the museum. MoMA's midtown location underwent extensive renovations in the early 2000s, closing on May 21, 2002, and reopening to the public in a building redesigned by Taniguchi along with Kohn Pedersen Fox, on November 20, 2004. From June 29, 2002, until September 27, 2004, a portion of its collection was on display in what was dubbed
MoMA QNS , a former Swingline staple factory in
Long Island City ,
Queens . The expansion, including an increase in MoMA’s endowment to cover operating expenses, cost $858 million in total. The project nearly doubled the space for MoMA's exhibitions and programs and features 630000sqft of new and redesigned space. The
Peggy and David Rockefeller Building
on the western portion of the site houses the main exhibition galleries, and
The Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Education and Research Building
on the eastern portion provides over five times more space for classrooms, auditoriums, teacher training workshops, and the museum's expanded Library and Archives. These two buildings frame the enlarged
Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden .
The architecture of the renovation is controversial. At its opening, some critics thought that Taniguchi's design was a fine example of contemporary architecture, while many others were extremely displeased with certain aspects of the design, such as the flow of the space.
The Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Education and Research Building marked the culmination of the Taniguchi project, providing significantly increased space for MoMA's wide-ranging educational and research activities. The building also features an entrance for school groups, a 125-seat auditorium, an orientation center, workshop space for teacher training programs, study centers, and a large lobby with double-height views into the Sculpture Garden.
Museum of Modern Art is selling its last vacant parcel of land in Midtown for $125 million to Hines Development, an international real estate developer based in Houston. Hines in turn announced plans to build
Tower Verre , a skyscraper to be as tall as the
Empire State Building . In 2009 the New York City Department of City Planning said the building could only be built if it was 200 feet shorter than the original plan., the lot sits vacant.
In 2011 the museum acquired the
American Folk Art Museum
which adjoined its property to the east for $31.2 million. Two years later, it later announced in April that it planned to demolish the folk museum. After much protest, architecture firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro was hired to evaluate whether the folk art building could be incorporated into a renovation.
In early 2014, the museum unveiled Diller Scofidio + Renfro's plans for a redesign of its building, featuring a retractable glass wall, new gallery space and the opening of its entire first floor, including the sculpture garden, free to the public. In particular, the proposed expansion would give the museum 15,500 square feet of new gallery space in the former site of the
American Folk Art Museum
and 39,000 in the Tower Verre. Construction on the project is scheduled to be finished by 2018 or 2019.
Exhibition houses
The MoMA occasionally has sponsored and hosted temporary exhibition houses, which have reflected seminal ideas in architectural history.
1949: exhibition house by Marcel Breuer
1950: exhibition house by Gregory Ain
1955: Japanese Exhibition House by Junzo Yoshimura, reinstalled in Philadelphia, PA in 1957–58 and known now as Shofuso Japanese House and Garden
2008: Prefabricated houses planned by:
* Kieran Timberlake Architects
* Lawrence Sass
* Jeremy Edmiston and Douglas Gauthier
* Leo Kaufmann Architects

MoMA developed a world-renowned art photography collection first under Edward Steichen and then under Steichen's hand-picked successor John Szarkowski, which included photos by Todd Webb. The department was founded by Beaumont Newhall in 1940. Under Szarkowski, it focused on a more traditionally modernist approach to the medium, one that emphasized documentary images and orthodox darkroom techniques.
Film
In 1932, museum founder Alfred Barr stressed the importance of introducing "the only great art form peculiar to the twentieth century" to "the American public which should appreciate good films and support them." Museum Trustee and film producer
John Hay Whitney
became the first chairman of the Museum's Film Library from 1935 to 1951. The collection Whitney assembled with the help of film curator Iris Barry was so successful that in 1937 the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences commended the Museum with an award "for its significant work in collecting films . . . and for the first time making available to the public the means of studying the historical and aesthetic development of the motion picture as one of the major arts."
The first curator and founder of the Film Library was Iris Barry, a British film critic and author, whose three decades of pioneering work in collecting films and presenting them in coherent artistic and historical contexts gained recognition for the cinema as the major new art form of our century. Barry and her successors have built a collection comprising some eight thousand titles today, concentrating on assembling an outstanding collection of the important works of international film art, with emphasis being placed on obtaining the highest-quality materials.
The exiled film scholar Siegfried Kracauer worked at the MoMA film archive on a psychological history of German film between 1941 and 1943. The result of his study,
From Caligari to Hitler: A Psychological History of the German Film
traces the birth of Nazism from the cinema of the Weimar Republic and helped lay the foundation of modern film criticism.
Under the
Museum of Modern Art Department of Film , the film collection includes more than 25,000 titles and ranks as one of the world's finest museum archives of international film art. The department owns prints of many familiar feature-length movies, including
Citizen Kane
and
Vertigo , but its holdings also contains many less-traditional pieces, including
Andy Warhol 's eight-hour
Empire , various TV commercials, and Chris Cunningham's music video for
Björk 's
All Is Full of Love .
Architecture and design
MoMA's Department of Architecture and Design was founded in 1932 as the first museum department in the world dedicated to the intersection of architecture and design. The department's first director was Philip Johnson who served as curator between 1932–34 and 1946–54.
The collection consists of 28,000 works including architectural models, drawings and photographs. One of the highlights of the collection is the Mies van der Rohe Archive. It also includes works from such legendary architects and designers as
Frank Lloyd Wright
Paul László, the Eameses, Isamu Noguchi, and George Nelson. The design collection contains many industrial and manufactured pieces, ranging from a self-aligning ball bearing to an entire Bell 47D1 helicopter. In 2012, the department acquired a selection of 14 video games, the basis of an intended collection of 40 which is to range from
Spacewar!
(1962) to
Minecraft
(2011).
Management
Attendance
MoMA has seen its average number of visitors rise to 2.5 million from about 1.5 million a year before its new granite and glass renovation. In 2009, the museum reported 119,000 members and 2.8 million visitors over the previous fiscal year. MoMA attracted its highest-ever number of visitors, 3.09 million, during its 2010 fiscal year; however, attendance dropped 11 percent to 2.8 million in 2011.
The museum was open every day since its founding in 1929, until 1975, when it closed one day a week to reduce operating expenses. In 2012, it again opened every day, including Tuesday, the one day it has traditionally been closed.
Admission
MoMA's reopening brought controversy as its admission cost increased from US$12 to US$20, making it one of the most expensive museums in the city; however it has free entry on Fridays after 4pm, thanks to sponsorship from Uniqlo. Also, many New York area college students receive free admission to the museum., admission fees for MoMA at its
Midtown Manhattan
location are as follows: Adults $25. Seniors $18. Students (full-time with current ID) $14. Children (16 and under) Free (note that this policy does
not
apply to children in groups). Members, Free. Guests of Members, $5 (limit of five per visit).
Finances
A private non-profit organization, MoMA is the seventh-largest U.S. museum by budget; its annual revenue is about $145 million . In 2011, the museum reported net assets (basically, a total of all the resources it has on its books, except the value of the art) of just over $1 billion.
Unlike most museums, the museum eschews government funding, instead subsisting on a fragmented budget with a half-dozen different sources of income, none larger than a fifth. Before the economic crisis of late 2008, the MoMA’s board of trustees decided to sell its equities in order to move into an all-cash position. An $858 million capital campaign funded the 2002-2004 expansion, with
David Rockefeller
donating $77 million in cash. In 2005, Rockefeller pledged an additional $100 million toward the museum's endowment. In 2011, Moody's Investors Service, a bond rating agency, rated $57 million worth of new debt in 2010 with a positive outlook and echoed their Aa2 bond credit rating for the underlying institution. The agency noted that MoMA has "superior financial flexibility with over $332 million of unrestricted financial resources," and has had solid attendance and record sales at its retail outlets around the city and online. Some of the challenges that Moody's noted were the reliance that the museum has on the tourist industry in New York for its operating revenue, and a large amount of debt. The museum at the time had a 2.4 debt-to-operating revenues ratio, but it was also noted that MoMA intended to retire $370 million worth of debt in the next few years. Standard & Poor’s raised its long-term rating for the museum as it benefited from the fundraising of its trustees. After construction expenses for the new galleries are covered, the Modern estimates that some $65 million will go to its $650 million endowment.
MoMA spent $32 million to acquire art for the fiscal year ending in June 2012.
MoMA employs about 815 people. The museum's tax filings from the past few years suggest a shift among the highest paid employees from curatorial staff to management. The museum's director Glenn D. Lowry earned $1.6 million in 2009 and lives in a rent-free $6 million apartment above the museum.
Key people
Officers and the Board of Trustees
Currently, the Board of Trustees includes 42 trustees and 15 life trustees. Even including the board's 14 "honorary" trustees, who do not have voting rights and do not play as direct a role in the museum, this amounts to an average individual contribution of more than $7 million. The Founders Wall was created in 2004, when MoMA’s expansion was completed, and features the names of actual founders in addition to those who gave significant gifts; about a half-dozen names have been added since 2004. For example, Ileana Sonnabend's name was added in 2012, even though she was only 15 when the museum was established in 1929.
