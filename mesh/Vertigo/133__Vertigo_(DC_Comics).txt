70 Aspects of Batman: 29

FRAZER IRVING
From Wikipedia:
Frazer Irving
(born in the 1970s,
Ilford ,
Essex ) is a British comic book artist known for the
2000 AD
series
Necronauts . Since breaking into the American market he has worked on a number of superhero titles, including a number with
Grant Morrison .
I love when artists who seem like they shouldn’t draw superhero comics draw superhero comics: I’d place Frazer Irving in that category. His art seems perfectly suited to atmospheric horror stories, so to see his style applied to Batman and Robin is to see two potent elements combine to make a much more potent whole.
Irving’s first work with Morrison was on
Klarion , part of the latter’s
Seven Soldiers
megaseries. His first Morrison/Batman art appeared in
Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne
#2, which saw the titular hero recast as a Puritan detective (see above) during his travels through the timestream.
He recently completed work on Morrison’s final arc of the
Batman And Robin
title he helped initiate. Irving was given ample space to display his gothic art on characters like Professor Pyg…
…Simon Hurt…
…and, of course, The Joker.
This may sound hyperbolic, but I think Irving’s Joker has for me quickly joined the highest echelon of Clown Prince depictions (Brian Bolland’s at #1). He looks so
diseased
and sinister. Let’s luxuriate in his Joker’s toxic glow:

Some manga series: first books and favorable first impressions

I recently remarked to my brother that
Akira
and
Lone Wolf and Cub
(and similar works by the creators of those works) were the only mangas (I’m going to pluralize it with an “s” because that’s how we fucking indicate pluralization in English)
I’d ever read that weren’t retarded.
Further review reveals that assertion as impulsive and over-general, as I really enjoyed the 3 volumes of Hiroshi Hirata’s
Satsuma Gishiden
that Dark Horse bothered to publish, and I’ve died laughing at the 4 volumes of
Cromartie High School
that I’ve read.
Still, with as many comics as I read and how little of it is Japanese, it seemed like I must have been missing some good stuff.
I surfed around, consulted “best-of” lists, and did that sort of nonsense and came up with a list of works that I want to check out.
Then I downloaded or checked out the first volumes of these series from my local library and read them.
Here are the opening volumes that I thought were great and convinced to read the rest of the series (which I will do in the future).
Uzumaki
by Junji Ito, 1998
You won’t need a Japanese-English dictionary to figure out that uzumaki means “spiral”.
The things are everywhere in this story and inspire major obsessions and eventually supernatural happenings.
The characters are flat as hell but the events are creeeepy.
The Drifting Classroom
by Kazuo Umezu, 1972
An entire school is suddenly teleported to a hostile wasteland and everyone.
Barely any time passes before kids started gettin’ fatal.
Parasyte
by Hitoshi Iwaaki, 1990
I actually read some of this series back in the 1990z when Tokyopop was serializing it in some wacky magazine my brother was buying.
Anyway, I think of Parasyte as a horror version of the 1960s Spider-Man comics.
A run-of-the-mill teenage boy is randomly gifted with an incredible power.
However, this gift is a parasitic alien with a mind of its own that really enjoys eviscerating its alien peers.
Biomega
by Tsutomu Nihei, 2004
This is really the most cliche of the mangaz that I’m covering in this post, as it’s mostly brainless with stupid fashions and wussy heroes.
However, the whole atmosphere is so gripping and several wide-lens type landscape shots are so epic that I was sucked in (also, there is a bear sleeping in a bed).
A lame android rides around on his motorcycle avoiding zombies and firing RPGs at nuke missiles.
Eden: It’s an Endless World
by Hiroki Endo, 1998
The story takes place in your basic, near-future, post-apocalypse but with a multi-generational twist.
The character development and long stretches between major events almost give it a “slice of life” feel.
20th Century Boys
by Naoki Urasawa, 1998
The story jumps back and forth in time, showing the same group of males as pre-adolescent boys and then as early middle age men.
In the past, the boys hang out and have fun while in the present, a cult gets busy and starts a murder mystery.
Children of the Sea
by Daisuke Igarashi, 2005
Full of beautiful depictions of the ocean and shoreline areas, as well as the animals one might find in those areas.
Also, there are some kids that are kinda magic in water or something and a girl gets kicked off of her handball team.
Well, if I included a premiere volume in this post it means I think it was overall excellent and worth your time and, most importantly, I intend to read the remaining volumes in the respective series.
There were definitely some first volumes that I didn’t get into but I’m just keepin’ it positive here.
Also, there are several others that I haven’t gotten to yet and I’ll give a full report when I have!

70 Aspects Of Batman: 23

RAFAEL GRAMPA
From Wikipedia:
Rafael Grampá
is a
Brazilian
comic
book
artist and writer. The comics anthology
5 created by
Grampá along with
Gabriel Bá ,
Becky
Cloonan ,
Fábio Moon
and
Vasilis Lolos
won the 2008
Eisner
Award
for Best Anthology. He is author and artist of the Mesmo
Delivery comic. [1]
I don’t have much to say about Rafael Grampa, because I don’t know much about him! I do know he’s from Brazil, and that he’s awesome. He hasn’t done much American comic work, as far as I know…he did a short story in
Hellblazer
a little while ago, and his creator-owned
Mesmo Delivery
is amazing. I love his Frank Quitely meets Geoff Darrow style. I have no idea where the above picture is from, but it makes me wish some editor at DC would assign Grampa a Bat-project pronto.

JOCK
From Wikipedia:
Mark Simpson , known by the pen name
Jock , is a British
comics
artist, best known for his work in
2000 AD
and on
The Losers . [1]
Jock began his professional career at
2000 AD , on series including
Judge
Dredd
and
Lenny Zero [2] .
He has worked in the American comic book market at
DC
Comics
and their
Vertigo
imprint.
Like most American comic enthusiasts, I first saw the work of Jock in the pages of Vertigo’s
Losers
comic, which was recently adapted into a feature film. Since then, he’s become one of the industry’s go-to guys for memorable cover art…most of the images in this post come from a stint he did as the cover artist for
Batman . Recently he added some interior Bat-work to his resume with a
Detective Comics
arc written by
Greg Rucka .
His work has also appeared in other media, including the package art for the Criterion Collection’s release of Akira Kurosawa’s
Drunken Angel .

Speaking of Batman…
So DC’s giving the whole new reader-friendly line of comics another shot. This time it’s called Earth One. Can it succeed where All Star only partly failed ( All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder , I’m looking at you). Well, I don’t know either way, but find out more
here !

Mickey Mouse in the Gurs Internment Camp

There was once an internment/refugee camp in France that went by the name of
Gurs . During WWII, after France joined up with the Nazis, Camp Gurs became home to non-French Jews and other “dangerous” people. Although this was a concentration camp, and obviously not a nice place to live, the people within Gurs were able to create for themselves a community that thrived on the arts. One prisoner, named Horst Rosenthal, created a couple of comic works before his death. One was titled “A Day in the Life of a Resident: Gurs Internment Camp, 1942”. I can’t find much about this one, but the other one, which a lot of people seem to love, is called “Mickey Mouse in the Gurs Internment Camp – Published without Walt Disney’s Permission.” Here are some panels:
you can read more about it in a paper titled:
Mickey Mouse in Gurs – Humour, Irony and Criticism in Works of Art Produced in the Gurs Internment Camp .
