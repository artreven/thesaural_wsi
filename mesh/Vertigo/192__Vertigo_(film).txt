Freaks – Tod Browning (1932)
March 24, 2013
by
cinecube
Freaks  is a 1932 American  Pre-Code   horror film  about  sideshow  performers, directed and produced by  Tod Browning  and released by  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , with a cast mostly composed of actual  carnival  ( funfair ) performers. The film was based on  Tod Robbins ‘ 1923 short story “ Spurs “. Director Browning took the exceptional step of casting real people with deformities as the eponymous sideshow “freaks,” rather than using costumes and makeup. [1] [2]
Browning had been a member of a traveling  circus  in his early years, and much of the film was drawn from his personal experiences. In the film, the physically deformed “freaks” are inherently trusting and honorable people, while the real monsters are two of the “normal” members of the circus who conspire to murder one of the performers to obtain his large inheritance.
Despite the extensive cuts, the film was still negatively received by audiences, and remained an object of extreme controversy. [5]  Today, the parts that were removed are considered  lost . Browning, famed at the time for his collaborations with  Lon Chaney  and for directing  Bela Lugosi  in  Dracula  (1931), had trouble finding work afterward, and this effectively brought his career to an early close. Because its deformed cast was shocking to moviegoers of the time, the film was banned in the  United Kingdom  for 30 years. [6]  Beginning in the early 1960s,  Freaks  was rediscovered as a  counterculture   cult film , and throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the film was regularly shown at  midnight movie  screenings at several movie theaters in the United States. [7]  In 1994,  Freaks  was selected for preservation in the  United States   National Film Registry  as being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant”.

The Party – Blake Edwards (1968)
August 12, 2012
by
cinecube
The Party  is a  1968   comedy film   directed  by  Blake Edwards , starring  Peter Sellers  and  Claudine Longet . The film has a very loose structure, and essentially serves as a series of  set pieces  for Sellers’s  improvisational comedy  talents. The comedy is based on a  fish out of water  premise, in which a bungling Indian actor accidentally gets invited to a lavish Hollywood dinner party and “makes terrible mistakes based upon ignorance of Western ways.
The Party  is considered a classic comedic  cult film . Edwards biographers Peter Lehman and  William Luhr  said, “ The Party  may very well be one of the most radically  experimental films  in Hollywood history; in fact it may be the single most radical film since  D.W. Griffith ‘s style came to dominate the American cinema.” Film historian Saul Austerlitz wrote, “Despite the offensiveness of Sellers’s  brownface  routine, The Party  is one of his very best films… Taking a page from  Tati , this is  neorealist  comedy, purposefully lacking a director’s guiding eye: look here, look there. The screen is crammed full of activity, and the audience’s eyes are left to wander where they may.”
The original script was only 63 pages in length. Edwards later said it was the shortest script he ever shot from, and the majority of the content in the film was improvised on set.
The film draws much inspiration from the works of  Jacques Tati ; Bakshi arrives at the party in a  Morgan  three-wheeler similar to  Monsieur Hulot ‘s  cyclecar  in  Monsieur Hulot’s Holiday . The entire film storyline is reminiscent of the Royal Garden restaurant sequence of  Playtime ; and the comedic interaction with inanimate objects and gadgets parallels several of Tati’s films, especially  Mon Oncle .

by
cinecube
Melancholia  is a 2011 film written and directed by  Lars von Trier , starring  Kirsten Dunst ,  Charlotte Gainsbourg  and  Kiefer Sutherland . The narrative revolves around two sisters during and shortly after the wedding party of one of them, while Earth is about to collide with an approaching  rogue planet . The film prominently features music from the prelude to  Richard Wagner ‘s opera  Tristan und Isolde  (1857–59).
Trier’s initial inspiration for the film came from a depressive episode he suffered and the insight that depressed people remain calm in stressful situations. The film is a Danish production by  Zentropa , with international co-producers in Sweden, France, Germany and Italy. Filming took place in Sweden.
The film premiered in May 2011 at the  64th Cannes Film Festival . Dunst received the festival’s  Best Actress Award  for her performance.

Brazil – Terry Gilliam (1985)
June 21, 2012
by
cinecube
Brazil  is a 1985 British  science fiction   fantasy / black comedy film  directed by  Terry Gilliam .
Pitting the imagination of common man Sam Lowry (the brilliantly befuddled Jonathan Pryce) against the oppressive storm troopers of the Ministry of Information, Terry Gilliam’s  Brazil  has come to be regarded as an anti-totalitarianism cautionary tale equal to the works of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, and Kurt Vonnegut Jr. Gathering footage from both the European and American versions of this masterpiece, Gilliam has assembled the ultimate, 142-minute director’s cut of his most celebrated film.
The film stars  Jonathan Pryce  and features  Robert De Niro ,  Kim Greist ,  Michael Palin ,  Katherine Helmond ,  Bob Hoskins , and  Ian Holm .
Gilliam’s original cut of the film is 142 minutes long and ends on a dark note. This version was released internationally outside the US by  20th Century Fox .
US distribution was handled by  Universal . Universal executives thought the ending tested poorly, and Universal chairman  Sid Sheinberg  insisted on dramatically re-editing the film to give it a happy ending, a decision that Gilliam resisted vigorously. [18]  As with the cult science fiction film  Blade Runner  (1982), which had been released three years earlier, a version of  Brazil  was created by the  movie studio  with a more consumer-friendly ending. After a lengthy delay with no sign of the film being released, Gilliam took out a full-page ad in the trade magazine  Variety  urging Sheinberg to release  Brazil  in its intended version. Eventually, after Gilliam conducted private screenings (without the studio’s approval),  Brazil  was awarded the  Los Angeles Film Critics Association  award for “Best Picture”, which prompted Universal to finally agree to release a modified 132-minute version supervised by Gilliam, in  1985 .
Los Angeles Times  critic  Kenneth Turan  described the film as “the most potent piece of satiric political cinema since  Dr. Strangelove “.

Seijun Suzuki interview
June 17, 2012
by
cinecube
According to critic Manohla Dargis, “To experience a film by Japanese B-movie visionary Seijun Suzuki is to experience Japanese cinema in all its frenzied, voluptuous excess.” Suzuki played chaos like jazz in his movies, from the anything-goes  yakuza  thrillers  Tokyo Drifter  and  Branded to Kill to the daring postwar dramas of human frailty  Gate of Flesh and  Story of a Prostitute  to the twisted coming-of-age story Fighting Elegy ; he never concerned himself with moderation, cramming boundless invention into his beautifully composed frames, both color and black-and-white. Suzuki first pursued film after returning home to Tokyo from service in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II and failing university entrance exams. Following an unsatisfying stint as an assistant director at Shochiku, Suzuki was lured in 1954 to the recently reopened Nikkatsu studio, which was hiring fresh talent to appeal to a new kind of youth audience. He flourished there for years, with such films as  Take Aim at the Police Van and especially  Youth of the Beast,  a commercial breakthrough for him. Yet his bosses became more and more opposed to his increasingly surreal visual stylings and lack of attention to narrative coherence, and after he made Branded to Kill, which a superior deemed “incomprehensible,” they unceremoniously (and illegally) revoked his contract. Of course, as any true Suzuki fan (and they are legion) knows, the incomprehensibility is part of the fun, and today his sixties works are considered some of the most essential of the Japanese New Wave.

Branded To Kill – Seijun Suzuki (1967)
June 17, 2012
by
cinecube
Branded to Kill  (殺しの烙印  Koroshi no rakuin )  is a 1967 Japanese  yakuza film  directed by  Seijun Suzuki  and starring  Joe Shishido ,  Koji Nanbara ,  Annu Mari  and  Mariko Ogawa .
When Japanese New Wave bad boy Seijun Suzuki delivered this brutal, hilarious, and visually inspired masterpiece to the executives at his studio ( Nikkatsu ), he was promptly fired. Branded to Kill tells the ecstatically bent story of a yakuza assassin with a fetish for sniffing steamed rice (the chipmunk-cheeked superstar Joe Shishido) who botches a job and ends up a target himself. Seijun Suzuki’s Branded to Kill is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It is about as close to traditional Yakuza pictures as Godard’s Alphaville is to science fiction. This is Suzuki at his most extreme—the flabbergasting pinnacle of his sixties pop-art aesthetic.
The film grew a strong following, which expanded overseas in the 1980s, and has established itself as a cult classic. Film critics and enthusiasts now regard it as an absurdist masterpiece. It has been cited as an influence by filmmakers such as Jim Jarmusch, John Woo, Chan-wook Park and Quentin Tarantino. Jarmusch listed it as his favourite hitman film, alongside  Le Samouraï  (also 1967) and thanked Suzuki in the screen credits of his own hitman film  Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai  (1999). Most notably, Jarmusch mirrored a scene in which the protagonist kills a target by shooting up from a basement through a sink drain.

La Jetée – Chris Marker (1962)
June 11, 2012
by
cinecube
La jetée  is a 1962 French science fiction  featurette  by  Chris Marker .
Time travel, still images, a past, present and future and the aftermath of World War III. The tale of a man, a slave, sent back and forth, in and out of time, to find a solution to the world’s fate. To replenish its decreasing stocks of food, medicine and energies, and in doing so, resulting in a perpetual memory of a lone female, life, death and past events that are recreated on an airports jetée.
La jetée  is constructed almost entirely from  optically printed  photographs playing out as a  photomontage  of varying pace. It contains only one brief shot originating on a motion-picture camera. The stills were taken with a  Pentax Spotmatic  and the motion-picture segment was shot with a  35mm   Arriflex . The film has no dialogue aside from small sections of muttering in German. The story is told by a voice-over  narrator. The scene in which the hero and the woman look at a cut-away trunk of a tree is a reference to  Alfred Hitchcock ‘s 1958 film  Vertigo , which Marker also references in  Sans soleil .
