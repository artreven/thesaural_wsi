Sight & Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time: HIFF’s Take
August 14, 2012

Behold, the film list to end all film lists!
So long as humans have 10 fingers and toes, and that infinite library known as
IMDb.com
( @IMDB ) right at their finger tips,
Sight & Sound Magazine
( @SightSoundMag ) will continue their once-a-decade survey of t he greatest films of all time .
Sight & Sound
unveiled this decade’s list last week with arguably the biggest shake-up to the list since the poll first hit newsstands in 1952. After a nearly 50-year reign as the consensus “Greatest Film Ever Made”,
Orson Welles ’
Citizen Kane
cedes the number one spot to
Alfred Hitchcock ’s
Vertigo .
Considered by many scholars and cinephiles alike to be the definite canonical list,
Sight & Sound ’s poll queried a total of 846 critics and 358 directors on their choices for cinema’s most outstanding achievements.
The full list of the
Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time
selections can be found at the
British Film Institute .
While we’re in the midst of whittling down our lists of films to be screened at the 20th anniversary edition of
Hamptons International Film Festival , the HIFF team took a breather and selected their favorite films from Sight & Sound’s Top 50 list.
Moved by
City Lights
and
Tokyo Story ? Blown away by
2001: A Space Odyssey
and
Apocalypse Now ? Share your lists!  Below, HIFF programmers pick their top ten favorites.
