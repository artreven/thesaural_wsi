MIKE ALLRED
From Wikipedia:
Michael Dalton “Mike” Allred
is an
American
comic book artist and writer
most famous for his indie comics creation,
Madman . His style is often compared to pop art, as well as commercial and comic art of the 1950s and 1960s.
Allred began his career as a TV reporter in Europe, and started drawing comics in 1989 with the 104-page
OGN
Dead Air ( Slave Labor Graphics ). Following this up with his similarly-titled works
Graphique Musique (SLG, 1990) and
Grafik Muzik ( Caliber Comics
1990/91), he set out the style that he was to become known for with his most famous character: Madman.
The first
Madman miniseries debuted from
Tundra Publishing
in March 1992, and gained higher recognition with its move to
Dark Horse Comics
in April 1994. Relaunched as
Madman Comics, it went on to be nominated for several
Harvey Awards . Allred himself gained further mainstream attention with the science-fiction/rock-and-roll comic
Red Rocket 7
and his art for writer
Peter Milligan ‘s series
X-Force , which he began drawing in July 2001, and subsequently became
X-Statix
after
X-Force #128.
His more recent work includes
The Golden Plates, an adaptation of
The Book of Mormon . Other projects are inking
X-Statix Presents: Deadgirl, and work on a new ‘Madman’ series. He has also drawn three issues of the
Vertigo
comic
Fables .
His wife,
Laura , frequently works as his
colorist .
Allred is a member of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , otherwise known as the Mormons.
Currently, he’s performing art duties on up and coming
Vertigo
series
I, Zombie, written by
Chris Roberson . The main character, Gwendolyn “Gwen” Dylan, is a ‘zombie girl detective’.
I first encountered Mike Allred’s work in the pages of
Madman
#1, waaaay back in 1993. When I would stay with my grandparents for a bit in the summer, my grandma would drive me to nearby Iowa City in order to take advantage of some of the things the college town offered that their small town didn’t. Like comic shops! I don’t remember if I read about
Madman
before I bought it, but for some reason one day, instead of getting the newest issue of
Spawn
I got
Madman
#1 from Tundra. I was instantly attracted to Allred’s clean, retro style (though his early stuff had more of a
Charles Burns -y feel as well), and read and re-read the issue multiple times. I’ve been an Allred devotee ever since.
Apart from the odd pin-up, Allred’s most substantial work on Batman appeared in his issue of
Solo , entitled “Batman-A-Go-Go”. I want to say BAGG was meant to be a miniseries at one point, but I can’t find anything online to support that. I definitely remember it being an idea that was mentioned long before it eventually appeared.
Unsurprisingly, considering the influence the 60s have on his work,  Allred’s take on Batman in this story is steeped in the look of the Adam West starring-TV show. The main plot of “Batman-A-Go-Go”, however, actually concerns Batman’s disillusionment about how the world is changing into a much darker place than the day-glo sound effects-laden one of the show. It’s an interesting take, and it would have been nice to see this story in full miniseries form (if that was ever actually a possibility).
So in closing, Mike Allred has long been one of my favorite comic artists, and you should do your best to seek out his issue of
Solo , and everything else he’s ever done.

70 Aspects Of Batman: 1

So here’s a new feature:
70 Aspects Of Batman .
As you may not know, this year marks the 70th Anniversary of creation of
Batman , The Dark Knight, The Caped etc. Batman first appeared in
Detective Comics
#27, cover-dated May 1939. To celebrate one of my favorite fictional character’s anniversaries, I’ve decided to share with you, the loyal Noising Machine reader, 70 different artistic interpretations of this guy throughout the rest of this year. These will include both entries on accepted Batman greats ( Neal Adams ,
Frank Miller ), relatively unsung heroes ( Norm Breyfogle ,
Graham Nolan ) and great artists who may have only drawn Batman once, but I like ’em so here they are ( Katsuhiro Otomo ). There definitely will not be any of the likes of
Jim Lee ,
Michael Turner
or
Ed Benes
though, so you can rest easy. Anyway, for this inaugural edition of 70 AOB, what better place to start then at the very beginning, with Batman’s “creator”…
BOB KANE
(Bob Kane pictured right)
Now here’s the thing about
Bob Kane : HE WAS AN ASSHOLE. For decades, he had a contract with
DC
Comics that allowed him to have his name on any and every Batman story they published, regardless of who actually wrote and drew them. He also downplayed and/or outright ignored crediting contributions made by such creators as
Bill Finger
and
Jerry Robinson
to the Batman mythos. Basically, he created Batman to cash in on the success of
Superman , who DC had premiered a year earlier.
As writer Bill Finger recalled: “[Kane] had an idea for a character called ‘Batman’, and he’d like me to see the drawings. I went over to Kane’s, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of … reddish tights, I believe, with boots … no gloves, no gauntlets … with a small domino mask, swinging on a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it was a big sign … BATMAN.”
Finger took this initial design and suggested modifications, substituting a cowl for the mask, adding a cape and gloves and instigating the color scheme change to gray and blue. He also came up with the name of Batman’s alter-ego, Bruce Wayne, by taking the last names of Scottish patriot
Robert Bruce
and Revolutionary War general
“Mad” Anthony Wayne
and combining them. He also wrote the script for Batman’s initial appearance in Detective #27.
If this seems more like a Bill Finger post than a Bob Kane post, that’s because Bill Finger seems like a better human being to me. If there was any justice, the byline that’s still found in Batman comics today would read “Batman created by Bob Kane & Bill Finger” instead of “Batman Created by That Butthole Bob Kane”.  Kane was all too happy to take the attention and accolades during Batman’s initial success in the 40s, his 60s resurgence thanks to the Adam West TV show and the hoopla surronding the Batman feature films of the late 20th Century. He died in 1998.
Still, I think one can and must judge work on its own merit and not by whether its creator was an asshole, as hard as that may be. Thus, while Bob Kane was a gloryhound who trampelled over others to get undeserved credit, he still did commit the first rendition of Batman to paper. And in his own stiff way, he lent the early Batman stories a sense of atmosphere that could be described as gothic or proto-noir. Like this:
That’s a good, evocative picture. But yeah, for the most part most of the stuff you like about Batman probably came about in spite of Bob Kane, not because of him. And in real-life, I bet Batman wouldn’t even like him that much.
G.
