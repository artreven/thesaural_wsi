The FØØL’s Progress
The Fool shows a child or youth, while the Magician depicts an all powerful adept. Just as the Fool showed us the price of eternal innocence, so this Magician gives us the fearsomeness of taking on responsibility. If the Major Arcana represents the Fool’s journey, the Magician is the first thing the Fool encounters.

Yesterday I got myself a new pack of
Tarot
cards.
The Mage Tarot
It wasn’t intentional. I was at the Kinokuniya main store to check for the new (both Japanese and English) magazine arrivals . As the main aisle leading from the Japanese section to the English Fiction section was congested, I made a detour through the maze of shelves in the Academic section. Again, I was channeled towards the narrow space between the information counter and the shelf where the Tarot cards are displayed. Seldom would I stop to look at the cards but something caught my eye. It’s the
The Mage
Tarot from World of Darkness, published by White Wolf games. I’m not really into the sword and sorcery stuff (e.g. Middle Earth,
D&D
etc) but I like Occultic
dark fantasy (Goth stuff, but I have no inkling towards Werewolves and Vampires) – Lovecraftian, Crowley-ian. I believe in
Magick , not magic.
The Mage Tarot – Major Arcana
I bought this pack of cards because I liked the art. This is the fourth Tarot deck in my collection.

Reign of Fools
My first set of Tarot deck was the
H.R Giger
deck by Akron. However, this deck only contained the Major Arcana set. The second set was the
Vertigo
Tarot. I thought the deck was too beautiful to be opened and used. I would have gotten a second deck if it weren’t such an limited edition exclusive. In the end, I got the Phantasmogoric Tarot from
U.S. Games
– a major publisher of Tarot cards. This is the deck that I’ve opened up for use.
I keep this deck of cards in a silk pouch, stored in a wooden box.

I’ve read the textbooks on how to use the Tarot. However, all that I read remains theory because I’ve not really done any actual reading myself. Despite that, I’m still fascinated with the imagery and the story behind this cartomancy system. For those interested in understanding the tarot, a good primer to start with would be the 78 Degrees of Wisdom by
Rachel Pollack . Ms Pollack was once a scribe for the
Doom Patrol
under the Vertigo imprint.

I’m drawn towards things that are secretive and esoteric. According to my
astrological profile , I am someone who’s attracted
“to the occult or to psychic phenomena”
and my
“life will be geared to the acquisition of higher knowledge..” . My
“mind is over-enthusiastic in regard to philosophic or religious subjects…”
Over the years, I’ve garnered a mini library on Occultic knowledge. I’m particularly interested in the
Qabbalah , the Tarot, crystals and astrology. I was introduced to astrology by a girl that I used to date.
Occult Library
OF FAITH AND DEVOTION
When I was a teenager, I became fascinated with Eastern occultic arts & science after watching the movie “ Peacock King (å­”é›€çŽ‹å­) ” that was an adaptation of the Japanese manga
Kujaku-O (å­”é›€çŽ‹) . The manga was inspired by
Shingon Buddhism , an off shoot of the
Vajrayana
stream of Buddhism. I was charmed by the monk-hero who could dispel demons by weaving spells (Mantras) together with the hand signs (Mudras). That made me wanted to know more about the mystical aspect of Buddhism. It made me think that there is more to Buddhism than a belief that happens during funerals. I didn’t have to look far. In my school library, I found this tome – “ Asiatic Mythology ” in the reference section. Its a rich encyclopedia on the major faiths and belief systems found in Asia – such as Islam, Zaraosterism, Jainism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism and so on (You can read the book online
here ). That book opened up a whole new world for me, as it took me deeper into the beliefs and myth making system of my heritage. Though I didn’t take up any Religious Knowledge subjects during secondary school, I was doing my own theological research, especially on Buddhism, a faith assigned during birth. At first I was fascinated with the esoteric Vajrayana and Tantric stuff, until it led me back to the source.
Incidentally, during that period of time, there was also nascent New Age ‘movement’ that found its way to Singapore. It happened at the time when The Newpaper covered stories of teenagers dabbling in the occult and Satanism. I did meet a self-professed “Satanist” when I was hanging out at a hobby shop (Scale Hobbies) at Far East Plaza. If I remember correctly, his name was Damien. I was spooked, at the same time fascinated when he told me about his experience. There was also this shop at Lucky Plaza called “New Age”. This shop sold literature and materiels related to “Wiccan” and “Pagan” traditions – such as crystals, wands and the likes. I had this weird but rather precocious classmate in secondary school. Vincent (if there’s an actor that would be able to play his character,
Tom Green
would be a good candidate) is also into the weird and kooky stuff. I remembered that he read a book on using technology to invoke angels and something to the efffect. Slowly, bookstores began renaming a section of what used to be titled “Occult” or “Self Help” to “New Age”. Writings by Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman got me interested in the Western occultic traditions – especially after reading the original “ Books of Magic ” mini-series.
I also followed another classmate of mine who’s a disciple of the
Tian Dao
sect to check out the religious group he was with. This movement (or “cult”, depending on your point of view) is a religious group professing the syncretic nature of religion – somewhat like “all roads lead to Rome”. During the initiation into the cult, you’re sworn to an oath of secrecy. If you breach their Official Secrets Act, you’d have five thunders crashing on your head if you disclose what was imparted. I quit the place after a while as I am not accustomed to a faith that insisted on idol worship, the oath of secrecy and life in a counter-society. I found little wisdom in what they’re trying to do, not very different from the Falun-gong.
I did dabble with Christianity. But it was mainly because of chicks. There were two occasions that I fell for Christian chicks and I followed them to church. I thought I would give Jesus Christ a chance. But my attendance ended as soon as I saw that it was going to be another unrequited relationship. Somehow, I don’t think I can subscribe to any of the monotheistic faiths, especially one that demands your unquestioned faith and allegiance, or one that make you feel rotten because your ancestors fucked up. Its not that I don’t believe in God – I don’t believe in the Church. Again, I reiterate the belief that the Church has taken Jesus Christ hostage and perverted His teachings to serve their selfish interest. Its got a blood stained history that I don’t wish to be associated with. Its not that the Church hadn’t done any good – it has. Personally, it was salvation for the maternal side of my extended family. But in my opinion, at the grand level. its no different from the civil-military relations (CMR) projects to win hearts and minds for a political purpose. George W Bush isn’t doing his faith any favour either.
At the end of the day, although I am pre-disposed to the Buddhist belief system, I am aware that even within Buddhism, its got its fair share of hypocrisy – from both the laymen and the religious clergy. I was so won over by Buddhist teachings that I had ever thought of becoming a monk. But I soon discovered that monks that indulge in materialistic lifestyle, political bickering etc.
Another thing that I realised that even though I can become vegan, its hard for me to take the vow of celibacy. “Buddhism” died the moment the term “Buddhism” was coined. Rather, its more apt to describe that I believe in the principles of the Dharma (but whether do I put it to practice is another matter).
I believe that most organised/institutionalised religious movements are prone to corruption. I rather not belong to any group. Spiritual salvation is a personal thing.
Make an island of yourself,
make yourself your refuge;
there is no other refuge.
Make truth your island,
make truth your refuge;
there is no other refuge.
– Digha Nikaya, 16
