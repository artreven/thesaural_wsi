British artist Bridget Riley (born 1932)
is my favourite living artist. Still
creative and innovative after 5 decades.
Her work is much more than just
"Op-Art".
More than 9600 views - thanks,
everybody.

woman, "inside" her work.
Bridget Riley,Blaze 1 (1962)

Die Welt, wie ich…
says: This is the kind of op-art work she
created in the early 60s and she's still
most famous for, although she never
understood herself as an
"op-art" artist or as being
part of any "movement". This
one is called
Blaze 1
and was painted in 1962, currently at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York
City.

Fission , 1963, Tempera on composition board, 35

York City. Similar concept as her
seminal "Movement in Squares".

Vertigo

Die Welt, wie ich…
says: Her influence on popular culture was
stronger than she bargained for. This is
the famous "swirl" logo of the
Vertigo
rock music record label. The design
was, as far as I know, never officially
credited to her. It produced a dazzling
optical effect when the record was
spinning on the turntable. The German
band Faust used one of her early
paintings as a
record cover .

Bridget Riley - Cataract 3
1967
by

Die Welt, wie ich…
says: Soon afterwards her waves became
colourful and more complex in shape:
This is one of her masteripeces:
Cataract 3 , 1967, emulsion on canvas. It is more
than 2 meters wide and almost square
(221.9 x 222.9 cm). Owned by the British
Council, London

Die Welt, wie ich…
says: You can see her painting
To a Summer's Day
from 1980 (acrylic on canvas) in the
Tate Gallery, London (115.5 x 281 cm).
Each wave has three colours at any one
point, starting and ending at every
crest or trough. The choice of colours
was intended to provoke an optical mix
in the eye, with as much interaction as
possible between colours.
MoMA 109 Bridget Riley

says: Her sketches are sometimes even more
interesting than her paintings, because
here you can analyse the way she works.
This one was exhibited at MOMA.

Die Welt, wie ich…
says: Her famous stripe paintings were created
in the late 70s and early 80s. Although
they look simple at first, they are full
of rhythm, music even, that reveals
itself if you take a closer look and try
to analyse the pattern. Regularities
seem to pop up, but as soon as you try
to get hold of them they disappear.

paintings reveals how meticulously they
are executed.
Bridget Riley: New Day
by
Michael Wailes
Die Welt, wie ich…
says: Later in the 1980s diamonds or
zigs
enriched her visual language. Although
the paintings from that phase look
simple you can discover intriguing
complexities when you look at them long
enough. No matter how long I analyse, I
never completely understand them. This
one is called
New Day .

says: Some of her works are painted directly
on the wall (by her assistants). This is
an example created in the Gemeentemuseum
Den Haag, 2012.
Bridget Riley: Wall Painting I
by
Michael Wailes
Die Welt, wie ich…
says: Another one of her wall paintings,
simply called
Wall Painting 1
and a good example for the colours and
shapes she experiments with today. This
one was made in Paris: at the Musée
d'Art Moderne, one of my favourite
museums in the world. Majestic, isn't
it?
Bridget Riley - OUT THERE, 2004
by
de_buurman
Die Welt, wie ich…
says: Another typical example of her more
recent paintings. The colours get more
daring the older she gets. This one is
called
Out There
and was painted (probably by a team of
assistants, following her instructions)
in 2004. More about it in the comments.

National Museums Liverpool
Die Welt, wie ich…
says: The artist herself, at the age of 78, in
front of a recent painting, exhibited in
Liverpool. After continuously developing
her style, one step at a time, over five
decades, she has lost none of her
creativity.

Now I understand. I do like her early work,
but then the introduction of colour in the
later art is spendid too.

Bridget Riley’s “Out There” is part of the
“Caldic Collection”, a private art collection
brought together by collector Joop van
Caldenborgh. It is not on permanent display
at the Kunsthal in Rotterdam. It is however
very likely to be on permanent display at the
Caldic Museum, to be opened in 2014 in
Wassenaar, Netherlands.
