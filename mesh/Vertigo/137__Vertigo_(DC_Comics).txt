To all you thirty-somethings worrying about how you wasted your twenties and what you’ll do to make up for it before you’re forty, know that there’s still time to live your life, and take some courage from these sage words of
Carrie Bradshaw :
“Enjoy yourself . . . That’s what your twenties are for. Your thirties are to learn the lessons. Your forties are to pay for the drinks.”
– From the film
Sex and the City , 2008

The 25 Most Influential People in Comic Book Movies: #14 Mark Steven Johnson
May 14, 2008 — sophosmoros
Some may call him a pioneer of dark and gritty comic book films. Others might say he’s the worst friend
Marvel Studios
could have. Either way,
Mark Steven Johnson
has certainly made his mark on Hollywood.
In 2003 he directed and co-wrote the screenplay for
Daredevil , based on the
eponymous Marvel character .
Interestingly, Johnson appeared in
Kevin Smith ’s 2001 comedy
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back
pretending to direct a Daredevil movie.
A few years later, he was actually hired by Twentieth Century Fox to direct
Daredevil . Smith wrote several issues of Daredevil comics for Marvel in 1999 and had a cameo role in Johnson’s
Daredevil .
Ben Affleck , who starred in
Daredevil , co-starred in
Jay and Silent Bob .
These fateful coincidences notwithstanding, the film opened to mixed reviews.
In 2005, Johnson was the executive producer for the spinoff film
Elektra   (based on the
Marvel character
created by
#7 Frank Miller ), for which he also wrote an early draft script.
Reviews for this film
were awful, and Rotten Tomatoes ranked it the
second worst reviewed comic book movie
of all time.
Did Johnson find redemption in 2007’s
Ghost Rider   (produced by
#22 Michael De Luca  with executive producer
#5 David S. Goyer ), which he directed and for which he wrote the screen story and screenplay?
It
depends on who you ask .
It didn’t
completely
flop at the box office, and it got slightly better critical reviews than
Elektra , but that’s not saying much. Despite these misfires, Johnson is set to direct a possible
Daredevil II
and co-write the screenplay for a
film
based on Marvel’s
Luke Cage , but release dates have not yet been issued for these films. Johnson is currently involved as executive producer and writer for a
television adaptation
of
Garth Ennis ’
Preacher
for HBO.

The 25 Most Influential People in Comic Book Movies: #15 Gilbert Adler
May 13, 2008 — sophosmoros
Gilbert Adler
kept the Crypt Keeper alive, as it were, owing a great deal of his accomplishment to his antecedent, the late writer/producer
#24 Milton Subotsky . Where Subotsky first brought
EC Comics
stories to the screen with the original
Tales from the Crypt
in 1972, Adler continued the tradition through the 1980s and ‘90s.
Adler started by directing the Crypt Keeper sequences in HBO’s “ Tales from the Crypt ” television show in 1989, directing two full episodes in 1992 and 1993, and writing several episodes between ‘91 and ‘96.
During this time, he produced over 60 episodes of “Tales from the Crypt” for HBO.
In 1995, he directed Crypt Keeper sequences for the big screen in
Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight , which he also produced.
He soon directed, produced, and wrote the screenplay for his own feature length Crypt film
Bordello of Blood
in 1996.
In subsequent years he has served as the executive producer for DC/ Vertigo ’s
Constantine  (produced by
#16 Lauren Shuler Donner ,
#8 Benjamin Melniker  and
#5 Michael E. Uslan ) released in 2005, and as a producer of
Superman Returns , also produced, directed, and co-written by
#9 Bryan Singer , released in 2006.
He is reportedly set to produce the Superman sequel,
Superman: Man of Steel , again with Singer, scheduled for release in June of 2009. He may also be the executive producer of the
sequel to
Constantine  (also with Shuler Donner producing) if the film is ever actually made.

The 25 Most Influential People in Comic Book Movies: #24 Milton Subotsky
May 9, 2008 — sophosmoros
In 1972,
Milton Subotsky
(co-founder of
Amicus Productions ) became the man responsible for bringing the
EC Comics
tradition of
pre-code
horror to the big screen. He wrote and produced
Tales from the Crypt , and its sequel,
The Vault of Horror .  As Roger Ebert observes,
“The titles published by E. C. Publications were more dramatically drawn, scarier and unsurpassed in the department of divine retribution. Six months or a year after I discovered “Tales from the Crypt” and the other E. C. comics, they were taken off the stands during a national anti-comics frenzy.
Dr. Frederick Wertham ‘s “ Seduction of the Innocent ” charged that kiddies were becoming sadists because of horror tales, and overnight we were flooded with talking magpies. And so, alas, my career as a sadistic madman was nipped in the bud. . . . There the story might have rested, If it weren’t for Milton Subotsky, British producer of horror movies and old-time E. C. fan. Subotsky bought the movie rights for all the E. C. horror titles from their publisher,
William M. Gaines , and “Tales from the Crypt” is the first film made from the material.”
Since that time, he can be indirectly credited as the inspiration for a number of sequels and spinoffs, including the HBO series “ Tales from the Crypt ” (directed, written, and produced by
#15 Gilbert Adler ) and
Stephen King ’s
Creepshow . Milton passed away of heart disease in 1991.

In Treatment
March 3, 2008 — sophosmoros
Great
show , on HBO.  If you can, watch it from the first episode.  The sequence is 1) Laura, 2) Alex, 3) Sophie, 4) Jake and Amy, and 5) Paul and Gina.  I think they’re scheduled up through week seven by now.
Anyway, it’s truly amazing to see how pervasively and persistently denial runs through all of us.  Its unsettling when I find myself identifying with the characters I dislike the most on this show.

Love the One You’re With but Be All That You Can Be
February 21, 2008 — sophosmoros
OK, the title of this post makes me want to gag.  But below is a great quote:
“The most important relationship is the one you have with yourself, and if you find someone to love the you that you love, well then that’s just fabulous”-
Carrie Bradshaw
(Sex And The City).
Thanks to
Kimberly’s Blog
for this one.
