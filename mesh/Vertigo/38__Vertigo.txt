Breastfeeding in the Past
It is amazing to know how timeless breastfeeding truly is. I came across this
website
that includes paintings and other art from the 14th, 15th, and 16th Centuries.
For me, it is just amazing to know that I am doing the exact same thing, to my babies, as women did to theirs hundreds of years ago!
Most of these paintings, to me, really glorify breastfeeding....something I feel is missing today.

Baby Talk Magazine
This month's edition of Baby Talk Magazine has a small article called "Nurse Mom" on page 20.
It reads that "America's hospitals aren't doing enough to promote breastfeeding. That's the crux of a new paper published in Pediatrics, the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP). Maternity facilities nationwide were graded on their support of breastfeeding practices. Out of a possible score of 100, the average hospital scored a 63.
In fact, 70 percent of facilities hand out infant formula packets to breastfeeding moms." When we had our first daughter, the "lactation consultant" only spent five minutes with me. She said my daughter was "tight mouthed" and did not know how to suck properly and therefor we should give her formula!!! My husband and I about died. But we had another Lactation Consultant at Scottish Rite, in Atlanta, who was a God sent! With both daughters we were sent home with loads of free formula, which we did ask for. But we only wanted it incase of an emergency. I am a very strong willed (maybe even stubborn) person. So I was convinced I was not going to give up breastfeeding at any cost or reason. But I can see how some moms would give up and go the "easy route" and do formula.
Support and education is the best key! It is about time our hospitals step up and really promote breastfeeding......I do hope our first "lactation consultant" (I use that term very lightly) got some education of her own or found a new job!!!!!!!! How about you? What do you think about this study?

Mixing Breast Milk and Formula
Some people believe that it is ALL breast milk or none at all. But the truth is that even a small amount of breast milk a day has benefits.
This
article
explains that if you nurse your baby once and give formula bottles for the rest of the day, you are still giving your baby all of the wonderful benefits breast milk has to offer.
For the first 2 months of Joslyn's (my oldest daughter) life, we gave her one formula bottle a day. When she got that bottle I pumped so I was still keeping my supply up. With Katelyn, we tried formula once and she hated it so bad she refused to eat it. So we have not given her any more since. But we do have an emergency stash in the laundry room.
So I am not going to say that it is horrible to give your baby formula nor do I pass judgment. But I do feel any amount of breast milk is just such an amazing gift to give your babies and no one should feel guilty if they need to supplement with formula.
But it is not for me to decide...... even though sometimes I wish I could!

March Carnival of Breastfeeding
This month's theme is "the joys of breastfeeding." Tanya at
The Motherwear Breastfeeding Blog , has shared her joys and I wanted to share mine as well. For me there is not one single joy....but a bunch. It is not the fact that breastmilk is free, does not contain chemicals, or even the fact that it is ready at a moments notice. For me, the joys of breastfeeding are more than that. I love when Katelyn holds my thumb while she is nursing. Seeing her teeny tiny hand grasp my thumb is so heart warming. I love the fact that all of her growth is all of my doing. We have petite girls, but every pound and inch gained is like a secret celebration to me! Even though this one is kind of tough in the beginning.....I love the fact that only I can feed her. Sure pumping my milk and putting it in a bottle is wonderful...but she does not take to bottles very well. Joslyn did not care if it was breast or bottle. But Katelyn only wants the real thing. I secretly love that! I also love the confidence that comes along with breastfeeding. Ever since I felt comfortable nursing Joslyn, my confidence has grown so much! Now nursing Katelyn I feel I am more confident than ever! I also love when Joslyn was 8 months old, all I had to ask was "Do you want to eat?" and no matter where she was she would crawl to me in such a hurry with the biggest smile on her face......Just seeing that image in my head makes me smile! So to me, breastfeeding is more than just feeding my babies. It is a special gift that only I can give them. One thing that I have that no on else has....Mummie's Nummies! What about you? What are your joys of breastfeeding?

Nursing in Public
I have to admit, while I nursed my oldest daughter, I only felt comfortable nursing in the car or at most on a bench in a secluded part of the store.
But something has changed since giving birth to our second daughter. I find myself saying "I don't care where I feed her." Now this newly found confidence is wonderful and it was put to the test this past weekend. It was almost feeding time and we were in the far back of a food store. Katelyn was sitting in her home made sling carrier and Joslyn was sitting in the cart cover being pushed by my husband. My husband asked if I wanted the car keys, so I could feed Katelyn. To my surprise I said "nope, I think I will do it here." Now my answer must have surprised him just as much as it did me! "Really?" he said. "Sure, why not?" was my response.
I flipped Katelyn around and proceeded to nurse her (while still walking) and no one had any clue! We were walking in the Frozen Food Isle and an older man looked at me and said "I bet you can't wait to get that baby out of this cold isle, huh?" I just giggled and said "yes". I looked at my husband and explained that he thought I had Katelyn covered up to keep her warm!!
hehe I would love to say that I fed her the entire time in the store....but I can not. The sling was too tight and she was not comfortable. So as Joslyn and my husband were waiting in line I took the keys and proceeded to the car.....with Katelyn still latched on! So....what unusual places have you fed your little ones?

Charleston West Virgina Companies Promote Breastfeeding
Here is a great news
article
that shows workplaces supporting moms who nurse. If every workplace was able to do this, how amazing it would be! I am a stay at home mommy, but not every mom is. How amazing it would be to work for a company who allows you to have your baby at work with you! Maybe this will catch on. Do you know of any workplaces, in your area, who do this?

Breast Milk Let Down
Let Down is when your breast milk begins to come out of your nipple, while you are nursing or pumping. Some women have " slow let down ", which means that your milk takes a bit longer to come out and other women may have " over active let down ", which means that your milk comes out very fast and forceful. With both of my daughters, we battled instant and overactive let down. Which in their cases caused their reflux to be worse. Before each feeding I began to hand express into a cloth (eventually went to a plastic cup as I was using so many towels) until the let down was less intense. It did help to some extent. My daughters were choking on the milk, due to the amount that was coming out, and hand expressing did stop them from choking. Also Let Down, whether it be "Slow", "Normal", or "Overactive" can cause discomfort and even a bit of pain in the first few weeks. My daughter, Katelyn, just turned 4 months and I can still feel when Let Down occurs. It feels more like a pinching feeling than pain now. Did you experience "Slow" or "Overactive Let Down?" If so ,what did you do to correct it?

N.Y. Chef Makes Cheese Made From Human Breast Milk
Fox News must be on a breast milk kick!!! (HURRAY FOR THEM!) Here is another
article
about breast milk.
Daniel Angerer is used to getting attention for the food served at his restaurant, Klee Brasserie — but the New York chef is making more headlines than ever over a new dish that has its source in his fiancee's brassiere.
"Mommy's Milk Cheese" is exactly what it sounds like: cheese made from the breast milk of a nursing mother.
In Angerer's case, that mother is his longtime fiancee, Lori Mason, who was producing more milk than she knew what to do with while nursing their now 10-week-old daughter, Arabella.
"We see this supply in the freezer and basically can't stuff anymore breast milk in there," Angerer told FoxNews.com.
So, the couple started researching how they could
donate
the milk but discovered it was a "lengthy process."
"We realized we were going to have to throw a lot of it out, pour this liquid gold down the drain, and we were not going to do that," Angerer said. "So, me being a chef, we said, 'Hey, let's make some cheese!'"
After a successful experiment in February, Angerer posted his new recipe on his
blog, "Taking Butter From Lettuce and Sugar From Peas,"
and from there, Mason said, it took off "like wildfire."
"People were sort of intrigued, interested, put off, fascinated, disgusted — whatever it is, people were obviously reacting and responding to it," she said.
And while responses to Angerer's blog post range from supporters who call "Mommy's Milk Cheese" a "beautiful thing" to critics who are horrified by the whole idea, Mason says the responses from those who've tasted it are far less varied.
"The people who've tried it so far say the same thing, which is, 'Oh, it tastes like cheese.'"
The couple's curious neighbor Troy Berman followed suit Tuesday, saying, "it tastes the same as any other cheese to me," after sampling it for the first time.
Being just as curious, I also gave it a try, and while I found it to be slightly softer, a little more gelatin-like, than a standard slice of deli cheese, if anyone had told me it was a piece of provolone, I easily would have believed them.
Angerer said that's exactly what he was going for with this batch.
"The one you tried was more like a cheddar or provolone cheese," he said enthusiastically.
Other batches have included cow's milk, peppercorn, truffle shavings, even one with a light soy sauce, and textures range from ricotta-style cheeses to some hard enough to grate over food.
But Angerer isn't the only one controlling the flavors in the cheese.
"People ask me if it tastes different according to what I eat, and I think it does," said Mason, a vegetarian. "I think there are times, if I'm eating sweets and cookies and things like that, that it tastes a little bit sweeter than if I'm in a round where I'm eating a lot of vegetables."
It's that impact that a mother has on what's in her breast milk that has the Health Department and other critics warning against the public consumption of human cheese.
"Consumption of breast milk could unknowingly expose consumers to infectious diseases like hepatitis and HIV," FoxNews.com Managing Health Editor, Dr. Manny Alvarez wrote in
the Fox News Health Blog.
Dr. Manny says people need to consider the risks associated with consuming any kind of food or drink containing human fluids.
Mason and Angerer agreed, saying "Mommy's Milk" was never intended for Klee Brasserie. But, confident in Mason's health and diet, they have no issues with eating it themselves or letting others give it a try outside of the restaurant.
"People are eating milk from a cow or a goat or a yak or whatever and the milk from those animals feed their young just like the milk from humans feed their young. And while adults of most species aren't meant to eat dairy or drink milk, we do," Mason said. "So if anything, it's less of a stretch to eat human's milk. … It's the most nutritious thing on the planet for humans."
Dr. Manny agrees that breast milk is "one of God's greatest natural foods" but says denaturalizing its properties causes the milk to lose its many nutritional values.
"So if you think you're going to eat breast milk cheese in order to improve your immune system, you should probably think again," he said.
Angerer said the couple still is going through the approval process to donate Mason's extra breast milk to those in need in its most nutritional form.
But in the meantime, the couple plans to hold some kind of a private tasting event for those looking to try "Mommy's Milk" and promises more cheeses — and maybe even gelato — to come.
"You will be the judge what is really better for humankind," Angerer said. "And if you're eager to try it, supply lasts." In my opinion......WAY TO GO CHEF! If I was able to make my extra "liquid gold" into something edible, you bet your breast milk I would! I agree with the woman.....why dump the milk when you can put it to good use! But I also agree with the Health officials. You never know what a stranger is putting into their bodies. But if they could figure out a way to test the milk and then make the cheese....GOLD MINE! Now I wonder if my husband would try my "Mommy's Milk Cheese."

Woman Arrested for Spraying Cop with Breastmilk
A special thanks goes to one of our "Nummie Mummies" for sending me this article that was posted on Fox News.
A Kentucky woman was charged with assault after she allegedly squirted breast milk into the face of a deputy, sparking online debate Sunday in the local media.
Toni Tramel, 31, was arrested Thursday for public intoxication in Owensboro, WYMT-TV reported, but it is what she did next which has attracted headlines.
As Tramel changed into an inmate uniform, she squirted a stream of breastmailk into the face of the female deputy watching over her.
A press release from the Daviess County, Kentucky, Detention Center, said that after the deputy decontaminated herself from the "bio-hazard", Tramel was charged with third degree assault.
While the public drunkenness was merely a misdemeanor offense, the assault is a felony charge and a US$10,000 bond was set.
Reports of the case have sparked debates about whether using breast milk as a weapon should constitute a felony assault case, with many readers likening it to an accused person spitting on an officer.
Also sparking feedback has been the use of the term "bio-hazard" to describe breast milk. Now, I would not want some lady to spray me with her breast milk, but to call it a "bio-hazard" is a bit of a stretch. I also hope that woman was not planning on nursing her baby, as she was intoxicated. Hey maybe this was her way to pump and dump!

Weight Chart for Breastfed Babies
On average, breastfed babies weigh less than formula fed babies. Most pediatricians use the
formula fed weight chart
as a way to track weight and length, regardless of how the baby is fed.
This can mean that your breastfed baby may be on the lower percentages for his/her age group and still be very healthy. The WHO
(The World Health Organization) has a
breastfed growth standard chart
for babies. This chart puts into account that breastfed babies do tend to grow a bit slower vs formula fed babies. It also shows the average growth pattern, of other babies, from birth on up. So when you are told your child is in the 10 % or less (like we were) try not to panic. Check the WHO and see what it says. Plus, you do not have to supplement, with formula, there are other ways to help your baby rise in the charts. But that will be another post.

Medicines that are Safe and Not Safe
Oh, to pump and dump? Which
medicines are safe
to take? This past weekend I was faced with these questions! I woke up Saturday morning with
Vertigo , my second episode in the past 5 years. But having a 22 month old and nursing my 15 week old...... it seemed like a worst case scenario! Being confined to bed, not even being able to sit up and hearing my 22 month old screaming for mommy just about broke my heart. My dear husband ran to the store, with both babies, and picked up
Bonine , theover the counter medicine our doctor said to get. There was a chance it could dry my supply up....but with my oldest daughter screaming for me, I figured one pill would not damage my supply. One hour later, my husband came to check on me. With tears of defeat I told him I took a pill. His face was of shock as he told me the sad news. This medicine, Bonine, had not been tested with breast milk and it was on the undetermined list! So needless to say I had to pump for the next 24 hours (suggested by my husband's sister in law who is a pharmacist) and dump the 30 ounces I had pumped! (well my husband did the dumping, I just can not pour breast milk down the sink.) The saddest part of this story? The medicine did not even help! The next question... will I take this medicine again? NO WAY! Both Katelyn and I were so happy to nurse again. I think she missed it as much as I did!
