Is voyeurism one of the sicknesses of our age? Peeping Tom

Peeping Tom , Michael Powell’s brilliant psychological thriller about a voyeuristic serial killer was greeted with absolute horror when it first came out in the ’60’s.  It destroyed Powell’s reputation as a  successful director, but attracted a cult following.  It has since been re-evaluated and is now considered a masterpiece because voyeurism is one of the sicknesses of the twentieth century.
Norman Bates in Psycho
The film has been refinanced and re-released by Martin Scorsese.  The main character of the movie, Mark Lewis,  is really a victim.   As a child, he was used as a guinea pig for his father’s psychological experiments in fear and the nervous system. Mark’s father would study his son’s reaction to various stimuli, such as lizards he put on his bed and would film the boy in all sorts of situations, even going as far as recording his son’s reactions as he sat with his mother on her deathbed. He kept his son under constant watch and even wired all the rooms so that he could spy on him. The father’s studies made his reputation as a psychologist.  The trauma of this treatment impels Mark to murder, while he films the reactions of the dying victims.
The film is ostensibly about the tortured relationship between father and son. However, many critics now argue that the underlying theme is the voyeurism of the audience, a theme specially relevant to us today.  The prurient interest of the media and the public today has got out of hand, and this interest is usually more damaging, destructive and harmful than the foibles the public is observing. Why does the public believe it has a right to delve into the private lives of others?  According to Martin Scorsese, this voyeurism is one of the worst sicknesses of our age.
In his book on Hitchcock’s 1958 film
Vertigo ,
Charles Barr
points out that the film’s title sequence and several shots seem to have inspired moments in
Peeping Tom .
The film
Psycho
by Alfred Hitchcock also deals with the subject of voyeurism, but this film was hugely successful from the outset. As Norman Bates in Alfred Hitchcock’s
Psycho , Perkins would give birth to a character that would become a stereotype in cinema, that of the shy, seemingly harmless boy next door who is both a sex pervert and a murderer. Perkins’ greatest role also became a curse. The actor became so identified in the public mind with the knife wielding, cross-dressing, and highly strung Norman that his Hollywood career went into terminal decline.  Antony Perkins seemed to surrender to the power of his alter-ego Norman though.  He said “Norman Bates is me.”

I
would say so yes.
The way people pry into the private lives of others and make judgments when they know next to nothing about anything, IS one of the sicknesses of our
age.

This does sound like a d eeply unpleasant film though.
Too strong a subject for most people.
But Psycho, now you are talking.
Great film.

Do try and see it. Yes it is strong meat, but it is also a genuine masterpiece.
It is inexplicable why people took Psycho to their heart, but rejected Peeping Tom. The only difference I can see is that the latter is entirely in colour.

Thank you so much for your comment, which I appreciate very much.
I agree that the film is a masterpiece, particularly as privacy is such a big issue for the 20th century.

Maybe Psycho hit a nerve with public because of the performance of Antony Perkins.
He is outstanding as Norman Bates.
Also, there is a sort of gruesome black humour in Psycho which makes it more palatable.
I thought Psycho was a great film, it is in my list of top ten movies.

I’m glad someone brought up the point that voyeurism, even thru “innocent” means like media, is CREEPY. It doesn’t matter if the story is about a celebrity or Jack the Janitor. Many people probably don’t understand that it IS wrong so thanks for enlightening.
I would feel much better if Boris did have some kind of security, at least for large events. Bodyguards aren’t always in suits and sunglasses.. sometimes plainclothes, sometimes women.
