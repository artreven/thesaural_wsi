04:32 PM on 09/03/11   # 1 Offline User Info. TJ Wells http://www.frycookonvenus.net Portland, OR Male - 28 Years Old 34,229 Posts New film from the director of
Dogtooth .
This
review really has me excited.
Quote:
"Hollywood might have fashioned a weepie or a thriller out of the same material - and there are echoes here of some of
Hitchcock 's fascination with surrogates, from the Roger Thornhill/George Kaplan of
North by Northwest
to the Madeleine/Carlotta of
Vertigo . But
Alps
is so intriguing because of what it refuses to explain. ... It's also a
film which manages to juggle absurdist comedy with bleak tragedy, a
yearning desire for human warmth with outbreaks of sudden violence, all
the while maintaining an impressive control of tone."
Out October 27.

Definitely. I might not agree with some of his (more negative) reviews, but his positive reviews tend to match my opinion more than most critics. terrycw89 View Public Profile Write on Wall View All Posts in Thread Inside AP.net   Posts: 10,797 Vitals Joined: Dec 2005 Location: PNW Male
