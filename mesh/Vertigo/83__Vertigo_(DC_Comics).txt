justice league
The  Justice League , also called the  Justice League of America  or  JLA , is a  fictional   superhero  team that appears in  comic books  published by  DC Comics .
First appearing in  The Brave and the Bold  #28 (February/March 1960), the Justice League originally appeared with the line-up of  Superman ,  Batman ,  Wonder Woman ,  Flash  (Barry Allen),  Green Lantern  (Hal Jordan), Aquaman , and the  Martian Manhunter . The team roster has been rotated throughout the years with characters such as  Green Arrow ,  Captain Marvel ,  Black Canary ,  the Atom ,  Hawkman ,  Elongated Man ,  Red Tornado ,  Firestorm ,  Zatanna , other Green Lanterns, and dozens of others. The team received its own comic book title in October 1960, when the first issue was published. It would continue to #261 in April 1987, which was the final issue. Throughout the years, various incarnations or subsections of the team have operated as Justice League America,  Justice League Europe ,  Justice League International ,  Justice League Task Force , Justice League Elite , and  Extreme Justice .
Various comic book series featuring the Justice League have remained generally popular with fans since inception and in most incarnations, its roster includes DC's most popular characters. The Justice League concept has also been adapted into various other entertainment media, including the classic Saturday morning  Super Friends   animated series  (1973–1986), an unproduced  Justice League of America  live-action series, and most recently the animated series  Justice League  (2001–2004) and  Justice League Unlimited (2004–2006). A live-action film was in the works in 2008 before being shelved. On June 6, 2012 Warner Bros. announced a new live action  Justice League  film was in development with  Will Beall  hired as screenwriter. [1]
The low sales of the various Justice League spinoff books prompted DC to revamp the League as a single team (all the various branch teams were disbanded) on a single title. A Justice League of America formed in the September 1996  limited series   Justice League: A Midsummer's Nightmare  by  Mark Waid  and  Fabian Nicieza , which reunited the "Original Seven" of the League for the first time since Crisis on Infinite Earths. In 1997, DC Comics launched a new Justice League series titled  JLA , written by  Grant Morrison  with art by Howard Porter  and inker John Dell. [47]
This series, in an attempt at a "back-to-basics" approach, used as its core the team's original seven members (or their successors): Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash ( Wally West ), Green Lantern ( Kyle Rayner ), and the Martian Manhunter. Additionally, the team received a new headquarters, the " Watchtower ", based on the  Moon .  JLA  quickly became DC's best-selling title, [48]  a position it enjoyed off and on for several years. [49]
Morrison introduced the idea of the JLA allegorically representing a  pantheon  of gods, with their different powers and personalities, incorporating such characters as  Zauriel ,  Big Barda ,  Orion ,  Huntress ,  Barbara Gordon  (Oracle),  Steel (John Henry Irons) , and  Plastic Man . He also had temporaries as  Aztek ,  Tomorrow Woman , and  Green Arrow (Connor Hawke) .
Under Morrison, the series pitted the League against a variety of enemies. These included White Martians, renegade angels, a new incarnation of the  Injustice Gang  led by  Lex Luthor , and  the Key . Other foes were the new villain  Prometheus , the existing JLA villain Starro the Conqueror, "The Ultra-Marines", and a futuristic Darkseid . Morrison's run culminated in an arc title "World War III" which involves the  New Gods  preparing the Earth for battle against a creature known as "Maggedon", a super-sentient weapon of mass destruction.
Morrison departed with issue #41, after which the book saw runs by  Mark Waid  and  Joe Kelly . Subsequent to this, the series switched to a series of rotating writers with issue #91 while Kelly (via  JLA  #100) was given a the mini-series  Justice League Elite , which featured Green Arrow, Flash, and several other characters. The new format saw stories by  John Byrne ,  Chuck Austen , and  Kurt Busiek .  Geoff Johns  and  Allan Heinberg would take over the book with #115, which saw a multi-part storyline that dealt with the aftermath of  Identity Crisis , and served as a lead-in to the events of " Infinite Crisis ", as  Superboy-Prime  destroyed the Watchtower at the end of issue #119.  Bob Harras  would ultimately write the book's final storyline ( JLA  #120-125) as Green Arrow struggled in vain to keep the League afloat.
n September 2011, following the conclusion of the  Flashpoint  miniseries, all DC titles were  canceled and relaunched from issue #1 , with DC continuity being rebooted again.  Justice League of America  was relaunched as  Justice League , written by  Geoff Johns  and drawn by  Jim Lee , and was the first of the new titles released, coming out the same day as the final issue of  Flashpoint . [57]  The first six issues-storyline is set five years in the past and features a new origin for the team. [58]  The series then shifted to the present day beginning with issue #7. [59]  After the first 12 issues,  Jim Lee  will be succeeded as artist by  Ivan Reis . [60]
The initial roster of the team consists of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Aquaman, the Flash (Barry Allen), and  Cyborg , [61] [62]  while the  Atom  (Ryan Choi),  Hawkman  (Carter Hall), Firestorm  (Ronnie Raymond),  Green Arrow  (Oliver Queen), Aquaman's wife  Mera ,  Deadman , recently created character  Element Woman , [63]  and  Lady Luck , a revamp of the Golden Age character, are set to join as additional members in the future. [64]
In addition to this series, two other  Justice League -related titles were launched during the same month: a new  Justice League International ; written by  Dan Jurgens  and drawn by  Aaron Lopresti ; [65]  featuring an initial roster of  Batman ,  Booster Gold ,  Rocket Red  (Gavril Ivanovich),  Vixen ,  Green Lantern  (Guy Gardner),  Fire , Ice ,  August General in Iron , [66]  and  Godiva , [ citation needed ]  and  Justice League Dark ; written by  Peter Milligan and drawn by Mikel Janin; featuring an initial roster consisting of  John Constantine ,  Shade, the Changing Man ,  Madame Xanadu ,  Deadman ,  Zatanna , and new character Mindwarp. [67]  In May 2012, DC announced the cancellation of  Justice League International  with issue 12 and an annual. [68]
The cancellation of  Justice League International  will lead into the launch of a new  Justice League of America title. The new Justice League of America will consist of  Steve Trevor ,  Martian Manhunter ,  Green Arrow , Hawkman ,  Catwoman , the new  Green Lantern  (Simon Baz),  Stargirl ,  Katana  and  Vibe . [69]
In a story told in flashback in  Justice League of America  #9 (February 1962), Earth was infiltrated by the Appelaxians . [70]  Competing  alien  warriors were sent to see who could conquer Earth first to determine who will become the new ruler of their home planet. The aliens' attacks drew the attentions of  Superman ,  Batman , Wonder Woman ,  Flash  (Barry Allen),  Green Lantern  (Hal Jordan),  Aquaman , and  Martian Manhunter . While the superheroes individually defeated most of the invaders, the heroes fell prey to a single competitor's attack; only by working together were they able to defeat the competitor. For many years, the heroes heralded this adventure as the event that prompted them to agree to pool resources when confronted with similar menaces.
In  Justice League of America  #144 (July 1977),  Green Arrow  uncovered inconsistencies in the team's records [71]  and extracted admissions from his colleagues that the seven founders had actually formed the League after the Martian Manhunter was rescued from Martian forces by the other six founders, along with several other heroes including  Robin ,  Robotman ,  Congo Bill/Congorilla ,  Rex the Wonder Dog , and even  Lois Lane . Green Lantern participated in this first adventure solely as Hal Jordan, due to the fact that he had yet to become the costumed hero at that time (the biggest inconsistency Arrow found, as they celebrated the earlier incident's date, while recounting only the later one's events). When the group formalized their agreement, they suppressed news of it because of anti-Martian hysteria. Because the heroes had not revealed their identities to each other at the time, they did not realize that Jordan and Green Lantern were one and the same when he turned up in costume during the event described in #9. While most subsequent accounts of the League have made little mention of this first adventure, the animated  Justice League  series adapted this tale as the origin of the Justice League as well.
Secret Origins  (vol. 2) #32 (November 1988) updated  Justice League of America  #9's origin for post- Crisis  continuity. Differences included the inclusion of the original  Black Canary  as a founding member and the absence of Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman. The  JLA: Year One   limited series , by  Mark Waid , Brian Augustyn , and  Barry Kitson , further expanded upon the  Secret Origins  depiction. [72]
In  Justice League Task Force  #16 (Sept. 1994), during  Zero Hour , an unknown superhuman named  Triumph  appeared. Triumph was revealed to have been a founding member of the Justice League and was their leader. On his first mission with the Justice League, Triumph seemingly "saved the world" but was teleported into a dimensional limbo that also affected the timestream, erasing all memory of him.
In  Infinite Crisis  #7 (June 2006), the formation of "New Earth" (the new name for the post- Crisis  Earth) restored Wonder Woman as a founding member of the Justice League. In Brad Meltzer's  Justice League of America  (vol. 2) #0 (September 2006), it was revealed that Superman and Batman were again founding members as well.  52  #51 (June 2007) confirmed that the 1989  Secret Origins  and  JLA: Year One  origins were still in continuity at that time, with Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman joining the team with founding members' status shortly after the group's formation with Aquaman, Black Canary, Flash, Green Lantern, and Martian Manhunter. [73]  In  Justice League of America  #12 (October 2007), the founding members of the Justice League were shown to be Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Flash (Barry Allen), Aquaman, and the Martian Manhunter.
With DC's history rewritten due to the  Flashpoint  limited series, an entirely new origin for the Justice League was introduced in the subsequent  Justice League  series which debuted with an October 2011 cover date as part of the company-wide event, " The New 52 ". Issue #1 portrayed the first meeting between Batman and Hal Jordan, with the two encountering each other during a battle against a  Parademon  in Gotham City. After realizing the creature is extraterrestrial  in origin, the two heroes head to Metropolis to seek out Superman and are attacked by him. [74]  Later, after a brief fight in which the Flash arrives and Batman convinces Superman they are on the same side, they move to an abandoned building to work on analyzing a  mysterious alien box , when it suddenly activates and more Parademons arrive. [75]  While fighting the Parademons,  Aquaman  and  Wonder Woman  appear and join forces with the other heroes. [76]  The mysterious box leads to  Darkseid 's arrival on Earth, and the heroes come together, along with the newcomer  Cyborg , to defeat him. The public are enamoured with the heroes, and a writer dubs the group the 'Justice League', following the Flash's suggestion of 'Super Seven'. [77]

Zatanna
Zatanna Zatara  is a fictional character in the  DC Comics   universe . Created by writer  Gardner Fox  and artist Murphy Anderson , Zatanna first appeared in  Hawkman  vol. 1 #4 (October–November 1964). The character, both a  stage magician  and a real  magician  like her father  Giovanni "John" Zatara , is known for her involvement with the  Justice League , her  retconned  childhood association with  Batman , and her crossing of the  Vertigo  line with characters such as romantic partner  John Constantine  and protégé  Timothy Hunter . She was ranked fourth in  Comics Buyer's Guide 's  "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list. [1]
Zatanna is the daughter of  magician   Giovanni Zatara  (who appeared in  Golden Age  comic books) and Sindella, a member of the mystical  Homo magi  race. Her younger cousin, the teenager  Zachary Zatara , is also a magician in the DCU.
Zatanna makes her living as a stage  illusionist  prior to discovering her magical abilities while investigating the disappearance of her father. Zatanna's search for her father was the subject of a storyline which was featured in several titles edited by  Julius Schwartz  and in it, Zatanna interacts with  Batman  and  Robin  (in disguise as a witch and under the control of the villain  The Outsider ),  Hawkman  and  Hawkwoman  ( Hawkman  Vol. 1, #4, Nov. 1964),  the Atom  ( The Atom #19, May 1965),  Green Lantern  ( Green Lantern Vol. 2, #42, Jan. 1966) and Elongated Man  ( Detective Comics  #355, Sept. 1966). The series culminated in  Justice League of America #51 (Feb. 1967). This Justice League adventure took place during the Batman television craze where Batman was featured prominently on the cover. The premise that the witch in  Detective  #336 was Zatanna was perceived by many fans at the time as an attempt to get Batman participating in this issue of  Justice League of America  no matter how vague the connection to Zatanna's quest was.
Zatanna assists the Justice League of America on a number of cases before being elected to membership in Justice League of America  #161 (Dec. 1978). During her tenure with the group, her power level diminishes, so that she can only control the  four elements  of earth, air, fire, and water; this limitation is reversed in  World's Finest Comics  #277 (Mar. 1982).
In Neil Gaiman's Books of Magic series Zatanna becomes friends and even temporary guardian to Timothy Hunter, a boy destined to become the greatest wizard in the world, and his girlfriend Molly who at the time was cursed by the Queen of the Fairies and unable to touch anything in the human world including the ground. After a brief stay she sent Molly home and Tim wandered off on his own adventures.

The Martian Manhunter
The  Martian Manhunter  ( J'onn J'onzz ) is a  fictional character , a  superhero  that appears in  publications published by  DC Comics . Created by writer  Joseph Samachson  and artist Joe Certa, the character first appeared in  Detective Comics  #225 (Nov. 1955). The character is known for being one of the core members of the  Justice League .
The character of J'onn J'onzz has featured in other DC Comics-endorsed products such as  video games , television series ,  animated films , and merchandise such as  action figures  and  trading cards .
The Martian Manhunter possesses a wide variety of superhuman powers— including telepathy, shape-shifting, projecting energy, x-ray vision, phasing, invisibility, flight, and super strength— but his abilities have been shown inconsistently throughout the years.
In the current DC continuity, many of his powers are similar to those of  Superman , including superhuman strength close to that of Superman, flight, invulnerability, vortex breath, and "Martian Vision" (a term designating both the ability to see through solid objects and the ability to project beams of energy from his eyes). Superman once said of the Manhunter, "He is the most powerful being on the face of the Earth". [55]
During the 1990s, it was stated that the source of his flight and "Martian vision" is a limited form of telekinesis [ volume & issue needed ]  (he had occasionally [ volume & issue needed ]  demonstrated more traditional uses of telekinesis to levitate and animate objects during his  Detective Comics  and  House of Mystery  appearances). His "Martian Vision" energy beams have sometimes been shown to knock foes backwards. [ volume & issue needed ]  On most occasions, however, these energy beams are depicted as heating objects rather than delivering a concussive impact. [ citation needed ]
The Martian Manhunter possesses the power of  shapeshifting , which he employs for various effects (adopting human or monstrous appearance, elongating his limbs, growing to immense size, altering the chemical composition of his body, etc.). His default form during JLA meetings and in public is a "human-friendly" version of his actual birth shape.
J'onn can become intangible, passing harmlessly through solid objects. He can also render himself invisible. He lost the ability to use his other powers while invisible during the Silver Age.
J'onn can become invisible to the naked eye. Until he was stripped of the use of his other powers while invisible J'onn was virtually unknown to the world except as John Jones, detective. He did his heroing while invisible as an unknown "angel" helping those in need.In "The Unmasking of J'onn J'onzz" from Detective Comics #273 where B'rett, a yellow-skinned Martian criminal, lands on Earth he reveals J'onzz's existence to Earth-1's public by using a Martian weapon to take away J'onn's ability to use his powers while he is invisible. Once visible to fight B'rett, J'onn is quickly outed as a Martian hero.
He is a powerful telepath, capable of both perceiving the thoughts of others and of projecting his own thoughts. He often acts as a "switchboard" between minds in order to coordinate the Justice League's actions. The extent of his telepathic abilities is great; several times he has connected his mind to the entire population of Earth [ volume & issue needed ] .
In the  Alex Ross  series  Justice , J'onn's "telepathy" is described in terms provocatively similar to the concept of  grokking  from  Robert A. Heinlein 's  Stranger in a Strange Land . In an internal monologue, the Manhunter says: "Since the first moment I chose this form and set foot on this world, I experienced it in ways no other human could. The humans call it telepathy. But that is only what it is like. There is no human word for how we Martians coexist with others.. We don't read minds. We share in other beings' thoughts."
J'onn is also capable of absorbing energy projectiles such as beams and other energy waves.
He has demonstrated regenerative abilities, once able to regenerate his entire body from only his severed head, but with great strain [56]  (due to the loss of mass, he found it necessary to incorporate new matter from the Martian sand). Early appearances of the character show him as able to breathe underwater; he displayed this power when he encountered  Zauriel  in the sea of  San Francisco  in  JLA  #6. The Manhunter has sometimes been said to possess nine senses, but these additional senses are poorly defined and generally ignored by most writers [ citation needed ] .
Aside from his superhuman powers, the Manhunter is also a skilled and very capable detective. As Batman mentions in his file, "in many ways, Martian Manhunter is like an amalgam of Superman and the Dark Knight himself." [57] [ clarification needed ]
J'onn J'onzz has also demonstrated the ability of generating and manipulating heat or energy beams, waves and blasts, and even absorbing extra mass from the earth to greatly increase his size.

Green Latern
Harold "Hal" Jordan  is a  DC Comics   superhero  known as  Green Lantern , the first human shown to join the Green Lantern Corps  and a founding member of the  Justice League of America . Jordan is the second DC Comics character to adopt the Green Lantern moniker. Jordan was created in the  Silver Age of Comic Books by  John Broome  and  Gil Kane , and made his first appearance in  Showcase  #22 (October 1959) to replace the original Green Lantern  Alan Scott  from the  Golden Age of Comic Books . [1]
In 1994, the story  Emerald Twilight  saw Hal Jordan turn into the  supervillain   Parallax . Later, in the  Zero Hour miniseries, he attempts cosmic genocide. He was replaced by  Kyle Rayner  as the new Green Lantern for the Modern Age of Comic Books . In 1996's crossover story " The Final Night ", he attempted to return to his heroic roots by dying to save the Earth, and later returned as a spirit of redemption in the persona of the  Spectre . Hal Jordan was resurrected in the 2004 miniseries  Green Lantern: Rebirth , which revealed that Parallax was actually an alien parasitic entity that influenced his prior villainy. He subsequently returned to the Green Lantern Corps and became the protagonist of the subsequent volumes of  Green Lantern .
Hal Jordan was ranked 7th on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes in 2011. [2]
After achieving great success in 1956 in reviving the  Golden Age  character  The Flash , DC editor  Julius Schwartz  looked toward recreating the Green Lantern from the  Golden Age of Comic Books . [ citation needed ]  Like The Flash, Schwartz wanted this new character to have a different secret identity, origin, and personality than his 1940s counterpart. A long time  science-fiction  fan and  literary agent , Schwartz wanted a more sci-fi based Green Lantern, as opposed to the mystical powers of  Alan Scott , the forties Green Lantern. He enlisted writer  John Broome  and artist  Gil Kane , who in 1959 would reintroduce Green Lantern to the world in  Showcase  #22  (September–October 1959).
The character was a success, and it was quickly decided to follow-up his three issue run on  Showcase  with a self-titled series.  Green Lantern #1  began in July–August 1960 and would continue until #84 in April–May 1972.
Cover to  Showcase  #22 (October 1959), the first appearance of Hal Jordan. Art by  Gil Kane .
This creative team was responsible for introducing many of the major characters in Hal Jordan's life. First and foremost was  Carol Ferris , Jordan's love interest. She was in charge of Ferris Aircraft, and as such, Hal's boss. While she preferred Green Lantern to Hal Jordan, she took an active role in trying to win him over, even going so far as to propose to him in the old  Leap Year  tradition. Although she gave Jordan some attention, her job and company always came first. Ferris was a strong-willed woman of authority at a time when this was rare, especially in comic books.
Another unique addition to Green Lantern's supporting cast was his best friend,  Tom Kalmaku , who was both Hal's mechanic and the chronicler of his super-hero adventures, after succeeding in working out his identity. An  Inuit (Eskimo) from Alaska, Tom's nickname was "Pie" or "Pieface", in reference to Eskimo Pie ice cream sandwiches. Like "Chop Chop" from the  Blackhawk  comics, this nickname is today understandably viewed as racist and has been downplayed by most modern writers. [ citation needed ]  However, unlike "Chop Chop", Tom was actually a competent and intelligent character with a well-rounded personality, not a stereotypical buffoon. Despite the unfortunate nickname, Tom Kalmaku was among the first minority characters to be portrayed in this manner and broke new ground for mainstream comic books. Tom would later be followed by another trail-blazing minority character,  John Stewart , the first African-American super-hero of the DC Universe.
Jordan's masters, the mysterious  Guardians of the Universe , were physically based on  David Ben-Gurion , the first Prime Minister of Israel , and were developed from an idea Schwartz and Broome had originally conceived years prior in a story featuring  Captain Comet  in  Strange Adventures  #22  (July, 1952) entitled "Guardians of the Clockwork Universe". [3]
Schwartz and company also allowed Jordan to have a family, which was another rare thing at this time in superhero comics. While he didn't have a wife or children of his own, he had many interactions with his two older brothers, Jack, a district attorney, and Jim, a more comical figure. A reporter, Sue Williams, suspected Jim of being Green Lantern due to his appearance and his reputation of being scatterbrained.
Starting in issue #17,  Gardner Fox  joined the book to share writing duties with John Broome. The quartet of Schwartz, Broome, Fox, and Kane remained the core creative team until 1970.
