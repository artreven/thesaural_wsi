New KML features in Earth 6.1
Posted:
Thursday, September 22, 2011
In the
recently released
Google Earth 6.1
we added two new features that will help you annotate line data and improve
KML Tours
that include Street View mode. As a part of Google’s ongoing commitment to innovation within the standard, these were added to the
gx: namespace
using the official extension mechanism for
OGC KML .
Line labels
When Earth 6.0 launched last November we introduced
line styling options
to create more realistic roads that have a
physical width ,
outer coloring , and text labels. Now with Google Earth 6.1 you can also add simple text labels at the midpoint of regular (screen < width >) lines by using the new < gx:labelVisibility > tag in < LineStyle >.
Caption: Labeled line between SFO and LAX airports.
Download the
KML .
Note: To preserve the current, unlabeled appearance of regular lines in existing KML files, we’ve turned off all line labels by default in Google Earth 6.1. Because labels for physical width lines were turned on by default in Earth 6.0, you will now need to explicitly enable
in your LineStyles to display them in Earth 6.1+.
Better Street View experience in Tours
Last November we also introduced < gx:ViewerOptions > in Earth 6.0 so that
KML Tours
can activate the
historical imagery ,
sunlight
and
Street View
modes, allowing you to tell even cooler stories.
Street View mode uses a different
field of view
(FOV) than the regular navigation mode to provide users with a better experience. However, until now this special FOV was not captured while creating Tours in Google Earth. This meant that tour playback couldn’t faithfully reproduce the Street View experience as originally recorded.
To address this issue in Google Earth 6.1 we added the < gx:horizFov > tag to < Camera > and < LookAt >. These values are captured automatically while recording tours in Earth 6.1 but you can also add them directly to your KML.
Caption: Here’s an example of using <gx:horizfov> to create the classic
dolly zoom effect , invented by cameraman Irmin Roberts and used in
Alfred Hitchcock’s
film
Vertigo . Download the KML
here .
Note: Although Cameras and LookAts can also be used to provide a default view for your placemarks, please note that in Google Earth 6.1 custom FOV values are only respected within the < gx:FlyTo > tags in tours.
We hope that these new features will help you create better tours and better annotate your data!
