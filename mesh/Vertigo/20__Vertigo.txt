The Psychology of Fear
What is Acrophobia?
Acrophobia
(from
Greek ,
meaning "summit") is an extreme or irrational
fear
of
heights .
It belongs to a category of
specific
phobias
, called space and motion discomfort that share both
similar etiology and options for treatment.
Acrophobia can be dangerous, as sufferers can experience
a
panic
attack
in a high place and become too agitated to get themselves
down safely. Some acrophobics also suffer from urges to throw themselves
off high places, despite not being suicidal. " Vertigo "
is often used, incorrectly, to describe the fear of heights, but
it is more accurately described as a spinning sensation.
Other names for fear of flying include;
aerophobia ,
aviaphobia ,
aviatophobia
and
aviophobia .
The Psychology of Fear
Fear is a powerful, unpleasant feeling of risk
or danger, either real or imagined. Psychologists such as
John
B. Watson
and
Paul
Ekman
have argued that fear, along with a few other basic
emotions
such as
joy
and
anger ,
is innate in all human beings. Fear is a defensive, survival advantage,
and may have evolved in a variety of organisms. It is usually a
response to a particular
stimulus .
For example, a person may see a spider and experience fear. Fear
serves as
motivation
to escape to safety.
An example of this may be something dangerous &
spontaneous, during this situation the blood goes to big muscles
(like legs) allowing the person to run faster. The body freezes
up instantly allowing the brain to decide if another reaction would
be better (like hiding). In the brain, hormones are released centering
the attention on the threat & looking for the most accurate
reaction.
