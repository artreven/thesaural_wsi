Vertigo
As production on the movie adaptation of the novel
D'entre les morts
began in 1957, behind the scenes a tug-of-war developed between its director,
Alfred Hitchcock , and studio,  Paramount , due to its title. Hitchcock wanted  Vertigo . The studio repeatedly shot it down. They offered a selection of alternatives that included "A Matter of Fact," "Tonight is Ours" and "The Mad Carlotta." Hitchcock refused to budge. Weeks later, on October 24th of 1957, Paramount executive Sam Frey tried one last time to change Hitchcock's mind, and sent him the following list of suggestions.
Yet again, Hitchcock stood firm. Paramount threw in the towel.
