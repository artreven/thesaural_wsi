Janet Jackson: All For You & Make Me – X Factor Performance HERE
For those of you who missed it, watch it here:
Miss Jackson, cracked the whip as usual, it was a nice set too.
Has anyone noticed Janet does not age, she looks the same as she did when she was 20, her face does not age.
I wish the camera people stopped cutting the angles so much we didn’t get to see the choreography as much as we should have but still. Loved it!

Janet Jackson Perfoming Today On X-Factor & At The Jingle Bell Ball
Superstar
Janet Jackson  is set to tear up the stage tonight performing on
X- Factor
and at the
Capital FM’s Jingle Bell Ball.
So far from what my sources have told me she will perform 2 songs on X-Factor, the new single
“Make Me”
and
“All For You”  off of the new greatest hits
“The Best”.
I tried to push for more information, but my friend wants me to be surprised. lol
and
Straight after the
X-Factor
performance she will be going directly to the
Jingle Bell Ball
to close the show with an apparent 30 min performance of
Rhythm Nation, All For You, Again, Escapade, Make Me and What Have You Done For Me Lately . So it’s set to be a hot night, I cannot wait. *Screams*.
*EDIT*: I will post the videos as soon as they are available so keep checking back.

Janet Jackson Readies European Tour For 2010
Pop & RnB Goddess
Janet Jackson
has revealed in an interview with the
The Times
newspaper (UK) that she is planning a European tour in 2010.  It has been over 9 years since Janet has embarked on a European leg, the last time was for
“The Velvet Rope”
tour in 1998. Her last tour
“Rock Witchu”  for 2008’s LP
“Discipline”  was planned to be worldwide but was cancelled due to her coming down with
Vertigo , an illness which could be detrimental for a performer who dances around as much as she does.
As mega Janet fan I’m sure you know I’m screaming right now, really and truly this is what Janet needs I think
f*ck
the US they dont even know good music anymore, all their wrapped up in is whose shaking there
coochie
in a video. Tut!.
Funny enough I’m not too surprised shes taking it over here I’ve noticed a lot of US artists are starting to promote overseas more than their home country, and to be honest it’s better, expand your market, improve your fan base and reach out to people who arent lucky enough to visit your shows in the states.
It’s been way too long since Janet’s rocked this side of the pond we all await her return,  That’s the way love goes.

Effrem J Adams: Janet Jackson – Make Me (Video Remix)
Ok so I never usually post unofficial remixes AT ALL but this one by
Effrem J Adams
is HAUTE!!. Remixing
Janet’s
current video
“Make Me”
with the various DJ mixes of the song it’s given it new life, also the various cuts in the video has really addressed something which I felt the original didn’t, which is  how much of a great dancer Janet is.
Watch all the way too
2:24
it shows the choreography in full which looks great and I’m loving it much more now. I really can’t wait for later tonight when she opens the AMA’s.

Janet Jackson: Make Me – Music Video Premiere
Check out the Music Video Premiere of
Janet’s
New Single
“Make Me”
of the new greatest hits
“Number Ones”
One thing, Janet looks super cute in the video, I’m loving the white outfit with the shoulder embelishments, I feel like that should make an appearance in my wardrobe. I’m also liking the digital effects, reminds me a bit of the scream video. I suppose seeming as the track plays a bit on Michael’s
“Dont Stop Til You Get Enough”
that may have been her mini tribute to him. I wish there was more dancing though, I feel like they kept it very simple, very safe. Even though the song isn’t heavy dance orientated, and this isnt for a new album I still wanted to see Janet break out a bit more like at the VMA’s this year but who knows I’m sure there will be a performance of this in the medley on Sunday so I guess we will see whether choregraphy is amped up for that.
Janet will open the
American Music Awards
This Sunday.
*EDIT*: Is it me or does Janet’s face look like she hasnt aged in 20 years.

Janet Jackson Readies “Make Me” Music Video
Sexy RnB & Pop Goddess
Janet Jackson,
is prepping for the
“Number Ones/The Best”
Cd due out next month. Friends over at  A&M/Interscope Records  have informed me that Janet recently put out a search for her next set of dancers of whom she has already selected, and will be in the music video for
“Make Me”.   Possibly along with a new tour in 2010. The upcoming single is off of the Greatest Hits CD due out on
November 17th .
The Music Video details are as follows:
Song: “Make Me”
Label: A&M/Interscope
Director: Robert Hales
Production co: HSI
Producer: Oualid Mouaness
Exec producer: Coleen Haynes
Commissioner: Kathy Angstadt
Robert Hales
directed
Justin Timberlakes “LoveStoned”
and
Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy”
among with others. So my guess is were looking forward to another creative video from Janet, I’m hoping she gets the break she needs this time. Im even surprised she decided to do a video for the greatest hits release considering she’s already working on a new studio album, So I guess we’ll see how it all unfolds.
Who wants to bet Janet will be on X- Factor sometime in December?

Janet Jackson: Recording “Emotionally Charged” Dance Album.
RnB and Pop Goddess
Janet Jackson  is back and in full swing with her latest studio album which as-of-yet is untitled. The album will be the follow-up to 2008’s Discipline which went straight to No.1 on the Billboard Chart. So far the project has enlisted long time producers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis as execs as well as Rodney Jerkins who produced Janet’s last No.1
“Feedback”
in 2008. Rodney told MTV this Wednesday (Oct 21) that the album will be emotionally driven, with lots of dance tracks as he knows Janet is a dancer at heart,  he also said there will be some mid tempo cuts but hes gonna try and keep the beats hard underneath. Check out the interview below:
“When we caught up with producer Rodney Jerkins on the VMA red carpet in September, he was already hard at work on Janet Jackson’s next studio album. Now the super-producer is opening up a lot more on exactly what fans can expect for Janet’s 11th studio album.
Janet is like my sister now,” Jerkins told MTV News on Wednesday (October 21) at his Los Angeles recording studio. “We definitely have this incredible chemistry, this bond — I think we musically connect, crazily. I knew it — it’s funny ’cause I predicted this. Five years ago, people used to ask me who I wanted to work with, and I was like, ‘Janet Jackson.’ And I was so passionate about that because I’ve always been a fan of her music and what her and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis have done in the past. And I felt like, knowing she wants to try new things, that I feel I can get it and I can deliver it for her,” he said.
DarkChild explained that fans can look forward to an emotionally driven album.
“Since we’ve been working … I feel like the studio has become a second home for her because with the whole situation with Michael [Jackson] happening, and I feel like right now, emotionally, she can come here and let all her feelings out. I got her writing again — she has the pen and the pad in her hand.”
But it’s not just the recent passing of her brother Michael that is fueling the content of Jackson’s album. Fans are going to see a side of Janet that they’ve never seen before, thanks in part to Rodney’s persuasion.
“You gotta understand, she lost her brother. She was in a relationship for seven years that’s over now. There’s things that she told me that I didn’t even realize. You know, certain [things] like self-esteem that I didn’t even realize that she dealt with for years that you know. … She’s working on her book and she’ll deal with that in her book, but also in songs, certain songs we’re dealing with that head on. And sometimes it can be a touchy subject for us to even go into, and I kinda had to persuade her, ‘Let’s just go, let’s talk about that.’ And she’s been doing it, and she’s a pro about it.”
Although Rodney says you can expect some up-tempo dance tracks on the new album, it won’t have the futuristic sound we heard on her last project, 2008’s Discipline.
“It’s funny, ’cause when we just started the project, she was like, ‘I wanna do 10 dance records, all up-tempo to dance. Let’s just go dance,’ ” Jerkins said. The sound is inspired by worldwide influences, from African rhythms to Brazilian and Latin music, and RJ said we can expect features on this album like a Pitbull track that was recorded last week.
“But she hits me today and she says we need to do some mid-tempos as well,” Rodney continued. “And I’m glad for that because there’s a time when you listen to a record that you wanna mellow out and she always gives us those great smoothed-out mellow records. So now that she’s in that zone, it’s like ‘Yes!’ ’cause we can focus on that. But I’m still gonna keep the beats hard underneath ’cause she’s still a dancer at heart.”
Jenkins and Jackson co-produced her recently released single, “Make Me,” which will be included on her greatest-hits’s compilation Number Ones, due in November. A release date has not been announced for her yet-untitled studio album.”
I cannot wait, I feel Janet hasn’t had the right break these last few years, ever since the Superbowl incident things havent been the same for her, even last year  when things were looking so good, new label, new producers, No.1 single and album; but then
LA Reid
the label decided to stop all promotion on that project when Janet didnt want to do as
he  they said. When you think it, an artist of Janet’s caliber and experience does not need to be told what to do, yet alone how to run her career i.e. releasing singles and etc.
Anyway shes rekindled her relationship with MTV aka her tribute to her brother at this years MTV Video Music Awards, which helped give them [MTV] there highest ratings for the show since 2004, she’s got a Greatest Hits out in November, a new studio album in the works, a book due out soon, She’s reprised her role in the Tyler Perry Flick “Why Did I Get Married 2” due out in April, and shes apparently scheduled to appear on this year’s X-Factor during Michael Jackson week. So fingers x’d everything goes well for her this era.
Till the next update
Miss Jackson If Ya Nasty!
