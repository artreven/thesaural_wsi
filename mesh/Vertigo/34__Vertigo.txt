Howl's Moving Castle
Loved the book, can't wait to see the movie! Unfortunately, I was unable to find the DVD at Borders during the weekend.
Was at Borders last Saturday (28 July) with my folks for dinner at Fish & Co.
What are the chances of it being available at other places? If I have time, I should check out HMV. But I've already asked for help in getting the DVD from Australia... Check out the videos below. The movie looks really promising and all reviews I've seen are positive.

It's not my fault...
I can thank my parents for lots of things but not for the following.
My kids can say no thanks to me too. :P The Top 10 Worst Heredity Conditions: 1)
Baldness
- my youngest bro suffers from it 2)
Lactose Intolerance
- I suffer from this and I love cream and cheese too! "The Chinese distaste for milk was thought to be a cultural one, until scientists in the 1960s discovered lactose intolerance in Asians, Africans, and southern Europeans." Wow, I can sue!
And there's a
website
too! And
another website! 3)
Acne
- I remember having very bad zits (more like tiny volcanoes) on my nose during my teenage years. 4)
Having Twins
- none in my family but my maternal cousin Jocelyn has a pair 5)
Heart Diseases
- I think I'm safe... God-willing 6)
Obesity
- Phew!
But I think my sis inherited it, haha "One scientific theory suggests the same genes that helped our ancestors survive famines are now working against people living in places where food is plentiful. Many of today's bulging waistlines have only to do with eating too much of the wrong foods, however." 7)
Bullying
- so my sis has an excuse?
That big, fat meanie... My mother's other daughter wanted me to leave work at 3pm.
Even if I was the boss, I wouldn't leave work early if there's things to be done.
So I msg'd her to go ahead with her plans cos' I was busy.
Her reply: "Bitch".
WTF was that for?
Obviously I am related to one seriously mentally deranged idiot. 8)
Colour Blindness
- thank goodness I don't have this 9)
Breast Cancer
- The cause of most breast cancers is still a mystery.
God forbids any of my family has this! Worldwide, breast cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death (after lung cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, and colon cancer).
Among women worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cancer. 10)
Alcoholism
- Every time I get drunk, I sleep like a log. I hate it cos' I miss out on all the fun.
The only alcoholic beverage I can tipple is snowball which is thankfully too mild to get me intoxicated. "Children of alcoholics are not destined to be alcoholics too. But recent research reports about 50 percent of the risk for alcoholism is genetically determined. The environment accounts for the other risky half. The disease is considered genetically complex, meaning that several genes come into play and they can affect individuals differently." The following may not be hereditary but my parents have them too... My Mom and I have/had
Hyperthyroidism
which is overactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to high levels of thyroid hormones and speeding up of vital body functions. My Dad and I suffer from
Vertigo
- It is the sensation of spinning or swaying while the body is stationary with respect to the earth or surroundings.

Unexpected Deception...
How interesting! Only one publisher (out of 18) spotted the similarity between a submitted manuscript entitled "First Impressions" and " Pride & Prejudice ". Frustrated author David Lassman decided to deliberately plagiarise from 3 of
Jane Austen 's books to see whether, if she were alive today, she would have a hard time getting her works published too. I really admire and am impressed with the assistant editor of
British Publishing company
Jonathan Cape .
Alex Bowler
was the only one who spotted the deception! He truly deserves his job. The others should all get the sack. If Alex Bowler is good-looking, he'd be my dream guy!
But I guess he's probably a middle-aged man.
*sigh* Speaking of deceit... I mentioned in my
last blog how pissed I was when I received my eBay purchase that was stated as coming from the States .
I wouldn't have minded the lie if the item was as described but instead, I got a cheap-looking and flimsy watch.
Argh.
Still can't get over it.
$ down the drain.
Darn...

Learnt something new today...
as always :) What I learnt today was that
Google
is NO longer my number one search engine.
After trying countless & fruitless searches for a catchy tune I heard on the radio this morning, I decided to try
Yahoo
instead... and lo and behold, it was the first result I got! So here's the tune, title and lyrics of the song, no thanks to Google, but many thanks to Yahoo and
iMeem
Happy listening and singing along! :) On The Shelf You took my love and you threw it away,
gave you my heart and you took it that day.
T-t-t-took it away, t-t-t-took it away, mmmm,
and I want it back.
Went for a drive just the other day,
I left my heart and you towed it away.
T-t-t-towed it away, t-t-t-towed it away, and
I want it back.
I'm like a dog without a bone,
I'm like a house that's not a home,
I'm like a watch that nobody wants to wind.
I'm like a lock without a key,
nobody wants to lean on me.
I'm so lonely, lonely without you.
There on the shelf am I, baby.
There on the shelf, am I.
Went to a party 'cause you said you would go.
I sat around but you didn't show.
No, no, no you didn't show, no, no, no you didn't show.
Oh no, oh no.
I ring your house I don't get no reply,
well I don't know why you keep tellin' me lies.
T-t-t-tellin' me lies, t-t-t-tellin' me lies.
Oh, oh, oh.....
I'm like a dog without a bone,
I'm like a house that's not a home.
I'm like a watch that nobody wants to wind.
I'm like a lock without a key,
nobody wants to lean on me.
I'm so lonely, lonely without you.
There on the shelf am I, baby.
There on the shelf am I, baby.
There on the shelf am I, baby.
There on the shelf am I, baby.
There on the shelf am I, baby.... I can't believe the video is available! Happy watching the dorky moves!
Can't understand why the audience was not responding to this great song!
Were they on pills?

Anne of Avonlea
I completed
Anne of Green Gables
last night. What a wonderful book!
I loved it so much that even though I've finished reading the story and I can read it online as well, I bought myself my very own copy.
I was excited to find it in one of the Bras Basah bookshops. Best of all, it cost me only $2 :)
I am looking forward to re-reading the book and will be very happy if my kids read it.
I was fighting tears when I read the chapter where dear old Matthew died of a heart attack. I started on
Anne of Avonlea
(2nd book in the series) this morning. Speaking of Anne, both my daughters are named
Ann . I wanted them to have an "e" like Anne of Green Gables insisted hers was spelled but unfortunately, my hubby forgot to follow my instructions! I have yet to hear from 8 Days regarding my missing prize.
I went all the way to Yio Chu Kang to collect my pathetic hamper only to find one of the prizes (the sunscreen lotion) missing!
I have been waiting to get it in the mail but so far, nothing. However, I did receive something in the mail that I was expecting anticipatedly. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.
Firstly, my eBay purchase is
supposed to be from the States.
When I saw that my envelope was postmarked in Hong Kong, *alarm bells* started ringing!
I opened my package and found a cheap-looking Marie watch inside.
The postage cost only HK$8 which is equivalent to about SG$1.
So the fugger made a $15 profit.
Bloody turd.
He had the gall to ask me for a favourable comment on his eBay page.
That reminds me -
I SHOULD leave a comment ! Never again will I purchase such stuff from eBay.
I will stick to just buying books.
The 3 books I got from eBay arrived from the States and were in great condition. That should teach me.
You get what you pay for I guess.
I accept that I look awful in my $10 haircut.
I should've spent more time and money on it but then again, I hate to waste money on such trivialities...
But I feel that I got conned with the Marie watch because the picture and description led me to think I was getting a beautiful stainless steel watch and not some cheap metal watch that can't even clasp properly.

Anne of Green Gables
I borrowed
Anne of Green Gables
from the school library because it was recommended in my daughter's book list. However, it stayed in the bookshelf untouched for a few weeks because my daughter got the gist of the story from
Wikipedia
instead. Tsk tsk tsk... I popped the book in my bag intending to return it. Fortunately, during the bus ride to school, I decided to skim the book. I love it! I can't put it down. I am currently in
Chapter 15: A Tempest in the School Teapot . I just found out that the girl in the picture is an English actress named
Kim Braden . She gained fame thanks to the popular 1972 made-for-television British mini-series. I think she suits the role because
Anne Shirley
is supposed to be a homely, red-haired freckled girl. I'm happy to see that Kim Braden grew up to be a beautiful lady. I wonder if Anne is supposed to turn out the same way. How nice if she does! The Canadian author,
Lucy Maud Montgomery
said that she based Anne's looks on a photograph of
Evelyn Nesbit . I'm always happy to stumble upon good books, especially those that have series because I have other books to look forward to after finishing one. Speaking of books, I visited the
Salvation Army
Thrift Store at Upper Bukit Timah Road yesterday and walked out with an armful of books that cost me just $8! :) I finally found a
Jean Plaidy
book there, titled
"the Plantagenet Prelude"
but unfortunately I already own that title. I got it anyway. I also found
Ellen Degeneres ' book " My Point... and I Do Have One"
which cost only $2! I bought 2 books that had a NIB stamp on it. This brought back memories because during my secondary school days, I used to hang out at the NIB in Serangoon Gardens to buy/borrow books. Most of my precious Jean Plaidy books were bought from there. One of the books was a Nancy Drew mystery for Kay. I think NIB stood for National Indian Bookstore. I miss that place... Interestingly, when I googled "nib serangoon gardens", it led me to my testimony on the
Serangoon Garden friendster page . I bought another book for Kimmy. It had the
CHIJ Secondary School (Toa Payoh)
Library stamp on it! I also purchased a book by
Terry Pratchett
called " The Carpet People ". I think I tried to read it before but was not hooked. I've decided to give it another go cos' after all, it's only $1 and proceeds go to charity. Oh cool! Just found out that
The Carpet People
was his first novel written in 1971. In the Author's Note of the revised edition, published in 1992 Terry Pratchett wrote: "This book had two authors, and they were both the same person." Update on 17 July 2007: Found

Samsung LCD ~ may it RIP!
My Samsung LCD TV died on Sunday, 08 July 2007 @ 957pm, just before Ugly Betty of all times! I thought it was a problem that could be fixed but after going around Mustafa yesterday evening, I noticed a sign on an LCD TV that said 60,000 hours lifespan. I asked the salesman about what happens when the 60k hours is up, and he described exactly what happened to my TV - it could switch on but there was no image, only beeping sounds. Drats! I can't remember when I bought my TV but it can't be more than 5 years ago. According to calculations (ok, actually
THIS website ), if watching TV was your full-time job, and you did it 24 hours a day, it would take you almost 7 years to wear out your LCD display. But but but... I didn't switch on my TV 24/7 for 7 years!! Only 4... :P So as mentioned earlier, I went to Mustafa yesterday to check out the TVs and they had a Samsung 27" LCD TV that seemed like a good deal for $870. However, I was hesitant because I don't like that my previous LCD TV which cost so much, betrayed me, by dying on me before I could watch Ugly Betty. I almost settled for a $109 no-name brand small TV but my sis advised against it. It was really very small. So we drove to Novena Square and during dinner, we bumped into Vincent and Terence Kesavan. Wish we could've met in more opportune circumstances. The reason they were there was to visit Terence's mom, Marina who was in hospital cos' she was in a coma after suffering a stroke. God bless her and may she get better soon. Auntie Marina happens to be my ex-bf Kevin's mom (i.e. Terence's bro). I wonder how he is holding up... Back to the quest for a new TV... From school, I strolled over to Ten Mile Junction to check out the TVs @ Sheng Siong. Not bad, they had more of the cheaper variety. Cheapest I saw was a small no-brand TV going for $99. But what caught my eye was a
21" flat screen Akira TV going for $189 . I asked the salesman how heavy and bulky the box would be and he recommended I get a similar TV but of the more reputable Samsung brand which costs $80 more but had free delivery. I would have bought a TV there and then if I could've cashed and carried it. If only my sis was in the vicinity so she could give me and my new TV a ride home. I guess I'll have to wait for tomorrow or Friday when my sis comes to the West for some business appointments. In the meantime, I'll have to tape all my fave TV programmes and watch Aja Geum Soon in the living room with mum-in-law, in gulp, Chinese. I prefer watching the show in it's original Korean but beggars can't be choosers...
Happened to google for TVs and came across
http://www.ebay.com.sg/ . One TV is selling for $140 and it's a Sanyo 29"! The set is 3 years old though. Tempting... but then again, I don't need a set that's so big because it's for my bedroom, and according to this
helpful link , since I'm watching about 5 feet or less away from the TV, a 20 to 27-inch display will do. Came across an even better sounding deal... $80 for a 21-inch almost-new Panasonic colour TV. The problem is, payment must be made only via only bank transfer or ATM -
NO COD!
How dodgy is that! My dilemma is... is it worth spending a few hundred $$$s more to get an LCD TV or stick to the cheaper fat-ass TVs... Hooray!!!
This website
has just reconciled me to getting the cheaper CRT TV! "CRT TVs may be bulky, but then you have one of the best pictures you can get from a video display device. The truth is that not even the latest top plasmas can rival conventional cathode ray tube displays for black depth and contrast, while nothing beats a high resolution flat-screen CRT display tube for picture clarity. In particular, today's true flat-screen high-resolution cathode ray tubes are capable of producing crisp, vibrant images of exceptional quality. In addition, the CRT TV is easy to set-up, and will work well in a variety of locations and light conditions. This means that if your screen size requirements fall within the display size limitations of CRT TVs, and if picture quality is of prime importance, then a CRT television may still represent a suitable and ultimately, a more affordable solution than the latest expensive plasmas and LCD TVs." That settles it. Getting a good. old CRT TV!
Update: Got a new 21" Samsung TV from Sheng Siong @ Ten Mile Junction for $269 on Wed, 11 July.
Thanks to my sis and Ow, I managed to bring it back home safe and sound.
Gave them a treat @ Pasta Mania on Thursday evening to thank them.
I actually wanted an Akira 21" TV for just $199 but the stock was only coming in 2 days later.
And I would have to pay for delivery, $30.
So in effect, by getting the Samsung, I was only spending $40 more.
So far so good. Labels:

Curiousity didn't kill this cat...
I'm not a big fan of the Ghost Whisperer. I only watch it now & then. So at the start of Season 2, I was bewildered to see that Melinda's (played by busty
Jennifer Love Hewitt ) best friend Andrea (played by
Aisha Tyler ) was a ghost. I was curious why and how Andrea died and why Aisha left. I got my answer in wikipedia - Andrea died in the plane crash shown in the last episode of Season 1. Apparently, Aisha left the show on her own accord. I'm currently reading Elizabeth based on the movie starring Cate Blanchett but I'm not going to complete the book cos' it's full of historical inaccuracies. How annoying! I am going to recommend to the school library to state this fact otherwise students will read the book thinking it's accurate. The book is boring anyway. I much more enjoyed and prefer reading
Jean Plaidy 's books on Elizabeth and other European royalty. I highly recommend her books.
I would love to own a
complete collection of her books . I just found out that the TV series "Elizabeth I" starring Helen Mirren also contains a historical inaccuracy - the show features a meeting of Elizabeth and Mary, Queen of Scots although the 2 never met in real life! Another show I wondered about was Charmed. I used to enjoy the show but got tired of the ridiculous stories soon after. I was curious to find out when Charmed finally ended - the series ended its run on May 21, 2006 in the US. The only thing I liked about the show that lasted was the closing song by Jay Gruska. Speaking of witches, I had fun thinking of my fave movies that had witches in it: I didn't see the movie version and apparently Roald Dahl hated the happy ending but I loved the book!

Friday's Detour
Today was the deadline for me to collect the Surfs Up hamper I won in the 8 Days contest I joined last week. Total cost of collecting the prize from 8 Days... 1.
20 cents
sms to join the contest 2.
$1.18
bus ride on service 163 from Toa Payoh to MediaCorp Publishings' office @ TechPoint (Ang Mo Kio St 65) which took only 30 minutes! 3.
85 cents
bus ride on service 854 from TechPoint to Yishun Interchange. Could have been cheaper but I missed my stop at Khatib MRT station. 4.
$1.15
bus ride on 171 from Yishun Interchange to Bukit Panjang. Loved the scenic route through Mandai. No tall buildings and best of all, I saw 5 parachutists descending from the sky. 5.
40 cents
bus ride on 190 from Bt Pjg to school. Total :
$3.78 And all that trouble for a movie poster, a t-shirt, lip balm and a key chain. Whoop-dee-doo... :P
Then I realised that I was missing one of the prizes, the sunscreen lotion! I just sent an email to complain about this. Hope they send the missing prize to me cos' I don't want to have to spend almost $4 again just to get to work! Normally, the journey to work costs me only $1.38 on one direct bus 985 or 985W, from the bus stop opposite Trellis Towers (10 minute walk from home) to Teck Whye. When I had my dear old Serow, the journey only cost me about 90 cents cos' every km was about 10 cents of petrol. I don't think I'll get a new bike although I miss the mobility and speed of getting around. I think it's time this gal got herself some 4-wheels. Preferably one that looks like this:

Howl's Moving Castle
Loved the book, can't wait to see the movie! Unfortunately, I was unable to find the DVD at Borders during the weekend.
Was at Borders last Saturday (28 July) with my folks for dinner at Fish & Co.
What are the chances of it being available at other places? If I have time, I should check out HMV. But I've already asked for help in getting the DVD from Australia... Check out the videos below. The movie looks really promising and all reviews I've seen are positive.

It's not my fault...
I can thank my parents for lots of things but not for the following.
My kids can say no thanks to me too. :P The Top 10 Worst Heredity Conditions: 1)
Baldness
- my youngest bro suffers from it 2)
Lactose Intolerance
- I suffer from this and I love cream and cheese too! "The Chinese distaste for milk was thought to be a cultural one, until scientists in the 1960s discovered lactose intolerance in Asians, Africans, and southern Europeans." Wow, I can sue!
And there's a
website
too! And
another website! 3)
Acne
- I remember having very bad zits (more like tiny volcanoes) on my nose during my teenage years. 4)
Having Twins
- none in my family but my maternal cousin Jocelyn has a pair 5)
Heart Diseases
- I think I'm safe... God-willing 6)
Obesity
- Phew!
But I think my sis inherited it, haha "One scientific theory suggests the same genes that helped our ancestors survive famines are now working against people living in places where food is plentiful. Many of today's bulging waistlines have only to do with eating too much of the wrong foods, however." 7)
Bullying
- so my sis has an excuse?
That big, fat meanie... My mother's other daughter wanted me to leave work at 3pm.
Even if I was the boss, I wouldn't leave work early if there's things to be done.
So I msg'd her to go ahead with her plans cos' I was busy.
Her reply: "Bitch".
WTF was that for?
Obviously I am related to one seriously mentally deranged idiot. 8)
Colour Blindness
- thank goodness I don't have this 9)
Breast Cancer
- The cause of most breast cancers is still a mystery.
God forbids any of my family has this! Worldwide, breast cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death (after lung cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, and colon cancer).
Among women worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cancer. 10)
Alcoholism
- Every time I get drunk, I sleep like a log. I hate it cos' I miss out on all the fun.
The only alcoholic beverage I can tipple is snowball which is thankfully too mild to get me intoxicated. "Children of alcoholics are not destined to be alcoholics too. But recent research reports about 50 percent of the risk for alcoholism is genetically determined. The environment accounts for the other risky half. The disease is considered genetically complex, meaning that several genes come into play and they can affect individuals differently." The following may not be hereditary but my parents have them too... My Mom and I have/had
Hyperthyroidism
which is overactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to high levels of thyroid hormones and speeding up of vital body functions. My Dad and I suffer from
Vertigo
- It is the sensation of spinning or swaying while the body is stationary with respect to the earth or surroundings.

Unexpected Deception...
How interesting! Only one publisher (out of 18) spotted the similarity between a submitted manuscript entitled "First Impressions" and " Pride & Prejudice ". Frustrated author David Lassman decided to deliberately plagiarise from 3 of
Jane Austen 's books to see whether, if she were alive today, she would have a hard time getting her works published too. I really admire and am impressed with the assistant editor of
British Publishing company
Jonathan Cape .
Alex Bowler
was the only one who spotted the deception! He truly deserves his job. The others should all get the sack. If Alex Bowler is good-looking, he'd be my dream guy!
But I guess he's probably a middle-aged man.
*sigh* Speaking of deceit... I mentioned in my
last blog how pissed I was when I received my eBay purchase that was stated as coming from the States .
I wouldn't have minded the lie if the item was as described but instead, I got a cheap-looking and flimsy watch.
Argh.
Still can't get over it.
$ down the drain.
Darn...

Learnt something new today...
as always :) What I learnt today was that
Google
is NO longer my number one search engine.
After trying countless & fruitless searches for a catchy tune I heard on the radio this morning, I decided to try
Yahoo
instead... and lo and behold, it was the first result I got! So here's the tune, title and lyrics of the song, no thanks to Google, but many thanks to Yahoo and
iMeem
Happy listening and singing along! :) On The Shelf You took my love and you threw it away,
gave you my heart and you took it that day.
T-t-t-took it away, t-t-t-took it away, mmmm,
and I want it back.
Went for a drive just the other day,
I left my heart and you towed it away.
T-t-t-towed it away, t-t-t-towed it away, and
I want it back.
I'm like a dog without a bone,
I'm like a house that's not a home,
I'm like a watch that nobody wants to wind.
I'm like a lock without a key,
nobody wants to lean on me.
I'm so lonely, lonely without you.
There on the shelf am I, baby.
There on the shelf, am I.
Went to a party 'cause you said you would go.
I sat around but you didn't show.
No, no, no you didn't show, no, no, no you didn't show.
Oh no, oh no.
I ring your house I don't get no reply,
well I don't know why you keep tellin' me lies.
T-t-t-tellin' me lies, t-t-t-tellin' me lies.
Oh, oh, oh.....
I'm like a dog without a bone,
I'm like a house that's not a home.
I'm like a watch that nobody wants to wind.
I'm like a lock without a key,
nobody wants to lean on me.
I'm so lonely, lonely without you.
There on the shelf am I, baby.
There on the shelf am I, baby.
There on the shelf am I, baby.
There on the shelf am I, baby.
There on the shelf am I, baby.... I can't believe the video is available! Happy watching the dorky moves!
Can't understand why the audience was not responding to this great song!
Were they on pills?

Anne of Avonlea
I completed
Anne of Green Gables
last night. What a wonderful book!
I loved it so much that even though I've finished reading the story and I can read it online as well, I bought myself my very own copy.
I was excited to find it in one of the Bras Basah bookshops. Best of all, it cost me only $2 :)
I am looking forward to re-reading the book and will be very happy if my kids read it.
I was fighting tears when I read the chapter where dear old Matthew died of a heart attack. I started on
Anne of Avonlea
(2nd book in the series) this morning. Speaking of Anne, both my daughters are named
Ann . I wanted them to have an "e" like Anne of Green Gables insisted hers was spelled but unfortunately, my hubby forgot to follow my instructions! I have yet to hear from 8 Days regarding my missing prize.
I went all the way to Yio Chu Kang to collect my pathetic hamper only to find one of the prizes (the sunscreen lotion) missing!
I have been waiting to get it in the mail but so far, nothing. However, I did receive something in the mail that I was expecting anticipatedly. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.
Firstly, my eBay purchase is
supposed to be from the States.
When I saw that my envelope was postmarked in Hong Kong, *alarm bells* started ringing!
I opened my package and found a cheap-looking Marie watch inside.
The postage cost only HK$8 which is equivalent to about SG$1.
So the fugger made a $15 profit.
Bloody turd.
He had the gall to ask me for a favourable comment on his eBay page.
That reminds me -
I SHOULD leave a comment ! Never again will I purchase such stuff from eBay.
I will stick to just buying books.
The 3 books I got from eBay arrived from the States and were in great condition. That should teach me.
You get what you pay for I guess.
I accept that I look awful in my $10 haircut.
I should've spent more time and money on it but then again, I hate to waste money on such trivialities...
But I feel that I got conned with the Marie watch because the picture and description led me to think I was getting a beautiful stainless steel watch and not some cheap metal watch that can't even clasp properly.

Anne of Green Gables
I borrowed
Anne of Green Gables
from the school library because it was recommended in my daughter's book list. However, it stayed in the bookshelf untouched for a few weeks because my daughter got the gist of the story from
Wikipedia
instead. Tsk tsk tsk... I popped the book in my bag intending to return it. Fortunately, during the bus ride to school, I decided to skim the book. I love it! I can't put it down. I am currently in
Chapter 15: A Tempest in the School Teapot . I just found out that the girl in the picture is an English actress named
Kim Braden . She gained fame thanks to the popular 1972 made-for-television British mini-series. I think she suits the role because
Anne Shirley
is supposed to be a homely, red-haired freckled girl. I'm happy to see that Kim Braden grew up to be a beautiful lady. I wonder if Anne is supposed to turn out the same way. How nice if she does! The Canadian author,
Lucy Maud Montgomery
said that she based Anne's looks on a photograph of
Evelyn Nesbit . I'm always happy to stumble upon good books, especially those that have series because I have other books to look forward to after finishing one. Speaking of books, I visited the
Salvation Army
Thrift Store at Upper Bukit Timah Road yesterday and walked out with an armful of books that cost me just $8! :) I finally found a
Jean Plaidy
book there, titled
"the Plantagenet Prelude"
but unfortunately I already own that title. I got it anyway. I also found
Ellen Degeneres ' book " My Point... and I Do Have One"
which cost only $2! I bought 2 books that had a NIB stamp on it. This brought back memories because during my secondary school days, I used to hang out at the NIB in Serangoon Gardens to buy/borrow books. Most of my precious Jean Plaidy books were bought from there. One of the books was a Nancy Drew mystery for Kay. I think NIB stood for National Indian Bookstore. I miss that place... Interestingly, when I googled "nib serangoon gardens", it led me to my testimony on the
Serangoon Garden friendster page . I bought another book for Kimmy. It had the
CHIJ Secondary School (Toa Payoh)
Library stamp on it! I also purchased a book by
Terry Pratchett
called " The Carpet People ". I think I tried to read it before but was not hooked. I've decided to give it another go cos' after all, it's only $1 and proceeds go to charity. Oh cool! Just found out that
The Carpet People
was his first novel written in 1971. In the Author's Note of the revised edition, published in 1992 Terry Pratchett wrote: "This book had two authors, and they were both the same person." Update on 17 July 2007: Found

Samsung LCD ~ may it RIP!
My Samsung LCD TV died on Sunday, 08 July 2007 @ 957pm, just before Ugly Betty of all times! I thought it was a problem that could be fixed but after going around Mustafa yesterday evening, I noticed a sign on an LCD TV that said 60,000 hours lifespan. I asked the salesman about what happens when the 60k hours is up, and he described exactly what happened to my TV - it could switch on but there was no image, only beeping sounds. Drats! I can't remember when I bought my TV but it can't be more than 5 years ago. According to calculations (ok, actually
THIS website ), if watching TV was your full-time job, and you did it 24 hours a day, it would take you almost 7 years to wear out your LCD display. But but but... I didn't switch on my TV 24/7 for 7 years!! Only 4... :P So as mentioned earlier, I went to Mustafa yesterday to check out the TVs and they had a Samsung 27" LCD TV that seemed like a good deal for $870. However, I was hesitant because I don't like that my previous LCD TV which cost so much, betrayed me, by dying on me before I could watch Ugly Betty. I almost settled for a $109 no-name brand small TV but my sis advised against it. It was really very small. So we drove to Novena Square and during dinner, we bumped into Vincent and Terence Kesavan. Wish we could've met in more opportune circumstances. The reason they were there was to visit Terence's mom, Marina who was in hospital cos' she was in a coma after suffering a stroke. God bless her and may she get better soon. Auntie Marina happens to be my ex-bf Kevin's mom (i.e. Terence's bro). I wonder how he is holding up... Back to the quest for a new TV... From school, I strolled over to Ten Mile Junction to check out the TVs @ Sheng Siong. Not bad, they had more of the cheaper variety. Cheapest I saw was a small no-brand TV going for $99. But what caught my eye was a
21" flat screen Akira TV going for $189 . I asked the salesman how heavy and bulky the box would be and he recommended I get a similar TV but of the more reputable Samsung brand which costs $80 more but had free delivery. I would have bought a TV there and then if I could've cashed and carried it. If only my sis was in the vicinity so she could give me and my new TV a ride home. I guess I'll have to wait for tomorrow or Friday when my sis comes to the West for some business appointments. In the meantime, I'll have to tape all my fave TV programmes and watch Aja Geum Soon in the living room with mum-in-law, in gulp, Chinese. I prefer watching the show in it's original Korean but beggars can't be choosers...
Happened to google for TVs and came across
http://www.ebay.com.sg/ . One TV is selling for $140 and it's a Sanyo 29"! The set is 3 years old though. Tempting... but then again, I don't need a set that's so big because it's for my bedroom, and according to this
helpful link , since I'm watching about 5 feet or less away from the TV, a 20 to 27-inch display will do. Came across an even better sounding deal... $80 for a 21-inch almost-new Panasonic colour TV. The problem is, payment must be made only via only bank transfer or ATM -
NO COD!
How dodgy is that! My dilemma is... is it worth spending a few hundred $$$s more to get an LCD TV or stick to the cheaper fat-ass TVs... Hooray!!!
This website
has just reconciled me to getting the cheaper CRT TV! "CRT TVs may be bulky, but then you have one of the best pictures you can get from a video display device. The truth is that not even the latest top plasmas can rival conventional cathode ray tube displays for black depth and contrast, while nothing beats a high resolution flat-screen CRT display tube for picture clarity. In particular, today's true flat-screen high-resolution cathode ray tubes are capable of producing crisp, vibrant images of exceptional quality. In addition, the CRT TV is easy to set-up, and will work well in a variety of locations and light conditions. This means that if your screen size requirements fall within the display size limitations of CRT TVs, and if picture quality is of prime importance, then a CRT television may still represent a suitable and ultimately, a more affordable solution than the latest expensive plasmas and LCD TVs." That settles it. Getting a good. old CRT TV!
Update: Got a new 21" Samsung TV from Sheng Siong @ Ten Mile Junction for $269 on Wed, 11 July.
Thanks to my sis and Ow, I managed to bring it back home safe and sound.
Gave them a treat @ Pasta Mania on Thursday evening to thank them.
I actually wanted an Akira 21" TV for just $199 but the stock was only coming in 2 days later.
And I would have to pay for delivery, $30.
So in effect, by getting the Samsung, I was only spending $40 more.
So far so good. Labels:

Curiousity didn't kill this cat...
I'm not a big fan of the Ghost Whisperer. I only watch it now & then. So at the start of Season 2, I was bewildered to see that Melinda's (played by busty
Jennifer Love Hewitt ) best friend Andrea (played by
Aisha Tyler ) was a ghost. I was curious why and how Andrea died and why Aisha left. I got my answer in wikipedia - Andrea died in the plane crash shown in the last episode of Season 1. Apparently, Aisha left the show on her own accord. I'm currently reading Elizabeth based on the movie starring Cate Blanchett but I'm not going to complete the book cos' it's full of historical inaccuracies. How annoying! I am going to recommend to the school library to state this fact otherwise students will read the book thinking it's accurate. The book is boring anyway. I much more enjoyed and prefer reading
Jean Plaidy 's books on Elizabeth and other European royalty. I highly recommend her books.
I would love to own a
complete collection of her books . I just found out that the TV series "Elizabeth I" starring Helen Mirren also contains a historical inaccuracy - the show features a meeting of Elizabeth and Mary, Queen of Scots although the 2 never met in real life! Another show I wondered about was Charmed. I used to enjoy the show but got tired of the ridiculous stories soon after. I was curious to find out when Charmed finally ended - the series ended its run on May 21, 2006 in the US. The only thing I liked about the show that lasted was the closing song by Jay Gruska. Speaking of witches, I had fun thinking of my fave movies that had witches in it: I didn't see the movie version and apparently Roald Dahl hated the happy ending but I loved the book!

Friday's Detour
Today was the deadline for me to collect the Surfs Up hamper I won in the 8 Days contest I joined last week. Total cost of collecting the prize from 8 Days... 1.
20 cents
sms to join the contest 2.
$1.18
bus ride on service 163 from Toa Payoh to MediaCorp Publishings' office @ TechPoint (Ang Mo Kio St 65) which took only 30 minutes! 3.
85 cents
bus ride on service 854 from TechPoint to Yishun Interchange. Could have been cheaper but I missed my stop at Khatib MRT station. 4.
$1.15
bus ride on 171 from Yishun Interchange to Bukit Panjang. Loved the scenic route through Mandai. No tall buildings and best of all, I saw 5 parachutists descending from the sky. 5.
40 cents
bus ride on 190 from Bt Pjg to school. Total :
$3.78 And all that trouble for a movie poster, a t-shirt, lip balm and a key chain. Whoop-dee-doo... :P
Then I realised that I was missing one of the prizes, the sunscreen lotion! I just sent an email to complain about this. Hope they send the missing prize to me cos' I don't want to have to spend almost $4 again just to get to work! Normally, the journey to work costs me only $1.38 on one direct bus 985 or 985W, from the bus stop opposite Trellis Towers (10 minute walk from home) to Teck Whye. When I had my dear old Serow, the journey only cost me about 90 cents cos' every km was about 10 cents of petrol. I don't think I'll get a new bike although I miss the mobility and speed of getting around. I think it's time this gal got herself some 4-wheels. Preferably one that looks like this:
