Biography Edit
Early career Edit
DeMatteis began as a music critic before getting his start in comic books at
DC Comics
in the late 1970s, when he contributed to the company's line of horror comics. He began writing for
Marvel Comics
in 1980 on the tiles
Defenders
and
Spider-Man , and had a lengthy run on
Captain America , paired with penciler
Mike Zeck .
1980s Edit
In 1987, DeMatteis and Zeck re-teamed for the " Kraven's Last Hunt " arc that ran throughout Marvel's then three
Spider-Man
titles. DeMatteis and illustrator
Jon J. Muth
created the graphic novel
Moonshadow , the first fully-painted series in American comics for Marvel's Epic line.
DeMatteis followed this with
Blood: A Tale , a hallucinatory vampire story drawn by
Kent Williams , and the 1986 Dr. Strange graphic novel
Into Shambhala .
Moving back to DC, DeMatteis succeeded
Gerry Conway
as writer of the superhero-team title
Justice League of America . When that series was cancelled in the wake of the company-wide crossover
Crisis on Infinite Earths , DeMatteis stayed through its relaunch as
Justice League International , scripting over the plots of
Keith Giffen .
JLI
took such lesser-known DC characters as Martian Manhunter, Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, Mister Miracle, Captain Atom, and Power Girl and turned the then-current preoccupation with "grim 'n' gritty" superheroes on its head. The lighthearted series emphasized the absurd aspects of people with strange powers, wearing colorful costumes, volunteering to fight evildoers. While the League had its serious side and often faced world-threatening villains, it also featured such characters as the lovably inept G'Nort, the worst Green Lantern in the
Corps ; Mr. Nebula, the interplanetary decorator; the Injustice League, a bunch of bumbling losers; and a flock of homicidal penguins who had been hybridized with piranhas.
1990s Edit
DeMatteis stayed with
JLI
for five years, often scripting its spin-offs, such as a Mister Miracle solo title, or a European branch of the Justice League. Back at Marvel, DeMatteis again succeeded Conway, this time as writer of
The Spectacular Spider-Man
in 1991, taking the series in a grimmer, more psychologically oriented direction. In collaboration with regular artist Sal Buscema, DeMatteis' story arc
The Child Within
featured the return of the Harry Osborn Green Goblin. Spider-Man's battle with the Goblin continued in
The Osborn Legacy
in #189 and came to an end when Harry was killed in
The Best Of Enemies! .
In the mid-1990s, DeMatteis took over from David Michelinie as writer of
The Amazing Spider-Man
for a run that included the apparent death of
Peter Parker 's Aunt May and the beginnings of the "Clone Saga" arc. DeMatteis as well worked on such characters as Doctor Strange,
Daredevil , Man-Thing, and the Silver Surfer.
DeMatteis helped launch DC's mature-audience
Vertigo
imprint, writing the graphic novels
Mercy
and
Farewell, Moonshadow , the miniseries
The Last One , and the 15-issue series
Wikipedia:Seekers Into The Mystery , the story of
a Hollywood screenwriter on a journey of self-discovery and the search for universal truths.
DeMatteis contributed tales of
Superman , Batman, Wonder Woman, and Doctor Fate; redefining the
Spectre , through the character of Hal Jordan, as a spirit of redemption rather than of vengeance; and in 2003, with Giffen, revived the Justice League International for the miniseries
Formerly Known as the Justice League .
The series won Giffen, DeMatteis and artist Kevin Maguire an Eisner Award.
The team followed this with "I Can't Believe It's Not The Justice League" arc in
JLA Classified
and, at Marvel, a five-issue run of
The Defenders .
In 2006, DeMatteis and Giffen began work on two original superhero comedy series,
Hero Squared
and
Planetary Brigade
for Boom! Studios.
21st century Edit
DeMatteis later teamed with veteran artist Mike Ploog to create the CrossGen fantasy comic
Abadazad
(May 2004). The following year, Ploog and DeMatteis announced they were collaborating on a five-issue miniseries,
Stardust Kid , from the Image Comics imprint Desperado Publishing.
The series moved to Boom! Studios in 2006.
