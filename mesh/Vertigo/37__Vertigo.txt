Headache
is symptom of innumerable underlying causes of fatal & non fatal
diseases which are of serious implications in term of cost,
disabilities, mortality, loss of human productivity etc. Migraine is a
type of headache which is crippling & recurrent in nature & does
not lead to permanent disability in majority of cases. However, it
affects young & middle aged productive population of any nation that
leads to interruption in jobs, employment, study, career & works
for concerned persons. Numerous kinds of remedies have been suggested
& tried, but not all got relief. Moreover, patients are being
subjected to unnecessary investigations in hope to clinch exact cause
& to rule out fatal component of diseases.
Here
lies the importance of expert opinions of consultant of repute &
competence who can give you proper, simple yet effective advice &
save you from harassment & harmful effects of medications &
investigations. It is worth trying.

A
headache or
cephalgia is
pain
anywhere in the region of the
head
or
neck . It can be a
symptom
of a number of different conditions of the head and neck. [ 1 ]
The
brain tissue
itself is not sensitive to pain because it lacks
pain receptors .
Rather, the pain is caused by disturbance of the pain-sensitive
structures around the brain. Several areas of the head and neck have
these pain-sensitive structures, which are divided in two categories:
within the
cranium
( blood vessels ,
meninges , and the
cranial nerves ) and outside the cranium (the
periosteum of the skull ,
muscles ,
nerves ,
arteries
and
veins ,
subcutaneous tissues ,
eyes ,
ears ,
sinuses
and
mucous membranes ).
There are a number of different classification systems for headaches. The most well-recognized is that of the
International Headache Society . Treatment of a headache depends on the underlying
etiology
or cause, but commonly involves
analgesics .
Also known as "sexual headaches",
coital cephalalgia is a rare type of severe
headache
that occurs at the base of the
skull
before
orgasm
during sexual activity, including
masturbation . A
pressor response
to exercise has been suggested as a mechanism. [ 1 ]
Epidemiology
During a given year, 90% of people suffer from headaches. Of the ones seen in the
ER , about 1% have a serious underlying problem. [ 21 ]
Primary headaches account for more than 90% of all headache
complaints, and of these, episodic tension-type headache is the most
common. [ 22 ]
It is estimated that women are three folds more prone than men to
suffer from migraines. Also, the prevalence of this particular type of
headache seems to vary depending on the specific area of the world where
one lives. However, migraines appear to be experienced by 12% to 18% of
the population. [ 22 ]
Cluster headaches are thought to be affecting less than 0.5% of the
population, though their prevalence is hard to estimate because they are
often mistaken as a sinusal problem. However, according to the existent
data, cluster headaches are more likely to occur in
men
than
women , given that the condition tends to affect 5 to 8 times more men.
Migraine
(from the Greek words
hemi , meaning half, and
kranion , meaning skull [ 1 ] ) is a debilitating condition characterized by moderate to severe
headaches , and
nausea . It is about three times more common in women than in men. [ 2 ]
The typical migraine headache is unilateral (affecting one half of
the head) and pulsating in nature and lasting from 4 to 72 hours;
symptoms include
nausea ,
vomiting ,
photophobia
(increased sensitivity to light),
phonophobia
(increased sensitivity to sound); the symptoms are generally aggravated by routine activity. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Approximately one-third of people who suffer from migraine headaches perceive an
aura —unusual visual, olfactory, or other sensory experiences that are a sign that the migraine will soon occur. [ 5 ]
Initial treatment is with
analgesics
for the headache, an
antiemetic
for the nausea, and the avoidance of triggering conditions. The cause of migraine headache is
unknown ; the most common theory is a disorder of the
serotonergic
control system. [ citation needed ]
Studies of twins indicate a 60- to 65-percent genetic influence upon their propensity to develop migraine headaches. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
Moreover, fluctuating hormone levels indicate a migraine relation: 75
percent of adult patients are women, although migraine affects
approximately equal numbers of prepubescent boys and girls; propensity
to migraine headache is known to disappear during pregnancy, although in
some women migraines may become more frequent during pregnancy. [ 8 ]
Retinal migraine (also known as
ophthalmic migraine and
ocular migraine) is a retinal disease often accompanied by
migraine
headache
and typically affects only one eye. [ 1 ]
It is caused by an
infarct
or
vascular spasm
in or behind the affected eye.
The terms "retinal migraine" and "ocular migraine" are often confused with an abnormal condition in the brain ( cortical spreading depression ) that may cause similar symptoms such as
scintillating scotoma
affecting vision in both eyes, also associated with migraine headaches.
Retinal migraine is associated with transient monocular visual loss ( scotoma ) in one eye lasting less than one hour. [ 2 ]
During some episodes, the visual loss may occur with no headache and at
other times throbbing headache on the same side of the head as the
visual loss may occur, accompanied by severe light sensitivity and/or
nausea. Visual loss tends to affect the entire monocular visual field of
one eye, not both eyes. [ 3 ]
After each episode, normal vision returns.
It may be difficult to read and dangerous to drive a vehicle while retinal migraine symptoms are present.
Retinal migraine is a different disease than
scintillating scotoma ,
which is a visual anomaly caused by spreading depression in the
occipital cortex, at the back of the brain, not in the eyes nor any
component thereof. [ 4 ]
Unlike retinal migraine, such a scintillating aura affects vision from
both eyes, and sufferers may see flashes of light; zigzagging patterns;
blind spots; and shimmering spots or stars. In contrast, retinal
migraine involves repeated bouts of temporary diminished vision or
blindness in one eye. [ 5 ]
Classification:
The
International Headache Society
(IHS) offers guidelines for the classification and diagnosis of
migraine headaches, in a document called "The International
Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition" (ICHD-2). [ 3 ]
These guidelines constitute arbitrary definitions, and are not supported by scientific data. [ 3 ]
According to ICHD-2, there are seven subclasses of migraines (some of which include further subdivisions):
Migraine without aura , or
common migraine , involves migraine headaches that are not accompanied by an aura (visual disturbance, see below).
Migraine with aura
usually involves migraine headaches
accompanied by an aura. Less commonly, an aura can occur without a
headache, or with a non-migraine headache. Two other varieties are
Familial hemiplegic migraine
and
Sporadic hemiplegic migraine ,
in which a patient has migraines with aura and with accompanying motor
weakness. If a close relative has had the same condition, it is called
"familial", otherwise it is called "sporadic". Another variety is
basilar -type migraine , where a headache and aura are accompanied by
difficulty speaking ,
vertigo ,
ringing in ears , or a number of other brainstem-related symptoms, but not motor weakness.
Childhood periodic syndromes that are commonly precursors of migraine
include
cyclical vomiting
(occasional intense periods of vomiting),
abdominal migraine
(abdominal pain, usually accompanied by nausea), and
benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood
(occasional attacks of vertigo).
Retinal migraine
involves migraine headaches accompanied by visual disturbances or even temporary blindness in one eye.
Complications of migraine
describe migraine headaches and/or
auras that are unusually long or unusually frequent, or associated with a
seizure or brain lesion.
Probable migraine
describes conditions that have some
characteristics of migraines but where there is not enough evidence to
diagnose it as a migraine with certainty (in the prescence of concurrent
medication overuse).
Chronic migraine , according to the American Headache Society [ 9 ]
and the international headache society, [ 10 ]
is a "complication of migraine"s and is a headache fulfilling the
diagnostic criteria for "migraine headache", which occurs for a greater
time interval. Specifically, greater or equal to 15 days/month for
greater than 3 months.
Signs and symptoms
Migraines typically present with recurrent severe
headache
associated with
autonomic
symptoms. [ 11 ]
An
aura
only occurs in a small percentage of people. [ 11 ]
The severity of the pain, duration of the headache, and frequency of attacks is variable. [ 11 ]
A migraine lasting 72 hours is termed
status migrainosus
and can be treated with intravenous
prochlorperazine .
There are four possible phases to a migraine attack. [ 3 ]
They are listed below - not all the phases are necessarily experienced.
Additionally, the phases experienced and the symptoms experienced
during them can vary from one migraine attack to another in the same
person:
The
prodrome , which occurs hours or days before the headache.
The
aura , which immediately precedes the headache.
The
pain
phase, also known as headache phase.
The postdrome.
Prodrome
Prodromal symptoms occur in 40–60% of those with migraines. This phase may consist of altered mood, irritability,
depression
or
euphoria ,
fatigue ,
yawning , excessive sleepiness, craving for certain food (e.g.
chocolate ), stiff muscles (especially in the neck), hot ears, constipation or diarrhea, increased urination, and other visceral symptoms. [ 12 ]
These symptoms usually precede the headache phase of the migraine
attack by several hours or days, and experience teaches the patient or
observant family how to detect that a migraine attack is near.
For the 20–30% [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
of migraine sufferers who experience migraine with aura, this aura
comprises focal neurological phenomena that precede or accompany the
attack. They appear gradually over 5 to 20 minutes and generally last
fewer than 60 minutes. The headache phase of the migraine attack usually
begins within 60 minutes of the end of the aura phase, but it is
sometimes delayed up to several hours, and it can be missing entirely
(see
silent migraine ). The pain may also begin before the aura has completely subsided. Symptoms of migraine aura can be sensory or motor in nature. [ 16 ]
Visual
aura
is the most common of the neurological events and can occur without any
headache. There is a disturbance of vision consisting often of unformed
flashes of white and/or black or rarely of multicolored lights ( photopsia ) or formations of dazzling zigzag lines ( scintillating scotoma ; often arranged like the
battlements
of a castle, hence the alternative terms "fortification spectra" or "teichopsia" [ 17 ] ). Some patients complain of blurred or shimmering or cloudy vision, as though they were looking through thick or
smoked glass , or, in some cases,
tunnel vision
and
hemianopsia .
The
somatosensory
aura of migraine may consist of digitolingual or cheiro-oral
paresthesias ,
a feeling of pins-and-needles experienced in the hand and arm as well
as in the nose-mouth area on the same side. The paresthesia may migrate
up the arm and then extend to involve the face, lips and tongue.
Other symptoms of the aura phase can include auditory, gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, temporary
dysphasia ,
vertigo , tingling or numbness of the face and extremities, and hypersensitivity to touch.
Oliver Sacks 's book
Migraine
describes "migrainous deliria" as a result of such intense migraine
aura that it is indistinguishable from "free-wheeling states of
hallucinosis, illusion, or dreaming."
Visual symptoms of migraine aura
Enhancements reminiscent of a zigzag fort structure
Negative scotoma, loss of awareness of local structures
Positive scotoma, local perception of additional structures
Mostly one-sided loss of perception
[ edit ]
Pain
The typical migraine headache is unilateral, throbbing, and moderate to severe and can be aggravated by physical activity. [ 3 ]
Not all these features are necessary. The pain may be bilateral at the
onset or start on one side and become generalized, and may occur
primarily on one side or alternate sides from one attack to the next.
The onset is usually gradual. The pain peaks and then subsides and
usually lasts 4 to 72 hours in adults and 1 to 48 hours in children. The
frequency of attacks is extremely variable, from a few in a lifetime to
several a week, and the average sufferer experiences one to three
headaches a month. The head pain varies greatly in intensity.
The pain of migraine is invariably accompanied by other features.
Nausea
occurs in almost 90 percent of patients, and vomiting occurs in about
one third of patients. Many patients experience sensory
hyperexcitability manifested by
photophobia ,
phonophobia , and
osmophobia
and seek a dark and quiet room. Blurred vision, delirium, nasal stuffiness, diarrhea,
tinnitus ,
polyuria ,
pallor , or sweating may be noted during the headache phase. There may be localized
edema
of the scalp or face, scalp tenderness, prominence of a vein or artery
in the temple, or stiffness and tenderness of the neck. Impairment of
concentration and mood are common. The extremities tend to feel cold and
moist.
Vertigo
may be experienced; a variation of the typical migraine, called
vestibular migraine , has also been described. Lightheadedness, rather than true vertigo, [ citation needed ]
and a feeling of faintness may occur.
Postdrome
The effects of migraine may persist for some days after the main
headache has ended. Many sufferers report a sore feeling in the area
where the migraine was, and some report impaired thinking for a few days
after the headache has passed. The patient may feel tired or "hungover"
and have head pain, cognitive difficulties, gastrointestinal symptoms,
mood changes, and weakness. [ 18 ]
According to one summary, "Some people feel unusually refreshed or
euphoric after an attack, whereas others note depression and
malaise ." [ 19 ]
Cause
The cause of migraines is unknown. [ 20 ]
Triggers
A minority of migraines may be induced by triggers. [ 11 ]
While many things have been labeled as triggers, the strength and significance of these relationships are uncertain. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]
The most common triggers quoted are stress, hunger, and fatigue; however, these equally contribute to
tension headaches . [ 21 ]
A 2003 review concluded that there was no scientific evidence for an effect of
tyramine
on migraine. [ 23 ]
A 2005
literature review
found that the available information about dietary trigger relies mostly on subjective assessments. [ 24 ]
This is in line with other reviews. A 2009 review found little evidence to corroborate the environmental triggers reported. [ 25 ]
While
monosodium glutamate
(MSG) is frequently reported as a dietary trigger [ 26 ]
evidence does not consistently support this. [ 27 ]
A prospective diary study showed that menstruation had the most
prominent effect, increasing the risk of headache and migraine in
migraineurs by up to 96%. Other factors such as muscle tension in the
neck, psychic tension, tiredness, noise and odours increased the risk by
less then 35 %. Nutrition played no role at all. Days off, relaxation
after stress, a divorced marriage and consumption of beer decreased the
risk.
[ 28 ] . Furthermore, data from the same diary study strongly suggest that weather has little if any effect on headache and migraine.
[ 29 ]
Depolarization
Animation of
cortical spreading depression
It has been theorized that the phenomenon known as
cortical spreading depression , which is associated with the aura of migraine, [ 30 ]
can cause migraines. In
cortical spreading depression ,
neurological activity
is initially activated, then depressed over an area of the
cortex
of the brain. It has been suggested that situation results in the release of
inflammatory
mediators leading to irritation of
cranial nerve
roots, most particularly the
trigeminal nerve ,
which conveys the sensory information for the face and much of the
head. This theory is however speculative, without any supporting
evidence, and there are indeed cogent arguments against it. First, only
about one third of migraineurs experience an aura, and those who do not
experience aura do not have cortical spreading depression. [ citation needed ]
Second, many migraineurs have a prodrome (see above), which occurs up to three days before the aura. [ 12 ]
Vascular
Studies have shown that the aura coincides with constriction of blood vessels in the brain. This may start in the
occipital lobe ,
in the back of the brain, as arteries spasm. The reduced flow of blood
from the occipital lobe triggers the aura that some individuals who have
migraines experience because the visual cortex is in the occipital
area. [ 31 ] [ unreliable source? ]
When the constriction of blood vessels in the brain stops and the aura subsides, the
blood vessels
of the scalp dilate. [ 32 ]
The walls of these blood vessels become permeable and some fluid leaks
out. This leakage is recognized by pain receptors in the
blood vessels
of surrounding tissue. In response, the body supplies the area with
chemicals which cause inflammation. With each heart beat, blood passes
through this sensitive area causing a throb of pain. [ 31 ] [ unreliable source? ]
Although cerebral vasodilation can trigger migraine attacks, blood
vessel diameters return to normal more than an hour before the migraine
headaches occur. [ 33 ]
Serotonin
Serotonin
is a type of neurotransmitter, or "communication chemical" which passes
messages between nerve cells. It helps to control mood, pain sensation,
sexual behaviour, sleep, as well as dilation and constriction of the
blood vessels among other things. Low
serotonin
levels in the brain may lead to a process of constriction and dilation of the blood vessels which trigger a migraine. [ 31 ]
Serotonergic agonists like
triptans , [ 31 ]
LSD
or
psilocin
activate serotonin receptors to stop a migraine attack.
Melanopsin receptor
A
melanopsin -based receptor has been linked to the association between light sensitivity and migraine pain, [ 34 ]
but this is at this stage speculation.
Neural
When certain nerves or an area in the
brain stem
become irritated, a migraine begins. In response to the irritation, the
body releases chemicals which cause inflammation of the blood vessels.
These chemicals cause further irritation of the nerves and blood vessels
and results in pain.
Substance P
is one of the substances released with first irritation. Pain then
increases because substance P aids in sending pain signals to the brain. [ 31 ]
Unifying theory
Both vascular and neural influences cause migraines.
stress triggers changes in the brain
these changes cause serotonin to be released
blood vessels constrict and dilate
chemicals including substance P irritate nerves and blood vessels causing
neurogenic inflammation
and pain [ 31 ]
Pathophysiology
Migraine is a neurovascular disorder. [ 11 ]
Although migraine is thought by some to be a neurological disease, in
the absence of scientific evidence, this remains a hypothesis.
Initiation
Migraines were once thought to be initiated exclusively by problems with
blood vessels , but the vascular changes of migraines are now considered by some to be secondary to brain dysfunction, [ 31 ]
although this concept has not been supported by the evidence. This was
eloquently summed up by Dodick who wrote ‘There is no disputing the role
of the central nervous system in the susceptibility, modulation and
expression of migraine headache and the associated affective, cognitive,
sensory, and neurological symptoms and signs. However to presume that
migraine is always generated from within the central nervous system,
based on the available evidence, is naïve at best and unscientific at
worst.The emerging evidence would suggest that just as alterations in
neuronal activity can lead to downstream effects on the cerebral blood
vessel, so too can changes within endothelial cells or vascular smooth
muscle lead to downstream alterations in neuronal activity. Therefore,
there are likely patients, and/or at least attacks in certain patients,
where primarily vascular mechanisms predominate.' [ 35 ]
Some have even attempted to show that vascular changes are of no importance in migraine, [ 36 ]
[ 37 ]
but this claim is unsubstantiated and has not been supported by
scientific evidence. 'If we swing between vascular and neurogenic views
of migraine, it is probably because both vascular and neurogenic
mechanisms for migraine exist and are important'- J Edmeads [ 38 ]
Pain
Although the initiating factor of migraine remains unknown, there is a
great deal of irrefutable evidence to show that the pain of migraine
(the third phase) [ 3 ]
is in some patients related to painful dilatation of the terminal branches of the
external carotid artery , and in particular its superficial temporal and occipital branches. [ 32 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]
It was previously thought that dilatation of the arteries in the brain
and dura mater was the origin of the vascular pain, but it has now been
shown that these vessels do not dilate during migraine. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]
Because these arteries are relatively superficial, it is easy to
diagnose whether they are the source of the pain. If they are, then they
are also accessible to a form of
migraine surgery
that is being promoted, largely to the efforts of Dr
Elliot Shevel , a South African surgeon, who has reported excellent success using the procedure. [ 46 ]
Pericranial (jaw and neck) muscle tenderness is a common finding in migraine [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ]
It has actually been shown that muscle tenderness is present in 100% of
migraine attacks, so muscle tenderness is the single most common
finding in migraine. [ 50 ]
Tender muscle
trigger points
can be at least part of the cause, and perpetuate most kinds of headaches. [ 51 ] [ unreliable source? ]
Diagnosis
Migraines are underdiagnosed [ 52 ]
and often misdiagnosed. [ 53 ]
The diagnosis of migraine without aura, according to the
International Headache Society , can be made according to the following criteria, the "5, 4, 3, 2, 1 criteria": [ 54 ]
5 or more attacks. For migraine
with
aura, two attacks are sufficient for diagnosis.
4 hours to
3 days in duration.
2 or more of the following:
Unilateral (affecting half the head);
Pulsating;
"Moderate or severe pain intensity";
"Aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity".
1 or more of the following:
"Nausea and/or vomiting";
Sensitivity to both light ( photophobia ) and sound ( phonophobia ).
The mnemonic POUNDing ( Pulsating, duration of 4–72 h Ours,
Unilateral,
Nausea,
Disabling) can help diagnose migraine. If 4 of the 5 criteria are met, then the positive
likelihood ratio
for diagnosing migraine is 24. [ 55 ]
The presence of either disability, nausea or sensitivity, can diagnose migraine with: [ 56 ]
sensitivity
of 81%
specificity
of 75%
Migraine should be
differentiated
from other causes of headaches such as
cluster headaches .
These are extremely painful, unilateral headaches of a piercing
quality. The duration of the common attack is 15 minutes to three hours.
Onset of an attack is rapid, and most often without the preliminary
signs that are characteristic of a migraine. [ citation needed ]
Medical imaging
of the head and neck may be used to rule out secondary causes of headaches. [ 11 ]
Prevention
Main article:
Prevention of migraines
Preventive (also called
prophylactic )
treatment of migraines can be an important component of migraine
management. Such treatments can take many forms, including taking
preventive drugs, migraine surgery, taking nutritional supplements,
lifestyle alterations such as increased exercise, and avoidance of
migraine triggers, .
The goals of preventive therapy are to reduce the frequency,
painfulness, and/or duration of migraines, and to increase the
effectiveness of abortive therapy. [ 57 ]
Another reason to pursue these goals is to avoid medication overuse headache (MOH), otherwise known as
rebound headache . This is a common problem among migraneurs, and can result in chronic daily headache. [ 58 ] [ 59 ]
Many of the preventive treatments are quite effective. Even with a
placebo ,
one-quarter of patients find that their migraine frequency is reduced
by half or more, and actual treatments often far exceed this figure. [ 60 ]
Medication
Preventive migraine drugs are considered
effective
if they reduce the frequency or severity of migraine attacks by 50%. [ 61 ]
The major problem with migraine preventive drugs, apart from their
relative inefficiency, is that unpleasant side effects are common. For
this reason, preventive medication is limited to patients with frequent
or severe headaches. [ 62 ]
There are many medicines available to prevent or reduce frequency,
duration and severity of migraine attacks. They may also prevent
complications of migraine.
Beta blockers
such as
Propranolol ,
atenolol , and
metoprolol ,
calcium channel blockers
such as
amlodipine ,
flunarizine
and
verapamil , the
anticonvulsants
sodium valproate ,
divalproex
gabapentin
and
topiramate
and
tricyclic antidepressants
are some of the commonly used drugs.
Tricyclics have been found to be more effective than
SSRIs . [ 63 ]
Tricyclic
antidepressants
have been long established as efficacious prophylactic treatments. [ 61 ]
These drugs, however, may give rise to undesirable side effects, such
as insomnia, sedation or sexual dysfunction. There is no consistent
evidence that
SSRI
antidepressants are effective for migraine prophylaxis. While
amitryptiline (Elavil) is the only tricyclic to have received FDA
approval for migraine treatment, other tricyclic antidepressants are
believed to act similarly and are widely prescribed, often to find one
with a profile of side-effects that is acceptable to the patient. [ 61 ]
In addition to tricyclics a, the anti-depressant
nefazodone
may also be beneficial in the prophylaxis of migraines due to its antagonistic effects on the 5-HT2A [ 64 ]
and 5-HT2C receptors [ 65 ] [ 66 ]
It has a more favorable side effect profile than
amitriptyline ,
a tricyclic antidepressant commonly used for migraine prophylaxis.
Anti-depressants offer advantages for treating migraine patients with
comorbid depression. [ 61 ]
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) are not approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for treatment of migraines, but have been found to be effective by some practitioners. [ 61 ]
There is some evidence that low-dose
asprin
has benefit for reducing the occurrence of migraines in susceptible individuals. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ]
Surgery
Migraine surgery
is a field that shows a great deal of promise, particularly in those
who suffer more frequent attacks, and in those who have not had an
adequate response to prophylactic medications. Patients often still
experience a poor quality of life despite an aggressive regimen of
pharmacotherapy. [ 71 ]
For these reasons, surgical solutions to migraines have been developed, which have excellent results. [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ]
A major advantage of migraine surgery, is that with the correct
diagnostic techniques, a definite diagnosis can be made before the
surgery is undertaken. Once a positive diagnosis has been made, the
results of surgery are outstanding and provides permanent pain relief,
as well as relief from the associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting,
light sensitivity, and sound sensitivity. Surgical cauterization of the
superficial blood vessels of the scalp (the terminal branches of the
external carotid artery) is only carried out if the clinical examination
has shown that these vessels are indeed a source of pain. It is a safe
and relatively atraumatic procedure that can be performed in a day
facility. [ 85 ]
The value of arterial sugery for migraine treatment is gaining recognition due to the efforts of a South African surgeon, Dr
Elliot Shevel , who has produced a number of papers on the subject.
The removal of muscles or nerves in areas known as " trigger sites " provides good results, but only in patients who respond well to
Botox
injections in specific areas. [ 73 ]
There is also evidence that the correction of a
congenital heart defect , patent foramen ovale (PFO), reduces migraine frequency and severity. [ 86 ]
Recent studies have advised caution though in relation to
PFO
closure for migraines, as insufficient evidence exists to justify this dangerous procedure. [ 87 ] [ 88 ]
Other therapies
A systematic review stated that chiropractic manipulation, physiotherapy, massage and relaxation might be as effective as
propranolol
or
topiramate
in the prevention of
migraine headaches , however the research had some problems with methodology. [ 89 ]
Migraine diary
A migraine diary allows the assessment of headache characteristics,
to differentiate between migraine and tension-type headache and to
record the use and efficacy of acute medication. A diary also helps to
analyse the relation between migraine and menstruation. [ 90 ]
Finally, the diary can help to identify trigger factors. A trigger may occur up to 24 hours prior to the onset of symptoms, [ 11 ]
however the majority of migraines are not caused by identifiable triggers. [ 11 ]
Management
There are three main aspects of treatment: trigger avoidance, acute symptomatic control, and pharmacological prevention. [ 11 ]
Medications are more effective if used earlier in an attack. [ 11 ]
The frequent use of medications may however result in
medication overuse headache
(MOH), in which the headaches become more severe and more frequent. These may occur with
triptans ,
ergotamines , and
analgesics , especially
narcotics
analgesics. [ 3 ]
Analgesics
A number of
analgesics
are effective for treating migraines including:
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs): Ibuprofen provides pain effective pain relief in about half of people. [ 91 ]
Naproxen
can abort about one third of migraine attacks, which was 5% less than the benefit of
sumatriptan . [ 92 ]
A 1000 mg dose of
Aspirin
(also called ASA) could relieve moderate to severe migraine pain, with similar effectiveness to sumatriptan. [ 93 ]
Paracetamol /acetaminophen either alone or in combination with
metaclopramide
is effective for migraines. [ 94 ]
Simple analgesics combined with
caffeine
may help. [ 95 ]
Even by itself, caffeine can be useful during an attack, [ 96 ] [ 97 ]
despite the fact that in general migraine-sufferers are advised to limit their caffeine intake. [ 97 ]
Triptans
Triptans
such as
sumatriptan
are effective for both pain and nausea in up to 75% of people. [ 11 ] [ 98 ]
They come in a number of different forms including oral, injection, nasal spray, and oral dissolving tablets. [ 11 ]
Most side effects are mild such as flushing however rare cases of
myocardial ischemia
have occurred. [ 11 ]
They are non addictive, but may cause medication overuse headaches if used more than 10 days per month. [ 99 ]
Ergotamines
Dihydroergotamine
is an older medication that some find useful. [ 11 ]
They were the primary oral drugs available to abort a migraine prior to
the triptans. They are much less expensive than triptans and continues
to be prescribed for migraines.
Corticosteroids
A single dose of intravenous
dexamethasone ,
when added to standard treatment of a migraine attack, is associated
with a 26% decrease in headache recurrence in the following 72 hours. [ 100 ]
Other
Antiemetics
by mouth may help relieve symptoms of nausea and help prevent vomiting,
which can diminish the effectiveness of orally taken analgesia. In
addition some antiemetics such as
metoclopramide
are
prokinetics
and help gastric emptying which is often impaired during episodes of
migraine. In the UK, there are three combination antiemetic and
analgesic preparations available: MigraMax ( aspirin
with metoclopramide), (paracetamol/codeine for analgesia, with
buclizine
as the antiemetic) and
paracetamol/metoclopramide
(Paramax in UK). [ 101 ]
The earlier these drugs are taken in the attack, the better their effect.
Prognosis
The risk of
stroke
may be increased two- to threefold in migraine sufferers. Young adult sufferers and women using
hormonal contraception
appear to be at particular risk. [ 102 ]
The mechanism of any association is unclear, but chronic abnormalities of cerebral
blood vessel
tone may be involved. Women who experience auras have been found to
have twice the risk of strokes and heart attacks over non-aura migraine
sufferers and women who do not have migraines. [ 102 ] [ 103 ]
(Note: Women who experience auras and also take oral contraceptives have an even higher risk of stroke). [ 104 ]
Migraine sufferers seem to be at risk for both thrombotic and hemorrhagic stroke as well as
transient ischemic attacks . [ 105 ]
Death from cardiovascular causes was higher in people with migraine with aura in a
Women's Health Initiative
study, but more research is needed to confirm this. [ 103 ] [ 106 ]

Incidence of migraine by age and sex
Worldwide migraines affect more than 10% of people. [ 20 ]
In the United States approximately 6% of men and 18% of women get a
migraine in a given year with a lifetime risk of about 18% and 43%
respectively. [ 11 ]
In Europe migraines affect 12–28% of people at some point in their lives. [ 2 ]
Based on the results of a number of studies, one year prevalence of
migraine ranges from 6–15% in adult men and from 14–35% in adult women. [ 2 ]
These figures vary substantially with age: approximately 4–5% of
children aged under 12 suffer from migraine, with little apparent
difference between boys and girls. [ 107 ]
There is then a rapid growth in incidence amongst girls occurring after puberty, [ 108 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ]
which continues throughout early adult life. [ 111 ]
By early middle age, around 25% of women experience a migraine at least once a year, compared with fewer than 10% of men. [ 2 ] [ 112 ]
After menopause, attacks in women tend to decline dramatically, so that
in the over 70s there are approximately equal numbers of male and
female sufferers, with prevalence returning to around 5%. [ 2 ] [ 112 ]
At all ages, migraine without aura is more common than migraine with aura, with a ratio of between 1.5:1 and 2:1. [ 113 ] [ 114 ]
Incidence figures show that the excess of migraine seen in women of reproductive age is mainly due to migraine without aura. [ 113 ]
Thus in pre-pubertal and post-menopausal populations, migraine with aura is somewhat more common than amongst 15–50 year olds. [ 111 ] [ 115 ]
There is a strong relationship between age, sex and type of migraine. [ 116 ]
Studies in Asia and South America suggest that the rates there are relatively low, [ 117 ] [ 118 ]
but they do not fall outside the range of values seen in European and North American studies. [ 2 ] [ 112 ]
The incidence of migraine is related to the incidence of
epilepsy
in families, with migraine twice as prevalent in family members of
epilepsy sufferers, and more common in epilepsy sufferers themselves. [ 119 ]
History
The Head Ache . George Cruikshank ( 1819 )
Trepanation , the deliberate and (usually) non-fatal drilling of holes into a skull, was practiced 9,000 years ago and earlier. [ 120 ]
Some scholars have (controversially) speculated that this drastic
procedure might have been a migraine treatment, based on cave paintings [ 121 ]
and on the fact that trepanation
was
a historical migraine treatment in 17th-century Europe. [ 120 ] [ 122 ]
An early written description consistent with migraines is contained in the
Ebers papyrus , written around 1200 BC in ancient Egypt. [ 120 ]
In 400 BC
Hippocrates
described the visual
aura
that can precede the migraine headache and the relief which can occur through vomiting.
Aretaeus
of
Cappadocia
is credited as the "discoverer" of migraines because of his second
century description of the symptoms of a unilateral headache associated
with vomiting, with headache-free intervals in between attacks.
Galenus
of Pergamon used the term "hemicrania" (half-head), from which the word
"migraine" was derived. He thought there was a connection between the
stomach
and the brain because of the nausea and vomiting that often accompany
an attack. For relief of migraine, Andalusian-born physician
Abulcasis ,
also known as Abu El Qasim, suggested application of a hot iron to the
head or insertion of garlic into an incision made in the temple.
In the
Middle Ages
migraine was recognized as a discrete medical disorder with treatment ranging from hot irons to
bloodletting
and even witchcraft [ citation needed ] . Followers of Galenus explained migraine as caused by aggressive
yellow bile . Ebn Sina ( Avicenna )
described migraine in his textbook "El Qanoon fel teb" as "... small
movements, drinking and eating, and sounds provoke the pain... the
patient cannot tolerate the sound of speaking and light. He would like
to rest in darkness alone." Abu Bakr Mohamed Ibn Zakariya Râzi noted the
association of headache with different events in the lives of women,
"...And such a headache may be observed after delivery and
abortion
or during
menopause
and
dysmenorrhea ."
In
Bibliotheca Anatomica, Medic, Chirurgica , published in
London
in 1712, five major types of headaches are described, including the
"Megrim", recognizable as classic migraine. The term "Classic migraine"
is no longer used, and has been replaced by the term "Migraine with
aura" [ 3 ]
Graham and
Wolff
(1938) published their paper advocating
ergotamine
tartrate for relieving migraine. Later in the 20th century,
Harold Wolff
(1950) developed the experimental approach to the study of headache and
elaborated the vascular theory of migraine, which has come under attack
as the pendulum again swings to the neurogenic theory. Recently
however, there has been renewed interest in Wolff's vascular theory of
migraine led by
Elliot Shevel ,
a South African headache specialist, who has published a number of
articles providing compelling evidence that Wolff was in fact correct. [ 46 ] [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 40 ]
Society and culture
Economic impact
Chronic migraine attacks are a significant source of both medical
costs and lost productivity. It has been estimated to be the most costly
neurological disorder in the European Community, costing more than €27
billion per year. [ 125 ]
Medical costs per migraine sufferer (mostly physician and emergency room visits) averaged $107
USD
over six months in one 1988 study, [ citation needed ]
with total costs including lost productivity averaging $313. Annual
employer cost of lost productivity due to migraines was estimated at
$3,309 per sufferer. Total medical costs associated with migraines in
the United States amounted to one billion dollars in 1994, in addition
to lost productivity estimated at thirteen to seventeen billion dollars
per year. Employers may benefit from educating themselves on the effects
of migraines in order to facilitate a better understanding in the
workplace. The workplace model of 9–5, 5 days a week may not be viable
for a migraine sufferer. With education and understanding an employer
could compromise with an employee to create a workable solution for
both. [ citation needed ]
Research
Merck Corp
is developing a new drug called Telcagepant which is intended to relieve pain without causing
vasoconstriction
(narrowing of blood vessels) as current medications such as triptans
do. Telcagepant would be a safe therapy for migraine suffers with risk
factors for cardiovascular disease. [ 126 ]
Recently it has been found that
calcitonin gene related peptides
(CGRPs) play a role in the pathogenesis of the pain associated with migraine as triptans also decrease its release and action.
CGRP receptor antagonists
such as
olcegepant
and
telcagepant
are being investigated both in vitro and in clinical studies for the treatment of migraine. [ 127 ]
In 2010, scientists identified a genetic defect linked to migraines which could provide a target for new drug treatments. [ 128 ]
