fun b-day: friends & Magpies
Standard
This past Sat. was my b-day.
Like, my actual birth day, not just the day I celebrated it.
It’s actually the 1st birthday I’ve had since 2005!
I know that may seem hard to believe, but it was.
Don’t think about that anymore.
That’s not important.
What is imp, is that I had a fabuloso time.
(that’s just like fabulous, but in Italian stilettos)
So, on Sat, I woke up & just chilled.
Had some yummy hazelnut coffee on the back deck & just
watched the sky.
Oh, here’s the thing… every year, on May 17th, it is
bee-u-ti-full .
Gorgeous.
70 degrees & sunshine.
Every May 17th.
W/out fail.
So, obviously, I was really bummed out on Fri when I heard we were gonna have rain & 60 degrees all weekend.
They said Sat would be rain, t-storms, & more rain.
(I think I may have said “Stupid Global Warming” at least once an hour on Friday)
But all for naught, b/c it was 73 & sunny, just like God intended it to be every May 17th.
Big ups to the G-o-d!
Mad props at cha, baby!
Ok, maybe that last part was a lil wrong.
But if you can’t be blasphemous on your birthday, then just when is it appropriate?
So, the gals & I went to
D’Vine
for din & drinks.
I have felt that I really haven’t had any “just girls” time in a while, & it was almost detoxing to be able to have that time w/ them!
I also got to meet one of my blog-friends in real life, so that was really cool!
I had “discovered”
Gennifer
sometime in like 2006.
We both were reading the same political satire blog; there was some Cleveland-related post & when commenting, I noticed there was a like-minded Clevelander on there.
Anyway, she came out & she is as cool, witty & charming in person as on her blog!
We’ve been blog-friends ever since!
Then, we went on to see
the Magpies
play at one of my favorite places.
They were so much fun, & I don’t know if it was just me, but I think it was prob the best performance I’d seen from them this past year!!!
They were really into the music.
And it was super-cool of them to wish me a happy birthday & play a song for me.
But then again, I’ve been to every single one of their shows (except the weekend of my sister’s wedding) for a long,
looong
time.
And my bff & I always bring at least another 10 ppl, who now love the band too!
*sidenote:
you may remember me talking about
the Whiskeyhounds
back in the day.
The Whiskeyhounds are now the Magpies.
You know, like how Puffy is now Diddy.
Just like that.
Oh, & one more thing…
The Magpies were on NPR recently on Around Noon .
If you click on that link, it’ll take you to their interview.
You can ff to around 31 minutes, that’s where their part starts.

killin any chance of me on Amer. Idol
Standard
Ok, so… not exactly thrilled about this one.
But here’s another Conversations in Real life involving my dad.
Let me 1st say that I haven’t been completely there this past week.
Starting last Tues, I’ve been super-spinny.
Yeah, that’s not exactly a technical term, eh?
Well, I’ve been so dizzy that I actually got out of bed last Tues, & just fell to the ground!!!
Like, couldn’t even stand up.
It was like Bambi, but on an acid trip.
The whole room just spinning around.
That was all day last Tues.
I didn’t go to work that day or the next (last Wed.).
Then, Thursday, I kinda
had
to go to work, so I did.
But I called my ppl (uh, that’s
Kaiser , they have these 24-hour advice nurses to take calls) to see what they thought.
They wanted me to come in to get looked at.
Of course they did; that’s their racket, ya know?!
They just wanna get you through the door, just like every other corporation.
I told them “no way, no how!”
My sister was having a HUMONGO party on Sat in Detroit, & there was no way I was missing it.
The advice-nurse kept insisting, saying it would only be a quick 30-min diagnosis.
They thought I prob had
Vertigo .
I explained to her that the last time they told me to come in for a quick 30-min diagnosis (for a
migraine ), I ended up getting admitted for 5 days (for
viral meningitis ).
So, I wasn’t coming in until I got back from this party, & we could set up an appointment for next week.
Which we did, & I went to it yesterday, & I do have Vertigo, & they gave me a prescription.
And as I’m typing this, I am SOOOO dizzy & light-headed; & feel like I should go lay down.
Ok, back to the post.
When I’m not feeling well, I like to stay at my mom’s house.
Yes, clichéd.
But that’s me.
My mom treats me well, & I can watch
Ellen
with her during the day.
So, to set the scene, I was at my parent’s last night watching
American Idol .
And they were naming all the things the American Idol winner gets.
Pappa:
Whoa, If only D could sing!
Then, we could put her up in American Idol & she could try to win it.
It’s too bad she isn’t that talented.
My mom:
It doesn’t matter anyway, she could NEVER go to American Idol, even if she could sing!
Pappa:
Why not?
Ma:
Cause she’s way too old.
They have an age limit to that, you know.
Pappa:
Oh.
Uh…. WAHAT!!
I’m sitting
right here
ppl!
While they’re discussing my inability to sing & how old I’ve become.
So, long story coming to an end (can’t really say “long story, short”, eh?), I’m sleeping at my own house tonight.
For the 1st time in over a week.

heehee…. he said huckleberry
Standard
Now for another installment of conversations in real-life:
My dad talkin to my sister on speaker-phone w/ my mom & me.
He’s trying to describe an actress to her.
pappa:
She looks like that woman… you know… from the James Bond movie…… Huckleberry.
my sis:
huh?
Huckleberry?
mom:
HALLE BERRY!!!
hee hee.
Yeah, not much, but it kinda cracked me up.
Cause we all know
my history w/ Halle Berry .

Batman vs. The Dark Knight
Standard
Whoa…. have you guys seen this?
My girl emailed it to me earlier this week, but of course I can’t watch video at work, so I just saw it now.
It’s the Trailer from Batman ’89 playin simultaneously w/ the new Dark Knight Trailer.
Pretty cool…. although it could just be that I can’t get enough Batman stuff.
I CANNOT WAIT for this movie to come out!

me & my cultured self
Standard
Ah, yes…. What have I been up to?
Well, being the east-sider that I am now, last week I went to an orchestra concert AND the opera.
Yeah, ya heard me.
The orch concert was amazing; there’s nothing quite like hearing a full orchestra live in
a great hall .
That was Wed night.
Then, Sat night, I went to see
La Bohème
at
Playhouse Square
downtown.
Just us gals went; there were supposed to be 6 ladies, but 2 had to back out.
By the time the lights went up for the 2nd intermission, I was just
bawling .
We had to go out to get tissues b/c 2 of us were just in tears.
Thank goodness for waterproof mascara, no?
Tomorrow night, one of my fabulous friends arranged for all of us to go see
John Caparulo
at
Playhouse Square .
My friends are really the best!
We are going to be in the 2nd row for a show that’s being taped to dvd for Comedy Central?!?!!?
Are you kiddin me?
I just love my friends.
Not for that, per se, but b/c they really are great.
I’ve been a Ms. Cranky-Pissy-pants lately, & they’ve dealt with me accordingly.
I’m also excited that we’re going to
Bricco
before the show.
They just opened it up here, across the street from Playhouse Square, & I was there just last Sat after the girls & I left the opera.
It’s totally fab, so I can’t wait!
