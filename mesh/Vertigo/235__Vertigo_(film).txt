Going Upstream to Download - Shane Carruth Is A New Color
Everyone is trying to figure out how to make money with movies on the internet and most are scared. But there's one filmmaker who not only has no fear, but is trying to upend it all by himself. Shane Carruth got his start in 2004 with
Primer , a film about time travel, that was the smartest thing I've seen on the subject since
La Jetée
released in the sixties. The films shared the disorientation of jumping between one's own past and future, experiencing and re-experiencing your own memories and sometimes changing them. But even more astonishing was the high level of cinematic accomplishment for a freshman project, with an artistic look and sensibility fully formed from the start. Carruth claims he did the whole thing on less than $10,000. Successful movies with especially low budgets grab attention not only for a great business success story, but also because making movies have always been expensive, and hearing about someone getting away with it for close to free means not only greater artistic freedom, but also lowers the barrier to who can do them. It's a sign of hope. In recent years, the possibility of making a movie has grown because of digital cameras that keep going down in price and rise in image quality. Close to anyone can do it with buying a higher priced SLR, and some postproduction software. But the trick is still getting people to see it.
The delivery to a bigger audience is locked up between demands of theater owners, movie studios, and cable operators. It's a mess that is getting in the way of the downloadable convenience we all want. It's a battle for money, with the belief that if it gets on the internet, all will be lost. Enter
Upstream Color , Carruth's second feature now out. How he made the movie, is a
story
of an auteur wanting a final cut and the studios not giving it, then
making it anyway
with little money and big ambition. But what is more astonishing, and the reason I'm writing this post, is that Carruth took it upon
himself to distribute the picture
after being frustrated with the options presented him. He's released on a limited scale in theaters but has opened wide
across all other platforms . He's done a big fuck you to how it's done. He's able to take the risk because the cost of
Upstream Color
is so low - many other low budget films couldn't stick their necks out this far. But it's an example of the possibilities digital can provide to filmmakers both artistically and financially that wasn't available before and a challenge to the view by
Steven Soderbergh on the state of cinema
and why he's retiring from it. So with all the current anxiety about movies dying in the face of technology, it's a surprise to me this hasn't been covered more in the mainstream press. Especially in movie publications and blogs. The only ones really following this story are from tech sites such as Wired and the Verge. When asked if what he's doing will replace the current distribution model, Carruth is unassuming and not crusading for a new order. He's just trying to get people to see his movie as best he can.
"Like put it on 1,000 screens or something? It’s tough. A movie like it could. Eventually, I think. I really don’t know."
Eventually.

Star Wars Made Me Love the Movies, Roger Ebert Made Me Love Films
Star Wars
made me love the movies, Roger Ebert made me love films. I was 12 when I discovered Sneak Previews on PBS and easily followed Siskel and Ebert sneaking up the stairs to the balcony of an empty theater and watching clips of premieres that week before telling us what they thought of them. It mimicked backyard talk with my friends about our favorite flicks. What was startling, was watching two adults take the movies as seriously as I did. And it was a type of voyeurism, as they talked about experiences in life bigger than my childhood provincialism. They made me realize the movies were more than an entertainment. As Ebert underscored many times, they were
films . Film. At the time, that felt like a description of what the movies were printed on. But it was Ebert that championed it as something more. He inspired me to search out more writing on the subject: Pauline Kael, Dave Kehr, Janet Maslin, and Vincent Canby came a reading. Eventually, I outgrew the two TV critics and their simple thumbs up or down fatalism. Kael's reviews became the more dog-eared pages in my library versus the snippets collected in Roger Ebert's
Video Home Companion
(the spine well cracked). Siskel and Ebert became popular opinion, and I was looking in the idiosyncratic corners for the next tastemakers. But as years progressed, I came back to him, especially to read his entries in the
Great Movies
series where his writing reconfirmed his talent in its clarity of praise. Reading them was like a clean glass of water compared to the muddy politically correctness and bully arguments of the nineties. And now he's gone. I never paid much attention to his writings of the last decade, a fecund period amongst the sad decline of his health. He had already made his impact on my life. RIP. Note:
The best eulogy of his work is by
David Carr
who praises him not just as being a critic but being an empire builder.

Ergo, Argo, and the Future
2012 was a bounty of interesting movies to see, but the writing on the year's Oscars is very boring. Good movies usually fuel critical writing on appraisals of their filmmaking and broader trends to look out for, but not this year. Maybe the reason is there doesn't seem to be a close race, with most of the odds on
Argo
taking the big prize. The only critical interest I found in this year's Oscar coverage was at the roundtable of
Charlie Rose
where David Denby's new book "Do the Movies Have a Future?" was answered by A.O. Scott, Dana Stevens, and Annette Insdorf with unanimous approval.
So far, I've only seen 2 of the 9 nominations this year.
Lincoln
had a
trailer that looked heavy in history, which made watching the film a weight lifting surprise in how the fat of biography was burned off and replaced with a swiftness on political process. No matter how many accolades were written across the trailer of
Beasts of the Southern Wild , it still couldn't hide how empty headed the visual artistry was to any meaningful storytelling. Ergo, with my provincial knowledge, below are my guesses at what we'll be talking about this Monday morning.
Will Win
Best Picture		Argo
Best Director		Steven Spielberg
Best Actor		Daniel-Day Lewis
Best Actress		Jennifer Lawrence
Best Supp. Actor	Alan Arkin
Best Supp. Actress	Anne Hathaway
Best Animation Film	Brave
Should Win
Best Picture		Amour
Best Director		Michael Haneke
Best Actor		Joaquin Phoenix
Best Actress		Emmanuelle Riva
Best Supp. Actor	Philip Seymour Hoffman
Best Supp. Actress	Amy Adams
Best Animation Film	Wreck-it Ralph
Update:
I had more fun reading about the Oscars the day after from
Anthony Lane
and
David Denby
at the New Yorker, than watching them at at home. I think it was one of the worst in many years. Tina and Amy next year. Please.

What Do You Do?
At the end of 2011, this blog recommended 30 Must Sees - an exceptional year of good trailers that showed promise to go to the movies in 2012. By April, Hollywood had released a hit ( The Hunger Games ) and a flop ( John Carter ), but I was still
predicting
a solid year. How did 2012 end? Pretty good, thank you. Hollywood reversed a slide not only in revenue, but most importantly in
attendance . But even better, was the
quality , which confirmed the early data from this blog. Like last year with
Tree of Life , one trailer stood out from the rest. Observing the searching hedonism of WWII veteran Joaquin Phoenix made you want to know what he was looking for. When Phoenix was asked what made him tick, he could never give a straight answer. When he bumps into Philip Seymour Hoffman and asks "What do you do?" Hoffman's giant answer gave away his occupational title to
The Master , Paul Thomas Anderson's portrait of two Americans that examined the mysterious bond between them with a complexity and depth seen more often in the pages of literature. More remarkable was the series of trailers for the 70mm release; beguiling clips from the movie that gave me a Pavlovian sweat, only to find out when watching the movie that many of them were outtakes. All of this was presented on a dead simple
website
with no credits, showtimes, or crashes.
2012 was another year of great transition for the world and for me. Follows are the movies that made it pass with less bumps. The Grey
- First trailer reviewed, one of the last to see, and one of my faves in 2012. Lean, meaningful story about life's highest stakes. The Hunger Games
- Better than expected story of survival. Prometheus
- Fassbender being an android cinephile of
Lawrence of Arabia
on a long flight in space was visual poetry - on par with the allusions of
Blade Runner . The rest of the movie was frustrating prose. John Carter
- There were glimmers of pulpy fun, but too much money washed out the storytelling ambitions of Andrew Stanton and Michael Chabon to make a movie of the best book covers ever put on a shelf. The Dark Knight Rises
- When Robin storms the Batcave and the platform rises underneath him, my heart swelled. Wreck-It Ralph
- Kept chuckling every time I saw the jerky motions of Ralph's neighbors skipping through space in 8-bit time. Margin Call
- Wall Street losing money has been told over and over in docs, but this fictional drama made the greed real. Beginners
- Christopher Plummer's confession of sacrificing one life for another made this father/son story memorable. Midnight in Paris
- Thought I was sitting in high school forced to watch this from an overzealous English teacher. Moneyball
- Excellent sports movie about losing. Brighton Rock
- Gorgeous British film noir drenched in a sadness to admire. Rise of the Planet of the Apes
- Like J.J. Abrams's successful
Star Trek
reboot, this celebrated the radical sixties/seventies series roots. The Debt
- Missed opportunity for a great cast. Drive
- B+ movie Contagion
- Effective zombie apocalypse without the walking dead. Take Shelter
- Ominous ending about never escaping our worries. Martha Marcy May Marlene
- Without knowing, this immediately reminded me of
Afterschool
sharing its clinical style, and, by golly, it was by the same directing team. Promising talent. The Adventures of Tintin
- I'm a fan of the comic and Spielberg captured the frantic energy, but CG
animation sapped out the hand drawn beauty. The Descendants
- Great movie about fathers and daughters. A Dangerous Method
- The trailer looked dangerous from Keira Knightley's overhysterics, but I was safely rewarded in watching the beginnings of psychotherapy from David Cronenberg who continues to extend his range. We Need to Talk About Kevin
- Maternal nihilism, if you're into it. Shame
- Sexual nihilism, isn't everyone into it? The Ides of March
- Pilot for an HBO TV series. Ellie Parker
- Movie is in love with Naomi Watts and especially life in LA. Required if you're thinking of becoming an actor. The Deep Blue Sea
- Rachel Weisz is gorgeous in British melodrama that reaches a beautiful sadness not seen since
The Red Shoes . A Separation
- Iranian mystery/drama about arguing through life everyday in Tehran. Margaret
- Kenneth Lonnergan's overambitious ramble about NYC life after 9/11 through the eyes of a mother and daughter. Dark Shadows
- Best Eva Green movie ever. Damsels in Distress
- Whit Stillman gets another chance to indulge into his obsessions of polite living. This maybe his last. Ruby Sparks
-
When author Paul Dano creates Zoe Kazan from his typewriter, the climax is a strange, violent scene of creative control and proof Kazan is an amazing talent. Cabin in the Woods
- Metahorror that is more fun behind the curtain than what's in front. Nice Sigourney Weaver sighting. Gayby
- Faith in independent romantic comedy restored. ParaNorman
- Handmade quality, Machinemade story. Tuesday, After Christmas
- Film's sensuous start with naked bodies at rest got better as they went in motion. Weekend
- A weekend fling for two gay men about the risks and rewards of falling in love. It's been told a million times, but this picture made it fresh because it was so honest. A brave breakthrough for everyone involved. So long 2012.

Too Much Of A Good Thing
"The problem is due largely to what we already associate with the different frame rates. Until recently, video has always been shot at higher frame rates than film, bringing with it a very specific look. Think cable access shows or soap operas — and that's exactly what you see in The Hobbit. Rather than the majestic grandeur presented in the first films, the new entry looks more like a Renaissance Faire recreation shot on your brother's mini-DV camera."
-
Bryan Bishop, The Verge The dramatic
deficiencies
in Peter Jackson's
The Hobbit
could have been predicted due to a single book being stretched out to three movies, but leave it to a tech blog to best describe what the new 48 frames per second format the film is unleashing on us is like, and how the presentation is maybe more than two steps back from the 24 frames we know and love. The new format exposes a 'matrix' most of us never realized: the blur we've been seeing when something moves in movies is really a limitation of film's memory and not our own. Jackson wanted to get it closer to reality, but many see a view into the valley of the uncanny. As we're just starting to get used to 3D and digital dominance, this new twist, especially spent on a huge franchise, is another test on what the future of film will look like. I predict 48 will not be liked. We'll want to stay 24 and be young forever. Update:
A roundup of the best quotes after watching 48fps is listed on
Grantland , which includes Anthony Lane's cheeky
review
in The New Yorker. Lane, the snowy owl, watches his vole as a boyhood fan of Tolkien's book, delighted and disappointed, and hopeful things get better in the next installments.

National Cult Cinema Day
If you've watched John Carpenter's
Halloween , there's a scene at the end, when Michael Myers is going to crash the babysitting across the street where Jamie Lee Curtis is snuggled before the TV, watching scary movies until the parents return home. She's catching the creature double feature put on always during Halloween night. If you were a lucky kid forty years ago, you got to see one of these after trick-or-treating. Now, cable channels have month long programming for the holiday, but these were special treats to discover strange gems for one night only from the corners of cinema. One could argue, dressing up in costume from horror classics, then sitting on the floor in the dark, while eating bags of candy, was a night of cult cinema on a national scale. Alas, the double feature has nearly faded from analog life. But we still make
bad lists
of our favorites. So, here is my annual shot at the unusual, in homage to the surprise of what I used to catch when I turned the nob to the end of the dial. Boo.
Color
The Descent
- High adrenaline horror
The Innkeepers
- Ti West's horror character study
Peeping Tom
- Career ending killer
Onibaba
- Watch what you throw away
The Mist
- Last good Stephen King movie
B+W
The Night of the Hunter
- Best Shelley Winters movie ever
Eraserhead
- So disturbing, can't ever finish
The Return of Dr. X
- Bogart goes boo!
M
- German expressionist scariness
The Mummy
- "He went for a little walk. You should've seen his face."
Happy Halloween.

Count Me In
"It is a movie about the lure and folly of greatness that comes as close as anything I’ve seen recently to being a great movie. There will be skeptics, but the cult is already forming. Count me in." -
A.O.Scott, NYTimes I turned a corner on Paul Thomas Anderson with
Punch Drunk Love
and have been a fan since. I think he's a cut above other current acclaimed directors like David Fincher and Christopher Nolan. Although not a blockbuster maker, he's turning into the next Stanley Kubrick, with a new narrative style and unexpected subject matter - you don't know what he's going to do next. The 70mm release of this is also a pleasant surprise, and I encourage anyone to try and get to a theater to experience it. I plan to this Saturday. I'm always challenged by this guy - his work grows - rewarding richly.

Ain't Over Until the Fat Man Sings
If you love film too much, you'll eventually find your way to the British Film Institute's Sight and Sound poll of the
50 greatest films of all time . What makes the list special is it's not a survey of common opinion or one film geek's midnight rant, but an elite snobbery of know-it-alls of over 800 critics, academics, etc. making a
judgement
every ten years. If it sounds repressive, it's not. There's no required reading, long winded essays or grand theories, just a numbered column to jump off or climb up, whichever is more fun. You discover it, and with a first look, you feel part of the club, because there will be films in the top-ten that you've seen and probably liked ( 2001, The Godfather - seen it, not bad, not bad at all! ). Then there will be movies you've maybe heard or not at all ( Tokyo Story, Rules of the Game, 8-1/2 ) and you'll give them a try because the list already likes some of your tastes. After seeing those great movies, you'll come back for more, watch the rest of the ten and further into the fifty. You've made a lifelong friend. So this friend had a birthday last week, but didn't look the same. Another ten years, The old master is still a fat man, but he shaved his beard. He looks younger. The other thing about this friend was his last name was Kane. It was always Kane. It was what made the list different from everyone else. You knew about
Citizen Kane
- maybe caught a clip on TV or puzzled at a lone figure posted to an activity board in college, large as a giant posing like a pair of scissors - saw it and thought what a boring film. But it sat on the top of this numbered text saying to you no, you're not looking hard enough. So you'd press play, again, and again, until you figured it out. It suddenly made sense. Cinema changed with a dying whisper for a winter sled. There was BK and AK. Like the keystone to an arch, if you pulled it away, the whole thing would tumble. But someone did, and it stayed up, floated in the air against gravity. WTF. The feeling is
Vertigo . I've often thought that the choice for top films were really critics deciding the greatest directors, then picking the best representative film from that artist's work. Which is why the
director's picks
are similar, but with a surprise every few feet that feels less checklist and more argument.
Citizen Kane
was on top because of its historic importance. What is
Vertigo ? It's about a man haunted by a dead girl who maybe comes back as a ghost. It doesn't hold any new breakthrough in the medium, suggest new forms of narration or mark a turning point in Hitchcock's style or subject matter. Maybe the answer lies in what it isn't. It's not European, black and white, and from that high point of the sixties new wave, a film somewhere between
Breathless
and
The Seventh Seal
that heroically put the 'art' in cinema. Instead, the winner is a populist Hollywood picture, done in technicolor, that received mild reviews on first day from a genre director who many thought did better work. Detective Scottie Ferguson's (Jimmy Stewart) fear of heights has become the critical cliché of our obsession with film: how we fall for and can't resist its gravity in our lives. This time, we've forgotten history and our intellect, and instead lost all our senses for love. Update:
Of course, everyone is putting their two cents into this. The best I've read is from
Scott Tobias
at AV Club who bravely defends the choices and how great this list is against the tide of
predictable
cowards
dismissing
the whole ritual as irrelevant. I guess you wouldn't find
surprises
out of the
blue
like this.

This Motion Picture was Shot and Finished on Film
"While Heath Ledger’s Joker set an impossible bar for colorful super-villainy, Nolan draws a sharp contrast between the Joker’s code-free nihilism and the fascist order Bane threatens on Gotham. Where the Joker preys on our fears of random, irrational acts of terror, Bane has an all-consuming, dictatorial agenda that’s more stable and permanent, a New World Order that’s been planned out with the precision of a military coup. Even his voice, projected muddily though that steel mask, has the authority of a prison-camp megaphone. He’s stronger than Batman, physically and mentally, which makes the “rising” part of The Dark Knight Rises an agonizing struggle to a hugely satisfying payoff."
-
Scott Tobias, AV Club "The impressive success of 'The Dark Knight Rises' pleasantly confounds our notions as to where great filmmaking is to be found in today's world. To have a director this gifted turning his ability and attention to such an unapologetically commercial project is beyond heartening in an age in which the promise of film as a popular art is tarnished almost beyond recognition. Wouldn't it be nice if the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which snubbed the trilogy's first two films in the best picture race, finally got the message?"
-
Kenneth Turan - LA Times
"TDKR is old-fashioned in two other ways: it renounces both the 3-D standard for big action pictures (though 72 minutes of the 160-minute movies can be seen in the IMAX format) and the tendency to make every movie digitally. A proud end credit reads: “This motion picture was shot and finished on film.”
-
Richard Corliss, Time The good reviews are plentiful, but what is surprising is the critical writing - I mean the extra long copy to examine this film and the larger context in which the series exists, in both comic book storytelling and allegory to our times. Even against the hype, reviewers are more than satisfied with the ending and also how reverent they are for the filmmaking - its classical craft of storytelling. I haven't seen praise like this since
The Return of the King . Follow the bat signal to the movies this weekend.

Keep the Faith
"However, there’s one kind of commercial for which viewers regularly hit the stop button on their DVR – ads for upcoming movies. This is because everybody hates commercials, but everybody loves movies. That’s why people stop to watch the spots for upcoming films. And that’s why people will also stop what they’re doing on a computer or mobile device to click on an appealing piece of movie marketing."
-
Chris McGurk, Cinedigm My naive optimism was bucked up again by Anne Thompson, who was kind enough to reprint the transcript of Cinedigm CEO, Chris McGurk, speaking the keynote last week at the LA Film Fest about the state of independent filmmaking. It's a great read about his take on the current state of the film industry, very different than the doomsday prophecies by critics and professionals worried that the art form will be lost to the internet and the latest device in our pocket. A better way to keep the faith is watch the second teaser for
The Master .
