Listening to my gut
My stomach talks to me. And I've begun to rely on it over the years. Walking onto a beach makes my stomach relax, but it screams when I have to present to a group. When I need to make a decision, I see how I am feeling before I make the pros and cons list. Sometimes I get false readings, so I have to take care not to necessarily go with my first instinct. I try to "sit" on whatever it is I am feeling or thinking to see if my gut still feels the same way later. (I have had one or two posts, that upon reflection, get jettisoned the next day.) But usually, my belly is right. Today I moved my books, files, pictures, and coffee mug from the Upper School building to the Middle School building, where I will teach eighth-grade–a move about which I was somewhat ambivalent. I packed up my things, looking around the modern, bare room that housed my ninth-graders all year. The black desks weigh a ton and are hard to move around for group work. The white walls are covered with large blue cabinets so there's no space for student work or pictures. The ceiling is non-existent; the rooms were designed to see the heating and cooling pipes, creating a horrible acoustics problem. The server, which services the building, hums constantly in that room. And it's cold. Literally and figuratively.
My stomach complained constantly last year. On this sunny day, I carted my belongings across campus, walking into my new space–pale blue walls and large windows, two-seater desks that can be moved wherever I want, and lots of bookshelves. I arranged the desks in a circle on the clean carpet, pushed a large round table to the corner, where I will keep the netbooks, and filled one of the bookshelves with my collection.
I imagined beginning my first day talking about all the books I planned to bring in for their independent reading, where they could work on the netbooks to publish and share their thoughts, and how we would create a community in this room. Our space.
I picked up the summer reading book, wondering what the students were thinking about it, hoping they would like the activity I have planned for their return. Checking my lunch, I realized I was starved and ready for a big lunch
Yep, it's going to be ok.

Instant PD
Once again my network comes to the rescue. I am spending the day thinking about what and how I will teach next year. Of course, while I am working, I am checking Twitter, because….you never know what will pop up.
Tom , my WPMU friend from Richmond, has shared a link to a video.
I browse the site, and suddenly I am watching an 8th grade English teacher learning h ow to go from Good to Outstanding
as he teaches a Dickens novel. The concept is like a reality TV show. The teacher teaches, then gets help from the experts. He has three weeks to come back and teach again, hoping to gain respect, votes, and a better class! Not only do they help him with how to present content, he also get advice about tone of voice, how to carry himself, and how his room looks. In 30 minutes I learned some great techniques for making "an old dusty novel" come alive and how to modulate voice and gestures to not talk too much. Does he make it? You'll have to watch:) Thanks, Tom. Ok, back to work.

Summer Begins
Between visits with family (wonderful), leading a workshop (stressful), and getting over
Vertigo
(yuk), I feel  like summer work has only started today. I am trying to use
July
to prepare for next fall (and not let the time slip away). Here's what I'm up to:
Our faculty is reading
Understanding by Design
together (perhaps even in a lit circle on our faculty ning, thanks to
Katie . Though I've read it before and use UBD as I plan, I am looking forward to seeing how this affects our teaching as a school.
This year I'll be teaching the tried and true classics ( To Kill a Mockingbird, Romeo and Juliet ) as well as providing some YA Lit to my students. But I'll spend this month looking for creative ways to get them involved such as using hypertext. Here's an example for
King Lear .
Summer is when I catch up on my reading. Here's what's on my coffee table:
Three Cups of Tea ,
The Geography of Bliss ,
Outliers ,
Here If You Need Me ,
The Book Whisperer , and
Building Literacy Through Classroom Discussion . That's just a start.
As I sip my coffee, glancing up occasionally to watch the dog roll in the grass or to enjoy the flowers scattered around the garden, I can feel my brain clearing. My body is experiencing calming, physical changes as I move to this summer mode. I have been inspired by teacher
Steve Shann
to focus on
meaningful
and connected things.
I'm off to walk the dog.

Looking back, looking ahead
Last August I found out I would be teaching ninth-grade English, not serving as a full time instructional tech coordinator. Of course, I had already signed on to participate in the
Powerful Learning Practice , and I was not about to stop working behind the scenes supporting teachers as best I could in their use of technology. I knew the year would be difficult (I hadn't read anything I was going to teach), time-consuming (I would be connecting and supporting teachers as a team fellow for the PLP), and exhausting (much of the work needed to be done in the evening and on weekends).
So how did it go?
Thumbs Down!
Using another teacher's lesson plans does not make things easier! My colleague,
Susanne , had taught this course for a number of years. In her organized, inimitable fashion, she handed me (virtually) her daily plans, quizzes, projects,and tests to use. Sounds great, but we teach differently, and I can't tell you how many times I would be halfway through a lesson, wondering why I was doing it that way and then having to re-group for the next day. Susanne is one of the best, most creative teachers I know. But I should have just created the lessons myself.
My disorganization. Sigh, it's my critical flaw. I suppose I should give up trying to be more organized after all these years; it's just not going to happen. I tried to use two email addresses and two diigo accounts (to accommodate our private ed group) with the kids, and that often created havoc in my attempt to be paperless. (It didn't work.) And, wow, can I let myself wander when I'm online reading one article or blog after another.
Thumbs Up!
I loved most days with my amazing, fun students. Our ninth-grade course is writing intensive in both English and history. Though I didn't always love the grading, I so enjoyed reading their work and watching them grow intellectually and creatively.
Frankenstein . This powerful book led us to "the monster within us," pop culture, Mary Shelley's writing style, and the pros and cons of scientific advancements. This piece also let them begin to react emotionally on their
blogs .
Using a
wiki
to organize our year. The perfect tool. What else can I say?
Working with the PLP and my network enriched my interaction with the students and let me try new things. The students would argue that some days we tried too much (another tool, Mrs. Carter Morgan??) However,I can't imagine teaching without our laptops or immediate access to internet resources again.
What I know for sure (as Oprah says) is that it is hard (impossible?) for me to focus on one thing. I tend to get distracted, spend far too much time online looking for the "best" tool or approach, making one more comment or
tweet
to someone, or trying to figure out how to change the theme on our
WPMU blogging platform
when I should be doing something else! Too many times I tried to say yes to people who needed help integrating technology, and frankly, that meant a less productive classroom for myself.
Those traits work well when I am a full time instructional technologist, as I can multi-task, share ideas, engage in conversations about teaching and learning, and spend hours looking for resources. But they do not work well for teachers working full time in the classroom. As I look forward to next year, I need to keep this in mind.
And I do like
this list
from an editorial in The Boston Globe. I will continue to let these principles guide me as I create a plan for my 8th grade students:
THINK strategically. Use technology wisely. Work collaboratively.
Communicate effectively. Recognize how the world around you connects to
everything you do.
