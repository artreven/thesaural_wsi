The 25 Most Influential People in Comic Book Movies: #16 Lauren Shuler Donner
May 13, 2008 — sophosmoros
It has been said that behind every great man stands a great woman. Be that as it may, it is certainly the case that behind every X-Man stands
Lauren Shuler Donner .
She has (with the assistance of
#19 Ralph Winter ) brought Marvel Comics’
X-Men
to the forefront of American pop culture with her productions of
X-Men ,
X2 , and
X-Men: The Last Stand . Capitalizing on the success of
this franchise , she is currently producing
X-Men Origins: Wolverine , starring
Hugh Jackman , scheduled for release on May 1, 2009. She has also been announced as a producer for
X-Men Origins: Magneto , based on a screenplay most recently written by
#5 David S. Goyer , also scheduled for release in 2009. Ms. Shuler Donner was instrumental in bringing the main character from
Hellblazer
(published by DC’s
Vertigo
imprint) to the screen in her production of  Constantine   (with producers
#8 Benjamin Melniker
and
#5 Michael E. Uslan
and executive producer
#15 Gilbert Adler ). She remains attached to the possibility of producing a
sequel
to the film, also with Adler and Melniker, but
according to IESB.net , possibilities are waning. Hollywood.com reports an announcement that Shuler Donner will also be producing an
adaptation
of DC Comics’
Metal Men , but no release date has been revealed.
