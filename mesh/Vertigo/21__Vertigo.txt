The present-day University of Technology originates from the
Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts
which was established in 1833. In the 1870s, the SMSA formed the Workingman's College which was later taken over by the NSW government to form, in 1882, the
Sydney Technical College . In 1969, part of the Sydney Technical College became the
New South Wales
Institute of Technology (NSWIT). It was officially unveiled by Neville Wran.
It was reconstituted as the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), in 1988 under the
University of Technology, Sydney Act
of NSW State Parliament, which was later superseded by the
University of Technology, Sydney, Act 1989 (NSW) . In 1990, it absorbed the Kuring-gai College of Advanced Education and the Institute of Technical and Adult Teacher Education of the Sydney College of Advanced Education, under the NSW
Higher Education (Amalgamation) Act 1989 .
Although its antecedent institutions go back as far as 1893, they took new shapes from the 1960s, creating a new University focused on practice-oriented education with strong links to industry, the professions and the community, and with a growing research reputation and a strong commitment to internationalisation.
UTS has had three phases in its history:
In the first phase, effort was concentrated on embedding an amalgamation of institutions which were structurally and culturally different. This strengthened the research culture and established a more consistent approach to teaching and learning.
The second phase, beginning in the mid-1990s, saw a strong focus on international student recruitment, combined with an expansion of professional post-graduate programs for domestic students. Greater emphasis on both research and flexible learning also became priorities during this period.
The third phase began in 2000 with a 10 year strategic vision. This involved concentrating research funding into four major research institutes, upgrading physical infrastructure at the city campus, enhancing teaching and learning, and continuing entrepreneurial activity.

Campus architecture
The University of Technology, Sydney is an interesting mix of architectural styles reflecting the different periods in which the buildings and grounds were constructed and renovated. The famous
'Tower' building
is an example of brutalist architecture with square and block concrete designs. Built following massive student protests in U.S. colleges like Berkeley and Kent State University, the building was designed to do away with large, outdoor areas and hence limit students' ability to stage large protests. The Haymarket campus combines a modern interior with the remaining exterior of the old markets building, and the recently completed buildings 4 and 6 are designed with an element of high-tech architecture.
In October 2006, the university's tower building was voted by 23% of the total vote in a poll hosted by Sydney Morning Herald as ugliest building in Sydney.
The University recently acquired the former Sydney Institute of Technology building that stands opposite to Building 10 (on Jones St) and adjacent to Building 2. This building was named Building 7, but was demolished to make way for an extension of Alumni Green. Currently, the university is constructing an underground multi-purpose sports hall beside the Alumni Green. Designed by PTW Architects, this project commenced in late January 2010 and opened in April 2011.
Housing
The University offers modern, self-catering accommodation in five buildings named Yura Mudang, Gumal Ngurang, Geegal, Bulga Ngurra, and Blackfriars. Yura Mudang is the largest complex with 720 beds. The 14 levels of Housing are built on top of UTS building 6 on
Harris Street . Gumal Ngurang is the second largest complex and is located on Broadway, just down the road from Bulga Ngurra.

which was approved by the University Council in August 2008. This plan which was unveiled to the public on 19 January 2009 will commence in mid 2009 and involve:
New buildings: a twelve-storey "gateway" building on Broadway adjacent to Building 10; a five-storey building facing Thomas St; and, a nine-storey building on the former Dairy Farmers site in Ultimo Road
New student housing in a multi-storey block to be built over the rear of Building 6
Extension of the Tower podium to create a new entry zone, improved Broadway street frontage and a "student commons" hub
