World Gets In The Game...
Whoo hoo!
Disc Wars!!
Light Cycles!!! Yeah, baby... No, the film hasn't been delayed... I know that this poster says it's January, 2011, but that's because this is an international poster for
Walt Disney Pictures ' " Tron Legacy ." That's right, all you guys outside America are going to have to wait an entire month after us to see it.
I know that you hate that, don't you? Well, if it's any consolation, it's going to be at least a couple years before we see anything about that new
Tron
attraction at
Disneyland .
But from what I hear, the Suits are so happy with what they're seeing on Legacy that they've fast tracked development on a swanky E-Ticket and a few other surprises that could wind up being part of a TL makeover before the
next
sequel in this
Mouse
franchise. But sadly, they won't fast track the film for you...

The Journey Of Peter Parker...
Feast your eyes on this ... Could this be your friendly, rebooted
Spider-Man
in the flesh?
Word from my Bothans is that
Sony
has settled on " Journey to the Center of the Earth 's"
Josh
Hutcherson
as the newly, high school bound
Peter Parker
after narrowing the search down to three actors.
After several extensive test shoots were performed,
Marc
Webb
and the top Sony $uits may have decided that Hutcherson was the right fit for the role and an offer could be made. The deal hasn't been signed yet, but if all works out there could be an announcement soon. Now, should the deal be signed, I wonder who'll be cast as the
Lizard ? Whoops,
I mean, the villain...

A Tale To Tell...
A couple/few weeks ago at
Annecy ,
WDAS
screened " The Princess and the Frog ," and with it they premiered the latest in their new
Disney Short
series... You've all heard about " Tick Tock Tale " from post
here
on Blue Sky and others, but finally, the public got to take a look at this new short.
I remember reporting that it was supposed to play with TPATF, but wasn't ready in time, but it finally did play with the film, just not till months after it was released. The story concerns a lonely, aging clock in a clock shop that is shunned by all the other, more modern pieces around him/it.
One day a thief comes into the equation and changes everyone's perspective of what this little clock is and perhaps capable of. And if you'd like to see what it looks like then head over to the
Walt Disney Animation Studios
Shorts Website
and check out
some lovely
screen shots
of this little gem. No word yet if the Suits have pulled the gun with the intention of releasing this with " Tangled " later this year...

A Friend In Need...
I just wanted to help someone out here... I am, after all, a very caring and trustful friend.
With that said, I want to pass along this plea from
Decadent Dave , who is in dire straights.
See, he's a little short on cash right now and could use your help in purchasing much needed transportation. All he needs is a mere $35,000. That way he can purchase that life size
Light Cycle
that is
for sale
on
E-Bay .
Does it work?
Not likely.
Will it get him to where he wants to go?
Well, there are two ways of answering that.
Realistically, no, but metaphorically, I think it'll be taking him to that great, geek kingdom/sweet spot that all Tron Units see as the final destination.
So, what do you say? A little charity for the man, perhaps...

Small Footprints...
This only makes sense when you think about it... Not wanting to deprive those of us that watch the small screen,
Marvel Studios
has
set up
an imprint/division that will focus solely on television series, films, shorts entitled, what else? Marvel Television . The name pretty much says it all.
For those that haven't yet heard, the
Mouse
division
has hired
Jeph
Loeb
as the head of the TV division.
Loeb, is an award winning comic/television writer that will be in charge of both live-action and animated forms of entertainment, the development and distribution of direct to DVD live-action/animated TV series and TV movies from Marvel. If you don't know Loeb, he worked on " Heroes " during it's first couple of seasons, various other series, including " Lost " and has some rather iconic comic work.
My favorite stuff of his is " The Long Halloween ," which I highly recommend you getting if you want to read a very good Batman story.
It's clear the man knows comics, let's now see how he manages and translates them to television. Marvel
is moving ahead with several properties that Loeb will have to address ( S.H.I.E.L.D. series! ) and hopefully give the greenlight to... UPDATE:
Super Hero Hype
has a short
interview
with Loeb talking about his plans for the future.

Legacy Downloaded...
G...A...M... E... ON... It appears that guests at the
Cinema Expo
got quite a nice showing of " Tron Legacy " the other day... The expo, which is held in Amsterdam, is the European ShoWest, basically.
All the exhibitors show their latest and upcoming projects for the foreign market.
This year,
Disney
had an hour and half
press event that featured looks at their upcoming projects over the next year+.
A good portion of that was on the
Tron sequel .
They showed various concepts, artwork, animatics and such.
And then they showed an extended trailer that blew the crowd away.
If you want to see one reader's impression, the
IMDb 's
boards
had this lucky fellow who got to experience it.
Click
here
for geeky delight... I can't wait for the new version of
this
software ... Hat Tip to
Collider .

End Of An Era...
Hakuna Matata... What a wonderful thing... On this day sixteen years ago, the Second Golden Age of Disney Animation ended... The fourth and last film of this animation renaissance went out into theaters everywhere and became the
Mouse 's highest grossing film up until that time.
We didn't know it then, but " The
Lion
King " would become the high watermark for
Walt Disney Feature Animation
(now,
Walt Disney Animation Studios ).
Nothing since has risen to, or equalled these four films in modern Disney history.
Nothing since the
Old Maestro
at least.
We're all still waiting for that Third Golden Age to begin. All part of the Circle of Life, I guess...

ReImagined Magic...
$$$$$$... $$$$$$... Those of you that wondered what the new
Disney Store
would look like finally have your chance to see what all the hype is about... Opening today at
The Shops at Montebello
is the first revised example of what the new "Imagination Park" as it's sometimes called will be.
So if you live in Southern California you might want to brave traffic and take a trip with your young boy(s) or girl(s) to, as Disney likes to say
"The best thirty minutes of a child’s day." Interested? The best way to find out is to take the drive...

Strange Days...
I put a spell on you... It appears
Marvel Studios
just keeps marching ahead with adaptations of it's characters... If you hadn't heard,
the
Disney
division has
hired
screenwriters
Thomas Donnelly
and
Joshua Oppenheimer
to come up with a film version of the classic
Stan
Lee / Steve
Ditko
character, " Doctor
Strange ."
If you're not a comic book geek and wonder who this physician is, well then, click the name dude.
Hehe.
The character is one of several secondary or B-level superheroes that line the 5000+ list that the Mouse bought last August.
There are literally four or five films (not counting " Thor ," " Captain America " and " Avengers .") in various stages of development, any one of which could be the first one launched under a Disney banner.
We don't yet know which one will be the first to start lensing, but none will probably be out before 2012/13 at the earliest.
I want to put my money on " Ant - Man ," or " The
Runa ways " first out of the gate, but my personal interest is in seeing that " S.H.I. E.L.D. " theatrical feature that
we broke
here going before cameras for a big tent pole debut.
Of course, with all the projects that Disney wants to have going, something else, like " Daz zler" could get the greenlight first. Stranger things have happened, I guess...

Toy Story, Tron Style...
Game oooooooon... Now this is cool... I can see
Decadent Dave
is going to be spending a lot of money come this October.
The pics of the toys that the
Mouse
is going to seduce geeks with this fall for " Tron Legacy " are starting to come out. What if you wanted to have your keyboard look Tron-swanky? And of course, you need a mouse. Or maybe you want to have a tricked out tv remote? Then you have to have a nice sound system for your iPhone that looks like a Tron Disc. And everyone wants their own collectible villain. How about this nice poster for the Zero G Light Cycle, cool huh? Then again, forget the poster.
I want the actual thing. Or even better, Flynn's Light Cycle. And you're going to have to write that check out for all this, right? Start preparing to break open that piggy bank... All artwork is copyright Disney.

The Plot Thickens...
Walt Disney Pictures

Pirate film ... In a press release, the
Mouse
has given us a little more information about the story of " Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides " for fans to mull over till next summer: Walt Disney Pictures'/Jerry Bruckheimer Films ' Comedy Adventure
" Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides " in

3D ( TM ) Begins Production. Johnny Depp returns to his Academy Award( R )-nominated role of
Captain Jack Sparrow, joined by Penelope Cruz, Geoffrey Rush, Ian
McShane, Kevin R. McNally, Astrid Berges-Frisbey and Sam Claflin in Fourth
Entry of Blockbuster Franchise.. Production has commenced on location in Hawaii, the United
Kingdom and Los Angeles on
Walt Disney Pictures ' and
Jerry Bruckheimer Films'
sweeping comedy adventure " Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger
Tides ," directed by Rob Marshall ("Chicago"), the fourth entry
in the blockbuster franchise which has already reaped $2.7 billion in
worldwide box office from the previous three films, and the
first to be filmed and presented in
Disney Digital 3D ( TM ). Johnny Depp returns to his iconic, Academy Award( R )-nominated role of Captain Jack
Sparrow, newly joined by Academy Award winner Penelope Cruz
("Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Rob Marshall's "Nine"), Ian McShane (HBO's

"Valkyrie"). The film is slated to open May 20, 2011. " Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides " captures the fun,
adventure and humor that ignited the hit franchise --this time in
Disney Digital 3D( TM ). In this action-packed tale of truth,
betrayal, youth and demise, Captain Jack Sparrow crosses paths with a
woman from his past (Penelope Cruz), and he's not sure if it's love--or if
she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled
Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the
ship of the formidable pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Jack finds
himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know who to fear
more: Blackbeard or the woman from his past. Rush reprises his role as the vengeful Captain Hector Barbossa,
and Kevin R. McNally returns as Captain Jack's longtime comrade
Joshamee Gibbs. Claflin stars as a stalwart missionary, while
Berges-Frisbey is transformed into a mysterious mermaid. " Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides " is written by
"Pirates" veterans Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio. The executive producers are
Mike Stenson, Chad Oman, Barry Waldman, Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio and
John DeLuca. Joining Bruckheimer and Marshall for the new voyage is a
top-flight group of award-winning behind-the-scenes artists, including
director of photography Dariusz Wolski (first three "Pirates of the
Caribbean" movies, Tim Burton's "Alice in Wonderland"), production designer
John Myhre (two-time Academy Award( R ) winner for Marshall's "Chicago"
and "Memoirs of a Geisha"), costume designer Penny Rose (all three
"Pirates of the Caribbean" films, "Prince of Persia: The Sands of
Time"), visual effects supervisor Charles Gibson, who won an
Academy Award for "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Oscar( R )
winner and eight-time nominee special effects supervisor John
Frazier ("Pirates of the Caribbean" films," "Pearl Harbor") and stunt
coordinator George Marshall Ruge, who also devoted his talents
to the previous three "Pirates" films as well as Disney and Jerry
Bruckheimer's "National Treasure" franchise. The editors include
two Oscar winners, Michael Kahn ("Prince of Persia: The Sands of
Time") and David Brenner ("Born on the Fourth of July"), as well as
Wyatt Smith (Marshall's "Nine"). Rob Marshall's first three films, "Chicago," "Memoirs of a
Geisha" and "Nine," have been honored with a total of 23 Academy Award( R )
nominations. For his work on "Chicago," winner of six Oscars( R )
including Best Picture, Marshall received the Director's Guild
Award, an Oscar nomination, a Golden Globe Award( R ) nomination, a BAFTA
nomination The National Board of Review Award and the New York
Film Critics Online Award. A six-time Tony Award( R ) nominee and George
Abbott Award winner, Marshall's extensive work on Broadway
includes co-director and choreographer of the worldwide award-winning
production of "Cabaret" and director/choreographer of the Broadway revival
of "Little Me," along with many others. He also produced, directed
and choreographed the NBC television special "Tony Bennett: An
American Classic," which earned seven Emmy Awards( R ), including three for
Marshall, and directed and choreographed Disney/ABC's critically
acclaimed movie musical "Annie," which received 12 Emmy
nominations with two wins, including Marshall for Outstanding Choreography;
it also won the prestigious Peabody Award. " Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides " will film on the
islands of Kauai and Oahu, Hawaii, followed by locations and studio work

Mini-Marvels...
It looks like we can look forward to a lot more unknown in the
Marvel Movie Universe ... By that I mean, a lot of secondary and B-Level characters making their mark on the big screen and possibly television. If you haven't read it,
Latino Review
is
reporting
from one of their sources that
Marvel Studios
and
Disney
are thinking about attaching short film versions of their lesser known heroes.
These shorts, between 8-11 minutes would be introductory and a great way for the Mouse to gauge how much interest the public has in these characters without having to spend hundreds of millions of dollars only to find that the world has no interest in seeing them*. I find this fascinating for one reason, this is what Hollywood used to call " Serials ."
This is what the inspiration for " Raiders of the Lost Ark ," " Star Wars ," and several other films.
I look forward to this immensely.
It's not known if these projects will be live-action or hand-drawn/cg animation.
I would hope that will Disney's vast collection of animation, they could pull something quite enjoyable together.
This might be the route that Marvel goes with that proposed
S.H.I.E.L.D. animated series
that is one of many ideas that the Suits are going over. Wow, first Disney Shorts, then Pixar Shorts and now Marvel Shorts...

I love you, Dad...
To the man that's married to and taken care of my mother, I have to wish a great, compliment filled day... I owe you a lot for putting up with me as a mean, stubborn little colt that drank your beer and lied about it.
Never did find those drunk gremlins, did we? Happy

Best.
Trilogy.
Ever...
You've got a friend in me... I haven't reviewed a film on
Blue Sky Disney
in quite a while... And I still don't intend to anytime soon.
I have never really enjoyed reviewing films, I just don't like doing it.
Taking what someone has worked on for two or three years and turning all that sweat and effort into a couple of paragraphs seems to belittle even the time and money put into a box office dud.
I have my opinions and I state them, I'm not afraid of that, but reviews I'll leave up to others.
Now that that is said, I will tell you that " Toy Story 3 " is brilliant and amazing. A fine end to a wonderful series of stories that started fifteen years ago.
It it every bit as deserving of the accolades it's receiving right now, as the first two.
Pixar , unlike any other studio just knows how to make a quality film. But what I want to say, or talk about, is the culmination of the whole.
All three films.
The trilogy that is
Toy Story .
When my friends and I get together and talk film, from time to time we debate what are the greatest films.
We also throw out what we think are the greatest trilogies.
We've discussed the faults and failings of mega-series like " Star Wars " and " Star Trek ."
The sadness, that series like " Spider-Man " and " X-Men " when from good, to great, to mediocre with their trilogies.
And until now, most of us have settled on " The Lord of the Rings " as the closest thing to a perfect trio of films.
As I said,
until
now. With the Lamp's release of this film, we now have the perfect trilogy of films about a series of characters.
Toy Story ,
Toy Story 2
and
Toy Story 3
are of a quality that rises far above the rest, but also shows that it is possible to create a series/trilogy of films that don't loose story or artistic value in the all mighty attempt to make the all mighty dollar.
It ain't easy as the record shows, but Pixar has done it.
Amazingly. When I saw the first Toy Story in 1995, I was amazed at the look, it being the first all computer animated film, but I was swept up in the authenticity of the details of such a heartfelt story.
When there was news that a sequel was going to be made, I wondered why and knew that it would fall short of the original... and I was wrong.
It was better than the first (my opinion), which I couldn't believe since the first one was so good.
As the years lingered on, I heard time and time again of a new, third in the series.
From the one not to be made by Pixar from the
Circle 7
guys, to the announcement that Pixar would do a finale to their other two films once the company had been bought by Disney four years ago.
Again, I thought that it would be a disappointment.
I couldn't imagine that they could equal or match what was so right in the first two films... and again, I was wrong. Now, I'm not going to say that it's better than
Part Two , which I still love, but I will say it's an equal brother to it or the first.
It's too early for me to wrap my head around it being better than the others,
but it is great, it's the best film of the year so far, it deserves to be up for best picture ( not
best animated), and I could deem it the best Toy Story film after more viewings and more passing of time.
But I never thought I'd say that. But then again, I should have realized that this was Pixar...

In Betweeners...
Sevens baby!
Sevens... While the
Lamp
continues to shine, the
Mouse
continues to try and find its place in this world... Tomorrow " Toy Story 3 " opens up and is guaranteed to be a success.
It's almost a given that this third (and last of the theatrical series,
at least ) film will bring in truckloads of cash for the Disney vaults.
And next year, the release of " Cars
2 " will most likely catapult past the original's box office take since all those new, young boys have bought all that merchandise over the past few years.
Then we have " Monsters Inc. 2 ," which will be a hit, and the mystery of " Brave " that is
Emeryville/Disney North 's only enigma.
That gives
Bob
Iger
and all the Suits in Burbank another two and a half years before they'll really have to wonder about profits from these films.
I know that nothing is for sure, but Pixar is as close to success as anything or anyone in Hollywood. But what about the
Mouse ? By that, I mean
Walt Disney Animation Studios .
The Big Brother to little
Luxo Jr.
has been having some struggles of late.
While we all screamed in joy at the thought of Pixar becoming part of the Disney family, what we really looked forward to was
John
Lasseter
being in charge of Walt Disney Feature Animation (now, WDAS).
We wanted him to take a bit of that Pixar dust and turn it into pixie dust.
Give Disney animation some of the amazing success that Pixar has enjoyed over the last decade.
And years later, we're still waiting for that to happen. Not that the films under his tenure in charge haven't been good.
They have, much better than what was seen the last decade almost, but they haven't enjoyed the kind of love, financially speaking that Pixar has enjoyed.
From the box office catastrophe that putting " Bolt " up against
horribly, badly acted, and badly told stories about vampires , to the sadness that audiences didn't embrace hand drawn animation like we had hoped with " The Princess and the Frog ." So what's up inside the
Hat Building ?
How are things holding up?
What projects are moving forward and when will we see Disney return to the glory of yesterday.
Right?
I mean, look at how Disney's former boss,
Jeffrey
Katzenberg
is doing over across town with his new animation company.
Not too shabby, I think. That right there is one of the worrisome things for animators right now at Disney Animation.
While they try to get something going and hope for a success, DreamWorks Animation moves steadily ahead with a large and growing slate of projects. Jeffrey's House has crews that are deep in development on multiple stories that will average out to five films every two years.
And the Mouse, well, he's struggling to put one a year out and there is a huge scheduling hole that animators hope to fill soon. So just as a refresher, here are the projects that are ahead for WDAS: Tangled
(2010) . The Further Adventures of Winnie the Pooh
(2011) . Reboot Ralph
(2013) . Notice that?
Another missing hole, just like 2011 used to be when " King of the Elves " occupied that 2012 spot.
But when the story didn't work out it was shelved and in it's place was another project that has travelled through animated development hell, " The Snow Queen ."
But the story wasn't going smoothly on that and suddenly Disney had a " Royalty " problem and it got shelved.
Meaning that now, the year without Disney Animation having a film would be in 2012, not 2011.
Development was starting to go better for
Rich Moore 's " Reboot Ralph " reinterpretation of " Joe Jump ," but it wouldn't be out till 2013.
So this has animators worried that there won't be a project in between to bridge the gap. There are a handful (literally) of directors working on projects that are in a strong development state, but each are in varying stages of process and none have been greenlit yet, and the animators are frustrated at a lack of enough projects to keep them all working and employed.
Many realize with that 2011 empty spot, several of them will be let go in another round of layoffs, and it's not really helping morale right now.
Now, this isn't the same as the morale of several years ago where management belittled the talent and respect was as uncommon trait among the bean counters that walked the halls.
They (the animators) all truly admire Lasseter and feel that he and Ed Catmull care, and are trying to turn the division around.
It's become a much more creative inspired company, but several feel that the marketing division has had too much influence over what gets made.
Princesses, fairies, ect.
It seems with
TPATF
and the
Disney Fairies
series moving into the latter part of its run that the direction has changed somewhat for the better.
There are several ideas being pitched, but nothing has gone so far as to keep staff from realizing that a lull in projects means no work.
Several are now preparing their portfolios for a trip down to
DreamWorks
Animation
where a few of their friends have already gone, and where the development slate is far stronger and the workload is far more stable. Of the few Bothans I've talked to, they feel that the line-up that is coming is strong, but there is just not enough in development.
Chris Williams ' project is still a ways off and
John
Musker
&
Ron
Clements
are working on two ideas for hand-drawn projects but neither have been given the go yet.
The lack of a sure fire hit has also weighed heavy on the hearts of animators as well.
After working on "Bolt" and "Frog" they were expecting to be back in the big time, but Pixar's success has overshadowed the older brother.
Not that they're jealous, but they want to show the world that they can tell great stories too.
This isn't a case of sibling rivalry, but a case of animators thinking they haven't yet had the opportunity to show the talents they know they have.
They just don't want to have to go across town to DreamWorks to show them. It seems that it's harder than we thought to take the magic of a Lamp and turn a Mouse into a Prince...

The Wraith Of Con...
Walt Disney's marketing department sometimes gets it right... We may all be faulting the marketing of
Walt Disney Animation Studios ' " Tangled " by the Mouse, but there are some projects that they seem to know how to market.
No mater if you liked it or not, " Alice in Wonderland " was marketed very well and the end result at the box office proved it.
The " Pirates of the Caribbean " film series has been handled very well, and the
Pixar
films have all been part of a great promotional strategy. Another one that has been handled brilliantly so far, is " Tron Legacy ." From that first surprise clip of the test footage a couple years ago, to last years appearance and the following
WonderCon
marketing as well. And the viral marketing campaign has been just as good. Now comes word, officially from the
Mouse
about their plans for the
2010 Comic-Con
in San Diego : NEWS RELEASE
FOR
IMMEDIATE RELEASE
“ComiTRON” TAKES OVER COMIC-CON INTERNATIONAL 2010 ON JULY 22
Convention’s Panel Presentation Features Filmmakers and Talent
from the Highly Anticipated 3D High-tech
Cultural Phenomenon
Walt Disney Pictures’ “TRON :
Legacy” Opens in US Theaters in Disney Digital 3D and IMAX® 3D on December 17, 2010
BURBANK, Calif. (June 17, 2010) —
Returning for an unprecedented
third year to the fans and Convention that “started it all,” Walt Disney
Pictures is pleased to present a very special, insider look at its
upcoming “TRON: Legacy” at this year’s San Diego Comic-Con International
Convention. At 11:15 a.m. on Thursday, July 22, 2010, the panel
presentation will be held in Hall H of the San Diego Convention Center.
On the dais will be filmmakers and talent from the film, including
director Joe Kosinski, producers Sean Bailey and Steven Lisberger as
wells as cast members Jeff Bridges, Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde,
Michael Sheen and Bruce Boxleitner. The panel discussion, to be
moderated by Patton Oswalt ,
is set to include exclusive glimpses of the film, as well as a Q & A
involving all panel participants, along with special surprise guests.
It was at the 2008 Convention that the vision of a 21st century TRON
was born. When VFX test footage was shown to a packed hall of incredibly
surprised convention attendees, it was met with such an overwhelmingly
positive response—becoming the “it” moment of the Convention—that the
studio gave the film an enthusiastic green light. In 2009
“TRON:
Legacy” returned to Comic-Con with an expanded presence and this year,
the filmmakers and cast are back with never before seen visuals and
“scoop” for the Convention fans
who have been such an instrumental part
of the story of “TRON: Legacy.” Director Joe Kosinski comments: “When we made the teaser, we
envisioned it as a sneak peek at the potential of this project. We set
out to stay true to the characters, the vehicles, and the world
established in the first film—then show its evolution. When it took off
with the fans, we knew we were in the right place. Because they’ve been
key to getting this story told, we’re back to keep them involved, and
excited to finally present actual footage from the film to the audience
that made it all possible.”
To add to the excitement of this extraordinary event, Disney will
showcase an interactive TRON booth on the convention floor (located on
aisle #3712), giving fans a first look at the all new “TRON: Legacy”
inspired merchandise launching this fall. Capturing the action, light,
and cool aesthetic style of the film, the display will include toys,
electronics, collectibles, apparel, accessories, publishing and the
“TRON: Evolution” video game from Disney Interactive Studios. Comic-Con
exclusive products will also be on sale. Disney will also reveal
exciting new mobile content at the event.
About “TRON: Legacy”
“TRON: Legacy” is a 3D action-packed adventure set in a digital world
unlike anything captured on the big screen. Sam Flynn (Garrett
Hedlund), a rebellious 27-year-old, is haunted by the mysterious
disappearance of his father Kevin Flynn (Oscar® and Golden Globe® winner
Jeff Bridges), a man once known as the world’s leading video-game
developer. When Sam investigates a strange signal sent from the
abandoned Flynn’s Arcade—that could have only come from his father—he
finds himself pulled into a world where Kevin has been trapped for 20
years. With the help of the fearless warrior Quorra (Olivia Wilde),
father and son embark on a life-or-death journey across a visually
stunning universe—created by Kevin Himself—which has become far more
advanced with never-before-imagined vehicles, weapons and landscapes,
and a ruthless villain who will stop at nothing to prevent their escape.
Presented in Disney Digital 3D™ and scored by Grammy Award®–winning
electronic music duo Daft Punk, “TRON: Legacy” hits theaters on December
17, 2010.
About Comic-Con 2010:
Comic-Con International is a nonprofit educational organization
dedicated to creating awareness of, and appreciation for, comics and
related popular art forms, primarily through the presentation of
conventions and events that celebrate the historic and ongoing
contribution of comics to art and culture. This year’s annual convention
runs July 22-25 at the San Diego Convention Center. I think no matter what else happens at this convention (and I'm hearing about quite a few surprises), this one is going to be owned by
TRON . I
will
be there...

Disney's Armada...
It's been one of those days were a particular kind of news just rises above everything else... Lots of video game news with
E3
been going on.
The
trailer
has been released for
Disney
Interactive 's
new game , " Pirates of the Caribbean: Armada of the Damned ."
It looks pretty cool.
Now if we can just get some in-game footage to see if it flows well. I feel as though
Propaganda
Games
is to
Disney / Marvel
as
Rocksteady
Studios
is to
Warner / DC Comics .
Now, I know the
Mouse
is wanting to expand the
Pirates
universe beyond what it is and not rely on
Captain
Jack
Sparrow
as much.
We'll see if they succeed.
I certainly thing the world that this franchise based on a
Disneyland
attraction
is worthy of exploring. Let's see what port this thing sails us in to...

Believing In Evolution...
Game on, baby... Earlier today we posted a trailer showing off one of
Disney Interactive 's new games, now we post a
trailer
for the one that I most anticipate... Before we go sit in a darkened theater to watch
Walt Disney Pictures ' " Tron Legacy " this holiday season, we'll be able to transport ourselves into that world at home with
Propaganda Games ' " Tron Evolution ."
Take a look at this new trailer for it and plan on getting behind one of those light cycles this November 1st. It's all part of the program(s)... Hat Tip to

Finally, Oswald gets some respect... Disney Interactive
has released a behind the scenes
video
of the making of
Junction Point 's
new game
starring a certain mouse... " Epic Disney " looks like it's going to be a great game and gives you an idea as to where video gaming is/can go.
I imagine someday being able to play a game that looks and interacts like one of the classic shorts.
As always, story has to rule, no matter if it's
Pixar ,
Walt Disney Animation Studios
or video games like " Batman: Arkham Asylum ."
A great game involves an intriguing and compelling story with amazing graphics and good game play. Warren Spector
looks to have another hit on his hand...

A New Hope: Part 2 A.G.*...
Holy Crap, this is cool... When I first heard about a new
Star Wars
film back in the late Nineties, I had visions of awesome light saber fights, huge Clone War battles and really epic amazingness.
That's not what we got obviously, but it appears that my friends and I aren't the only ones who thought this.
There are a couple new Star Wars games coming out soon, both look much better than the Prequels, but one look like it's filled with that amazingness that I imagined a long, long time ago.
In fact, it looks like they reached into my mind and pulled out those memories as research.
Take a look at
BioWare
and
Lucasarts ' " Star Wars: The Old Republic "
trailer
of the upcoming game and dream of what could have been and might some day be. Maybe
Lucasfilm
should let these guys work on a theatrical film, they seem to get it more than the
Master
does... * A.G. - After George.

Raimi: The Great And Powerful...
According to various
sources , including
Nikki Finke's Deadline Hollywood ,
Walt Disney Studios
made an offer Friday to Sam to direct the
Robert
Downey
Jr.
vehicle, " Oz, The Great and Powerful ," and word is that he accepted it today.
No, not
Sam
Mendes , who was originally being courted for the project, but
Sam
Raimi , who was planning on directing " World of Warcraft " until
Sony
got a look at the budget for this proposed film.
Still, I guess it doesn't stop Sam from playing the video game daily (he's obsessed with it). There is still some confusion as to if Downey is a lock, but as of now it appears that the man behind Evil Dead and Spider-Man is the man behind the curtain...

Forbidden Competition...
Difficult times lie ahead, Bob... You just have to face a choice between what it right, and what is easy... It's good to be back in sunny, Southern California... Remember when I said I was " Gone Phishing " last week?
Well, I kinda was.
I was in Florida and I've been very busy.
I was spent some time at
Walt Disney World
with friends, spending a day at each park (and still enjoying
Disney 's
Animal Kingdom
most of all).
But the main thing we all wanted to do was go to the competition.
We enjoyed a nice day at
Universal Studios , but then the next day we went to our actual destination and reason for going in the first place:
Islands of Adventure .
You know where this is going? The Wizarding World of Harry . To be specific, we wanted to see " Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ."
And that we did.
First off I want to say that IOA is probably my favorite non-Disney theme park.
It's probably the closest thing to a
Disney Park
in terms of details and theming, but it still falls short.
But with the addition of "Forbidden Journey,"
they've made a huge leap toward parity.
All of the park is very well laid out with nice touches and good details, but were the rest of the park to have to quality of the Harry Potter section then this would truly be a rival to the
Mouse .
It is a very detailed area, rivaling Animal Kingdom in the layering on of things that you have to pay attention to to notice.
And the E-Ticket, if you could call it that, the main attraction, Forbidden Journey, is of a quality not seen lately by
WDI
in the states.
It rivals
Tokyo DisneySEA
in terms of craftsmanship and standards, it's that good. I want to thank
Universal Creative
(Universal Studios version Walt Disney Imagineering) for achieving this, it's truly a step up from anything that they've done before and if the future of their rides/attractions is like this then Disney is going to have to step up their game.
The heat is on.
And that's a really good thing.
We should all thank these people and this attraction because without them and this marvelous ride, there wouldn't be all the construction going on in the back of Fantasyland.
That
300 million dollar expansion
of WDW was started specifically because the Suits were uneasy with the new opening at Universal.
Competition is good.
We all benefit from it.
And if more people go see this and reward Universal, Disney starts to get even more worried and we might even see more TLC for Disney World.
Again, a very good thing.
The better these parks get, the more the Mouse will have to respond with the incredible details that enhance a guest's experience there. Now, as to what they'll do?
We'll have to wait and see how the response to this new experience unfolds.
Don't expect anything relating to that
four billion dollar purchase
last year, though.
Nothing is/will be planned in Florida for most likely the coming decade because of Universal's preexisting conditions with Disney's
new adopted child .
But there are plenty of things in the files of WDI over in Glendale that the Imagineers can pull out to use.
If only they have the will to do so.
A decade ago I wouldn't have any faith in the management at the time to have that vision or willingness to spend the bucks.
At least now I know there is a chance and that we might see something like this come about.
All you have to do is dream and have the desire to see those dreams through. And we may have a teenage wizard to thank for it...

George & Steven's Fantastic Time Machine...
Oh, time you cruel, cruel thing you... It's difficult at times to realize that it all happened twenty-nine years ago today.
On this day in 1981,
George
Lucas
and
Steven
Spielberg
released " Raiders of the Lost Ark " which hijacked my brain and I haven't gotten it back since. When I went into the theater to see this new film that the poster claimed was
"From the Creator of Star Wars " and " The director of Jaws " I didn't know what to expect.
When I left after it was over, I was suffering from withdrawal from having the only out of body experience I've ever had watching a film.
I fell in love like many others with the new character of Indiana Jones.
He was bold, brash and all too human.
I enjoyed seeing him even in the flawed sequels to this masterpiece(sans
Crystal
Skull , of course).
Happy birthday, Henry Jones Jr.! And thanks to Steven and George for making a kid feel like the world opened up to him...

The Invisible Tower...
Retro is better than old no?
Yes? No? Yes... Maybe... I'm sure most of you have seen the
artwork
for the new renovation of the
Disneyland Hotel ... When the Mouse started working on this project they changed the names of the
original hotel
towers from the Sierra Tower, which is now Dreams ( Adventure Tower
in 2010), the
Marina Tower, which is now the Wonder ( Frontier Tower
in 2011), and Bonita, that is now the Magic ( Fantasy Tower
in 2012).
Notice that?
Each tower will now be named after three of the original four lands of
Disneyland .
Four lands.
Three towers? Hmmm... So what about a fourth tower named after the other land?
A
Tomorrow Tower .
Well, that'll have to wait and see.
When the original proposal for expanding the park was designed, there were plans to give the DLH an additional fourth tower during the makeover of the park, were the
We st COT
designs to get approval.
In addition to the other wonderful new hotels (a future post, btw) that were to grace a lovely curving Disneyland Drive, was a revamped version of the hotel that started it all.
But we all know what happened to those plans. But when
WDI
set about taking all three towers and giving them a retro-makeover, the initial plans were/are to turn the buildings into something akin to the 50's/60's version of the future just as the
Contemporary Resort
in
WDW
does.
But with everything and every plan, there is room left for future development.
And that is one of the bits of blue sky that could happen if and when the time is right. Before the economy went into the tank, the
Disneyland Resort
had occupancy rates of close to 90%, compared to around 70% for the
Walt Disney World Resort .
Not bad, but as we know, when the recession happened there was a dip in spending and bookings.
The rates haven't gotten back to those levels from a few years ago, but they don't appear to be decreasing any further.
Should the economy start to take off and bookings begin to rise, then that expansion would move forward and a fourth tower would be become closer to being a reality instead of a fantasy. So there are three towers named after three of the original lands, a fourth tower would need a name that thematically went along with the other towers.
I wonder what that name could/would be? I guess we'll just have to find out
tomorrow ...

Getting Tangled...
The actual
first teaser trailer
for
Walt Disney Pictures ' " Tangled " has been released... This is the same one which will be before " Toy Story 3 " next weekend.
As for what it shows, there is really very little of the story shown in context.
The trailer is marketed very edgy, and is naturally trying to play up to the market that the
Mouse
thinks it missed out on in " The Princess and the Frog ." Males/Young Boys. It comes off closer to pop-cultury references, but don't worry about that rock song being in the film.
From what I've heard this is marketing for the trailer and the film has songs that play more classically, like
B&B .
The few I've talked to about the film said it's actually quite good, and Lasseter and the directors have been busy tightening up the story.
Little tweaks here and there and most everyone is happy with the result despite a very crunched schedule. Let down your guard, go over to the recently activated
official website
and give it a look...

Blue Sky Buzz: Try All & Era...
Wow... Wonderful... Friday a whole new era begins for the
Disneyland
Resort ... Those that have seen
World of Color
know what I'm talking about.
Having seen it three times now, I can tell you that it's a game changer for the resort and the theme park.
Starting this week,
DCA
will make its first, bold step toward becoming a Disney destination, not a Disney abomination. You can already see some of the changes in how the park is being marketed in the new
commercials
and billboards for the event.
It truly crosses the line that ends the
Pressler Era
for good and moves forward into a bright future for
Disney Parks
the world over. So, what is it that is so different?
First off, scale.
The scale of this endeavor is big.
Really big.
More than any project so far seen in this park.
When this show is seen by the public it will give them a sense that things have changed.
Things are different in Disney's Second Gate in California.
There's now a reason to come through those turnstiles.
I've seen the show three times myself and it's incredibly beautiful with one of my first reactions to it as how different it feels from anything else that the Mouse has tried to pull off there since the 2001 park opening.
It doesn't feel like a stopgap measure, as many other "events" have.
This feels amazing and spectacular, an entertainment show that you would see in a park like Disneyland itself were it to have the real estate to actually pull it off.
That is going to be one of the great benefits of the bay at Paradise Pier.
And it's going to be a great alternative to those that have seen entertainment over in the Rivers of America and are looking for something else. The one thing that some people will be critical of is the narrative of the show.
There is none.
Being as almost everything that Disney does from attractions to films, a storyline is usually involved, but WOC is a string of beautiful scenes combined with powerful, cutting edge technology that are connected by nothing else.
And no, Disney wasn't trying to be lazy.
There actually was a storyline in the beginning of the concept and it survived all the way through much of the testing phase.
But it didn't work, so bits were replaced and changed as the show was worked on.
If you've seen some of the videos on
YouTube
and think you've seen it then realize that you probably haven't.
There have been at least five versions on display during late night testing and this is the final version for the opening. Missing is the little character known as "Squirt" that was supposed to be making an appearance throughout the scenes as a water creature that was going to tie certain scenes together.
All of the scenes of paper mache animation as well.
The
Cheshire Cat
scenes may have looked good on the small screen, but spread out over three hundred feet they didn't look near as attractive and so they were cut.
It will probably have little tweaks made over the coming years and add/drop scenes just as " Fantasmic !" has done.
There is even early, blue sky talk of having customized shows for specific events, like Christmas or perhaps Halloween as time goes by.
But that won't likely happen the first few year, just like " Toy Story Midway Mania " was designed so programs could be switched out and new things added in little time, so will this show do/be eventually. Come this fall, the front entrance will start to become a mess of walls and construction like many other parts of the park and a little more than a year later, Disney fans' eyes will drink in an incredibly detailed, lovingly crafted and themed new front entrance that evokes the idealized version of the Los Angeles Walt saw when he stepped off that train looking for his American dream.
This Christmas will not likely be very themed in DCA as the room/space that could be used in very limited, but once the front area is turned into something far better than a gaudy extension of
The Block in Orange , you can expect something during the holiday season to rival Disneyland's Main Street decorations.
A very
California Christmas
I would say/imagine.
With themed entertainment that the park is working on making guest feel like they've gone back in time to what it must have been like in an earlier part of the Golden State's holiday history.
Events that park goers experience during Holidays 2012/13 are going to have them looking back on what was DCA when it opened as a faint, drifting bad dream.
The young ones that first enter the park then will have to be told that all this wonder as a far better sight than what they remember a decade ago.
They won't believe you. And about that time, as the first phase of the
Extreme Makeover
comes to a close, people will start to see the improvements coming to the original park start to take place as well as the announcement of an addition Disney hotel if attendance and spending continue to rise from current levels.
But that's another story for another posts (just like the beginning of the second phase of expansion at DCA which won't start till probably 2014 or so). The future is bright for Southern California over the coming decade and we Disney Fans/Geeks can look forward to the evolving plans finally turning what was said to be a resort into an actual one...

Warner's Wish List...
Here we come Marvel... Just as
Disney / Marvel
is moving ahead with its men-in-tights plans, so is
Warner / DC ... DC Entertainment 's Chief Creative Officer,
Geoff
Johns
recently spoke to
Newsarama
about the future of Warner's comic book properties and while he couldn't/wouldn't say that these projects were greenlit, he did stress the ones that he'd like to see.
Since he caries a lot of weight in what happens there you can bet much of this has a good chance of actually coming true.
Here are some of what he'd like to see: Wonder Woman
- Princess Diana of Amazon Island, has been the subject of a comic, the " Super Friends " animated series,
William
Dozier 's
attempted 60's series
that was/would have been disastrous, a
70's television series
and numerous other merchandising efforts, but a theatrical release has long evaded her.
Even
Joss
Whedon 's resume and script were not enough to get her off the ground and into theaters apparently.
Johns thinks that's about to change and
Diane Nelson
and the others at DCE seemed determined to bring her into the modern reality.
For anyone that has never heard of this character (really?), she's princess from a tall race of Amazon women sent from her hidden island paradise to the world of man to basically, save man from himself.
Go, girl power!
I am curious to find out what talent gets attached to this because it'll not only show us they're serious, but exactly what kind of direction they're headed. Blue Beetle
-
Not, the
Ted Kord
version, which is my favorite (and the inspiration for
Daniel Dreiberg/Nite Owl ), but the
Jaime Reyes
version that is the most different and recent.
For the many that haven't heard of this title, Reyes is a young teen in Texas that finds a blue beetle scarab that happens to be an ancient technological instrument of war.
He takes it home and while asleep, the devise connects or fuses itself to his back.
The scarab is actually an alien tool of battle that works with and against Reyes to give him access to incredible powers. Sleeper
- The comic book series written by
Ed Brubaker
with art by
Sean
Phillips
about an undercover agent placed in a secret organization.
That agent happens to have had contact with an alien artifact that allows him to feel no pain and actually store up that pain to pass on to others.
He rises within the organization, trapped by its power and continually working to destroy it.
Along the way he falls for member of the organization and it only complicates matters.
Think of this as a " The Departed " meets " The X-Files " that would make an amazing movie if done right.
It's been in
Development Hell
for
Tom
Cruise
for quite some time. Suicide Squad
- Think of this as a superhero version of the "A-Team."
A group of former/current(?) villains were sent by government operatives to take care of a mission that was perceived to be suicidal... hence the name Suicide Squad.
The story involves government intrigue, espionage, back stabbing and infighting as well as saving the nation they fought against from destruction.
Given the right writer and director, this could be a fun action film, sans the cheesy costumes of course ( A prime example being the characters in
The X-Men
films ). 100 Bullets
- Johns mentioned trying to get a version of this limited series comic to the screen.
For those that don't remember, this is one of the titles I mentioned the Mouse should try and make in my " Without Tights " post pre-MA * .
The comic series, written by
Brian Azzarello
and illustrated by
Eduardo
Risso
was published under the
Vertigo
imprint and is a tale of revenge and possible redemption.
Each story has an agent show up to some aggrieved person to present them with a gun and 100 bullets that are totally untraceable, with this weapon they will be able to get away without anyone knowing that they killed the person responsible for their predicament.
The events play out on a larger canvas as the story unfolds and becomes more complex.
This would make an excellent television series if done correctly. He also mentioned a couple of projects that are now considered a given ( Batman #7/3 ,
Man of Steel ,
Green Lantern
and a likely
Flash ).
These are projects I'm sure you'll be hearing more about in the future, say around
Comic-Con 2010 ? Interesting things are ahead in the very, near present I'd say...
