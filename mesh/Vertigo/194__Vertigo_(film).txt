Trailer Review: This is 40 - Twenty Times Two
With a title dropped of final prediction from the sky, another Judd Apatow movie is upon us, this time, about mid-life, its crisis and reconciliation. Let's pull the file on Apatow: TV debut with Freaks and Geeks (high school), Knocked Up (parenthood), Funny People (mortality), 40 Year Old Virgin (women) - and a number of producing credits all proves a Woody Allen ambition to chronicle the turning points of life with a comedic touch. He's chosen to look at these milestones through the gaze of a gen-x American male, and, as someone born after 1970, I've never been able to empathize with his man-child stereotype. I can check some boxes of his profile, but the big one I can't and haven't really seen it in others my age is the fear of women. It's the cornerstone of the bromance genre and he's the chief contributor to the mythology. Growing old isn't fun, but Apatow has never gotten any of his characters to confront that truth - instead, they avoid it by staying somewhere with the lost boys in neverland. Women are the ones trying to pull them into the present, as Rudd's wife does by giving him a carpe diem speech to jump on the trampoline with the kids and fall in love with her again from extra long takes in the bathroom. The start of this trailer has Paul Rudd and a friend overstuffed into cyclist spandex chilling out at a corner coffee shop after a long ride, dreaming about the death of their first wives for a restart with a fresher second. It's the type of buddy talk one overhears waiting in line for coffee on a Sunday morning, the pleasant recognition of same experiences that maybe we could have coffee with everyone. Wishing for another life is honest, but new wife fantasies are just as wasteful as thinking we were getting laid all the time in our youth. It's destructive nostalgia, untrue of our past and not helping our futures. Talk like this tests those limits and divide the people in this world from who you are to what everyone else is: losers. Then we take our latte to go. Opening December 21, 2012, Verdict: Wait for the Critics

Ain't Over Until the Fat Man Sings
If you love film too much, you'll eventually find your way to the British Film Institute's Sight and Sound poll of the
50 greatest films of all time . What makes the list special is it's not a survey of common opinion or one film geek's midnight rant, but an elite snobbery of know-it-alls of over 800 critics, academics, etc. making a
judgement
every ten years. If it sounds repressive, it's not. There's no required reading, long winded essays or grand theories, just a numbered column to jump off or climb up, whichever is more fun. You discover it, and with a first look, you feel part of the club, because there will be films in the top-ten that you've seen and probably liked ( 2001, The Godfather - seen it, not bad, not bad at all! ). Then there will be movies you've maybe heard or not at all ( Tokyo Story, Rules of the Game, 8-1/2 ) and you'll give them a try because the list already likes some of your tastes. After seeing those great movies, you'll come back for more, watch the rest of the ten and further into the fifty. You've made a lifelong friend. So this friend had a birthday last week, but didn't look the same. Another ten years, The old master is still a fat man, but he shaved his beard. He looks younger. The other thing about this friend was his last name was Kane. It was always Kane. It was what made the list different from everyone else. You knew about
Citizen Kane
- maybe caught a clip on TV or puzzled at a lone figure posted to an activity board in college, large as a giant posing like a pair of scissors - saw it and thought what a boring film. But it sat on the top of this numbered text saying to you no, you're not looking hard enough. So you'd press play, again, and again, until you figured it out. It suddenly made sense. Cinema changed with a dying whisper for a winter sled. There was BK and AK. Like the keystone to an arch, if you pulled it away, the whole thing would tumble. But someone did, and it stayed up, floated in the air against gravity. WTF. The feeling is
Vertigo . I've often thought that the choice for top films were really critics deciding the greatest directors, then picking the best representative film from that artist's work. Which is why the
director's picks
are similar, but with a surprise every few feet that feels less checklist and more argument.
Citizen Kane
was on top because of its historic importance. What is
Vertigo ? It's about a man haunted by a dead girl who maybe comes back as a ghost. It doesn't hold any new breakthrough in the medium, suggest new forms of narration or mark a turning point in Hitchcock's style or subject matter. Maybe the answer lies in what it isn't. It's not European, black and white, and from that high point of the sixties new wave, a film somewhere between
Breathless
and
The Seventh Seal
that heroically put the 'art' in cinema. Instead, the winner is a populist Hollywood picture, done in technicolor, that received mild reviews on first day from a genre director who many thought did better work. Detective Scottie Ferguson's (Jimmy Stewart) fear of heights has become the critical cliché of our obsession with film: how we fall for and can't resist its gravity in our lives. This time, we've forgotten history and our intellect, and instead lost all our senses for love. Update:
Of course, everyone is putting their two cents into this. The best I've read is from
Scott Tobias
at AV Club who bravely defends the choices and how great this list is against the tide of
predictable
cowards
dismissing
the whole ritual as irrelevant. I guess you wouldn't find
surprises
out of the
blue
like this.

Trailer Review: Cloud Atlas - History's Puzzles
Whatever you think of the result, this year has been an amazing one of ambition from Hollywood. Yes, a lot of the creative work is channeled into sequels, but the risk taking is there. I saw
The Dark Knight Rises
last night, and although it was uneven, I couldn't help but marvel at what it took to put the production together. It was easy to see the hard work. Moreover, for being a third sequel, there was genuine inspiration to tell a good story, against making an easy franchise cash-in. Hollywood isn't lazy. Consider the trailer for
Cloud Atlas . A new film from the Wachowskis (The Matrix) based on a thick
book
by David Mitchell that connects stories across a thousand years (or more) in literary fireworks that would seem folly to bottle up in a two hour movie. But that is exactly what Wachowskis are doing. It's usually not good when the directors introduce how great their trailer is, but this is essential to watch, because their back story of how they discovered and got this film financed tells the difficulties (even for established) and solutions to getting movies made. The trailer is over five minutes long. That's a hard pitch that risks boredom, and it seems to start that way with people from different points in history asking questions about life to the drops of piano keys, getting worse when Tom Hanks's voiceover is heard reminding of Forrest Gump's too sweet box of chocolates. But then we're in the future, hurrying at an action pace of escape in a florescent urban city and chases on rocket bikes.
DEATH, LIFE, BIRTH. FUTURE, PRESENT, PAST. LOVE, HOPE, COURAGE. EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED. I cringe when I see big titles like that in a trailer. I feel like I'm browsing the greeting card aisle at Walgreens, forced to get something for that event I had to go to and say thank you. Just sign and send it. But I've read this book, and can say, it's not as life affirming as this trailer looks, but it's also not a complete downer. It's complicated lit, the kind movies usually can't put on screen. So this is shooting for the clouds, but there's enough ingenuity these days, they may get up that high in a slow balloon to a fast rocket. Opening October 26, 2012, Verdict: Must See
