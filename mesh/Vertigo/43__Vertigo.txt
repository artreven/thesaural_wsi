Fact Many Studies Have Proven Danger : Sleep Apnea Treatment : Sleep Apnea Symptoms : Get Up Fresh
Heart Problems
Sleep apnea has been
associated with:
accelerated
coronary
atherogenesis .
precipitation of
myocardial infarction .
malignant
cardiac
dysrhythmias .
systemic
hypertension .
pulmonary
hypertension .

ventricular
failure.
An estimated 50% of
congestive
heart failure
patients and many patients with
atrial
fibrillation
have
central or mixed
sleep apneas , often with a
Cheyne-Stokes respiration
pattern.
Failure to control the sleep-related breathing problems can lessen the
effectiveness of treatments for
heart failure
and
result in accelerated deterioration of heart function.
Hormone And Enzyme Problems
Sleep apnea may worsen
insulin
resistance in
women with
polycystic
ovary syndrome .

function,
glucose
tolerance
and body weight.
Sleep apnea has been
associated with chronic liver injury with
steatohepatitis
and elevated liver enzymes.
Stomach Problems
GE reflux
tends to worsen markedly
during sleep, particularly in regard to episode durations: as a consequence of
recumbent posture, greatly reduced swallowing frequency, diminished awareness
of episodes and (in many patients) due to aggravation by sleep apnea.
Sleep apnea is
associated with sleep-related
GE
reflux , and treatment of sleep apnea can improve
GERD .
Age Problems
Daytime sleepiness has
been identified as a major predictor of reduced lifespans and increased risk of
cardiovascular disease in elderly women, who also were found in another study
to have a higher mortality rate from sleep apnea than elderly men.
Many sedative
hypnotics
given widely to
geriatric
patients worsen
sleep apnea, while increasing the risk of nocturnal confusion, sleepwalking and
self-injury during sleep.

found in several studies in approximately 60% of male stroke victims.
Female Problems
The prevalence of sleep
apnea increases rapidly after menopause, a trend that is likely to be increased
by avoidance of hormone replacement therapy.
Sleep-related breathing
disorders are far more common in women than originally thought, and frequently
take the form of upper airway resistance syndrome which is frequently found in
individuals of normal body weight who do not snore excessively.
Some studies have found
sleep-related breathing abnormalities in the majority of patients suffering
from
fibromyalgia : a
condition more common in women.
Some women develop
sleep apnea during pregnancies, necessitating a careful history.
Blood Problems
Sleep apnea has been
associated with
thalassemia
as a consequence of nasal obstruction arising from
extramedullary
hematopoiesis .
Lymphomas
involving the upper
airway can lead to sleep apnea.
Polycythemia
has been
identified in some patients with severe sleep apnea.
Treatment of
anemia
has been found to improve
sleep apnea in congestive heart failure patients.

Studies have shown
sleep apnea syndrome in 44%, insomnia in 41% and periodic limb movement
syndrome in 34% of patients with kidney failure on maintenance dialysis.
Renal transplantation
has been reported to eliminate sleep apnea in patients with kidney failure.
Acoustic reflectance
studies found
pharyngeal
narrowing in kidney failure patients: a possible factor in the pathogenesis of
sleep apnea.
Restless legs syndrome
connected to sleep apnea is strongly associated with renal failure.
Sleep apnea was
reported to be the cause of
nocturia
in 40% of men seeking help for that complaint: a phenomenon mediated by
increased release of
atrial
natriuretic peptide .
Hypertension
is a
recognized complication of sleep apnea.
Reports have
recommended assessment for sleep apnea in patients with kidney disease who are
hypertensive.
Sleep apnea has been
associated with
microalbuminuria ,
and hypertensive sleep apnea patients have an increased prevalence of renal
function abnormalities.
Nerve Problems
Sleep related seizures
can result from the tendency (in many patients) for seizures to occur primarily
during sleep, seizure precipitation by sleep-related cardiac
dysrhythmia
or breathing
disorders, or a combination of both.
A significant number of
patients seeking evaluation for possible
Alzheimer's dementia
instead suffer from reversible cognitive and memory difficulties arising from
sleep apnea.
Treatment of sleep
apnea has been found to improve cognition in some patients with
Alzheimer's dementia .
Sleep apnea has been
found in several studies in approximately 60% of male
stroke
victims.

associated with a large number of neurologic disorders including
myotonic dystrophy
and other muscular dystrophies,
syringobulbia ,
syringomyelia ,
Arnold-Chiaric
malformation ,
poliomyelitis
and
post-polio
syndrome ,

atrophy ,
Shy-Drager
Syndrome ,
Parkinson's
disease ,

can be
associated with restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement syndrome
associated with sleep apnea.

An association has been
reported between sleep apnea and:
glaucoma
and optic nerve perfusion deficits.
papilledema .
pseudotumor cerebri .
FloppyEyelid Syndrome .
precipitation of
visual loss in
non-arteritic AION
(Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy)
patients, felt to be mediated by

hypotension .
Optic nerve disease has been
linked to increased napping and sleep-wake cycle abnormalities.
Aqueous humor
flow decreases during sleep.
Visually impaired seniors have
been found to have a higher prevalence of sleep complaints.
Ear, Nose And Throat Problems
Narrowing of the upper
airway at any level and from any cause can increase the likelihood of
obstructive sleep apnea.
Otolaryngologic
surgical
procedures appear of frequent benefit in pediatric sleep apnea.
Vertigo
upon awakening and
during sleep onset has been associated with sleep-related seizures, sleep apnea

by a number of drugs commonly utilized in pain management, including those
administered
epidurally .

Many children with
symptoms suggesting
attention
deficit disorder
suffer from underlying sleep disorders such as sleep apnea
and narcolepsy.
Children with
sleep-related breathing disorders often suffer from
upper
airway resistance syndrome (UARS)
which can be readily missed by
conventional sleep monitoring techniques. UARS frequently afflicts non-obese
patients and in many cases is not associated with significant snoring.

Depression , irritability,
impotence , diminished
libido ,

and narcolepsy.
Patients with symptoms
of chronic fatigue and
fibromyalgia

reflux
which in turn is associated with sleep apnea in many patients.
Treatment of sleep apnea can help address both these problems.
Patients with both
chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease
