The 25 Most Influential People in Comic Book Movies: #15 Gilbert Adler
May 13, 2008 — sophosmoros
Gilbert Adler
kept the Crypt Keeper alive, as it were, owing a great deal of his accomplishment to his antecedent, the late writer/producer
#24 Milton Subotsky . Where Subotsky first brought
EC Comics
stories to the screen with the original
Tales from the Crypt
in 1972, Adler continued the tradition through the 1980s and ‘90s.
Adler started by directing the Crypt Keeper sequences in HBO’s “ Tales from the Crypt ” television show in 1989, directing two full episodes in 1992 and 1993, and writing several episodes between ‘91 and ‘96.
During this time, he produced over 60 episodes of “Tales from the Crypt” for HBO.
In 1995, he directed Crypt Keeper sequences for the big screen in
Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight , which he also produced.
He soon directed, produced, and wrote the screenplay for his own feature length Crypt film
Bordello of Blood
in 1996.
In subsequent years he has served as the executive producer for DC/ Vertigo ’s
Constantine  (produced by
#16 Lauren Shuler Donner ,
#8 Benjamin Melniker  and
#5 Michael E. Uslan ) released in 2005, and as a producer of
Superman Returns , also produced, directed, and co-written by
#9 Bryan Singer , released in 2006.
He is reportedly set to produce the Superman sequel,
Superman: Man of Steel , again with Singer, scheduled for release in June of 2009. He may also be the executive producer of the
sequel to
Constantine  (also with Shuler Donner producing) if the film is ever actually made.
