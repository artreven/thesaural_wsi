Super Party Soul Sisters!
About Us Two protons expelled at each coupling site creates the mode of force, the embryo becomes a fish though we don't enter until a plate, we're here to experience, evolve the little toe, atrophy, don't ask me how, I'll be dead in a thousand light years, thank you, thank you, genesis turns to its source, reduction occurs step wise though the essence is all one, end of line. FTL system check. Diagnostic functions within parameters repeats the harlequin, the agony exquisite, the colors run the path of ashes...

embedded Summary:
"You look just like my Laura." - Leland Palmer Notes:
This vid was created for Vividcon 2010's Challenge Vidshow. The theme was "Self Portrait" and I chose to go for the literal interpretation based entirely upon the fact that when Leland Palmer picks up that police sketch of BOB and says, "I know him," he is indeed looking at a portrait of himself...he just doesn't know it. (Or does he?! dundundunnnn.) My intention was to be true to both the horror and the pain that possessed this man to transplant his obsession with Laura onto all of his victims. BOB represents the most terrible cycle of violence and the fate that befalls Maddy Ferguson is even more horrific in that, ultimately, it was inevitable. Somehow, with Laura Palmer's ghost hanging around, it's easy to forget about Maddy, that she was her own person and not just a sweet girl in hipster glasses who had the misfortune of having her dead cousin's pretty face. So this is as much a Maddy vid as it is a Leland vid because they deserve it. The concept of vertigo - introduced within the context of the show as demonstrated by the first shot of Leland in the police station when his world literally starts to spin - gave me an in to explore it further and adapt it aesthetically for this vid.
Twin Peaks
is a VERY static show, but for Leland everything is rocking and spinning. The fact that Madeleine Ferguson is herself a specific reference to Hitchcock's
Vertigo
was an added bonus. Password:
Wow Bob Wow FOG These broken arms won't hold you down These ruptured lungs won't make a sound These syllables won't bring you back, Won't stitch the holes, no bones intact And I can't pretend that you were there And I can't pretend I held your hand And I miss your smile I miss your smile I need you now I need you now And I am not scared of falling down I am not scared of dark dark clouds I miss your smile I miss your smile I need you now I need you now

Wow, glad I got to see this now!
That was unsettling and really well put together.
I love the constant movement and how it goes from somewhat controlled to unraveling at the end, if that makes sense.

Wow! That was... quite disturbing, actually. I mean, not that your vid was- Well, it was but not actually- I mean,
it
wasn't, it just-- ALRIGHT LET ME START OVER!!! This was really fantastically edited. I have to say, though, that I haven't seen Twin Peaks (DON'T KILL ME!), and other than the fact that there's a dead girl called Laura Palmer, I really don't know much about it, so I only knew so far as what you've shown in the vid, but I really loved it. The best part about it is how it starts all "normal", but then there's a point where the song starts repeating itself and the clips too, and you see this guy going round and round in circles and it becomes something else completely. I loved that progression! Fantastic job as always!

Haha! I won't kill you for not watching Twin Peaks...yet! :PPPP
No but seriously, thank you! I'm glad you got to feel the frenzy at the end. There's some really disturbing stuff happening in context, so I'm glad you could feel it out of context as well.
Thank you!!! :D

Twin Peaks is a VERY static show, but for Leland everything is rocking and spinning. So true. Almost as if BOB is a whirlpool or a black hole, sucking everyone around him down into his abyss. Which works with Maddy's 'inevitable' death simply because she's too close and gets caught in the pull of gravity. I think the song choice is perfect, especially these two lines: These syllables won't bring you back, Won't stitch the holes, no bones intact Great vid, saving to my bookmarks.

(I actually pulled it off a post-Children of Earth, Torchwood mix I never finished.) It was perfect to vid to as it packed such a punch in such a short time. It really leaves you sitting there, thinking about it afterwards.
Thanks so much for watching and I'm thrilled you enjoyed!!!

SO UHM. I'VE SEEN IT 6 OR 7 TIMES. AND.
There might be some teary eyes over here.
I just. Have a Lynch feeling and Lynch feelings make me very sad indeed. :/ Obviously the story is tragic and heartbreak-inducing on the show but the way you condensed it here just has a huge impact on me. I clearly cannot be coherent about this: this vid just makes me
feel so many feelings~~!
Emotionally, for me, the arrival of Maddy at 0:43, BOB in the mirror at 1:11, Leland picking Maddy up at 1:15 and then spinning her around intercut with him spinning around with Laura's picture (sdfkjsklfj) are the most powerful moments. FKGJDFKLGJ Also, your choice of song! I looked up the band and they're not from the '90s at all but the song has a '90s feel to me and it just seems so in tune with the feel of the show. On the technical side of the things, I BOW DOWN TO YOUR PERSON because damn, woman, you made the show move so much haha! I love how the visuals respond to the bass especially (I love all of the bass-cuts,
all of them,
but especially the little section at around :33/:34.) But you already know you're my favourite vidder EVER.

UGH BB, HOW YOU HAVE SUCH A WAY WITH WORDS?!!! I mean, LYNCH FEELINGS! That's exactly what it is and I'm thrilled beyond words that you got it from this tiny thing of a vid! No seriously, I was a bit of a wreck when making this since it is, as you said, the whole tragedy condensed and just IN YO FACE. It really does hurt, and it does stay with you, that Lynch feeling. Oh Maddy!!! :'(((((( I seriously can't deal with your comments ever, they're just too great and wonderful and I don't know how you manage it. THANK YOU SO MUCH! *clings to you*

i can't pretend i held your hand
I need to take a shower after that horrid and disturbing vid. I loved it. The dancing and kissing and twirling and the hits and the back and forth between Leland and BOB.

Re: i can't pretend i held your hand
YES! I...totally wanted that sort of reaction. The need to shower!
In all seriousness, thanks so much for your comment. It really is a disturbing subject to deal with and when its received in such a guttural way that means I did my job as the show did its job on me when I watched it!

I just watched the challenge disc today and was so blown away by this. I thought it was by you, but wasn't sure, so that was cool when I find it especially awesome despite not really knowing who it's by. I LOVED the build-up of atmosphere; it worked perfectly. I LOVED the intercutting and the circular movement and how well you built Maddy into the narrative. Just gorgeous, heart-rending stuff.

Ahhh! What a glorious coincidence. :D Sometimes I feel bad that I took the challenge so literally when pretty much everyone decided to go for the meta interpretation, but eh, it is what it is and I'm thrilled you enjoyed it! The Maddy storyline was truly devastating and she's often forgotten by everyone. There's a fabulous fic I once read from Yuletide that basically argued that Maddy's destiny was to be stuck in this loop where she takes on Laura's identity and that the Laura we saw in the Black Lodge was really Maddy. It was such a fascinating read because it was based on what we saw in the show, this terrible, heart-wrenching truth. Anyway thanks again for the lovely comment! :D

Damn lj for failing me, I haven't seen this yet! Very evocative and disturbing, and I love how you flicker back and forth between Leland and Bob.

Awesome! I am obssessed with Maddy even 20+ years later after seeing TP when I was 7. It particulary struck me what you said she was her own person, after the devastation that she suffers, I was always angry how she is brushed aside after they found her body and just mentioned very casually, especially because she was so sweet and pretty. It's as if the underlying commentary was that sweet and innocent girls get killed all the time so let's not spend too much time on this.

Thanks for this comment! And I completely agree with you. I watched Twin Peaks only a few years ago but thankfully was completely unspoiled and when the big reveal happened...well I was stunned to say the least. Lynch and Frost did such a brilliant job with the Laura Palmer storyline, but they literally lost steam in the story once they revealed Leland. However, they had such a fascinating character in Maddy who honestly deserved the attention! So many more parallels could have been drawn, and certainly with the established Cooper/Laura fascination it would have been even more epic to explore Maddy. Not sure how into fanfic you are, but
here is a BRILLIANT example
of the kind of things that could have been explored way further.
