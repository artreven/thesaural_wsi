VERTIGO – Simple Exercises
You feel dizzy, unstable, nausea, sweaty, the room is spinning and you are
floating about crazily, try lying down and the moment you rise – starts all
over again.
The first attack caught me by surprise, without
any warning, very scary indeed as I have never been through dizzy spells before. A few hours in
the hospital for thorough examination, tests and observation, the doctor explained
to me what
Vertigo
is all about. Phew… what a relief, something’s
just not right with my inner ears!

I was very lucky my first experiences happened at home but imagine if one is driving a car, swimming, climbing the stairs
or carrying your baby etc?
Roughly a third of patients have such recurrences within
a year of treatment and half have recurrences within five years, do you need to
carry the pills with you at all times?
There are vertigo exercises that you can
do at home to help manage these attacks, simple steps that will take less than
5minutes of your time, it works. There are many videos posted in the internet
to help you with these exercises.

cookingvarieties February 19, 2012 at 3:20 PM hi katrina, dizziness sounds like a scary symptom of abnormal blood pressure or the coming of stroke. never realized that it also relates to vertigo. thanks for highlighting this.
for me, i will get dizzy spells if the air is stagnant or if my blood pressure is low.
have a nice day, hope you are in great health, take care. Reply Delete katrina February 19, 2012 at 9:50 PM CV, First time can be frightening - horrible and scary. Important to see the doctors to analyse cause of dizziness. Sometimes we hear popping sounds coming from one side of the ear. Some suggested it helps to drink iced water, I tried, Ok for temporary relief. But those excercises really help. Cheers Reply Delete Add comment Load more...
