NYT Saturday 12/12/09 - Fill of the Year?
The fill of this Saturday
New York Times
crossword is just delightful: it could well be the best this year. I started off reasonably well in the NW corner, but couldn't find the ends of
The Natural
or
work permit
(wanted
working age ) until towards the end.
Getting roadblocked there, I worked down the left-hand side, again getting into difficulties with endings at
coalbin
(thought
coalbox
better suited to a Scrabbly Saturday grid). Continuing in a counter-clockwise direction, I was left with the tricky northeast sector (not really a corner, as a swathe above and to the right of the plus sign was largely empty).
Here,
Velázquez
was critical and if I'd just known at the beginning that he was the painter of "Lady With a Fan", my solving time might have been halved. This answer unlocked a whole bunch of downs, including the wonderful
Bridezilla
- this is apparently its first appearance in a New York Times puzzle.
At the end, I just had to correct one mistake: like many others I suspect, I had
Velasquez
and thought
Sachbraff
an unlikely name, even for an actor. It took a couple of minutes to realize that the answer would need to be parsed as a (4,5) ... hence
Zach Braff .
Solving time: 32 mins ( solo, no solving aids )
Clue of the puzz: 12d
Bridezilla
{Hard-to-please wedding participant}

New To Me
14a
The Natural
{Moniker for fictional baseballer Roy Hobbs}.
The
at the start seemed likely from the outset, but it took a long time to get the second word.
The Natural
is about fictional baseballer Roy Hobbs, written by
Bernard Malamud . Hobbs is a baseball prodigy who is shot by an obsessed fan. The story is loosely based on the career of
Philadelphia Phillies
player
Eddie Waitkus .
Robert Redford
starred in
the 1984 movie version .
16a
acro-
{Tip end: Prefix}. This is still a bit of a puzzle: "Tip" on its own makes sense, but "Tip end" seems tautologous ... should there have been a comma between the words? Anyway,
acro-
comes from the Greek
akron
meaning "tip" or "end" and
akros
meaning "highest" or "outermost". Hence
acrophobia
... cue the great
Vertigo .
49a
LA Raider
{'84 Super Bowl celebrant}. I gather
LA Raiders
was the name of the
Oakland Raiders
from 1982 to 1994, the name change coinciding with moves from
Oakland, CA
to
LA
and back. In
Super Bowl XVIII , the
LA Raiders
beat the
Washington Redskins
38 to 9.
58a
Skee
{Rapper ___-Lo}. I've gradually gotten used to
Skee-Ball , but today it's clearly time to ring the changes, because we get the second NYT appearance ever of
Skee-Lo
the nom de rap of
Antoine Roundtree . After some success in the 1990s,
Skee-Lo
disappeared for nine years but is making a comeback this year with the 2009 album
Overdose .
3d
pero
{Spanish "but"}. Not seen
pero
before - another new entry for my
Español para los crucigramistas . In what circumstances might you be expected to have come across this? Maybe from the song
Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No
(" I thank you, but no" ) recorded by
Alejandro Sanz
and
Shakira .
5d
caper
{Rémoulade bit}.
Rémoulade
is a term I come across so occasionally that its meaning never quite sticks in the mind. It's a French (surprise, surprise) condiment somewhat like
tartar sauce . It's made with eggs, herbs and
capers , and sometimes mayo, and is typically served with fish.
29d
Zach Braff
{"Scrubs" Emmy nominee}.
Zach Braff
is not a familiar name to me, so I had the answer starting S until the last minute when I realized it had to be a (4,5) and not a nine-letter surname.
Braff
first became known in 2001 for his role as
John 'J.D.' Dorian
on
Scrubs . He has since expanded into film directing, working on the coming-of-age movie
Garden State
(2004).
44d
Jardin
{Paris's ___ des Plantes}. Where would plants grow in Paris? Why, a
jardin , of course! But I hadn't come across this name before: the
Jardin des Plantes
is France's premier botanical garden, so roughly equivalent to Britain's
Kew Gardens , I imagine.
Noteworthy
45a
ryas
{Scandinavian area rugs}. I've noticed
rya rugs
several times in my travels through
The Chambers Dictionary . There aren't that many words starting RY, so it's prominent on the last R page. Naturally, I've never seen one of these "Scandinavian knotted-pile rugs with a distinctive colorful pattern", so it's time to remedy that. [Apparently the Finnish equivalent is a
ryijy
- might be witty to get that in a Saturday puzzle some day!]
2d
Shor
{Old Manhattan restaurateur}. My introduction to
Toots Shor
on
Friday 13th February
was a bit of a rude awakening, but since then he's been my friend in crosswords (with or without the Toots) and is a helpful gimme in a puzzle like this (referencing the guy being the only option if you happen to get SHOR as an answer).
12d
Bridezilla
{Hard-to-please wedding participant}. Such a delight to get this answer! This is my "clue of the puzz" more for the answer than the clue. I kind of expected the answer to be one of the ancillary participants, like the groom's mother. But of course it had to be a
Bridezilla . How come we don't use the wonderful -zilla suffix more, as in Bridgezilla, Blogzilla ... its use seems to be largely restricted to software naming. Our wedding preparation had none of the Sturm und Drang that we see in this clip - thank you Magdalen.
21d
Pequot
{Early Connecticut tribe}. Once I'd got the Q in third place, I could start to think seriously about this answer. I could see that the
Pequod
would fit, but remembered from somewhere that the tribal name, which presumably inspired
Melville , is the
Pequot . In the 17th century, the
Pequot
inhabited much of what is now Connecticut, but the
Pequot War
and
Mystic massacre
virtually eliminated them and the population was recorded as 66 in the 1910 census. There are now two small independent Pequot tribal nations: the
Mashantucket Pequot
and the
Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation
(a.k.a.
Paucatuck Pequot ).
31d
Bel Ami
{Guy de Maupassant novel}.
Bel Ami
(1885) was reasonably fresh in my mind for some reason. It doesn't seem to have been referenced in any NYT puzzles this year, so I guess I must have encountered it in one of the many anthologized New York Sun puzzles I'm working through.
Bel Ami
is the second novel by
Guy de Maupassant
( 1850 – 1893 ) - an author better known for his short stories. It's the story of  a poor ex-NCO's rise to power in Paris,
by manipulating a series of powerful, intelligent, and wealthy mistresses.

Didn't finish this one! Thought I'd got to the point where I was at least finishing every Saturday, but Karen Tracy got me here, and this is not the first time - she, along with Bob Kahn, definitely make
the hardest themelesses for me! Gave up with LARAI?E? to go. Didn't see the double meaning in DEMS, and hadn't heard of JARDIN. I had met up with LARAIDER once in a LAT puzzle, but a) didn't remember and b) parsed it as LARA I?E?, lol. Don't know how I decided LARA was a guy! Also had VELASQUEZ/SACHBRAFF BTW - I'm sure this was the most common error today by miles! The only long gimme for me was BRIDEZILLA, one always feels really cocksure getting something like that off the bat, but the rest of the puzzle was a slow slog, typical for Saturday. Also hadn't heard of Mr. Lo! Thank you for the link to the Spanish "crosswordese" post. Ironically was actually thinking of asking around for something like that this morning! Along with politicians, sports stars, race horses, 40's singers and French words - which is a long list - Spanish words are a particular weak spot, especially as I can never work out if they end in a, e, or o!

Ach! My only miscue today, indeed, was the orthographical blunder of "Velasquez"--I watch so little TV and figure actors have such daft names half the time anyway that I didn't give "sach" the scrutiny it so richly deserved. Two zeds in one name is one too many, in my book, famous painter though you may be!

Thanks both and sorry about Velasquez/Sach Braff. Yes, a list of actors with daft names could be in the offing. I think the award for the daftest name goes to Abe Vigoda, but Magdalen would be better at this game than me. I'm currently working on "Pavlov's Guide to Crosswords". Horse racing would be another great addition to the Crucial Posts. I usually work on one when I get particularly frustrated by a void in my knowledge. LARAIDER looks like a portmanteau of Lara Croft and Tomb Raider.
