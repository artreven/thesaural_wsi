Janet Jackson: The Best/Number Ones – My Album Review
So last week one of the CD’s I picked up was
Janet Jackson’s: The Best , her latest greatest hits LP replacing
“Design of Decade 1986/1996”
and covering all her hits from the
“Control”
album all the way up to 2008’s
“Discipline”.  The CD also includes new single
“Make Me”  which was dubbed as
“A Gift for the Fans”.
I love the CD which is no surprise considering I have all the songs already, but what makes this one different is that you have all the classic songs over two discs rather than having to chop and change over 6 or 7 albums. Also some of the earlier songs sound exceptionally crisp which I love, no guess some remastering was done to bring it up to par with the newer tracks.
What I love about this greatest hits has to be the varation of song styles and topics that span through the 2 discs, something which I find can only be rivaled by possibly
Madonna . Both artists have re-invented themselves throughout the years and manged to have careers that spans over 2 decades. Moving more towards my point, its listening to the CD from start to finish that makes you realise how creative Janet as an artist is before even looking at her music videos. I truly think the real artistry of perfecting your craft was left in the 80s as star’s these days seem to be hooked on talking about the same things and then at last resort sampling something that was more than likely conceived in the 80s.
You have people talking about, money, cars, and sex, or to pin point it more to female artists, going to the club, getting a man, keeping your man, leaving your man and then telling all your girls about it, but what else?, where’s the substance?. Then of course you have a real artist like Janet who writes their own songs, and yes maybe covers some of those topics but also talks about the more important things in life racism, spousal abuse, children, getting a education,  depression, empowering women, taking control of your life, the death of loved ones and several other things. So what astound’s me is when people come to the assumption that all Janet talks about is sex? bullsh*t. Buy the cd’s, buy this cd, listen to the messages, then talk otherwise. Cut it, keep it, seal it, get your facts
in order.

The Sunday Sessions: Whats Playing in my iPod?
Each week I will be posting the top 5 songs I’ve listened to for that week, hopefully you will like it and go check out some of the songs yourself, anyway check out the tracks after the cut. This week my Top 5 are:
1. Janet Jackson  – Make Me (DJ Dan Vocal Edit)
LISTEN
2. Rihanna – Rockstar 101
LISTEN
3. Lady Gaga – So Happy I Could Die
LISTEN
4. Chris Brown – Crawl
LISTEN
5. Jennifer Lopez – Fresh Out The Oven (RE-ENTRY)
LISTEN
This weeks top 5 was a little harder than usual but in the end I got my top 5. Still Janet’s
“Make Me”
is at the top of my list but this time the vocal club remix by DJ Dan, the space like rhythms along with  Janet’s catchy lines has me hooked as I can only think of her dancing while I listen. I also think and hope she performs a club remix of
“Make Me”
on the X-Factor next week to add an extra bit of buzz and exclusivity for the UK
Coming in 2nd is Rihanna’s
“Rockstar 101 ” featuring none other than the legendary
Slash
as guitarist, it’s RiRi’s bad girl lyrics like “6 inch walker, big sh*t talker” and ” baby frisk me good check my panties and my bra” which has got me playing this day and night.

Outrage Over Adam Lambert Dropped For Chris Brown On Good Morning America
American television network
ABC
have decided to drop American Idol finalist
Adam Lambert  from an interview and performance on there morning show
“Good Morning America”
( the US version of GMTV). While the network state he was dropped because they find him unpredictable, however the question remains are they supporting an underlying stigma over gay men in america?. Check out the fox news report below:
ABC has booked Rihanna-beater Chris Brown for an interview and a performance on “Good Morning America” — right after the network canceled guy-kisser Adam Lambert.
Brown will do a taped tell-all with Robin Roberts, followed by a performance of songs from his new album. But TV insiders say the appearance, slated to air the week after next, has outraged feminists and gay activists who wonder why a convicted girlfriend abuser is more palatable to the network than an openly gay man who broke no laws with his raunchy performance on the “American Music Awards.”
An ABC source said, “The network is giving a mixed message — that it doesn’t trust someone who shocked with an unpredictable show and a gay kiss, but then it is happy to go ahead with Chris Brown, who was convicted of felony assault.”
ABC News has insisted that Lambert’s sexual orientation did not play a role in its decision to pull the plug on his “GMA” appearance this week.
ABC insiders said they ruled the “American Idol” star’s sexed-up shenanigans on Sunday’s awards show — which included him groping a female dancer, kissing a male musician and shoving a male dancer’s face into his crotch — were inappropriate for morning TV. One said, “He was not canceled over a gay kiss. He showed himself to be unpredictable on live TV.”
[SOURCE]
Personally I think this whole thing has been blown out of proportion, what Adam did in his performance was nothing to be shocked about at all, one he is openly gay, two female artists have done stuff like that for ages and no one blinks an eye they just cheer it on, i.e.
Madonna
sharing a lesbian kiss with
Britney
and
Christina   just to name one.
I think people should give him a break he’s a performer and he was doing his job, If
Lady Gaga, Madonna,
or
Britney
did anything like that what he did no one would care, just because he’s gay or male doesn’t give anyone a reason to judge him differently. Equality for all.
Case Closed.

Janet Jackson Readies European Tour For 2010
Pop & RnB Goddess
Janet Jackson
has revealed in an interview with the
The Times
newspaper (UK) that she is planning a European tour in 2010.  It has been over 9 years since Janet has embarked on a European leg, the last time was for
“The Velvet Rope”
tour in 1998. Her last tour
“Rock Witchu”  for 2008’s LP
“Discipline”  was planned to be worldwide but was cancelled due to her coming down with
Vertigo , an illness which could be detrimental for a performer who dances around as much as she does.
As mega Janet fan I’m sure you know I’m screaming right now, really and truly this is what Janet needs I think
f*ck
the US they dont even know good music anymore, all their wrapped up in is whose shaking there
coochie
in a video. Tut!.
Funny enough I’m not too surprised shes taking it over here I’ve noticed a lot of US artists are starting to promote overseas more than their home country, and to be honest it’s better, expand your market, improve your fan base and reach out to people who arent lucky enough to visit your shows in the states.
It’s been way too long since Janet’s rocked this side of the pond we all await her return,  That’s the way love goes.

Cheryl Cole: Official 2010 Calender Pictures
Loving the shots from
Cheryl’s
2010
calendar, I’m sure I will be picking myself up a copy I think the styling is really nice, however I’m sure they never pushed the fashion  further because they wanted to appeal to a larger audience. All I know is Cheryl look’s great in these pic’s I wouldn’t be surprised if they make a Barbie after her next.
