TNT TNT was formed in the Norwegian city
Trondheim
in 1982, by vocalist and rhythm guitarist
Dag Ingebrigtsen , guitarist
Ronni Le Tekrø , bassist
Steinar Eikum
and drummer
Morten "Diesel" Dahl . Securing a national record contract with
PolyGram
subsidiary Vertigo Norway, they released
their self-titled debut album
the same year — their only album that features Norwegian lyrics — and got a hit with the single "Harley Davidson". In August 1983
Morty Black
replaced Steinar Eikum on bass, and the following year
American
vocalist
Tony Harnell
became TNT's new frontman, making his debut on their album
Knights of the New Thunder . His unique and powerful 4 octave range was the final element the band needed to break out of Norway and into the world market. The album was a huge success in
Scandinavia
and the band then was offered a worldwide deal with Mercury/Polygram worldwide out of New York. Knights was then released in the U.S. in 1985 and the video for Seven Seas got heavy rotation on MTV and the album entered the billboard charts.
That line-up recorded one more album,
Tell No Tales
in 1987, before "Diesel" Dahl was fired later that year after some turbulent times within the band.
Tell No Tales
produced TNT's biggest hit, the single " 10,000 Lovers (In One) ".
Tell No Tales
marked a slight change in sound from melodic Euro-metal to a more palatable hard rock style, with Le Tekrø and Harnell gaining a reputation as a talented duo. The album was the best selling release in Norway and Sweden that year (outselling hugely popular artists like
Michael Jackson
and
Def Leppard ).
Tell No Tales
also saw the band establishing a mainstream following in Japan and the U.S. Promotional Videos for " Everyone's a Star " and "10,000 Lovers (In One)" were featured on both European and American
MTV . They were also featured on
Headbangers Ball . The band supported Stryper on a sold out arena tour in the U.S. followed by a tour with Twisted Sister and Great White as well as headlining shows in large clubs in the U.S.
Ronni Le Tekrø
Kenneth Odiin became TNT's new drummer, but recorded only one album with the band,
Intuition
in 1989, before he left. This release marked a more
AOR -oriented sound, still maintaining a little of the hard rock edge of the previous album.
Intuition
was another huge success in Scandinavia and Japan. It was also the band's best received American release and saw the band embarking on their first headlining tour of the U.S. which broke attendance records across the country in small theaters and large clubs, thanks to the prominent display of the video for the title track on MTV. After the touring to support the album was done, the band negotiated a new (and generous) record contract with
Atlantic Records . With new drummer
John Macaluso , TNT released the studio album
Realized Fantasies
and the live recording
Three Nights in Tokyo
(both in 1992). However, Atlantic did a poor job of promoting the album in the States (assuring that TNT would never find huge success in America) and also the rest of the world. The same year they decided to take a break, choosing to focus on various solo projects. In 1996 the compilation
Till Next Time
was released, and Harnell, Le Tekrø and Black reformed TNT with drummer
Frode Lamøy . That line-up recorded two albums,
Firefly
in 1997 and
Transistor
in 1999.
Tony Mills
"Diesel" Dahl returned to TNT in 2000, and the band started working on their new album
My Religion , which was released in 2004. Months after the album release, Morty Black decided to quit, and
Sid Ringsby
took his place for the following concerts and the album
All the Way to the Sun , which was released in the fall of 2005. A single, "Sometimes" was released on July 25 in Norway. At the end of that year
Victor Borge
became TNT's new permanent bassist.
Tony Harnell left the band in April 2006 for both personal and professional reasons, although his final show was on
June 30 , where TNT played the Polar Rock Festival in Storsteinnes, Norway. He was replaced by British hard rock singer
Tony Mills
(of UK act
Shy ,
coincidentally
supporting TNT for Harnell's farewell show). Despite leaving the band, Harnell collaborated with iMagic Films and producer Darren Paltrowitz on a live DVD featuring his performance with the band in Madrid, Spain from
April 1 ,
2006 . The
Live in Madrid
CD + DVD package was released in Japan in August 2006 and elsewhere in the world in September 2006.
In 2007 TNT released their tenth studio album,
The New Territory
to mixed reviews and controversy amongst the fans. No music videos to support the album were released.
TNT released its 11th studio album,
Atlantis ,
on September 22, 2008 in both Norway and Japan. The album was influenced by
The Beatles
and
Queen , and was mixed by Tommy Hansen, who also worked on
My Religion
and
All the Way to the Sun . ______________________________________________________________________________ Harem Scarem Early years
Harem Scarem was formed in
1987
by guitarist
Pete Lesperance
and former
Blind Vengeance
singer
Harry Hess . They were signed to
Warner Music
years later and recorded their first album with them.
Commercial success
In
1991 , Harem Scarem released their
self titled
debut album , which charted at #68 on the Canadian album chart. The band managed to score a major hit while they were at it; " Slowly Slipping Away ", which charted at #25 on the Canadian single chart. They also managed to score two minor hits; " Honestly " and "Love Reaction"
In
1992 , the little known band, Harem Scarem was able to gain some notoriety when 8 songs from their debut album
Harem Scarem
was predominantly featured in the Canadian teen series
Degrassi Junior High
and
Degrassi High ' s farewell TV movie,
School's Out . There were many requests by excited fans for the songs on radio stations throughout
Toronto .
In
1993 , Harem Scarem released their second album,
Mood Swings , which had more of a harder sound to it than their previous album. A fan favorite,
Mood Swings
charted at #83 on the Canadian charts. The album's lead off single was "No Justice", which managed to chart at #59 in Canada, but the other two singles failed to chart.
Mood Swings
caused the band to gain popularity in
Japan
and the band's previous album was quickly issued in that country the following year.
Short lived success
In
1995 , the band released their third album
Voice of Reason . The album introduced a change in the bands musical style, and was very different from the other two albums. The song "Blue" was released as a
promotional single
and had a music video for it. However, fans didn't give the album a chance and it failed to chart.
The next two albums;
Karma Cleansing
(which was released as
Believe
in Japan) and
Big Bang Theory , saw Harem Scarem change their sound to go more modern. However, both the albums (and the singles from them) again failed to chart. In
1998 , the band released their last single; "So Blind".
Rubber
In
1999 , Harem Scarem changed their name to
Rubber , and started releasing albums under that name in Canada. However, they still used the name Harem Scarem in Japan and the rest of the world. Rubber made a music video called "Sunshine", which had two guys that looked like
Jay and Silent Bob
and parodied movies which were released around that time, such as
American Pie . The band released two albums as
Rubber
in Canada, but later dropped the
Rubber
name and switched back to using to their original name, Harem Scarem.
[ edit ]
Later years
In
2003 , Harem Scarem released their comeback album,
Higher . The album's sound was more of a combination of classic melodic rock with a modern twist to it. The album also featured the
power ballad
"Higher".
In
2005 , Harem Scarem released
Overload , followed by
Human Nature
in
2007 .
The Japanese version of
Overload
features a cover of the
AC/DC
classic, " You Shook Me All Night Long ".
Recent events
On
July 19 ,
2007 , lead singer
Harry Hess
announced that Harem Scarem " will make one more studio record and then after 20 years we have decided to move on to other things ". [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
The final album is called
Hope
and was released July 2008. ___________________________________________________________________________________ Lillian Axe Lillian Axe

Electric Boys
are a
funk metal
band founded in
Sweden
in 1988, which enjoyed a cult status in
Europe
at the end of the decade.
They were formed by
Conny Bloom
(real surname: Blomqvist) (guitar/vocals) and
Andy Christell
(bass). Originally a duo, they signed for
Polygram
and scored a local Swedish hit with the single "All Lips and Hips" in 1988. This early version of what would become perhaps the band's best-known hit also appeared that same year in America on the soundtrack to the movie
Feds . The band then added second guitarist Franco Santunione and drummer Niklas Sigevall.
In 1989, the band's debut album
Funk-O-Metal Carpet Ride , including a revamped version of "All Lips and Hips" was a success in Europe, and they picked up a strong following in Britain, where, as well as headlining small clubs, they supported
Thunder . When headlining Newcastle upon Tyne, Riverside club, the band were joined on stage by the lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Anthony Kiedis who were performing in the same venue at around the same time. The following year, the album was released in America, where they also became moderately successful, thanks to the singles "All Lips and Hips" and "Psychedelic Eyes." However, the follow-up album
Groovus Maximus
did not emerge until 1992, by which time
grunge
had swept all before it and the album was overall inferior to the debut. By the end of an American tour to promote it supporting
Mr. Big , the band had lost Santunione and Sigevall and both North American and European record deals. Outgoing members were replaced by Thomas Bromann (drums) and Martin Thomander (2nd guitar) and this lineup released the band's third album,
Freewheelin'
on the
Music For Nations
label in Britain. The album attracted little interest and the band dissolved. In 2005, founders Bloom and Christell had joined
Hanoi Rocks .
The
Groovus Maximus
album was recorded at the famous
Abbey Road Studios
in
London . There were two music videos made from that album: "Mary in the Mystery World" & "Dying to be Loved." The "Dying to be Loved" music video only had a budget of £100.
The band reformed in 2009. ______________________________________________________________________ Leatherwolf Formed in the early 80's, Leatherwolf quickly emerged as one of the musically most impressive bands on the Southern California scene despite the band members young ages. Sharing bills with fellow OC metal acts such as
Metallica , Witch, and
Slayer
at venues like the Woodstock and Radio City, Leatherwolf quickly caught the attention of
Enigma Records
affiliated indie label Tropical Records who financed the band's eponymous 1984 5-song EP, produced by Randy Burns (who would go on to work with the likes of
Megadeth ,
Helstar , and
Kreator ). Influenced by European heavy metal in general and
Iron Maiden
in particular, Leatherwolf's musical sophistication earned them high praise and let to the EP being extended to a full-length album and licensed in Europe. Germany's Steamhammer/SPV released the album in 1985, titled
Leatherwolf , while Heavy Metal America, who had the rights for Great Britain, issued it as
Endangered Species , so named after one of the songs on the album.
In 1986, Matt Hurich was recruited by another Orange County band,
Stryper , to take over bass duties for Tim Gaines who had mysteriously disappeared during the
To Hell With The Devil
sessions. Gaines reclaimed his spot only weeks later and Hurich was out of a gig as Leatherwolf had tapped Paul Carman who'd previously played in Black Sheep and appeared on their
Trouble In The Streets
album. The band signed a new record deal with
Island Records
and holed up with producer
Kevin Beamish whose
credits included
REO Speedwagon ,
Y&T , and
Starship
for their major label debut. Released in 1987 and confusingly titled
Leatherwolf , the band's style had evolved significantly with the use of prominent vocal harmonies akin to
Def Leppard
as well as the incorporation of keyboards, played by vocalist Michael Olivieri. The band also conquered
MTV
with their first single/video,
'The Calling' . It was followed up with another single,
Cry Out
b/w
Bad Moon Rising , a cover of the
Creedence Clearwater Revival
classic. Leatherwolf would also contribute the song 'Alone In The Night' to the
Return of the Living Dead Part II
OST.
For 1989's
Street Ready
album, recorded in the Bahamas, the band kept on Beamish as producer but tapped German expatriate
Michael Wagener
for the mix. Although the first single/video was the radio friendly semi-power ballad
'Hideaway' ,
Street Ready
saw the band take a step back toward their more metallic roots with songs such as opener 'Wicked Ways', 'Too Much', and especially the all-instrumental tour-de-force, 'Black Knight'. Leatherwolf would finally make their European live debut in the spring of '89 with an appearance at the Aardschokdag in Holland and opening slots for Japan's
Vow Wow
and German metallers Zed Yago. But the overall lack of label support began to take its toll on the band's inner workings and drummer Dean Roberts was eventually ousted in favor of Marco Forcone (ex-Enticer). Roberts joined The Rod Squad, led by former Knightmare II vocalist Dennis Carlock
aka
The Rod, with whom he recorded the 'Body Heater' 7" in 1990. Even bigger changes lay ahead as Leatherwolf dropped their trademark style in favor of a bluesier approach and
Guns N' Roses -style visuals. With Pat Guyton replacing Paul Carman on bass, the band had morphed into Hail Mary by 1991. However, success under the new moniker proved as illusive as ever as and the grunge rock revolution put the final nail in the band's coffin. Grand Slamm Records would re-issue the self-titled Leatherwolf debut on CD in 1991.
It was not until 1999 when the classic Leatherwolf line-up would re-emerge with a celebrated reunion show at the Galaxy Theater in Santa Ana, CA, documented on the
Wide Open
live album that featured 14 of the band's best songs as well as a cover of the
Doors ' 'Break On Through.' Leatherwolf also made their return to Europe with an exclusive show the at
Wacken Open Air
festival in Germany that same year. Further activities would remain few and far between and Michael Olivieri announced his departure in the spring of 2003 after supporting
Halford
at the Grove in Anaheim, CA. Auditioning various singers, the band recorded a 3-song demo consisting of 'Disconnect', 'Behind the Gun', and 'Burned' with Jeff Martin from
Racer X . Martin eventually declined to join on a full-time basis and lone survivors, Geoff Gayer and Dean Roberts, started the search anew and were finally introduced to Florida-based screamer Wade Black ( Crimson Glory , Leash Law,
Seven Witches ). With both Carey Howe and Paul Carman out of the picture, bass was handled by San Antonio, TX native Pete Perez ( Riot ,
Spastic Ink ) while OC local Mark Smith and Houstonian Eric Halpern (Destiny's End, Z-Lot-Z) contributed additional lead guitars to the new album. Co-produced by Roberts and Gayer and mixed by Jacob Hansen at Hansen Studios in Ribe, Denmark,
World Asylum
was released in the spring of 2006 to great reviews and Leatherwolf played the
Bang Your Head!!!
festival in Germany in June, with Paul Carman back in the fold on bass for the occasion. The band also shot a promotional video for the song
'Behind The Gun'
with director Karpis Maksudian. Former Hail Mary and
Shotgun Messiah
member Patrick Guyton would take over on bass for the band's
ProgPower USA
festival appearance in Atlanta, GA in the fall of '06.
Original members Carey Howe and Michael Olivieri returned in 2007 and Leatherwolf re-issued
World Asylum
with Olivieri's vocals in place of Wade Black as
New World Asylum , again mixed by Hansen. In the fall of 2007, Leatherwolf embarked on a short European tour, highlighted by a headline appearance at the 9th edition of Germany's
Keep It True
festival. Guitarist Geoff Gayer was let go at the end of the trip and replaced by Greg Erba with whom the band lensed a video clip for
'Dr. Wicked (Rx O.D.)'
with Karpis Maksudian at the helm once again. It would be included on the
Monsters of Metal Vol. 6
video compilation by
Nuclear Blast .
As of mid-2009, Leatherwolf are said to be writing for a new studio album and have been confirmed for the third annual
Rocklahoma
festival, sharing a bill with
Anthrax ,
Saxon ,
Overkill ,
Anvil , and
Metal Church
on July 9. __________________________________________________________________________________ Fashion Police Fashion Police
are a prime example of a band caught in this phenomenon. Their sound is pure late 80's, and if the album
Callin' All The Shots
had been released during that time perhaps this Cleveland quartet would have had a better chance at being signed by a major label. It is evident that
Fashion Police
were heavily influenced by early
Poison . The songs are catchy, fast-paced, and sprinkled with dizzying guitar riffs akin to
C.C. DeVille , particularly on "Crazy Stuff", "Days And Nights" and the "Talk Dirty To Me" clone "Baby Loves To Rock". Singer
Daniel Montesanto
fares well against his more well-known peers, belting out lyrics that run the gamut of typical tongue-in-cheek sex, drugs and rock n' roll topics that include references to riding the rocket and making it to the top. They also show a softer side with the 'boy loves girl' tunes "Alone/Together", "Days And Nights" and "Feels So Good". Most of us have a hard time admitting that we actually enjoyed listening to this type of candy-coated music back in the day. But there's enough distance between then and now to allow ourselves some guilt-free indulgence with
Callin' All The Shots . Give it a few listens and you'll soon be rummaging through your closet for your vintage hair band t-shirts. Whether you try them on for old time's sake or immediately put them up for sale on eBay is up to you. www.myspace.com/fashionpolicerocks

www.suncityrecords.com _________________________________________________________________________________________ Blackboard Jungle Originally from New Jersey, Britt Pennella, and Kenny Price moved to Los Angeles in the mid 1980's where they,
Blackboard Jungle
thought they had a much better chance to make a name for themselves.
They started up a glam rock band called
Filthy Ritz .
Filthy Ritz
gathered up quite a strong fan base in a very small period of less than six months.
Just as
Filthy Ritz
were starting to headline their own shows and make a name for themselves, the band decided to call it quits due to a few personality clashes. Britt and Kenny hooked up with Dave Zinc and Joel Faith and decided to start up another band and that's when
Blackboard Jungle
was born. Blackboard Jungle
were one of the more diverse hard rock bands from the strip with a style of their very own. To me, they drew similarities with Australia's very own
Candy Harlots
and even early
Vain .
Singer, Kenny Price has a unique and very distinctive voice along the same lines as Davy Vain. Blackboard Jungle
covered more ground and got more press than any unsigned band to ever come out of L.A. Sporting a resume' that starts with a 12 song cd entitled "I Like It Alot" on Church Records which was produced by Brent Muscat. As well as extensive touring with the likes of
Faster Pussycat ,
Gene Loves Jezabel ,
Filthy Lucre ,
Hole ,
Love Hate
and these guys even opened for
Cheap Trick . Blackboard Jungle
went to Japan in 1992 for about two weeks, playing sold out shows for up to 2,500 people and recorded BBJ-Live In Japan 1992 vhs. One of the songs recorded for the live set in Japan is featured on the new album which incidently will be called "Welcome To The Blackboard Jungle". Brent Muscat also produced two songs that appear on the Japanese motion picture soundtrack for "He Is Werewolf King". 1993 for
Blackboard Jungle
was spent touring and recording demos with Bill Kennedy who worked with
Nine Inch Nails
on Broken and Fixed for an upcoming album called "America Now" that was released in 1994 and went on to a mini tour of Germany. More recording, local shows and shuffling band members took up most of 1994.
Blackboard Jungle
was one of the three finalists for FOX 11 L.A. unsigned band contest, which received over 2,500 entries.
Blackboard Jungle
went on to win this contest and appeared live on national T.V. twice to perform and accept the honour. Then came the dreaded 1995. More shuffling of band members, the death of Laz (R.I.P.), the loss of 7 Seas and the departure of Dave eventually resulted in the end of
Blackboard Jungle .
The only good thing to come out 1995 was Kenny, Britt and Joel recording together for one last time. Check out the killer track entitled "Sweet Elaine". "Sweet Elaine" went down very well live and still to this day remains a real crowd pleaser. _________________________________________________________________________ Roxy Blue A short lived outfit whose straight-ahead hook heavy pop metal came to late in the glam
movement to make any sort of splash.
Their only album was an unoriginal affair, but
rocked from start to finish with the same flair as early
Van Halen .
Formed in Memphis, Tennessee, by
Todd Poole
(vocals), former
Atlanta Guitar Institute members
Sid Fletcher
(guitar) and
Josh Weil
(bass), and
Scotty T
(drums, who was touring the country with a Memphis blues
band at the young age of fourteen).
Even an album produced by
Mike Clink , sporting an outrageous cover
and the debut single "Rob The Cradle" claiming "the one-take
track, recorded live to tape with no edits, no dubs, no breaks, no shit," couldn't
make the group stars.
The group broke up shortly after, never to be heard from again. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Killer Dwarf Killer Dwarfs
were a
heavy metal
band who formed in late 1981 in
Oshawa, Ontario . Though they were known for their off beat sense of humor (all band members adopted the surname "Dwarf"), they were nominated for two
Juno Awards .
The original members of Killer Dwarfs are
Russ Graham
(Russ Dwarf) lead vocals,
Bryce Trewin
(Bryce Dwarf) on guitar,
Ange Fodero
(Ange Dwarf) on bass, and Darrell Millar (Darrell Dwarf) on drums. Millar has gone on to start his own record label Unkledunk Records and is a frontman for rock band Automan. Trewin and Fodero left the band a year after its self-titled debut album was released in 1983 because they thought the band was stuck in neutral; they were replaced by Mike Hall (Mike Dwarf) on guitar and
Ronald Mayer
(Ronald "Bad Ronbo" Dwarf) on bass, respectively. They released 1986's
Stand Tall
(on indie label Maze/A&M in Canada and Grudge Records in the USA) with this lineup, and the album received good reviews and achieved modest success, selling 80,000 units (with no small help from the videos for "Keep the Spirit Alive", which was the most requested video on MTV by spring 1987, and the title track, "Stand Tall"). With the addition of touring the U.S. coast to coast, the exposure got the band noticed, which eventually led them to signing a record deal with major label
Epic Records . In 1988 the band released its first album on the Epic label titled
Big Deal , which featured their major U.S. metal radio hit
We Stand Alone . They were the opening act for
Iron Maiden
on their tour of England in 1988. In 1990 they released
Dirty Weapons . These two albums are their only releases to make the
Billboard charts . Mike Hall left prior to 1992's
Method to the Madness , and was replaced by
Gerry Finn
(Gerry Dwarf). With their most successful days behind them, they were dropped by Epic. That, added to Graham's family crisis, was enough to put the Killer Dwarfs on ice in 1995. The
Stand Tall
lineup reunited in 2001 for a tour, and a live album --
Reunion of Scribes: Live 2001
-- was released in 2002. Mike Hall also played in the band Balls Deep, with former
Harem Scarem
drummer Darren Smith, as well as playing guitar on Smith's recent solo release. As of 2008, the band is inactive, with Russ Graham joining Canadian rock institution
Moxy .
Mike Hall has also been a member of
London, Ontario 's
Helix , playing alongside his Balls Deep bandmate Darren Smith. Gerry Finn has also played alongside Hall in Helix.
