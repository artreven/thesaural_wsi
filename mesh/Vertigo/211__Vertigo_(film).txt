For the Love of Film - An interview with Hitchcock
Friday, May 18, 2012 at 1:45PM
Today is the last day of
For the Love of Film: The Film Preservation Blogathon III
and my last post Hitchcock themed post invites to watch this interview with him from
Monitor , a BBC show from 1964.
There are some fantastic quotes from this interview, here are a couple of examples:
You’re a master, aren’t you, of the unexpected... Well, that’s only because one’s challenged by the audience.
They’re saying to me “show us” and “I know what’s coming next”... and I
say, “do you?”
And therefore, that’s the avoidance of the cliché
automatically.
They’re expecting a cliché and I have to say “we cannot
have a cliché here”.
Have you ever been tempted to make what is nowadays called a horror film, which is different from a Hitchcock film? No, because it’s too easy.
Are you talking about visual horror like Frankenstein and that kind of thing?
Yes. No, they’re... they’re props.
I believe in putting the horror in the mind of the audience and not necessarily on the screen.
I always enjoy listening to anything Alfred Hitchcock says. I find his articulation, humour and point of views all very delightful.
Sit back and enjoy. Monitor - Huw Wheldon meets Alfred Hitchcock
The last quote about happiness in the Monitor interview is a perfect segway into to the next clip, where we can hear Hitchcock talk more about his definition of happiness. I absolutely love, love, LOVE what he says.
And there you have it folks, an interview with Hitchcock and his definition of happiness seems like the perfect way to end this blogathon. Hope you have been enjoying reading these posts as much as I have been putting them together. You can find
all of my previous For the Love of Film: The Film Preservation Blogathon posts here .

For the Love of Film - Hitchcock Dreams
Thursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:15PM
Today's Hitchcock themed post that's part of
For the Love of Film: The Film Preservation Blogathon III , is about the fascinating subject of dreams.
BTW, there's one more day left for this blogathon and our goal is to raise $15,000 to help get
The White Shadow,
directed by Graham Cutts and written,
assistant-directed by Alfred Hitchcock
to stream online for free for everyone to enjoy and to also record the music score.
If you can spare two minutes and some cash, please click on the Donate badge on the right (or at the of this blogpost) or by going
here .
OK, back to dreams.
Spellbound
(1945) In
Spellbound , there's a dream sequence designed by Salvador Dali and it's as surreal as it can get. Oh how I would love to know what the conversation at the time was like between Hitchcock and Dali that led to this scene. (This isn't Dali's first dabble in film. An exhibition called
Dali: Painting and Film
explored his painting and "moving" pictures. You can
read more aout it here .)
Watch this clip and pay attention to the details in the dream sequence.
This excerpt includes the Salvador Dali dream sequence but puts it in
context: Gregory Peck's character suffers from amnesia, and Ingrid
Bergman has brought him to her own analyst and mentor. "JB" (Peck)
recounts a dream which the two analysts examine for clues to a murder
mystery. The film as a whole makes an appealing but illegitimate analogy
between psychoanalysis and solving a mystery which proved to be
central
to the appeal of psychoanalysis in popular culture.
Vertigo
(1958)
In
Vertigo , we have another dream sequence designed by an artist.
John Ferren , an Abstract Expressionist/Figurist/Still Life Painter, was the artistic consultant for the film and besides the dream, he also painted the Portrait of Carlotta that appears in the film. In a post by
Alfred Hitchcock Geek , we can
see the
part of the dream sequence was inspired by Bursting Shell, a painting by Christopher Nevinson from 1915 , "which
depicts a victim's-eye-view of a World War I mortar explosion ". I'm quite entralled by this scene.
