Diagnosis: Meniere's Disease
At the end of March I got dizzy. Laying down seemed to help --- it almost made me feel normal again. About four days into this, I laid myself down on the living room floor and willed the phone to come to me.
What is wrong with me?!?!
After, several minutes I willed
myself
to the phone, which worked mildly better than the phone coming to me. I returned to my previous spot on the floor as I dialed my husband's cell. "I can't do this anymore," I wailed. He said to make a doctor's appointment and he'd be able to come home to take me. Relief! (Often, he's an hour away for work.) But, that meant I would now have to get the phone book. A doctor's visit was motivation enough to crawl myself back into the kitchen.
Fortunately, by the time of the appointment, the worst of it had passed. The doctor asked so many questions. Many seemed repetitive. One was if I had ringing in my ears. I said I didn't. Each time I turned to look at my husband, I would get nauseous again (poor guy : ). The doctor did a bunch of test in which I had to follow his finger with my eyes. Finally, he concluded that I had
Vertigo
and eventually it would just go away on it's own.
Vertigo, in very simple terms, is when some of the "gravel" in your ears gets out of its spot and ends up in different parts of your ear, causing you to feel unbalanced or dizzy.
So, he had me lay down with my head just hanging off the end of the table(?) and turned it just so. I stared at his fingertip until the dizziness went away. Then we repeated it on the other side.
When I stood back up --- I was BETTER! I wanted to laugh right out loud. It seemed so humorous that I spent 4 days at home trying to get over this, and then to lay down in the doctor's office and get immediate relief!
Why had I waited so long?
He told me that I could do that exercise at home and prescribed
meclizine
to help reduce the dizziness. Unfortunately, the medicine didn't seem to do much for me.
I was so happy to feel good again until it returned. I tried and tried to do that exercise on my own bed. My husband tried to help too, until I vomited. We just couldn't get it to work. He and his friend gave me a priesthood blessing of which I was very grateful for. I wanted to be told that I
would heal quickly. Instead, I was told that this would bring me closer
to the Lord and to not be ashamed to ask for help from members in our
ward. Ok...
I spent the weekend lying down again. I did have good moments though, sometimes even a day or two where I almost felt back to normal. I managed to get through the next week well enough. Then it was suggested that I see a certain chiropractor. I did with the help of my visiting teacher who was so kind to drive me --- 3 times a week sometimes. The chiropractor would reset my ears. It helped a lot. Every now and then a little wave of dizziness would threaten worse to come, but it didn't and life seemed manageable. I felt sure the whole Vertigo thing was going away.
Then came the neck pain. Terrible neck pain. (I blamed it on the chiropractor.) Soon after that came the migraine, only on the left side, but constant, unless I laid on my back and kinked my head to the left just so, it would go away, then I felt well again, as long as I stayed in that position. Anyway, having the chiropractor move my neck around to reduce the dizziness didn't work very well anymore and the dizziness got worse again. The chiropractor prescribed muscle relaxers and pain killers for the migraine and sent me back to my doctor. Those two were now talking about me seeing a neurologist and having an MRI done. That scared me.
About that time, I realized that the high pitch beeps I'd hear in my ears from time to time is was "ringing" in the ears. I also noticed that that was happening more often. This is called
Tinnitus . My chiropractor said that when you have Vertigo and Tinnitus as the same time, it is called Meniere's Disease.
And that's all he said about it. But, he, and the doctor and the neurologist, still wanted to have a couple MRIs done, one on my neck, one on my brain. Fortunately, the MRIs didn't find anything. Still, that was a miserable week. One good friend brought my children home from school several times. Another came to pick me up so that I wouldn't have to walk there in the rain. Thankfully, the ward brought dinner over 3 times one week. I felt extremely grateful that they cared enough to do that, but my husband said he could fix dinner (which he was, and doing wash, and cleaning the house, and sometimes even making breakfast, and going into work early so that he'd be back in time to pick up the kids when he could, and running me around). He stepped right up to what needed to be done and did a great job. I was so grateful for him. He needed a break! Even if he didn't think so, and I was so grateful that a prepared dinner would give him that break.
I feel guilty though --- letting people help so much. I did my best to walk down and pick up my kids from school when I could and it felt good to do that. One day, I felt a little off to start, but figured a walk would do me some good. We only had a couple houses to go before we would be back home when I got really dizzy. I had to yell at my son to run and catch up, but I couldn't wait, I was going to be sick. I don't know how, but I managed to make it to my own toilet. : )  I can't tell you how paranoid I was to do anything for a week after that, but I simply could not let my kids miss out on their life because of it. (Everywhere we went I would look for the nearest trashcan or bathroom, just in case... sometimes I'd carry plastic bags with me.) I so
want ed to take care of my responsibilities. After all, I am
healthy!!!
I just have a little ear trouble that's causing a BIG mess.
One Thursday the dizziness came back and my chiropractor was not in his
office. On Friday, I waited to go until my husband could take me after work. The office had closed at noon. Desperate to not spend the entire
weekend in bed, my husband's grandma sent some exercises for Vertigo
that her doctor
gave her. They were the same ones I couldn't make work. Eli searched the
internet for some new exercises and had me try some. No
luck. Later, I tried one called
Brandt-Daroff
Exercises . It works! (At least most of the time.) I felt
empowered that I no longer would have to rely on my chiropractor to make the dizziness go away!
So, to finish my story, I got medicine for the migraine and about the time things started to feel good again, the pain in my neck began on the opposite side. So, it was not the chiropractor who had caused the pain on the left side after all. I was aghast. I just could not start over with that pain again. Especially if it was going to mean another month or more of pain! I began taking the pain pills again and fortunately, I don't think it even lasted a whole week. That made me happy.
Last week was good. In fact, I felt good enough to get back on the internet and read! I could focus on words again! I could concentrate again! I love to research stuff on the internet and was finally able find out what it had to say about Meniere's Disease.
After reading many sites (finding the same information on multiple sites make the repetitive information more valid to me) I came across two sites that I like. One is by a
man who tells about his personal experience
with Meniere's Disease and the other is a
compilation of easy to read facts .
____________________________________________
Meniere's Disease -- An Overview
Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can cause severe
dizziness, vomiting, ringing in the ears, and can disable
you for the better part of a day or more.  It is a non-fatal,
non-curable condition.  Non-curable?
Well, think of it like having an allergy to something...  nothing they
can do will make you no longer allergic to whatever
it is you're allergic to...  but once you understand the fact that you
do have this allergic condition, you can find ways
to avoid triggering it. My
personal battle with Meniere's
...  I had a total of about a dozen severe attacks
over six months or so.  During an attack I would get extremely dizzy
within a matter of 5 or 10 minutes.  Sometimes
I would begin vomiting.  During an attack I was too dizzy to walk or do
anything except lie down.  ...   I usually still felt pretty lousy,
or as Meniere's sufferers often
say "out of sorts", for about a day after an attack.
The severe attacks … were triggered by the
stress… …
One frustrating aspect of dealing with Meniere's disease, or any
inner-ear disorder, is that you don't generally LOOK sick to
other people.  Your friends and co-workers may think you are making the
whole thing up, or that you're a little crazy…
…
How
I Beat Meniere's Disease … An MRI of the brain and ear was performed
to rule out the possibility of physical damage
including a brain tumor…
One doctor … suggested I keep a log of my attacks.  I wrote down when they
occurred, and anything unusual I had eaten or done
in the day or two prior.  (He suspected I was reacting to salt in my
diet.)  Once I did this, it became totally
obvious that my attacks had nothing to do with food, and everything to
do with stress and disturbances to my sleep schedule…
(Hmmmm, I did notice I felt the worst when I was working, but seriously, I live fairly stress free, unless there's a deadline to meet... Logging my food? What a tedious and loathsome way to spend my day, however, it may help me keep the symptoms away, I should make a sincere effort --- especially being the mom of two little ones.)
____________________________________
Ménière's disease
is a condition of the inner ear. About 1 in a 1,000 people develops
Ménière's disease. … The disease is named after a French doctor called Prosper
Ménière who first described the disease in the 1860s. Symptoms that 'come and go' Ménière's disease
typically comes in attacks (episodes) of the following symptoms:
Dulled
hearing
in the affected ear(s). The degree of hearing loss varies.
Vertigo .
This is dizziness with a spinning sensation. It can be quite severe and
make you feel sick or vomit. Vertigo can develop with little or no
warning. You may feel very dizzy and ill. You may need to go to bed
until it passes.
Tinnitus . This is a noise such as a
ringing, roaring, or buzzing noise which you can hear from inside the
affected ear.
Ear pressure . You may get a sense of
fullness or pressure inside the ear.
Loud noises may seem
unpleasant and distorted .
An attack of Ménière's disease
may last from 20 minutes to several hours. The average is 2-4 hours.
Many people feel quite sleepy after an attack. Slight unsteadiness may
last a day or so after an attack --- sometimes longer.
(This helped me to understand what was happening.)
…
Attacks may be
frequent, or occur only every few months or longer. Sometimes they come
in clusters of several attacks in quick succession. For example, you may
have an attack every couple of days or so for a week or so. Some
attacks may be so close together that it may seem that one attack lasts
for several days. On average, you may get 6-11 clusters a year.
(Hopefully, I don't get cluster of attack 6-11 times per YEAR!)
…
An uncommon
symptom is to have sudden unexplained falls (drop attacks).
These are
falls without losing consciousness. Drop attacks last just a short time
with little associated vertigo. They occur in about 1 in 25 people with
Ménière's disease. So, although uncommon, drop attacks can be alarming
and potentially dangerous if, for example, you are driving or up a
ladder when one occurs.
(WAIT! What? At least this hasn't happened to me! Talk about making someone paranoid about going out.
For
the most part, I have a brief period of warning and I have not fallen
at all. Whew!)
You may have long periods of time (months
or years) between attacks (or clusters of attacks) when you have no
symptoms. In about 7 in 10 people with Ménière's disease, the attacks
stop altogether within 5-10 years of their starting.
This is hopeful! : ) Symptoms that may become permanent Hearing loss . During each attack the hearing
loss is temporary at first….
Tinnitus . … often temporary at first … eventually becomes permanent in some cases.
(and not so hopeful...)
What causes
Ménière's disease? …
It
is thought that a build-up of fluid in the labyrinth from time to time
causes the symptoms. The build-up of fluid may increase the pressure and
cause swelling of the labyrinth. Also, fluid may leak between different
parts of the labyrinth. These effects may cause the inner ear to send
abnormal messages to the brain, which causes the dizziness and vomiting.
(There's a longer explanation on their site, but I think this sums it up quickly.)
…
What is the outlook (prognosis)? The way
Ménière's disease affects people can vary greatly. At the outset of the
disease, it is not possible to predict how badly it will affect an
individual in the coming years. In many cases, months or years go by
between attacks. In some cases the attacks are more frequent. Some
attacks are minor and don't last long. Some attacks can be very
distressing with severe vomiting and dizziness. However, treatments that
can ease symptoms have improved in recent years.
There is a good
chance that after a while (typically after 5-10 years) the attacks stop
occurring altogether. However, you may have developed some permanent
hearing loss or permanent tinnitus in the affected ear or ears by this
time. This may be only a minor degree of hearing loss, but some people
become deaf in the affected ear or ears.
(So, I guess we just wait and see...)
So, I'm sure that's more than anyone cared to know. But, that's been my life pretty much for the last couple of months. I so desperately wanted to be done with it by the time school lets out for the summer and it looks like I may have my wish. And, just to note, I've found that a green veggie juice a day seems to reduce the pressure in my ears. One more incentive to eat better.

Kari May 31, 2011 at 3:29 PM I have a friend who has this and she told me what she wishes she knew at the beginning.
(As now she has permanent hearing loss in her left ear.)
She said you are supposed to cut down on salt and caffeine.
She is pretty funny about the hearing loss though.
She just says she sleeps on her good ear and she can't hear her husband snore.
She is our age as well btw. I'm sorry you are going through this though. Trials are the pits. Reply Delete Eli & Corinne June 1, 2011 at 11:20 AM Kari, sorry to hear about your friend. I'm so hoping to keep my hearing, but I see now that there is a plus to only hearing in one ear. I watch my salt intake --- I thought I did really good, comparatively anyway. However, I did notice the pressure in my ears increase after eating popcorn at the movies last Saturday. As for caffeine, I don't drink soda at all, I hate the fizz on my tongue. Chocolate, however, is another story. Reply Delete Add comment Load more...
