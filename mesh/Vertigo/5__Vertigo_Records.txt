Patto
Patto
was a
progressive
jazz-rock band formed in
England
in 1970 consisting of
Mike Patto
(born Michael Thomas Sean Patrick McCarthy,
22 September
1942 , in
Cirencester , Gloucestershire
died
4 March
1979 ) on vocals,
John Halsey
(born
23 February
1945 , in
Highgate ,
North London
(ex Barry Reed and the Avengers, Felder's Orioles) on drums,
Ollie Halsall
(born Peter John Halsall,
14 March
1949 , in
Southport
Lancashire
died
29 May
1992 , in
Madrid ,
Spain ) on guitars and vibes, and
Clive Griffiths
(born
16 May
1945 , in
Middlewich ,
Cheshire ) on bass. All ex Timebox. History Timebox
was a '60's outfit that developed from a complicaded ancestry that included The Bo Street Runners, Patto's People, and the Chicago Blue Line. This soul/psych-pop combo made two singles for Pye's Piccadilly, before signing to Decca's Deram label in 1967. They also recorded five singles for Deram between '67 and '69 and appeared on BBC shows such as Noise at Nine, Stuart Henry on Sunday and Jimmy Young. After their last single failed in '69, keyboard player
Chris Holmes
(born Christopher Noel Holmes,
12 September
1945 , in
Cleethorpes ,
Lincolnshire ) left and they decided that their future lay in the burgeoning
progressive rock
movement. In 1970 Patto was formed out of the remaining ex-members of
Timebox
and was signed to the newly formed
Vertigo
label. With
Muff Winwood
as producer they recorded their first album live in studio. This was because Winwood felt this best way to capture the raw virtuosity of Halsall's guitar playing and Mike Patto's soulful voice. The album " Patto " sold poorly and is still considered an underrated classic today. In December 1971 Patto entered the studio again to record their second album " Hold Your Fire ". Again the sales were poor and they were dropped from
Vertigo . This did not hinder the fact that they were becoming known as one of the most exciting live acts of their time. Through his connections in England
Muff Winwood
was able to get the band signed to
Island Records
where they recorded the album " Roll 'em Smoke 'em Put Another Line Out ". To their dismay this album also sold poorly. In 1973 the band began to record their next album. For this album Mike Patto wanted to use more of his material which was less cynical than the usual Patto songs and much more commercial. For whatever reason Halsall failed to put much effort into his playing on tracks that he didn't take part in writing and when asked about this he left the band. The album that was called
Monkey's Bum
was also rejected by
Island Records . Without their virtuoso guitarist Patto chose to call it quits with each member moving on to other projects. Discography Studio albums ( 1970 ) Patto ( 1971 ) Hold Your Fire ( 1972 ) Roll Em, Smoke Em, put another line out ( 1973 ) Monkey's Bum (Unreleased)
Live albums ( 2000 ) Warts and All
