Weekend box office: Blackjack

The buzz around " 21 " was hotter than an illusory winning streak at the tables, so even
middling to lousy reviews
and the movie's own bad self couldn't keep it from riding atop the box office this weekend: $24 million at 2,640 theaters. Still, it was the weakest end-of-March overall since 1999. The reason? Nothing propped "21" up other than " Horton Hears a Who! " in its third weekend. " Superhero Movie " crashed ($9.5 million at almost 3,000 theaters) and " Stop-Loss " ($4.5 million at 1,300 houses) couldn't overcome audience resistance to Iraq War-themed dramas, despite a heavy MTV promotional campaign. " Flawless " and " Priceless " -- one starring Demi Moore, the other Audrey Tautou -- did decently in small releases, but " Run Fat Boy Run " dared to dash into over 1,000 theaters and pulled in a weak $2.4 million. " Under the Same Moon ," an art-house hearttugger about a Mexican kid crossing the border to be reunited with his illegal immigrant mom, actually made it into the top 10 last week and stays strong this week at #14 with almost $6,000 per theater; it opens in the Boston area this Friday.

Here's some interesting casting news:
Mos Def
has been hired to play
Chuck Berry
in the currently filming " Cadillac Records ." The film takes places in Chicago in the 1950s and is based on the story of
Chess Records , the label founded by
Leonard
and
Phil Chess
(played by
Adrien Brody
and
Shiloh Fernandez ). Chess, of course, was the little record company that released the big sound of the Chicago blues and paved the way for rock and roll, and the cast looks like an R&B drooler's fantasy:
Jeffrey Wright
as
Muddy Waters ,
Cedric the Entertainer
as
Willie Dixon ,
Eamonn Walker
as the great
Howlin' Wolf . Oh, and
Beyonce
as
Etta James
-- better get started with the donut diet, Beyonce. Plus
Mos Def
as
Berry , the man who with " Maybellene " (originally called "Ida Red") brought the label roaring into the early rock era. Wesley and I were talking the other day about how Def (" Be Kind Rewind ," " The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ") is a fine, original actor who seems content to take character roles when he has the stuff to be a real star. I doubt this will change things but I'm still hankering to see what he does with Chuck Berry.
The film's the brainchild of writer/director
Darnell Martin
and she's currently filming in New Jersey. No release date is set, so we'll have to make do with
the music
for now.

I don't know what kind of brain aphasia prompted me to write, in today's review of " Flawless ," that the sax solo in the classic Dave Brubeck Quartet jazz tune " Take Five " is by Gerry Mulligan. It is of course by
Paul Desmond , who wrote the song. Apologies to Brubeck/Desmond fans and to the entirety of jazz history.

The
Independent Film Festival of Boston
goes into its sixth year from April 23 to 29, and the line-up of films has just
been posted online .
It looks to be a strong group. Two of the better fictional films from this year's Sundance are here: " Ballast " and Azazel Jacobs' " Momma's Man ," the first a bleak but brilliantly told slice of life in the Deep South, the latter a pleasingly minimalist comedy about a grown man who can't bring himself to leave his parents' house. Also on the line-up are two fine off-Sundance docs: " American Teen " and, from local filmmakers/Harvard profs Robb Moss and Peter Galison, " Secrecy ."
There's new work from directors Brad Anderson (opening night film "Transiberian"), Guy Maddin (" My Winnipeg "), Harmony Korine (" Mister Lonely "), and Werner Herzog (" Encounters at the End of the World "). Roxbury-based filmmaker
Robert Patton-Spruill
chips in the doc "Public Enemy: Welcome to the Terrordome." Newbie superstar Ellen Page is featured in " The Tracey Fragments " (photo above), while actors Mary Stuart Masterson and Chris Eigeman turn director with, respectively, " The Cake Eaters " and " Turn the River ." There are Asian epics (" Mongol ") and Asian action flicks (" Triangle ," directed by Johnnie To, Ringo Lam, and Tsui Hark). There's even a new movie from " Re-Animator " director and cult figure Stuart Gordon, and
it sounds mighty weird .
This
is a film festival, folks.
Widmark redux

March 26, 2008 05:23 PM
I can't add very much to what Wesley has already
written below , but I do have to say that if you really want to appreciate what Widmark was capable of, you need to get a look at " Pickup on South Street ," Sam Fuller's absolutely essential 1953 film noir. Widmark, the go-to weasel of 50s B movies, plays a pickpocket (a "cannon" in the movie's surreal argot) who boosts some top-secret Commie microfilm from an unsuspecting courier (Jean Peters, soon to become Mrs. Howard Hughes in real life) on the subway.
Widmark's character, Skip McCoy, is so alienated from mainstream society that he lives in a shack tenuously connect to Manhattan by a plank -- you can't live farther out in New York City and still actually be
in
New York City. He's a nasty piece of work, but the movie and Peters slowly reel him back to the land of the living; when these two kiss, it's like pieces of meat mashing together.
Wesley's already mentioned the actor's weirdly taut face, as though all the contradictions of the Eisenhower era were stretching his skin too tight, but what I always took away with me was Widmark's smile -- wide, insincere, and mesmerizing. If a cobra had teeth, that's what he'd look like.
"Pickup" is available on a dandy
Criterion DVD , as is " Night and the City " (1950), in which Widmark tries to play both ends of gangland London against each other and, as expected, loses badly. Don't ask how the professional wrestling supblot fits into this. The actor spent the 1960s and beyond playing mostly good guys, but he didn't fool anyone -- in truth, he embodied the acrid smell in back of the 1950s better than almost anyone else.
Richard Widmark 1914-2008

Richard Widmark has died. In a complete reversal of Hollywood physics, he reached stardom by playing heavies, starting with "Kiss of Death," in which he notoriously tied up poor Mildred Dunnock and pushed her down the stairs in a wheelchair.
I saw that movie at about 9pm on a Saturday night in 1986. I was 10, and the evil that came off the TV set was so vivid (that laugh, that bone structure) I was afraid to go to sleep. Part of what made Widmark so dangerous, at least to me, was that he made evil seem evil without making it seem repellent. He was sexy, and later on part of me didn't know how to reconcile that. His characters killed and connived and tortured, and while my brain understood ("This man is bananas!"), the rest of me couldn't resist him.
Like the rest of America at the height of Widmark's fame, I was caught in his sexual undertow. He wasn't gorgeous. His skin was tight over his face in way that sometimes made it seem skeletal. And he could be schvitzy. To my mind the only working actor who comes close is
Viggo Mortensen , another guy with Scandinavian roots. But even he is still a neighborhood over from what made Widmark so appealing. Widmark thrived in a strange moment when nihilism and misanthropy in Hollywood were easier to come by and straight happy endings were scarcer.
By the 1960s, that nasty laugh and those disgusted expressions had plenty of camp to occupy them. My favorite Widmark movie from this period is " The Long Ship " (1964), a sword-and-sandal-esque situation
with him as a man trying to get gold before King Sidney Poitier -- James Brown's hair and in full West Indian accent (if memory serves the king is Islamic) -- does first. Or something like that. The movie's a hoot. But it was one of the markers of his persona's transition from societal menace to the inevitable authority figure. Don Siegel's "Madigan" (1968) pretty much capped the transformation. In "The Long Ship," occasionally, Widmark lets a smirk slip through all the outlandish gravity. Maybe he noticed the movie's ludicrousness --or Poitier's wig. But by that point, he'd blazed a trail nobody could really follow. He didn't need to throw Dunnock down the stair in "Kiss of Death." He could have killed her with a look.

I wasn't going to say anything, since A) I thought I imagined it and B) what I thought I imagined was sort of blah. But now since the New York Times magazine's T brand is happily still promoting i ts discovery
of short filmmaking with T Takes, a gang of laconic, loosely connected movies (written and directed by Brody Baker and featuring a motel) about the shivering and fashionably disheveled, with Josh Hartnett, Saffron Burrows, Lukas Haas, Andre Royo, and Brady Corbet, who is Andy Roddick's
doppelganger . They use pay phones and exclaim "fudge." The cast is described as "bright young things," which means somebody let Aunt Mildred write the captions again. The shaky camerawork. The random close-ups of activities we don't need to see.The storylessness. The willful "indie"-ness. It's like Sundance in March.

Tyler Perry meets the green

Weekend box office: The short news is that " Horton Hears a Who! " landed in the top spot again, with $25 million in ticket sales adding to a $86 million gross. Digging deeper, though, are some interesting stories.
" Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns " (above), for instance: It opened with $20 million without benefit of a big ad campaign or word-of-mouth advance screenings. Why? because Perry has a devoted audience that will turn out ASAP to see his movies. (The 11:30 a.m. show on Friday that I attended was about half full -- usually there are only two or three people in a theater at that time, and they're usually sleeping something off.)
Perry may be beginning to hit the wall, though. "Meet the Browns" made an
eensy bit less
than " Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married? " last October and a
whole lot less
than " Tyler Perry's Madea's Family Reunion " two years ago. Still, "Browns" managed almost $10,000 per theater, and that's something.
The clock's also running out for Asian horror remakes, as another movie not screened for the press, " The Shutter ," pulled in a punk $10 million. The real story, though, is the rather shockingly low $10 million returns for " Drillbit Taylor ". Admittedly it's a rather shockingly poor movie, but when has that ever stopped audiences? Either Judd Apatow's not the broad box office draw the pundits would have you believe or Owen Wilson's offscreen troubles have put a genuine dent in his insouciant onscreen image. Or moviegoers looked at the ads, saw a family film, and just decided to go see "Horton" again.

Grover Dill? Or Scut Farkas?

I'm already getting a bunch of emails in response to my
Bully Round-up
in today's paper. Seems I mistakenly referred to Grover Dill as the primary bully and object of Ralphie's revenge in the 1983 classic " A Christmas Story ," when in fact Dill is merely the toady of Scut Farkas (in photo above).
And yet I'm not wrong! If you came to "A Christmas Story" through the original
Jean Shepherd
stories on which the movie was based, as I did, you'll know that Grover
is
the bully Ralphie fights -- and he has the yellow eyes to prove it. Exhibit A: the story
"Grover DIll and the Tasmanian Devil"
itself, and if you've never had the joy of reading Shepherd, read now and thank me later.
So, yes, my bad, but not
wholly
my bad. And I still think Grover Dill is a funnier name than Scut Farkas.

Lots of interesting movie stuff going on throughout the greater Boston area this weekend, but first I'd like to offer early birthday wishes to Mladen Sekulovich, who turns 96 tomorrow. You know him as
Karl Malden . 96! Way to go,
fighting waterfront priest ! Too many of my posts this week have been about dead people; tomorrow night, let us raise a glass to the character actors who survive.
On the other hand, I'm late off the dime in alerting you to the
10th Boston Underground Film Festival , which started at
the Brattle
last night with a screening of " The Wizard of Gore ," a brand new remake of the venerable
1970 grindhouse classic
(don't worry, it plays again today at 2:30; if you hurry, you'll just make it.) Other good stuff plays
throughout the weekend .
Over at the
Harvard Film Archive , the celebration of the career of legendary Portuguese director
Manoel de Oliveira
continues. Oliveira turns 100 this year; he directed his most recent film, " Christopher Columbus, or, The Enigma " (it plays the HFA on Wednesday) last year. Kind of makes Karl Malden look like a pimply teenager.
At the MFA over the weekend
is " The Duchess of Langeais , which lovers of director
Jacques Rivette
and slow, exquisite French movies will flip for; others, not so much.
On Saturday , there's a very fine documentary about the legacy of AIDS in Africa: " Today the Hawk Takes One Chick ". It'll be followed by a panel discussion with Cambridge-based filmmakers Jane Gillooly and Robert Gardner (whose 1986 classic " Forest of Bliss " will screen earlier in the day), part of an intriguing
series on Boston area documentaries
sponsored by the
LEF Foundation .
On to lesser stuff: New movies in theaters today. It's the middle of March, so don't get your hopes up. On the other hand, if you have a kid and want to sample something truly different from the
hogswallop
the studios usually serve, you really need to check out " CJ7 ," the latest highly entertaining weirdness from Steven Chow, the man who gave you " Kung Fu Hustle " and " Shaolin Soccer ."
Otherwise, " Drillbit Taylor " is a disappointment coming from the Judd Apatow factory (I hear much better things about the upcoming " Forgetting Sarah Marshall "). Wesley finds much to not like about David Gordon Green's " Snow Angels ," although, to be fair,
some of the reviews
have been through the roof, so if you like the " George Washington " director's work, you should probably give the new one a look.
" Military Intelligence and You! " at the Kendall? Great idea all dressed up with no place to go.

When I
blogged yesterday
that the Movie Nation comments function is now open for business, what I
should
have said is that simply posting a comment doesn't make it instantly appear on the site. Because we're deeply paranoid here at the Globe, and because we know Movie Nation readers are an unwashed, pottymouthed bunch of cineastes, I (or Wesley) have to personally vet each comment before it can go live. Apologies in advance, and I promise to check for incoming a few times each day. Comment wisely and comment well, but you only need to comment once.
Paul Scofield 1922 - 2008
Link | Comments

Posted by Ty Burr
March 20, 2008 10:28 AM
Paul Scofield, the great British stage actor who all too rarely deigned to appear in films, has died at the age of 86, from complications of leukemia. The AP has a
full obit ; Wikipedia has a
concise career trajectory ; IMDb has the
filmography
and an
appreciative bio .
Of his acting generation -- Richard Burton, Peter O'Toole, Richard Harris were his closest peers in age and impact -- Scofield was the film star who wasn't. No marriages to Hollywood sex goddesses, no flirtations with the star-making machinery, no appearances in "Harry Potter" movies. He was primarily about the stage and, even more fundamentally, about playing a role before a live audience. "Acting is all I can do," said the man who turned down a knighthood three times and who stayed married to the same woman for 65 years.
Our loss, as anyone knows who saw Scofield in his signature role as
Sir Thomas More
in Fred Zinneman's 1966 multiple Oscar-winner " A Man for All Seasons ." (The star won best actor but didn't bother to turn up for the ceremony.) He had originated the part on the London stage and on Broadway, picking up trophies everywhere, and so he really couldn't turn down the chance to play the conscience of Tudor England onscreen. Thus we have the evidence: Scofield's More has a clear-sighted, righteous charisma that stands inflexible against the wishes of Henry VIII (Robert Shaw) to trade in his first queen for a newer model. (Trust me, the movie makes " The Other Boleyn Girl " look like kids playing dress-up.)
Then there was that voice: Sonorous, considered, emanating from banked fires deep within. Scofield made the concept of mature duty seem
sexy , and I'm not being facetious -- I've just been listening to my editor, a young girl in 1966, practically fanning herself as she recalled the crush she had on the actor. When More stands before the block at the end of the film and says with artless simplicity, "I am commanded by the king to be brief, and since I am the king's obedient subject, brief I will be. I die His Majesty's good servant, but God's first," you could hear the hearts of historians and smart women everywhere breaking.
Scofield appeared in other films but none with the impact of "A Man for All Seasons," and he certainly didn't rush to find other leading roles. He was a strict classicist, recreating his King Lear in a
1971 film version , and appearing opposite Katharine Hepburn in Edward Albee's " A Delicate Balance ," a 1973 entry in the short-lived
American Film Theatre
project designed to bring great plays to movie audiences. (My high school English teacher took us to see a number of these; "Balance" was quite good, with Scofield subtly underplaying against the tornado that was Kate, but I still have saddle sores from the three-hour version of "The Iceman Cometh" starring... Lee Marvin as Hickey.)
The actor's latter-day claim to fame, of course, was as Ralph Fiennes' father in Robert Redford's 1994 " Quiz Show ," the leonine intellectual Mark Van Doren looking down his nose at his son's involvement in a tatty TV game show. Scofield picked up a second Oscar nomination for that role, and deservedly: the sorrow with which Van Doren contemplates the son's ruin of the family name is both moving and terrifying -- an immovable mountain of parental/cultural guilt. (The best supporting actor winner that year was the equally excellent Martin Landau for "Ed Wood".)
Two years later came Scofield's last appearance in a theatrical movie, as Judge Danforth in "The Crucible" -- a fitting finale but not the one his talents deserved. Besides "A Man for All Seasons," the only time the actor may have met a lead film role worthy of his stature was in John Frankenheimer's underrated 1964 dramatic thriller " The Train ," where he plays a Nazi officer obsessed with stealing the great artworks of Paris (Burt Lancaster is the resistance train engineer bent on stopping him). (I haven't seen 1973's "Scorpio," but here's a nice
blog appraisement
of it.)
To have seen Scofield on stage, then, may have been to take the full measure of the man. Unfortunately, a stage performance, no matter how great, vanishes from everything but memory when it's over. Perhaps that's what he intended all along. It's as though Scofield took to heart his line from "A Man for All Seasons": "I trust I make myself obscure."

More on Minghella

Posted by Ty Burr
March 18, 2008 02:04 PM
What a strange year for left-field losses in the movie industry. Heath Ledger, now
Anthony Minghella . I hope the rule of three doesn't apply.
Whenever I think about Minghella's career, I keep circling back to " Truly, Madly, Deeply " (1990) the first and least elegant of his films -- that's meant as praise -- and the one that seems a blueprint for everything that came after. The throughline of his movies (I haven't read the many plays that came before Minghella's move into directing) is the damned impossibility of human connection and the nearly insane lengths we go to connect anyway.
In "Truly, Madly, Deeply," the grieving wife played by Juliet Stevenson (with all faucets open) misses her husband (Alan Rickman) with such ferocity that she wills him back into ghostly existence. It's as though she never really knew him while he was alive and demands an extension on their time together. The film, a comedy soaked with tears, has been described as the thinking moviegoer's "Ghost," but it's not so much about love defeating death as it is death kissing life on the forehead and graciously moving on. The reason the film works, though -- the reason it's still my favorite of all Minghella's films -- is the intemperate anger and sorrow with which Stevenson batters on the wall of the afterlife. Not a subtle movie, and that's a good thing.
The director's later work was nothing if not tasteful and gradually, I'd argue, that became a liability. " The English Patient " (1996) deserves its awards not for the scope of its canvas but for its pained crisscross of love and events -- for the way it shows the world's demands (and plain bad luck) thwarting desire time and time again. That's in Michael Ondaatje's
original novel
but Minghella envisions it with a ruthless epic eye, not to mention an ear for the silences between people. Like Kristen Scott Thomas' character, we're all stuck in the desert waiting for rescue.
Then there's Matt Damon as Ripley in 1999's " The Talented Mr. Ripley ," a man who carries his own desert inside him. He tries peopling it by pretending to be another man -- the unlucky Dickie Greenleaf, played by Jude Law -- but living in another person's skin proves as impossible as loving a ghost or another man's wife during wartime. Minghella's "Ripley" lacks the farcical nastiness of
Patricia Highsmith's great novel , and I still think Damon's miscast (rightly or wrongly, I would have welcomed an actor whose edge showed a wee bit more -- Christian Bale, perhaps, or Edward Norton). But Highsmith genuinely hated people (that's what makes her writing so readable and so ugly), and Minghella is just moved to sympathetic awe by what they're capable of.
2003's " Cold Mountain "? Brilliantly made but as chilly as its title, and for the first time Minghella feels hemmed in by his literary source rather than freed by it. (The less said about Renee Zellweger's Mammy Yokum impersonation, the better.) As the director's filmmaking skills grew -- and "Mountain" is certainly beautiful to
experience
-- so his characters seemed to retreat behind a veil of discretion. There's plenty of bad behavior in " Breaking and Entering " (2006) but for the first time you can feel Minghella reaching to make a larger point rather than letting his characters simply embody it.
And yet. Minghella's cinematic touch remains unique -- a " Lubitsch touch " minus the cynicism and with an added, measureless compassion for the silly, confused animal that is man. (Look no further than Jude Law's character in "Breaking" for confirmation.) The director's final work before his unexpected death was an adaptation of "The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency," starring singer Jill Scott as a Botswanan private eye. It'll hopefully be on HBO later this year, and then that's all she wrote. As with Ledger, the loss for moviegoers is all the work we'll never see.
Anthony Minghella 1954 - 2008

March 18, 2008 10:50 AM
The English writer and director Anthony Minghella has
died . His best-known movies were tony adaptations of other people's novels. He specialized in the kind of prestige films that Oscar voters went for and certain audience congratulated themselves for seeing.
Minghella
walked a delicate line between discretion and spectacle, class and its trappings, obsession and romance. (His first feature's title, "Truly, Madly, Deeply," could apply to every movie he made after it.)
Those combinations were famously evident in "The English Patient" (1996), from Michael Ondaatje's novel. A friend called the movie "David Lean with a brain." The movie won nine Oscars, including one for best picture and another for Minghella's directing, and became such a hotly debated cultural touchstone that " Seinfeld " built one of its best episodes around it.
But he was never better than his scathingly intelligent version of Patricia Highsmith's "The Talented Mr. Ripley" (1999), about a sociopath who infiltrates jet-setting Americans in the 1950s. Minghella refashioned Highsmith's noir as a vertiginous critique of the blue-blood boys club and the women suffering on its margins. The movie also has five excellent performances from actors who, at the time, were pretty young, exciting and at the upswing of their stardom: Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and, of course, Matt Damon, who hasn't been as adventurous since.
Minghella's films could be excruciatingly tasteful, too. His adaptation of Charles Frazier's "Cold Mountain" made the Civil War seem like a pageant of art-direction and costuming for glamorous white people. (Where were these slaves we were hearing so much about?) But Minghella's sense of proportion turned out to be just right -- the beauty was a respite from the ugliness and misery that wound up taking over the movie anyway. He let Nicole Kidman radiate a Hollywood glamor that had been missing from those kinds of big Hollywood movies. She was Grace Kelly and Vivien Leigh at the same time, and yet unmistakably herself. It's one of her least appreciated performances. (In other movies, Minghella got similarly outstanding work from Juliet Stevenson, Alan Rickman, Juliette Binoche, and Robin Wright Penn. He was great with landscape and narrative structure, but he was even better with actors.)
With "Cold Mountain," his talent and storytelling judgment seduced and disarmed me. When Jude Law (Dietrich to Minghella's von Sternberg) and Nicole Kidman see each other for the first time since the war separates them, tears dripped into my lap. So for all his movie's toniness, he did something only a very good moviemakers can: he wore down my resistance and broke my heart. That's a gift the movies will really miss.
Horton Hears Ka-Ching!

See? A G rating isn't so bad. " Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who! " easily led the weekend box office, bringing in $45 million at just under 4,000 theaters, for a robust $11,400 per theater average. That's the sixth biggest opening ever for a G movie (gotta love those
Box Office Mojo charts ).By contrast, the live-action Thanksgiving turkey " The Cat in the Hat " opened in November 2003 with $38 million and a slightly lower PTA, while " How the Grinch Stole Christmas ," the film that started Hollywood's current romance with the good Dr. (I'd call it more like date-rape, but never mind) opened November 2000 with a huge $55 million ($17.6K PTA).
What that means is a Seuss movie can do perfectly well as a G-rated computer animation with stars behind the microphone rather than decked out in latex and fur.
Other newbies didn't fare so well: martial arts drama " Never Back Down " ($8.6 million, actually pretty good given its low profile) and " Doomsday " ($4.7 million), the latter a movie not screened for critics by a gunshy Universal but that still got
surprisingly high scores
when the reviewers got around to seeing it. Michael Haneke's probably chuckling hollowly, as the success of the horror movie proves his point: We do love our cinematic violence but hate it when Austrian filmmakers play " Funny Games " and deliver it to us with a spanking. (The
IMDb user comments
are a graduate course all by themselves in how Haneke's re-do does and doesn't play. Fascinating reading, more so than the film in many ways.)
Other B.O. notes: " The Bank Job " is holding on surprisingly well: week 3 and it's still averaging $3,000 per theater. (So is " Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day ," albeit at a third of the theaters.)
For more number crunching go to the
Box Office Mojo charts
and
Leonard Klady

Ty's movie picks for Friday, March 14

Well, let's not start out with a movie. Let's start out with a play.
I'm probably not the best person to trust on the subject of theater: I watch movies for a living, and The Globe
has a writer
who's more than up to the task of parsing, analysing, condemning, appreciating. Plus, I have to admit I'm fairly sour on the Boston area theater scene -- 20 years in New York followed by two subscription seasons at The Huntington that just about put me into a coma will do that.
Still, the plays and the productions have seemed to be improving lately, especially around the South End nexus, and there's the
New Rep
in Watertown, which under Rick Lombardo is finding a good balance between the crowd pleasers and the risk takers.
" The Clean House " starts as the first and ends as the second. The play's written by
Sarah Ruhl , who's the Hot New Thing of the theater world (even
John Lahr
loves her), and it starts in stock class-comedy territory -- a rich bitch doctor (Paula Plum, the play's secret weapon) can't figure out why her Brazilian cleaning lady (Cristi Miles, bim-bem-bim) has stopped cleaning; the doctor's obsessive-compulsive sister (Nancy Carroll) takes over the job for her. Then it slowly lifts off into surrealism and poetry. By the end, "Clean House" has become something radically different than what it began as, in a wholly satisfying manner, and I thought to myself: Why don't more movies try this?
I'm not talking about the tonal mixmastery and genre pastiches of a film like Ira Sachs' " Married Life ," which opens with a lovingly overstylized sigh today. I mean a narrative that allows itself to grow organically so that what begins as an ordinary shrub keeps flowering and sending off different shoots until it looks like a Dr. Seuss tree, with a swing on it for us to sit in. I can think of few filmmakers who try this approach -- Alan Rudolph springs to mind -- and maybe it's just not an endeavor suited to movies, with their emphasis on putative realism. It works with "The Clean House," though. The play's not perfect (Ruhl's ethnic calculus is too pat, for one thing), but it pushes buttons you didn't know you had. It's
at the New Rep until the 23rd,
but good luck getting a ticket.
Speaking of Dr. Seuss -- oh, right, this is a movie blog! -- " Horton Hears a Who " opens today, and it's perfectly serviceable product for the young ones. (Meaning my 11 year old was a little bored but reasonably diverted while the five year olds in the row behind her were in ecstasy.) I like what
A.O. Scott
had to say about it in the Times: "What distinguishes Â“Horton Hears a Who!Â” from the other recent Dr. Seuss film adaptations ... is that it is not one of the worst movies ever made." That's about right.
If you like horror/suspense movies, up to and including the "Saw" series, and you want your preconceptions and cultural tastes spit back in your face, by all means take the challenge that is Michael Haneke's " Funny Games ," a remake of his
1997 Austrian film
of the same name. This time Naomi Watts and Tim Roth are the bourgeoise couple assaulted by the polite young psychopaths (now played by Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet), but the sub-Brechtian tricks and fourth-wall breaking of the original remain. So does an inherent academic smugness not shared by any of Haneke's other films: in both iterations, "Funny Games" spanks the audience for behavior its director is convinced he's above. I'm not buying it, although Wesley is -- he thinks the new version is one of the year's best so far. I'll agree it's more professionally done (you learn a lot in 11 years) and that Watts brings a needed rigor to her role (not to mention opening Haneke's argument to the arena of celebrity -- do we respond differently to watching a trusted star playing tortured victim than we do to anonymous actors?). But the unexamined attitudes here (that the director's vision of moviegoers is any less reductive than the audience's vision of movie characters, for one thing) is impossible to respect. The movie's the deconstructivist equivalent of pulling wings off flies.
Phew. I feel better. If you're a fan of Gus Van Sant's
artsier work , Wesley's review of " Paranoid Park " should make you want to go. " Alice's House " (photo above), at the Kendall, may not be a clean house but it's full of sensual misbehavior and bad luck for Brazilian women.
I'll be back later with a look at what's playing at the institutes and revival houses.
Is Tang Wei banned in China or not?

In case you missed this one,
the Chinese government has banned
the young star of " Lust, Caution " due to the film's sex scenes and "negative" portrayal of WWII Chinese resistance fighters.
Or maybe not. Per the
ShanghaiList blog , China's State Administration of Radio, FIlm, and Television (SARFT) denies the media blacklist.
Or maybe it doesn't.
This
blog
cites an informal acknowledgement of the ban by a top Chinese official.
Whatever's going on, "Lust, Caution" director
Ang Lee isn't happy
about it. The next stage of this weird Big Brother-ish farce will be the
Asian FIlm Awards
on March 17. "Lust, Caution" is nominated for six awards, including Tang for Best Actress. The question is whether she'll show, although, per the
Reporter article referenced up top , no one has heard otherwise. The key quote is:
"A spokesperson for the Asian Film Awards, where Tang was announced Friday as a presenter, said in an interview that the event had no knowledge of any ban and had not been contacted by TangÂ’s management."
This despite reports that all awards shows in China have been advised to exclude Tang and the film's producers
from their list of guests, while discussions about "Lust, Caution" and Tang on online forums have reportedly been deleted.
My, it's entertaining to watch a giant totalitarian state bureacracy try to run in two different directions at the same time.

Two new developments reported on recently.
You know how I keep saying all big-studio movies will be released in 3-D in five to ten years? (Nod and pretend you do.) Make that three to five, if the numbers in
this SanFran Chronicle story
are correct. Blame Miley Cyrus for the rush to convert as many screens as possible to digital projection and then 3-D capability. Disney's distribution president is quoted in the article as saying of the Hannah Montana 3-D concert movie and its success, "We were in as many locations as we could possibly get. If there were 3,000 3-D screens available, would we have played them all? Yeah, I think we would." In other words, resistance is futile.
And
in other scary news , Paramount will start licensing itty-bitty scenes from its massive film library for use on FaceBook and elsewhere, using a combination clip service/media player called VooZoo. This will lead to the legal use of emoticons of Jack Nicholson in "Chinatown" and Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" -- finally, a genuine purpose to their careers. And here you thought the Internet couldn't get more depressing. For what it's worth,
Anne Thompson
thinks the app will drive more people to classic films. Sure, while reducing their attention spans to that of a spider monkey on crack.

It's kind of refreshing how the math holds, especially when we're talking about March movies: The dumber the film, the more money it makes. And if that movie features a giant tree-climbing attack chicken (in photo above), all the better. " 10,000 B.C. ," which is certifiably idiotic (check these choice
user comments ), made $36 million over the weekend, with a depressingly high $10,478 per-theater-average. " College Road Trip " -- almost but not quite as stupid -- made $14 million; perhaps the weird-casting perfect storm of Martin Lawrence, Raven-Symone, Donny Osmond, and that
scary girl
from "The Suite Life of Zach and Cody" chased audiences away.
The next new release, the reasonably intelligent " The Bank Job ," came in at #5, below " Vantage Point " (unintentionally stupid) and " Semi-Pro " (intentionally stupid). " Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day " -- based on a novel, so it must be smart -- made $2.5 million and didn't crack the top ten.
Hey, you watch 'em, folks. I just report on it. More details from
Box Office Mojo
and
Leonard Klady .
Hey Biggie. He's playing you tonight.

So we can all breathe a sigh of relief. Thanks to the
Hollywood Reporter , we now know that Jamal Woolard has been safely ensconced in the role of Biggie Smalls a.k.a. Christopher Wallace a.k.a. the Notorious B.I.G. in "Notorious," the Hollywood movie of Biggie's life and death. Wasn't the part his, like, eons ago? But wait: Didn't I see something on MTV News about an open casting call after that? No worries, I guess.
And what inspired casting. Not only does Woolard look the part, he's got street cred, too. This is the same Jamal Woolard who, as a rapper named
Gravy , took a bullet to the heinie before conducting an interview at New York's
Hot 97 FM
("Where hip-hop lives!"). Here's Ben McGrath's unreasonably entertaining, highly quotable Hot 97
New Yorker profile , featuring Woolard, from a few years ago. (Where's the "WKRP"/"M*A*S*H" a la "Network" farce about that station? Paging Sidney Lumet.)
As for the movie, despite its dream casting of Anthony Mackie, Angela Bassett as Momma Biggie, and Derek Luke as Diddy (so many haircuts so little time), the odds for greatness seem low. Courtesy of New York Magazine's
Vulture
blog, word on the script is kind of meh. Allegedly, Momma Biggie a.k.a . threw in more than her two cents. Plus: Who plays 'Pac?
In other Hollywood bio pic news: I got a press release from the Weinstein Company bragging about its upcoming Bob Marley movie. No one's been cast yet, but I'm throwing Cate Blanchett's hat in the ring. She could play this Bob, too.

If you want to see a new movie this weekend, it should probably be " The Counterfeiters ," which despite winning the Oscar for best foreign-language film is actually quite good. As much fun as I had writing about " 10,000 B.C. ," it's the kind of movie
you feel slightly unclean paying real money for. Borrow someone's DVD in a few months.
" Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day " has Frances McDormand
and
Amy Adams in WWII England; it's a good, gentle arthouse movie for those unwilling to handle the rigors of "Counterfeiters." " The Unforeseen " is to my mind a genuine disappointment -- a documentary about real estate development that goes soft and gooey right when it should be heading in for the kill. But know that
a lot of other critics
love the film, so proceed accordingly. I still say it's not the movie this subject deserves or even the movie it thinks it is.
Among Wesley's reviews: " The Bank Job " sounds reasonable for a heist movie. " College Road Trip " sounds like getting a cavity filled without novocaine.
You're better off relocating your inner
Bender
at the
Brattle 's quite excellent " The 80s Rock! " series. Tonight (Friday) sees the return of the Ramones and P.J. Soles (in photo above) in " Rock 'N' Roll High School ," while " Fast Times at Ridgemont High ," " Repo Man ," " Desperately Seeking Susan ," and " This is Spinal Tap " also pop up during the weekend. Hold out until Tuesday and you'll see his
Royal Purpleness
in all his funk majesty in " Purple Rain ." Inexplicably missing from the series: " Get Crazy ," director Alan Arkush's
terrific 1983 follow-up to "Rock 'n' Roll High School" and a movie that casts
Malcolm McDowell as Mick Jagger
and
Lou Reed as Bob Dylan . One of the great lost 80s movies, that one.
Much more respectable doings down the street at the
Harvard Film Archive
this weekend. Tonight (Friday) and tomorrow they're bringing in Brazilian filmmaker
Jorge Furtado
for a personal appearance and showings of his short films and the stylish 2003 feature " The Man Who Copied ." Sunday brings a welcome one-day retrospective of the films of the elliptical American director
David Gordon Green
followed on Monday by a sneak of his newest, " Snow Angels " (opening theatrically at the end of this month). Green will be at both events.
Also, the
International Women's Day Film Festival
continues at various locations throughout the city, and on Monday the
Lunafest
program of short films by, for, and about women arrives at
the Coolidge
for one night. At the
MFA , the documentary " Beyond Belief ," about two Boston-area 9/11 widows and their remarkable journey, continues its
occasional run . Combine these three events plus P.J. Soles in "R'n'R High School" and compare to Camilla Belle's limp, passive
Iron Age noodle
in "10,000 B.C." Discuss.

Now,
this
is brilliant: Some web obsessive has
GoogleMapped the car chase
from the 1968 Steve McQueen classic " Bullitt " using locations scouted out by a
pre-existing webpage . (Thanks to
Movie City News
and
Jeffrey Wells
for the tip.)
It's a great idea -- you, too, can now fly over your favorite movie scenes -- and an endlessly applicable one. Why not Jimmy Stewart's fetishistic wanderings through San Francisco in Hitchcock's " Vertigo "? (Someone has already done
the location legwork . ) How about Captain America and Billy's travels through 60s America in " Easy Rider "? Paul Reubens' pit-stops in " Pee-wee's Big Adventure " ( here's a start )? Let a thousand hi-lited route markers bloom.
Oh, and if you've never seen the car chase from "Bullitt," here you go:

No more waiting in vain. According to
the Hollywood Reporter , the Weinsteins have picked up the rights to bring the Bob Marley story to the big screen, with the singer's widow, Rita, executive producing. "I don't want a fairy tale or Cinderella story," she says, and good luck to her on that.
Rita
also wants
Lauryn Hill
to play her (being her mother-in-law, Marley has seen presumably Hill
lately ) and floats the idea of her grandson Stefan -- "the spitting image" of Bob -- as the singer in his younger years. Meanwhile, Martin Scorsese is working on
an authorized documentary
about Marley due for release in 2010, on what would have been the artist's 65th birthday. With luck, either one of these projects could be Marley's onscreen redemption song.

Here it is only March 2008 and Radar's Amy Monaghan has already rounded up
the decade's most misogynistic movies . It's a good, cranky/funny rant for the first five and then it loses a little steam after the basic point has been made: Hollywood movies (and indie movies, too) treat women like dirt. After that, I guess, you have to go into the why -- because sex sells and so does the misogyny it's often packaged with -- and then you have to go into the why of
that , and the house you're building just keeps getting bigger. Bigger than an online movie list can comfortably deal with, anyway.
Anyway, it's worth a read (as are the comments), even if Monaghan inexplicably leaves out " Irreversible " and even if " Sin City " is so well made that it kicks the argument into the realm of, if not art, great pulp fiction. And speaking of which, what about Tarantino? The "Death Proof" half of " Grindhouse " -- pro- or anti-grrl? (It's both, actually, and that's a head-cramper of the first order.)

Here's Jack clip-stumping for Hilary:
And here's a pro-Obama response from some YouTuber.
What's most interesting here is the sight of old-media Hollywood finally getting around to using viral video for political stumpery. Jack, Jack, if you'd been born 40 years later, you'd be as big as
this guy . Me, I'm still waiting for the one that says McCain's f***ing Matt Damon.
What Oscar bump?

Ouch. A truly punk weekend at the box office, with the new Will Ferrell movie " Semi-Pro " pulling in a paltry $15 million and " The Other Boleyn Girl " making about $9 million (although it was in half the theaters that "Semi-Pro" was and made a much higher $7,000 per-screen-average).
More to the point, the Oscar ceremonies translated to little box office action. True, " No Country for Old Men " was bum-rushed back into almost a thousand more theaters for a total of just over 2,000 and it's take was up by two-thirds from the previous week, putting it briefly back into the Top Ten. Don't expect the movie to ever crack the magic $100 million mark, though, even if its $70 million total is by far the highest gross for a Coen Bros. project to date. " There Will Be Blood " slid 40%, " Juno " was down 20%, " Atonement " 60%. " Michael Clayton " didn't even chart -- it is in fact still in theaters -- and apparently Tilda Swinton's unexpected win wasn't enough to prompt even a token re-promotion.
The biggest beneficiary of the little golden man? That would be best foreign language winner " The Counterfeiters ," which expanded from 10 arthouses to 18 and saw its take jump 130%, with an $11,000 per-theater-average, the week's best. Sony Classics is following the exact same routine they did for last year's " The Lives of Others " -- holding a broad release off in hopes for an Oscar win, then heading to the bank when the bet pays off. I saw "Counterfeiters" last night -- it opens at the Kendall on Friday -- and it hits the exact same dramatic/demographic sweet spot as "Lives": a period story about a not-too-nice man (Karl Markovics, in photo above, as a Jewish counterfeiter forced to work for the Nazis) purified by his guilty participation in heinous events. (That said, it's a very good movie on its own terms; more on Friday). Way to niche-market, Sony Classics.
