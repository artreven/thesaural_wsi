Fuck Breast Cancer Awareness and Research

So let me get this straight: there are half a billion underfed kids in the world but our big, fat, #1 “charity” case is a bunch of middle aged American ladies that have led comfortable lives that have come down with a case of the breast cancerz?
The absolute worst is all the dumb slogans and laughable claims of being united in sisterhood or being “strong” and “committed”.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Committed to what?  Whining?  Going on pointless fun runs to raise awareness of the already-most-overexposed disease in America?  What does all this awareness even accomplish?
At least it gets NFL players to wear pink wristbands and stuffs.  -Kicknz

A Fine Collection of Romero Trailers

The
Vault of Horror
recently posted a collection of
George A. Romero
Trailers. There are a couple movies missing, such as the
ROMANTIC COMEDY , “ There’s Always Vanilla ” (wait… what?!), and his fourth film, “ Season of the Witch ” (not to be confused with the recent
Cage/Perlman
thriller).
I’ve included those in this post, but go check out The Vault for the classics. Classics such as…
Knightriders !
And here’s the trailer for There’s Always Vanilla:
… if that’s a romantic comedy… umm… wow…
And Season of the Witch:
Ok. Let’s watch these films!
Go to
The Vault of Horror
for the others.

A startling confession: in 2010, Western Games > Japanese Games

*Note: This article is primarily concerned with arcade and console video games, and not the computer video game market.  Thanks.
To make a long story short, video games were originally dominated by American companies.  Then Japanese companies got a piece of the pie and then eventually dominated the whole market.  Then American (and European) companies slowly came back and now they totally dominate the world console market.
In a few short years the Japanese have become shells.  I’m not going to say they’re totally useless or anything stupid like that but they’re really repeating themselves  ( New Super Mario Bros. Wii ,
Super Mario Galaxy 2, Street Fighter IV ), making mediocre sequels ( Resident Evil 5 ), or just ruining their classic series ( Metroid: Other M ,
Sonic Unleashed ).
The last new idea from Nintendo that I liked was Pikmin, which is now 9 freaking years old!  Most of the games/series that I’ve enjoyed the most from the current generation have been Western in origin:
BioShock ,
Fallout 3 ,
Grand Theft Auto IV ,
Red Dead Redemption ,
Half-Life 2 ,
Batman: Arkham Asylum , etc.  This is strange for me to admit because I’ve had a strong bias for Japanese games since I was a kindygardner.
My recommendation: ritual suicide for the entirety of Japan.

70 Aspects of Batman: 28

MIKE ALLRED
From Wikipedia:
Michael Dalton “Mike” Allred
is an
American
comic book artist and writer
most famous for his indie comics creation,
Madman . His style is often compared to pop art, as well as commercial and comic art of the 1950s and 1960s.
Allred began his career as a TV reporter in Europe, and started drawing comics in 1989 with the 104-page
OGN
Dead Air ( Slave Labor Graphics ). Following this up with his similarly-titled works
Graphique Musique (SLG, 1990) and
Grafik Muzik ( Caliber Comics
1990/91), he set out the style that he was to become known for with his most famous character: Madman.
The first
Madman miniseries debuted from
Tundra Publishing
in March 1992, and gained higher recognition with its move to
Dark Horse Comics
in April 1994. Relaunched as
Madman Comics, it went on to be nominated for several
Harvey Awards . Allred himself gained further mainstream attention with the science-fiction/rock-and-roll comic
Red Rocket 7
and his art for writer
Peter Milligan ‘s series
X-Force , which he began drawing in July 2001, and subsequently became
X-Statix
after
X-Force #128.
His more recent work includes
The Golden Plates, an adaptation of
The Book of Mormon . Other projects are inking
X-Statix Presents: Deadgirl, and work on a new ‘Madman’ series. He has also drawn three issues of the
Vertigo
comic
Fables .
His wife,
Laura , frequently works as his
colorist .
Allred is a member of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , otherwise known as the Mormons.
Currently, he’s performing art duties on up and coming
Vertigo
series
I, Zombie, written by
Chris Roberson . The main character, Gwendolyn “Gwen” Dylan, is a ‘zombie girl detective’.
I first encountered Mike Allred’s work in the pages of
Madman
#1, waaaay back in 1993. When I would stay with my grandparents for a bit in the summer, my grandma would drive me to nearby Iowa City in order to take advantage of some of the things the college town offered that their small town didn’t. Like comic shops! I don’t remember if I read about
Madman
before I bought it, but for some reason one day, instead of getting the newest issue of
Spawn
I got
Madman
#1 from Tundra. I was instantly attracted to Allred’s clean, retro style (though his early stuff had more of a
Charles Burns -y feel as well), and read and re-read the issue multiple times. I’ve been an Allred devotee ever since.
Apart from the odd pin-up, Allred’s most substantial work on Batman appeared in his issue of
Solo , entitled “Batman-A-Go-Go”. I want to say BAGG was meant to be a miniseries at one point, but I can’t find anything online to support that. I definitely remember it being an idea that was mentioned long before it eventually appeared.
Unsurprisingly, considering the influence the 60s have on his work,  Allred’s take on Batman in this story is steeped in the look of the Adam West starring-TV show. The main plot of “Batman-A-Go-Go”, however, actually concerns Batman’s disillusionment about how the world is changing into a much darker place than the day-glo sound effects-laden one of the show. It’s an interesting take, and it would have been nice to see this story in full miniseries form (if that was ever actually a possibility).
So in closing, Mike Allred has long been one of my favorite comic artists, and you should do your best to seek out his issue of
Solo , and everything else he’s ever done.
– Greg

Vince Clarke’s Analogue Monologues

So this is pretty fun.
Vince Clarke
(of
Depeche Mode ,
Yazoo ,
Erasure , etc.) has a new feature on his website called
The Analogue Monologues .
It’s basically just a series of videos involving Vince talking about all of his wicked analog gear and then turning knobs and stuff. But it’s cool!
There are only two videos so far.
The first video is about the
Sequential Circuits Pro One .
And the second video is about the
Roland System 100m .
Both of them real beauties!
and speaking of beauties:
Vince Clarke and his favorite ladder.
