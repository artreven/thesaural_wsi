BLOG - November 2008
11.03.08 - Monday
The race team turned in their worst performance of the race
series this past Saturday.  2483 was 11th prize about 13 minutes behind the
first bird clocked in the club.  Although the east side of the club and
combine filled the top of the race sheet, the race team seemed tired.  I am
surprised because I thought that the team was in excellent form and condition.
I have no explanation for the team's poor performance.  As a precaution,
their exercise will be limited this week as they are prepared for the final
young bird race of the series from 300 miles at Waco, Texas.
In order to control the race team's exercise, I am going to
train them on the road from 15 to 20 miles twice a day on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday instead of exercising them around the loft twice a day.  By
keeping them just a little hungry, they should trap quickly although they will
not have exercised as long as normal.  I will road train them from the
north; although the race course is from the south.  This exercise should
also sharpen their orientation ability.
The breeders will be coupled in less than a month; on about
December 1.  For the past five weeks, I have been reviewing pedigrees and
marking down which pigeons to couple.  If you want to race the widowhood
system in 2009 young birds, it is now time to begin the process.  Widowhood
and intense sexual motivation requires the oldest most mature young birds
possible.  Consequently, young birds should be hatched as close to January
1 as possible in order to race them in August, September and October.  As I
blogged earlier, the breeders have been on an annual complete medication program
for about three weeks.  The breeders should be in perfect health when
coupled.  If not, wait until they are in perfect health to couple them or
foster the eggs from breeders that are not in perfect health.
As you may known by now, I generally prefer pedigrees that are
line-bred to cousins, aunt-nephew or uncle-niece, etc.  I am not generally
prone to coupling parents to children or siblings to produce racers for young
birds.  I might couple this way for late-hatch breeders in late spring or
early summer however
I received a call today from Bubba Wilson in Arkansas.
On Saturday's 250 mile race, he won the top four positions with four on a drop.
Three of the four racers were Antoine Jacops crosses.  This makes five
races in a row that Bubba has won with mostly Jacops crosses.
Last week I received a call from Arnel Vega who told me that
in his current third year of racing, he went from the bottom of the race sheet
to the top of the race sheet using the methods outlined in the blog and the
videos on drjohnlamberton.com.  Several weeks ago, he won a third prize in
a large California Combine race just behind one of the top fanciers in the area.
His turnaround on the race sheet was so dramatic that other fanciers have been
seeking his secret.  Arnel said that there is no secret; just high quality
information on drjohnlamberton.com.  Arnel told me, "This really works!"
Yes it does.  Motivated pigeons race home while less motivated or
unmotivated pigeons fly home.  It really that simple.  Arnel is also
performing well with a young bird in a futurity he entered out of a Lamberton
pigeon.
Frank Jared in southern Oklahoma is also performing well with
a Jacops cross in a futurity he entered.
Larry Adams in southern Oklahoma called to report on his race
results.  He has performed very well with Lamberton Jacops pigeons this
race season winning a number of races.  One particular male out of a full
brother to Jacops' NUDIST coupled with a granddaughter to the VELO is one of his
foundation breeders.  This male bred two high point birds for two different
fanciers in the past three years.
My friends and club mates racing under the TNT TITANS
partnership, Tony Smith and grandson Josh Cooley, were 6th and 7th club with
Jacops crosses.
My friend Steve King has sold Lamberton Jacops pigeons to
friends who have performed very well in the last year.
Time after time, the Jacops pigeons race extremely well in any
circumstance for anyone.  They really are that good.
As I have blogged repeatedly, Jacops is a master at breeding
pigeons that race and breed very well.  He accomplishes this feat by
maintaining a 70%/30% balance between line-breeding and out-crossing.

HOW DO YOU BREED ALL-AROUND DUAL PURPOSE PIGEONS?
The following three types of pedigrees show you how to
accomplish this feat:
1.  AU 08 LAMBERTON 234 is an excellent female bred
primarily from the pigeons of Antoine Jacops.  She is currently offered for
sale on ipigeon.com.  Her pedigree represents one of the pedigrees types
that I look for when I couple the breeders in October and November each year.
234's sire is 1801.  1801's mother is BELG 03 6192439.
234's mother is BELG 03 6192440.  These import pigeons are nest sisters and
have both bred excellent racers.  234 is an aunt-nephew mating.  About
75% of 234's pedigree is line-bred to the pigeons of Antoine Jacops.  The
other 25% is out-crossed to an excellent performance male who has also bred
excellent racers in Holland.  Antoine's target is 70% line-breeding 30%
out-crossing.  234's pedigree is close to that target ratio.
Consequently, since 234's physical structure is very good, she should race well
and breed well.
2.  AU 08 LAMBERTON 9 pencil male represents another type
of pedigree I like to use to breed dual purpose pigeons.  If you will
notice 9's paternal grandmother and maternal grandfather are full brother and
sister.  This makes 9's parents first cousins to each other.  I like
these pairings very much!  In addition, 9's maternal grandmother is also a
cousin of the first cousins.  Consequently, 75% of 9's pedigree is
line-bred while 25%, the paternal grandfather, represents a 25% outcross.
3.  The final example - and probably the best example -
is AU 07 TEAM 814 blue white flight female.  Please study her pedigree
carefully.  Her grandfathers are nest mates and her grandmothers are full
sisters.  Their pictures are on the pedigree.  814 is an example of a
very nice pedigree for breeding.  Her genotype is very homogenous and ideal
for an out-cross to create a racing pigeon with superb hybrid vigor.  814
may have been a great racer also because she is absolutely perfect in the hand.
In a few weeks, I plan on out-crossing 814 to another line-bred family of
pigeons; probably the Ceulemans or Mattens.

THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY BREEDING ON DECEMBER 1, 2008
Like I have been saying all week, if you want to breed early
2009 young birds, it is now time to thoroughly medicate the breeders.
Medicate for each anomaly one at a time and for enough time to thoroughly rid
the breeders of any problems.  For instance, I give an antibiotic for 10
days.  If necessary, wait ten more days after treatment and medicate again
for another ten days.  The goal is to create very healthy breeders to begin
the breeding season.  You must do whatever is necessary to make sure your
breeders are perfectly healthy for the onset of the breeding season on December
1, 2008.
Write down each breeding male from which you wish to breed and
select a female for each male.  female selection should focus on line-breeding
and out-crossing depending upon the pedigree target for a breeding couple's
offspring.  By December 1, you should select an ideal breeding pair for
each male in the breeding loft.  Perhaps you may want to poly-breed a
particular male or males.  If you do, pre-select several females for each male
that is selected for poly-breeding.
In the case of younger breeders, I suggest pre-mating the last
week in November.  Pre-mating means that you introduce a new female to a new
male for a day or several days (one day at a time) the week before December 1.
For instance, put a male and female together on Monday and Thursday.  Or
Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  However, only one day of pre-mating may be
required to mate all breeding pairs on December 1.  The goal is to produce
eggs in seven to ten days after mating.  This means mating on December 1
and having the females lay fertile eggs from December 7 to 10.  Breeding
couples that don't mate quickly on December 1 may result in (1) eggs later than
desired, (2) eggs laid later than the average time of egg laying for the entire
breeding loft and/or an infertile egg(s).  The ultimate goal is to produce
two healthy squabs from each breeding pair that hatch as close to January 1 as
possible.
The performance of the 2009 young bird race team in the 2009
young bird race series begins this week.  Although it is not too late to
begin medicating your breeders now, I have been thoroughly medicating the
breeders since early October.
AN EMAIL FROM DR. WARREN SHETRONE IN HAWAII
I received the following email from Dr. Warren Shetrone, an
esteemed veterinarian and pigeon fancier who re-located from California to
Hawaii last year.  Warren wanted to start racing pigeon in Hawaii with
pigeons that could successfully traverse the incredibly difficult race courses
among the islands.  Warren contacted me, we discussed his goals, and he
purchased AU 07 TEAM 26, a blue Antoine Jacops female that had performed very well
in the 2007 young bird race series.  Please read Warren's email very
carefully.  Racing pigeons in the islands is very hard.  His email is
as follows:
Aloha John; I was going thru my records the other day and
found an email from you in which you stated that you were fretting which female
from your race team to send to me. Fret no more my friend as this female
produced two winners from the same nest when paired with one of most
reliable old widowhood males I brought from California.
The female I flew here was one
of only five birds to ever make it home from Maui (86miles) in the entire
club. I rested these five birds and sent them back to Maui again  She came
with another female to win again by 2 hours . Three more arrived at my loft
with no other birds returning. My club continued on for two more races until
they ran out of birds. The moral of the story is that very few birds
released at the edge of one island will strike out over 70 miles of open
water without being able to see where they are going.
Her nest mate brother was
sent as a youngster to compete in one of the many money band races they have
in Honolulu. This young male hatched in late April was chastised as being
too big and gangly, flew eleven straight races moving up steadily each week
He was 2nd Combine against 600 birds two weeks before the big race from the
Southern tip of my island(300) miles. I flew over for the big race and
pooled him all the way. Birds were released at 7am and my bird came with a
loft mate to tie for first place at 1109 ypm. I should explain that the
trade winds always blow from the southeast which aids the Oahu birds and are
disastrous for us flying in the opposite direction.
My partner Ron Boyer
purchased AU 08 LAMBERTON 14 on my behalf in last week's ipigeon.com
auction.  I'd be interested in knowing what birds you acquire from
Antoine's final sale.
Sorry for rambling so much,
but obviously I'm very pleased what one little female - 26 -  did for my
enthusiasm.
Warren
Warren's tremendous success breeding the 26 female is incredibly
gratifying for me.  As I have been saying for over 25 years, the Antoine
Jacops pigeons are some of the very best racing pigeons in the world.  This
is one of the reasons that I had the confidence to start selling pigeons in 2007
after years of prodding and encouragement from many friends, as well as the
support and advise my dear friend Mike Ganus, the finest racing pigeon fancier
in the USA and one of the best in the world.  Concerning my other mentor, I
am very sad that Antoine is selling most of his entire breeding and racing loft
next month due to his health.  The well-spring from which I have been
purchasing super pigeons since the mid 1980s is about to dry up.  However,
I will still look to Mike and Antoine to help advise me in the future.
The fact that the young female and male, nest mates, from 26,
raced so well in such tough physical conditions only reaffirms my confidence
again in these superb pigeons.  Congratulations Warren.  Winning is
not only the result of great pigeons.  It also takes a great fancier.
Congratulations!
By sheer coincidence, Bubba Wilson visited me several weeks
ago from Arkansas.  He said that he wanted an excellent, proven Antoine
Jacops female.  He purchased the DIAMOND QUEEN, AU 05 LAMBERTON 49 blue female,
26's mother.  Good luck Bubba.
AU 07 TEAM 26 blue female's line-bred pedigree of Antoine Jacops
pigeons is the following:
I had mentioned that I might start road-training the young
bird race team this week because of their lack luster performance in last week's
300 mile/480 kilometer race.  Due to the south winds this week gusting to
30 or 40 miles per hour in the Tulsa area, I decided that road training would be
too unpredictable and ultimately dangerous and foolish.  Consequently, the
race team was exercised "open loft" on Tuesday and Wednesday.  The same
will occur on Thursday.  The young birds currently look very good and seem
to be preparing well for Saturday's race.   But that's also what I
thought I observed last week.
There are usually a number of management strategies that will
perform the same function.  Effect loft management sometimes involves
altering a management strategy to obtain the same goal sought by a previous
strategy that didn't seem to work as well as intended.  Although the young
birds need to rest after racing seven weeks in a row, they also need to remain
in form through proper continuous exercise.  Road training, open loft, and
two regimented exercise periods per day are all effect ways to obtain the same
performance goal.  Because the young birds may be a little stale after
seven weeks of regimented racing, a change to open loft daily exercise may
refresh them.  then again, it may make no difference at all.
Hopefully it won't hurt Saturday's performance.  We'll see how the results
of the altered daily exercise regiment worked this weekend.
11.10.08 - Monday
The 300 mile race from Waco was a good one.  The race
team all arrived in about 45 minutes after the first loft mate clocked which was
AU 08 LAMBERTON 108
scoring 13th club.  The race
team has definitely fallen off during the last two 300 mile races.  After
winning 5 out of 6 club races, they may have been just a little tired.
However, their performance was still good enough to win
club average speed in the B Race Series .
The 2nd average speed loft was about 36 minutes behind Lamberton Cuypers.
Over 8 B races, the difference between the first and 2nd place lofts for each
race was 3 minutes.  In other words, on each race, the margin of victory
from the first to the 2nd place bird was 3 minutes.  In 1500 miles of
racing young birds, that is very fast racing.  But these figures bear out
the fact that racing south from northeast Oklahoma into Texas with prevalent
tailwinds is a very fast race course.  The old-time relentless hard weather
birds will not fair well on this race course.  Only the fastest birds will
win.  Only the most intelligent birds will win.  Birds that understand
the game they are playing and are motivated to excel week after week in very
tough competition.
Even though Lamberton Cuypers scored 13th in the Waco race, a
Lamberton pigeon still won the race.
AU 08 BLUE SKIES
166
Antoine Jacops blue female won the club race for TNT TITANS, Tony Smith &
Josh Cooley.  166 was one of several young birds that we gave Josh and Tony
to race.  The BLUE SKIES band designation comes from the Blue Skies Charity
Race we have sponsored on Lookout Mountain Ranch.

K & J loft did not qualify for the average speed award.
If you look at the Lamberton Cuypers Average Speed Results, 8
different birds clocked first on the eight races.  Since we began the race
series with 13 birds, 8 of the 13 young birds won the club B average speed
award: one male, 44403, and seven females.  These statistics continue to
validate the point that it doesn't take a large team of racers to be very
competitive in pigeon races.
11.11.08 - Tuesday
The Combine and Federation results are out for the last 300
mile/480 kilometer young bird race.
Tony Smith & Josh Cooley won 3rd, 4th and 5th prizes competing against 945
pigeons!   Congratulations gentlemen.  Two of these birds are
Antoine Jacops crosses while the 3rd prize bird is a "pure" Antoine Jacops young
bird rung at Lamberton Cuypers loft.  The parents of AU 08 BLUE SKIES 166
blue female have produced other excellent racers.  166's sire is a white
Jacops' import male.  I was just visiting via email with Art Casale about
the Jacops' white pigeons.  He knows of a fancier in California who races
extremely well with these special pigeons.  If you have been following this
blog, you may recall that Jacops began racing pigeons with a white male, the
Oude Witte (Old White) from Emiel Verhaert.  Together with a blue female, the
Blauw Witoog (Blue White Eye) from Warre De Schutter, this basic pair launched
Antoine Jacops into the top of the race sheet in the Antwerp Union Belgium for
the next 40 years.  History has recorded that both Verhaert and De Schutter
were "geniuses" or Masters in the racing pigeon sport in Belgium.
Still to this day, the Jacops pigeons produce whites on
occasion.  Often, these whites are gold!!!  They race well and breed
even better.  Besides myself, both Steve Trotter and Bill Kinyon have raced
extremely well with offspring out of white Jacops.  Steve and Bill have
been two of the best fanciers in the Federation for many years.  More
specifically, Bill raised 10 race winners out of a white Jacops female.
Back to Tony and Josh, their three females landed on a drop and
all three were racing on widowhood to older males.  As they can testify,
the widowhood system works.  Motivation is the key to winning pigeon races.
I encourage all readers to raise early youngsters to race on
some form of proper motivation in the 2009 young bird race series. While you are
at it, please consider sending young birds to the Texas Center Convention in
Tulsa, Oklahoma USA July 14 - 19, 2009.  As I have said before, three of
the very best fanciers in Oklahoma are organizing the event: Roland Gutierrrez,
Steve Trotter and Bill Hill.  The Convention will be excellent and the
races will be very competitive.
Click
Here for more information .
In addition, for you white and grizzle enthusiasts like me,
Bob Roberson is promoting his one loft grizzle/white races again in 2009.
Bob has changed the loft location from his home near Chandler
to the Oklahoma City area.  I have entered this race before and will again
in 2009.  Perhaps I will see you at the races in October.  In October
2009, there will be two races: the first from 150 miles/240 kilometers and the
second from 300 miles/480 kilometers.  These races are a great opportunity
to test your grizzle pigeons.  Click on the All Grizzle Banner for more
information.
The next several weeks, I will pre-mate the breeders so that
coupling on December 1, 2008 will go smoothly and quickly.  I have been
grading a few 2008 males and females from which to breed in 2009.  These young
pigeons will take more care and effort to couple quickly than the older
breeders.  If their youngsters are to hatch in the same time period as the
older more experienced breeders, it will take a significant amount of pre-mating
to put them on the same time schedule as the older breeders.  The next
several weeks will provide the opportunity to pre-mate younger breeders.  I
seldom couple two young pigeons.  Instead, I couple young pigeons with
older more seasoned breeders.  If these young birds are placed in one side
of a nest box with an older mate for several hours a couple of times per week,
the pairing ritual will be much shorter on December 1.
I have visited with several fanciers in my area who already
have their breeders paired on paper.  This amount of organization is
excellent!  It will simplify the task on December 1 if these decisions have
been carefully analyzed and decided ahead of time.  Each day of the 365 day
calendar year has a task that is repeated annually.  Success is not
entirely an accident or a function of random chance.  Success is usually
the result of careful thought and hard work.  The degree of success of
entire 2009 young bird racing season most probably will result from the
decisions or lack of decisions that you make during the latter part of November
each year about the youngsters you want to raise from your breeders pairs.
Please consider coupling your breeders to produce prepotency and hybrid vigor.
Prepotency is usually developed by line-breeding and hybrid vigor is produced
from out-crossing.  Try uncle-niece, aunt nephew, first cousins, second
cousins as potential breeding pairs.  Couple two different line-bred
families to produce hybrid vigor.  then after the 2009 young bird race
series, take the best crosses and breed them back to one or the other families
from which they came.
I often plan breeding couples two or three years ahead from
birds I haven't raised yet.  It is all accomplished on paper using a good
pedigree program.  I name the future pigeons Test 1, 2, 3, etc. and breed
from young birds that I haven't raced yet in the 2009 yb race series and haven't
even been hatched yet.  Proper breeding is often like a good game of chess:
one move after the other as a result of strategy and thought.  Try not to
make your breeding program entirely random.  Although clique breeding pairs
are often the result of good fortune, the majority of them are more a function
of careful planning.
Last week, I placed an excellent half-Steketee female on
ipigeon.com, AU 08 LAMBERTON 235 blue white-flight pied female.  I may place
one or two more Steketee-based pigeons on the internet.  There are two
beautiful daughters of the 603 Steketee raced by the brothers-in-law partnership
of Oliviers-Devos breeding in Tulsa, Oklahoma USA.  The 603 Steketee is a
fabulous long distance racer that I have blogged about before.  Many
readers may not be familiar with the fantastic Steketee pigeons in Holland.
The Steketee pigeons come from an incredible long distance fancier in Holland by
the name of Jac Steketee.
Click

in Holland is Jan Polder.  He became a national threat in 1985 when he
purchased 15 youngsters directly from Jac Steketee's best breeders.

include most of the 2008 young bird race team.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT
Over the weekend, I received several nice emails.  The
following are excerpts:
1.  "I have enjoyed your informative videos,
particularly the widowhood setup. I am curious about watering the widowhood
birds. My friend Art Casale steered me towards your website and speaks highly of
you."
2.   "A couple of weeks ago, quite by accident I
discovered your website and started reading your blog. Since I am starting back
into pigeon racing after a nearly 40 year layoff I found what you write to be
both very interesting and very informative and just wanted to say that I am
reading it and I hope you will continue writing it.
As someone who is starting over and approaching this as a total novice I
find your blog very exciting as a source of information.  I just don't know
where else a person would find a how to instruction that would be so
carefully structured on a day by day, minute by minute thought by thought
basis with logic to enforce every minute detail of a working strategy for
consistent care of the birds and development of a winning team.  This
is a great service for those of us starting out, as we can preclude many
mistakes that might otherwise  be made in a hap hazard trial and error
method of searching for a system that works. You are probably aware that
many fliers never share their secrets or systems.  So thanks for your
unselfish sharing of what obviously has been acquired thru much effort and
energy over many years of hard work."
3.  "We need more people in the sport like you.  Your
interests are not self oriented but are directed towards the betterment of
the sport itself.   In this day and age of pigeons, nothing
can compare with the sport in Europe where
its foundation exists.   Your efforts are truly
appreciated by those
of us who have respect for our birds as well as our peers.
Keep up the great work."
Thank you to all of you who know about the website and who
enjoy the content.  Your emails of encouragement make all of the difference
in the world.  I would prefer to blog every workday, but with life's busy
challenges, it's easy to run out of time to spend on the computer.  Your
emails motivate me to write when I am too tired to do so strictly on my own
will.  Jeremy ( my son who takes the pictures and videos) and I are trying
to make a positive difference in the Sport because it has given so much to me
personally.
USING HANDS TO EVALUATE PIGEONS
When I was 16 years old, I was a high school calf-roper.
Practicing for a local calf-roping event, I made a costly mistake and was nearly
dragged to death.  I nearly lost the use of my right arm and hand and still
suffer from major paralysis.  The racing pigeons were a major factor in my
recovery and remain a major component of my life today. While there are many
sports in which I have great difficulty competing due to my disability (this is
not a politically correct word anymore - I should have said challenges), I can
compete with racing pigeons.
Since that accident, I have severely injured my left hand and
wrist twice working with horses and cattle.  In reality, I have less than
one-half of a good hand with which to negotiate life's journey.  I remember
in the mid-eighties on a trip with Mike Ganus to Belgium, Tist Eyssen, the
Janssen Brothers brother-in-law, told Rene Truyen that I grabbed the birds and
held tightly when I handled them.  Embarrassed by Tist's comment, Rene did
not want to hurt my feelings by interpreting the remarks.  But I could tell
from Tist's hand motions and body language what he was saying.  So I showed
Tist my paralyzed hand and arm.  He turned bright red from embarrassment. I
will be forever grateful to him, however, for forcing me to begin to address my
deficiencies and begin to learn how to handle pigeons with hands that do not
function correctly.  For me, handling pigeons and evaluating them by feel
and touch has become artistry - not because I am good at it - but because it is
so very difficult to do.
I remember on a trip to my home in Tulsa with his wife Maria,
when he looked at the widowhood team, Antoine Jacops said that I breed better
Jacops pigeons than Jacops.  He then told me I had a tremendous eye for a
good pigeons; but my major weakness was my hands.  He told me that I would
never be a good or great fancier unless I overcame my fear of using my hands to
evaluate racing pigeons.  From that time forward, I have used my hands as
much or more than my eyes to evaluate pigeons for racing and breeding.
Believe me, if I can do it, anyone can do it.  I
encourage everyone to spend time in your loft at night when it is difficult to
use your eyes as evaluation tools.  Handle your best pigeons.  After a
while, your hands will send information to your brain that forms a mental image
and begins to make some sort of sense about the type and conformation of various
pigeons.  Although you may have seen it, I made a video about evaluating
pigeons with your hands.
Incidentally, while I am revealing some of my oddities, I blog
and type one-handed with my left hand.  For 16 years I was right-handed.
Since then, I have been left-handed.  Since my father and two of my three
sons are left-handed, I am able to use my left hand very well.  There may
be some type of left-handed genetic advantage in my family.  In addition,
fortunately, I played the piano at 16 and was used to using both hands.  So
I type using all of my fingers backwards on the keyboard (no pecking with one
finger).  Due to the piano lessons, I type fairly quickly.  Thank
goodness for spell-check on Microsoft Word.  It generally corrects the
unintended extra letters that frequently find their way into my words in the
blog.
BREEDING SEASON IS NEAR - IT'S TIME TO TURN ON THE LIGHTS
Breeding season begins in about two weeks.  I will couple
the breeders and the widowhood team together about December 1.  I will also
turn the lights on the breeders and give them about 16 hours of daylight each
day.  The extended light will stimulate the sexual activity of the breeders
and allow them to breed successfully in the darkness of winter.  The
widowhood team will not experience an altered light schedule.  I believe
that the widows should experience a normal winter's light in order to moult
regularly during the racing season.  Extended light helps the breeding
process primarily in two ways.  First, it allows the breeders to feed the
youngsters longer hours during the day.  The extra feed will translate into
healthier, more robust youngsters. Secondly, extended light often results in a
greater percentage of fertile eggs than normal winter light.  Consequently,
it is probable that more youngsters will hatch from breeders on a light system
than breeders with no light system. Because I foster many of the breeder's eggs
under the widows, I am not as concerned about the fertility percentage of eggs
among the widows as I am among the breeders.  I will throw away many of the
widow's eggs in favor of breeding two rounds of youngsters out of the breeders
that are about 10 days to two weeks apart in age.
HOW TO BREED MORE EARLY YOUNGSTERS FROM BREEDERS
If you want to breed more early youngsters out of the
breeders, couple the breeders and widows (or foster parents) at the same time.
Transfer the breeder's eggs to the widows and dispose of the widow's eggs
(except in the case of your best racers).  In about 10 days, the breeders
should lay a second round of eggs.  Following this procedure, you should be
able to produce two rounds out of the breeders about 10 days apart.  Even
if you only have one or two good pairs of breeders, please follow this
procedure.  It is better to race several great pigeons that a whole flock
of average pigeons.  In pigeon racing, contrary to popular opinion, there
is seldom safety in numbers.  Greater numbers generally translate into more
time, more work, and more expense.
SUCCESS IN 2009 BEGINS NOW
Success in the 2009 young bird race season largely begins now.
Your breeders should be medicated and vaccinated by now.  Breeding couples
should be determined based upon genotype and pfemaleotype and written down in a
three-ring binder.  Nest boxes should be clean.  Nest bowls should be
clean with new nest pads.  Nesting material should be gathered.  I
gather pine needles at several places in Tulsa.  The 2009 racing and
breeding season begins in Tulsa on December 1.  It is time to complete the
final preparations for a great 2009 season over the next two weeks!
Last week and this week I have posted one of the best sets of
young females on ipigeon that I have ever posted.  In addition to several
summer-breds, I posted several of the females on the 2008 Young Bird Race team
including the 1st Ace West Tulsa RPC in the B Race Series,
AU 08 ARPU 44435 .  There is also a full sister
to the nest mates, AU 05 LAMBERTON 64 and 65 pigeons, AU 08 LAMBERTON 250 blue
check white flight pied female.  As a reference, 64 was the 4th National Ace
2006 Old Birds ARPU and 65 has raised six children that have won 1st place or
equal first place for Kirk Hardin including last week's tough 300 mile/480
kilometer race in the Keystone RPC where 3 of the top 5 pigeons in the B Race
were 65 children or grandchildren.  The following are pictures of 65 and
250.
The are a number of excellent foundation females on
ipigeon this week
that have been raced or marked for sale.

THE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS OF USING A THREE-RING
BINDER AS AN ANNUAL PERMANENT RECORD
Within each daily Blog during the calendar year, I often
repeat or restate certain ideas.  If this is boring or overly repetitive,
please forgive me.  But proper loft management is repetitive and I don't
know how to reflect on management activities on a daily basis without repeating
or restating.  With that said, I strongly encourage everyone to purchase or
find a three-ring binder today to use during the 2009 calendar year.  I
don't like binders with large rings as this type of binder is personally hard
for me to handle.  I like binders with small rings that are easy to open
and carry.  Be sure to get a binder with a plastic cover.  Find a
picture that motivates you and is something that makes you feel extremely good.
It can be a picture of a pigeon or a fancier or your loft or your family -
anything that strikes the most positive chord in your psyche.  then, print
the picture on an 8 X 10 sheet and slip in underneath the plastic see-through
cover of the three-ring binder.  You will be amazed at the positive
motivation to use the binder that a relevant picture creates in your mind.
Also, be sure to use page separators to create sections within the binder.
Designate the first separator's tab as 2009 Breeders.  then, designate the
second tab as 2009 Youngsters or something to that effect.
By hand or using the computer or word processor, list the
breeding pairs that you have decided to couple for 2009.  You can copy the
pedigrees for each pair and include that information in the Breeder section of
the binder or I sometimes print a "Test" page from the pedigree program I use to
create pedigrees.  A "Test" pedigree will allow you to visually evaluate
the quality of the youngsters produced from each breeding couple.
Under the second tab, write down or list in a table in a word
document, each band number with a column for date of hatching, parents, color,
sex, and special notes about each youngster hatched.  The following
template is one example that you might use in your binder.
2009 YOUNG BIRDS – AU 09 LAMBERTON

Let me strongly suggest that you update the information in the
three-ring binder on a daily basis if possible.  Most of the time,
recording information in the binder is more a function of discipline than of
time.  It may help to also use a clip board with several sheets of blank
breeding records in the clip board.  That way, when you ring your
youngsters, you can jot the info down on the working notes on the clipboard and
then transfer the information to the permanent binder.  For smaller
breeding operations, it may be easier just to keep the binder with you and only
record the breeding records one time.  I use several clip boards within the
breeding loft to keep notes.  If you are like me, I have found that I will
perform a work function much more readily if it is very convenient to do so.
And I am definitely to the age where my memory is much less reliable than in
years past.
So, two management functions that I suggest you begin
immediately are using a binder and a clip board(s) to easily keep relevant and
important breeding information and notes.  Especially when fostering eggs,
immediately record each and every action that you make in the breeding loft.
Believe me, it will help more than you can imagine later on when you are trying
to remember what you did when you thought at the time that you would surely
remember your actions.
HOW TO CREATE PEDIGREES WITH PREPOTENCY & HYBRID VIGOR
The ideal pedigree should contain about 70% homogenous genes
and a 30% outcross of heterogeneous genes.  An outstanding homing pigeon
with this pedigree with most probably race and breed well and is sometimes
referred to as a dual-purpose pigeon.  I believe that the percentage of
youngsters raised each year that performs well as racers and are successfully
retired to the breeding loft will dramatically increase if there is an organized
well-planned breeding program in place rather than continually breeding two
unrelated pigeons together hoping for magic to strike through a great outcross.
A breeding loft that continually outcrosses every pair of breeders is playing a
game of roulette in which the outcome is determined strictly by luck or chance.
If you are more of a gambler type of personality, this type of breeding program
may excite you and adequately fulfill your needs. However, if you are more of a
connoisseur of the artistry of successfully breeding a family of pigeons, a more
organized breeding program will probably fit your needs better.  In this
case, raising youngsters with a 70/30 ratio of prepotency to hybrid vigor will
probably satisfy your needs much better.
The following pedigree for AU 07 TEAM 814 blue white-flight
female demonstrates a type of line-breeding that has generated a pedigree with a
very homogenous gene pool:
Let's carefully examine this pedigree.  The parents of
814 are double first cousins.  Their grandfathers are not only full
brothers; they are nest mates: BELG 98 6121464 and BELG 98 6121465.  The
grandmothers are full sisters, BELG 98 6121421 and BELG 97 6200741.
Further, all of the grandparents are related.  The FINE CAHORS - BELG 95
6582941, sire to the grandfathers, is a half-brother to the SUPER ACE - BELG 87
6444021, the sire of the grandmothers.  Both the FINE CAHORS and the SUPER
ACE are children of the super-pigeon, KLEINE CAHORS that represented Belgium in
the Olympiade in 1987 and were out-crossed to produce the grandparents of 814.
If it were not for this critically important fact of out-crossing in the 4th
generation of the pedigree, 814's pedigree would be too inbred and would not
have worked.  Although 814 was not raced, I believe that she has the
pfemaleotype or confirmation to have raced very well.  I definitely believe
that she will make a great breeder.  I plan on out-crossing her to a
line-bred Vandenabeele or GOLDEN MATTENS male.
Breeding a family of successful racers and breeders around
several outstanding pigeons is simply a matter of weaving a genetic fabric in
future youngsters which includes the proper percentage of prepotency or
line-breeding with the proper percentage of hybrid vigor or out-crossing.
As I indicated earlier, according to the Masters, that percentage or ratio is
approximately 70/30.
Depending upon how you started in pigeons and from whence your
breeders came, getting to the 70/30 ratio may take some time and require some
effort.  If you are starting from scratch, I recommend that you out-cross
two very high quality pigeons (Pair 1).  then, take the very best
youngster(s) of Pair 1 and breed them back to outstanding brothers or sisters of
Pair 1.  If you have no brothers or sisters to Pair 1, you will need to
purchase or obtain another pair of outcrosses (Pair 2) whose children will be
crossed on Pair 1 and the children of Pair 1.  In 814's pedigree, the two
original pairs were the FINE CAHOES coupled with a daughter of Gaby
Vandenabeele's 1st Provincial Champion, the PICANOL, and the SUPER ACE crossed
on a full sister to the infamous KANNIBAAL, the 1996 1st National Ace Middle
Distance in Belgium.  Is it understandable why I think that 814 will make a
great breeder.  Genotypically, she comes from the very best pigeons of
Antoine Jacops, Gaby Vandenabeele, and Dirk Van Dyke that have been raced and
won in the most elite racing competition in Belgium.  when Antoine
outcrosses his family of pigeons, he only selects the very best pigeons he can
obtain from winning lofts at the time.
I always use a pedigree program to generate hypothetical
couplings.  It is very fast and very simple.  I am able to couple
breeders with a number of mates in only a few moments in order to select the
best breeding pairs during the initial phase of the 2009 breeding season (2
rounds).  After several rounds of youngsters are produced, breeding pairs
are frequently separated and re-coupled.  This occurs especially when I
have selected more than one desirable pairing combination.
If you haven't done so, you still have about two weeks in
November to mate your breeders on paper before December 1.  In the
meantime, select your breeding males and place them in their breeding boxes if
you have not already done so.  New boxes often retard the mating process if
a male has a new box and a new mate.  Once a male has identified his
territory or box and feels very comfortable in it, he will accept a new female much
more readily.  Otherwise, the first set of eggs may not be as synchronized
as possible with other breeders.
SYNCHRONIZE YOUR ROUNDS OF YOUNGSTERS
Especially for racers, loft training or road training a round
of youngsters is much more advantageous if they are very near the same hatching
age.  If all of the breeder pairs lay their eggs from December 10 - 14,
they will all hatch about January 1.  Creating uniform rounds of youngsters
is one of the most critical functions of a great young bird racing season.
I'll discuss that subject next blog.
11.19.08 - Wednesday
UNIFORM ROUNDS OF YOUNGSTERS
Particularly for racing purposes, it is very important to
breed a uniform round of youngsters.  To do this, you must synchronize your
breeders to the exact same breeding schedule or routine.  That is, if a
fancier couples 20 pairs of breeders on December 1, the fancier should take
every precaution so that all 20 pairs lay at the same time and hatch youngsters
at the same time.  when I say at the same time, I mean within a week or so
of each other.  In order to synchronize the breeders to the same breeding
schedule, it is important to manage the following aspects of breeding:
1.  Every breeder should be properly medicated prior to
the onset of the breeding season.
2.  Every breeding male should be in his nest box long
enough to become familiar and comfortable with it and to claim the box as his
territory.  Depending upon the circumstances, it may take a few days to
several weeks to manage this aspect.  If a breeding male is already in his
compartment or nest box, then this aspect is not a problem.
3.  Premating new couples - If two pigeons are going to
be coupled that have never been coupled before, it will help to premate these
pigeons the last two weeks in November.  when I premate new breeders, I
close a female in one side of the nest box and let the male court the female through
the wire door/side of the nest front.  I can place a small water cup on the
front of the locked side of the box so that the female can drink.  I leave the
female in the locked side of the nest box for two to eight hours.  Depending
upon the interaction between the couple, I may repeat this daily routine three
or four times over a two week period prior to December 1.
4.  Premating young females (late 2007 or 2008) or females that
have never been coupled before - young females will often take two or three weeks
longer to lay than older females that have produced youngsters.  In order to
speed up the laying period for young females, it maybe necessary to premate shy,
slow-mating or immature females as many as 6 to 10 times before December 1.
If a young female does not respond well enough to premating, she should probably be
removed in place of another female that is more ready to mate.  It is too
important for the first round to try to force a female to mate that is not ready.
Save her for breeding later in the breeding season.
5.  Premating young males or males that have never been
coupled -  young males are often very aggressive when they are first
coupled.  They will often scalp or injure a female, young or old, very easily.
It is best to thoroughly premate young males such that they will not hurt a female;
but instead will safely drive a female to lay in a week to ten days.  females
that have been hurt by an overly aggressive or abusive young male will often
refuse to mate with that male or take a very long time to do so.  An
unnecessary delay can be detrimental to synchronizing the hatch of a young bird
race team.
6.  Never place a new pair of breeders in a new nest box.
The newness of the pairing is confusing to each bird and the newness of the nest
box is confusing to both birds.  By thoroughly premating new pairs and
thoroughly acclimating them to their nest box, the laying time for new breeders
can be significantly shortened by days or weeks.
7.  Any age breeding male that is not completely and
thoroughly acclimated to his nest box will often inadvertently fly to a wrong
nest box and fight with the pair in the nest box.  The fight will often
damage, or break the eggs, or push the eggs out of the nest bowl to quickly
chill in the cold temperatures in December.  In order to protect the
integrity of all of the eggs in the breeding loft and assure that they will
hatch, males should be familiar enough with their nest box and the flight path
to their nest box that the probability of their inadvertently selecting the
wrong box is very low or nil.
In summary, breeding males should be thoroughly and completely
acclimated to their nest box.  New breeding pairs should be thoroughly
premated. Breeding pairs coupled on December 1 should lay in about 7 to 10 days
and hatch their eggs at the end of the month.  Synchronize the first round
of young birds in order to cut down on losses off the loft or when road training
begins.  The best team of young birds to race in August or September in the
USA is a uniform team (the same approximate age) of youngsters whose incubation
cycle was synchronized such that they are as near the same as possible.
As I have said before, I will couple all of the widowhood
males so that the first round of breeder eggs can be fostered as soon after
laying as possible.  The breeders will lay a second round in about 10 days.
In this way, the number of youngsters produced from the breeders can be doubled
and hatched 10 days apart.  I consider two rounds of youngsters from the
breeders a excellent synchronized and uniform round of 2009 racing prospects.
11.20.08 - Thursday
CHAOS VERSUS ORDER
Modern homing pigeons may be domesticated; but they are still
wild birds from the moment of hatching.  In order to play the racing pigeon
game successfully, wild pigeons must be tamed and trained from the moment they
hatch from their eggs.  First, young birds should be healthy.  Their
parents should be completely medicated and thoroughly healthy prior to breeding
in order to raise healthy youngsters.  Secondly, breeders should be fed
healthy food, i.e., excellent grain with plenty of protein.  Protein
usually comes in the form of peas.  Breeders should have plenty of fresh
grit and pickstone.  They should receive vitamins and minerals.  They
should have plenty of fresh water.  Different fanciers have different
preferences concerning water.  Municipal water is treated for human
consumption and some fanciers believe that it is not good for pigeons.  I
honestly don't know.  But I use the City of Tulsa's water to water the
birds.
Nest boxes should be constructed so that eggs and young
pigeons are covered by a warm parent's body at all times.  It is not
desirable that parents leave the nest frequently during winter breeding.
Eggs and babies will chill very easily if their parents are frightened by any
type of external danger including people.
MODELING BEHAVIOR AND DEVELOPING ATTITUDES
After hatching, youngsters learn from the moment they can hear
and see.  Just as people do, youngsters use their senses to discover the
world.  After their eyes are open, they observe their parents and learn
about their environment through their parents' actions and reactions.  Tame
parents teach youngsters to be tame.  That is, if fear is not present in
breeders, breeders will not teach it to their babies.  It is critically
important that your breeders and racers are as tame and quiet as possible.
A chaotic loft will be passed down from generation to generation.  Wild
parents will teach their youngsters to be wild.  Tame parents will teach
their youngsters to be tame.
Animals and humans learn attitudes and behaviors from their
very first teachers to whom they are exposed - their parents.  If parents
are fed in the nest box, youngsters will see their parents eating and model
their behavior.  The breeders are fed in small bowls in the nest box - one
bowl for food and another for grit.  If youngsters can access a water
source, they will also learn to drink from the time they first learn to walk
around the nest box.  Youngsters can learn to eat by the time they are 21
days old.  If they eat on their own during the 4th week of their life - a
week when they require the most feed prior to weaning - their personal food
intake will significantly reduce the stress of feeding on their parents.
"Creep feeding" (feeding youngsters as babies) is much easier on parents.
when squeakers are weaned from 25 to 30 days of age, they should be eating
completely on their own.  In years past, I have often placed youngsters on
the floor at 25 days to teach them how to drink when they watch the older birds
drink.  They are also exposed to their first bath.  Squeakers love to
bathe and it is very good for them - weather and environmental conditions
permitting.
Whenever the pigeons are fed each day, I "call" them.
Youngsters learn the sound of my voice and what that sound means at a very early
age.  when young birds are weaned, it is possible for them to know how to
eat, drink, bath, and come when called - if they are taught these behaviors.
I feed just-weaned babies on the floor.  Twice a day, I scrape and sweep
the floor to prepare it for feeding the youngsters.  I sit on the floor or
sit on a small plastic pail and hand feed the youngsters.  I talk to them.
I call them.  I gently pour the grain over their heads, necks and backs.
I feed a handful of grain at a time and let them nearly finish that amount
before gently spreading another handful or two on the flock of youngsters.
I believe that their is a critical window of time when pigeons can be more
positively affected and trained than at any other time in their life.  In
humans it is called "early childhood development."  Modern research now
shows us the young children have their personalities formed at a much earlier
age that the literature used to think was possible.  Antisocial
personalities are created during the first year or two of life according to the
latest research.  I believe this is true in people and in birds and
animals.
Homing pigeons are wild creatures with innate tendencies to
flee anything that doesn't look, smell, and sound just like them.  That
innate wildness is a characteristic of survival and necessary for their species
to survive in the wild.  As fanciers and pigeon fanciers, we must
neutralize the innate tendency to flee by building trust in all of our pigeons.
Homers that trust their fanciers are entirely different creatures than a flock
of wild young birds in a large room flying all over the room at the slightest
interruption.  I have seen fanciers call their pigeons out of the sky, tap
on a hand crate, and load their pigeons without touching them in only a moment.
Pigeons are incredibly smart and innovative birds.  If they are not taught
the right way to do something, they will learn the wrong way.  Great
fanciers teach their young birds at the very earliest age possible how to act as
a classic racing homers.  Michel Van Lint, arguably one of Belgium's
greatest fanciers over the past ten years or so, hand feeds his youngsters from
the time they are about a week old.  His wife and daughter help him.
He feeds them twice a day at a minimum.  There is a bonding process that
can occur between young birds and fanciers at a very early age if fanciers will
take the time to develop the bond.  From this bond comes trust.  Trust
is a condition that allows the greatest training.  Great training usually
converts into head prizes on the race sheet.
If you don't have the time to bond with 100 young birds, breed
20 and bond with them.  If you don't have the time to bond with 20 young
birds, breed 5 and bond with them.  As I have said so many times: "it is
often more satisfying to race a few pigeons very well than a flock of pigeons
poorly."
Wild pigeons must be taught to be tame pigeons.  Order
must be created out of chaos.  A condition of trust must be learned out of
fear.  The pigeon loft must reflect the calmness of an orderly system
rather than the chaos of randomness.  Tame and trained pigeons are a
tremendous joy.  Wild pigeons are a great deal of effort.  The former
can generate great satisfaction while the latter can generate great frustration.
May I suggest that if it is appropriate in your situation,
dedicate yourself to a new spirit of excellence for the 2009 young bird season which begins on
December 1, 2008.  Clean your loft and prepare it for
the upcoming breeding season.  Couple your breeders thoughtfully and
intelligently - genotypically and pfemaleotypically (pedigree and conformation).  Manage your breeders effectively.  Create order out of
chaos.  With these suggestions as a foundation, I urge every reader to
start the 2009 young bird race season by hatching the best round
of future champions as possible on January 1, 2009.
11.21.08 - Friday
In 2008, Antoine Jacops
competed in the pigeon races in the Hafo Turnhout RPC in the Antwerp Union
amassing the following superb results:
1st    CHAMPION   YEARLINGS 2008
2th   ACE-PIGEON YEARLINGS 2008 with the B-08-6042082    pedigree

10th ACE-PIGEON YEARLINGS 2008 with the B-08-6042011    pedigree
click here
There are full brothers and sisters to the parents of these
Ace pigeons breeding in Tulsa, Oklahoma; including in several cases, the
nestmates to Antoine's breeders.  One of his best breeders in the last few
years is the Miniem: 2nd Ace Pigeon Antwerp Union 2002 Yearlings and 15th Ace
Pigeon B. D. S. (Belgian De Duivin Sport) Belgium 2002 (The 2002 Miniem is the
2nd pigeon Antoine has named the Miniem - Antoine had another outstanding
distance Ace pigeon he called the Miniem years ago.  The reason this
information is relevant for me is that I also have outstanding pigeons bred down
from the original Miniem).  The nest brother to the 2002 Miniem is breeding
in Tulsa in addition to three other full brothers.  Sadly, in a few weeks,
the Miniem will be breeding in someone else's loft as Antoine is selling almost
all of his pigeons in December.  The December 13 and 20 sales will mark the
end of a golden era of over 40 years of incredible racing in the Antwerp Union
in Belgium.
Even with his illness, Antoine's superb pigeons managed to
win 1st Champion Yearlings in a large prestigious middle-distance club in the
Antwerp Union in 2008.  For those of you who may not remember, Antoine has
been suffering from
Meniere's Disease
for a number of years.  This disease is a disease of
the inner ear in which the inner ear is constantly telling the brain that
Antoine is out of balance.  Consequently, Antoine's pupils constantly
dilate and constrict trying to find the right balance.  The net effect is
that Antoine is constantly dizzy, out of breath, sick to his stomach, and tired
- all symptoms of
Vertigo .  Often, Antoine can only care for the birds for a one-hour
time period or less; and sometimes not at all - prompting Maria to care for
them.  In addition, Antoine can no longer drive or ride in the car so Maria
must also enter the birds in all of the races at the club.  Maria's health
has not been so good also; so taking the birds to the club has been a major
effort for her.  Consequently, Antoine has decided to sell most of his
pigeons and only keep a few 2008 youngsters to race for fun.
This change in history is very sad for me because the primary
source of my pigeons for over 20 years - the Golden Well - is ceasing.  In
spite of that fact, Antoine and Maria will always remain like a brother and
sister to me and Morgan and I will continue to visit them in Belgium.  I
suspect that Antoine will counsel me anytime I need additional Belgian breeders
on where to find the best pigeons.  He is one of the most respected
fanciers in Belgium and knows where to find the best outcrosses to bring into
his family of pigeons.
I have traveled all over Belgium for almost 25 years.  I
have never found a family of pigeons that race any distance under any
circumstances like the pigeons of Antoine Jacops.  You may ask yourself,
well if this is the truth then why aren't his pigeons more popular in the USA?
The answer to this great question is very simple and is tied up in the character
of the man himself - Antoine Jacops.  You see, Antoine is really very much
like an American.  He is an innovator, he is "old fashioned," and he has
never ever let the pigeon merchants dictate the way he plays the racing pigeon
game.  If you lived in parts of Asia, you would know that Antoine's pigeons
are enormously famous.  Why?  Because the Asians gamble thousands of
dollars on the sport and Antoine's pigeons win!
As I have said before, the man that introduced Antoine to me
on a trip to Belgium in 1986 is Mike Ganus.  Because of Mike's character,
Antoine allowed Mike to purchase youngsters to re-sell in the US.  Antoine
has refused to allow most of the well known pigeon merchants to sell his
pigeons.  Why?  Primarily because Antoine always sells every pigeon
that he offers for sale by himself - he doesn't need a pigeon merchant, or their
publicity, to sell pigeons.  Antoine does well on his own because of the
high quality of his pigeons and his honest straight forward character.
Since Mike changed his marketing strategy and quit selling imported young birds
in the US in favor of purchasing Ace pigeons and selling their youngsters,
I have imported Antoine's pigeons myself.  Antoine and Maria are very
old-fashioned in their beliefs.  No hustlers or merchants trying to make a
quick buck or euro at their expense need enter their driveway and ring their
doorbell.  Although the Jacops are extremely courteous to everyone, the
answer to merchants has always been no.  In 2005, when Antoine won 1st
National Souillac, the feather merchants called him daily wanting to buy the
winner.  Antoine's answer was always no.  After years of trying and
coming extremely close, the Jacops finally won a 1st National, and the winning
pigeon was worth more in their loft than in someone else's loft.  Just the
thrill of seeing him in the loft everyday has been priceless for the Jacops.
The tremendous relationship I have enjoyed with the Jacops
family would not have been possible without my dear friend, Mike Ganus.
Mike and Antoine have altered and changed my life in the most fundamental ways
and have made my life much richer than any other course my life could have
taken.  I love homing pigeons.  In addition to my family and my God,
homing pigeons have done something for me that nothing else I have experienced
in the world has managed to accomplish.  Homing pigeons have given me a
reason to get up in the morning and try to accomplish something with one hand
and arm paralyzed and the other hand twisted and weak from several other
injuries.  What the calf-roping accident took away from me at the ripe old
age of 16, pigeons have given back a thousand-fold.  After the accident,
when I wouldn't get out of bed for me, I got out of bed for the pigeons.
In my life, I have literally risen up on their wings when my mind or my body
didn't want to.  My loft is like a sanctuary to me.  I love to be
there.  The sounds coming from the lofts are like water - bathing me -
nourishing me - encouraging me to compete in life with the same intensity that I
ask the pigeons to exhibit during their races.
If I never entered another pigeon race - if I never sold
another pigeon - if I never spoke to another fancier - if I never made another
trip to Belgium - I would keep homing pigeons as a hobby.  They simply
bring me too much joy to ever stop.

DIAMONDS OF THE 2008 YOUNG BIRD RACES
The 2008 young bird team amassed a tremendous race record
winning 1st Average Speed in the West Tulsa RPC B (Unlimited) Race Series.
Five of the top nine Ace Pigeons were raced under the Lamberton Cuypers banner while a
sixth Lamberton pigeon in the top nine was raced by TNT TITANS: Tony Smith and Josh
Cooley.  Below are pictures of the top two Ace pigeons.
TWO OF THE DIAMOND FEMALES ON THE 2008 RACE TEAM
LADY GODIVA - 1st Ace Pigeon
EMILY - 2nd Ace Pigeon
The development of Ace pigeons is one of the great joys I
experience in the racing pigeon game.  For me, the game is about the
pigeons and not about me.  I don't fly races; the pigeons do.  My job
is to put all of the racers in the best possible position to accomplish the
goals I set for them.  The reason these images or pictures are important
for me is that they are the images I envision when I begin the breeding season
in October of each year.  The images are visual representations of a
hypothetical goal each fall.  I am a visual learner and planner.  I
perform much better if I can visualize my goals.  The above picture of the
two females is my personal visual goal for 2009.  The picture depicts the fact
that that Ace pigeons start their development process inside their eggs rather
when they hatch.  Eggs are the first lofts that house future champions and
Ace pigeons.  The creation of quality eggs is a direct result of the
quality of the decisions made during the next two weeks.
As I have said, each breeding season does not begin for me on
January 1.  It starts in October.  In October, I begin thoroughly
medicating the breeders and selecting breeding couples "on paper" (That's an old
expression since data is now generated and stored on a computer.)  December
1, the breeding couples are actually paired.  In Belgium, January 1 is the
target date for the 2009 youngsters to hatch.  I begin the process of
creating "diamonds" each fall as the loft is prepared for breeding.
IT'S TIME TO SIMULATE SPRINGTIME LIGHTENING
Since next week is December 1, depending upon your location,
it is now time to turn on the lights in the breeding loft for 16 or 17 hours per
day to simulate spring time in the winter breeding months.  Extended light
stimulates the pituitary gland that influences the passion to breed.  With
show horses, we extend the lights in the barn during winter so that the show
horses will continue to shed their hair and look smooth and sleek like they
naturally do in the spring and summer.  The pituitary gland is sensitive to
the amount of light to which it is exposed.  Extended light, i.e., 17 hours
of light per day, automatically produces mating behavior in pigeons, and other
animals for that matter.  We put mares under lights in order to breed them
in February to produce a January 1st foal.  Like pigeons, large, more fully
developed weanlings are often judged better in fall confirmation futurities.
These futurities award sizable purses to the winners and the top ten award
winners.  Breeding early foals correlates into a higher probability of
winning money in the fall.  Early pigeons often race better in fall races
because of their physical development and sexual maturity.
VERY IMPORTANT:   Do not let the extended
artificial light effect the race birds
at all .
Race birds should always experience the normal light of your area.
Otherwise, extended artificial light will adversely affect their moult next
spring.  Contain the sphere of artificial light to the breeding area
only .
WARNING:   Normally, males become very
aggressive during the initial mating stage of breeding.  Coupling
stimulates aggression.  It's normal.  It's natural.  It's innate.
However, males often turn their aggression on the other males in the loft.
This is the reason that a male may force his way into a strange nest box and
fight the breeders in the strange box.  Overly aggressive males may destroy
nests and eggs; and kill or scalp youngsters.  Aggressive males may start
fighting on the floor or in the aviary.  It's a part of the process.
This is why it is best to couple valuable breeders in small solitary lofts or
large nest boxes where they can be isolated from other breeders.  May I
suggest that you keep a close eye on your breeders during the mating process and
try to control unwanted or undesirable behavior among overly aggressive males.
MORE INFO ON PRE-MATING
December 1 is one week away.  As a precaution, I premated
the breeders today.  Fortunately, today was a very sunny day so I could
evaluate what up to now are theoretical matings in my hands and with the eye
loop.  While most of the breeders readily accepted their mates, I
specifically looked for those breeders, if any, that sulked or did not readily
couple.  The SHADOW, an outstanding son of the PHANTOM, sulked when his new
female was introduced.  He misses his former mate.  Consequently, I will
continue to pre-mate him to his new female.  Ultimately, I may need to switch
females.  I don't know.  I will need to pay special attention to the
SHADOW during the coupling stage next week so that his female lays her eggs at the
same time as most of the females in the loft.
Frequently, couples that look good on paper are less desirable
when actually paired.  There is normally a period of adjustment this time
of year when hypothetical couples are re-paired due to the fact that I just
didn't like the couple together when I actually paired them.  Or, sometimes
I re-pair a couple because I find a mate or mates that I like much better than
the mate I selected on paper.  Rarely do I end up coupling the exact same
pairs that I selected on paper.  The paper matings generally provide a well
thought-out
guide
to mating that
can be changed or manipulated when the couples are actually paired.  This
time of year I often spend as much as 18 hours per day coupling the breeders in
the hand and on paper.  The decisions I make today will usually last a
year.  I take these pairing decisions very seriously and work very hard the
last week of November and the first week in December to "get it right."  I
am constantly comparing pedigrees to confirmation in the hand and in the eye.
Genotype to Pfemaleotype.  Usually, I discover new matings that I didn't
consider earlier in the year.  The next two weeks are as time-consuming as
any other period of time during the year.  While it is exciting and fun, it
is also physically and mentally exhausting.  Of course it makes a
difference whether a fancier is mating six pairs of breeders or sixty-six pairs
of breeders.
11.25.08 - Tuesday
I have received a number of interesting emails the past few
days.  The following email is from a fancier talking about a smash training
toss:
I have kept pigeons all my life.  I only started racing
in 2008.  I finished with the following results in my club: 2X's 2nd, 6th,
8th, 9th, 10th,11th,12th,2X's 16th, 28th, 29t.  These results were
accomplished with only 12 birds on my young bird team. This was not my choice,
but due to a smash training flight, only 3 weeks before the first race.
Even though I had 12 young birds on my team, these results are from my best 4
birds. I had planned to race all of my 30 ybs the first couple of races. I guess
you could say that smash training flight not only picked the numbers of birds,
but also picked which one's would remain on the team.  I have spent every spare
moment I had the last 3 years, talking to and listen to, and reading everything
I can get a hold of.  Although I'm very pleased with my results for my
first year, I have also realize some mistakes that I've made and learned from
them.
I first saw your videos on My Tube, then I went to your site.
I must say that I am very impressed, with all that I have seen. I most like that
your blogs are more in the format of a daily journal. I have never gotten so
much from someone in such a short time, as I have from you in the last week. I
plan to continue to read on. I flew to the perch this year, and my birds was not
breed early enough to have reach sexual maturity , and to fly on the widowhood.
But it makes a lot of sense to do so. I am afraid that time and money will not
allow me to be set up in time, for me to implement this program this year. But I
have included this in my plans for 2010. So I  will continue to read on and I
hope that you don't mind if I pick your brain from time to time. Just wanted to
say Thank You!
This email gives me the chance to talk again about the number
of quality young bird racers that will be produced in 2009.  Smash training
tosses are a "natural" way of selecting the best young birds for the young bird
race team.  What I mean by natural is that smash training tosses allow the
birds to select themselves for the team rather than the fancier.  Most
fanciers prefer to let the basket determine which young birds stay on the team
and which young birds are eliminated from the team.  I have advocated a
method during training during which both the fancier and the basket determines
team membership.  As I have also stated before, the Lamberton 10% Rule
states that about 10% of the young birds raised for the race season will make up
the pool of quality racers for that year.  The email's author reveals that
he began with 30 young birds.  After the smash training toss the team was
reduced to twelve young birds.  He reports the results for the top four
young birds.  10% of 30 is 3.  The author reported the results of the
best 4.  This email confirms the fact that only a very few young birds
contribute to the top prizes won by the overall young bird team.  If we
only knew ahead of time which 10% were the best young birds for racing, racing
young birds would be much easier and cheaper.
The term "smash training toss" is commonly and widely used by
the fancy as a whole.  However, because of the Lamberton 10% Rule (as it is
referred to by my friends), the phrase "smash" training toss is actually a
misnomer.  Actually, we should
expect
to lose 90% of the young birds we raise each year lofting, training and racing
young birds; or, we should expect that only 10% of the young birds will perform
at the top of the race sheet.  Fanciers have said to me that they only lost
a few pigeons out of 50 or 75 young birds on the race team.  While at first
blush this seems to be a good situation, when I ask them to identify only those
young birds that won the best head prizes during the race season, the number is
usually less than 10% of the number of young birds raised.  If a fancier
starts with 75 young birds and only loses 6, leaving 69 young birds at the end
of the race season, the 10% Rule would predict that 7 of the 69 pigeons would
contribute the best results during the young bird race season.  More times
than not, only about 7 young birds will actually win the top head prizes.
For me, the task is never one in which I attempt to keep every
young bird that I raise.  The question that I try to answer each year is
which few youngsters are the very best and which youngsters will win head prizes
or prizes at the top of the race sheet each week.  In 2008 young birds, the
1st Ace female, 44435, won a first prize, a second prize, and two third prizes.
Out of the 8 young bird B series races that the team flew in 2008, one pigeon
(44435) was the best bird on the race team for 4 out of 8 races.  This one
pigeon was the best racer for half of the race series (50% of the time)!
If two females of 44435's caliber and quality were raced in the young bird race
series, the two-bird race team still could have won 1st Average Speed in the B
Race Series.  So the task for me now is to raise or create as many healthy
young birds as possible in January and February of 2009.  then between
February when they are weaned and September when they are raced, the task is to
eliminate 90% of the young birds that I just spent so much time and effort
raising in order to identify the top 10% to race on widowhood in the young bird
race series.
I am never disappointed by a smash training toss unless I lose
every single pigeon; and fortunately that has never happened.  I sometimes
comfort fellow fancier friends who are waiting and anguishing for the birds to
come home during a smash toss quit anguishing as soon as the first bird returns.
Why?  Because if one young bird returns, they all could have returned.
While I am waiting for hours during a smash toss, I want to see just one pigeon
return.  After one pigeon returns, I am off the hook or no longer
responsible for the outcome of the smash toss.  If one pigeon returns, they
all could have returned.  The first pigeon home is the first contribution
to the 10% pool of excellent young birds.
During the 2008 young bird training regiment,  163 or
44435 were always the first young birds back from a hard training tosses.
Their performances placed them at the top of the 10% pool.  2483, the 2nd
Ace Pigeon, was never far behind.  The results of strenuous training tosses
clearly demonstrated to me which birds were the best young birds.  Their
performances screamed at me "we are the best.  Choose us!  Take super
care of us by giving us the most room, good mates, quality food, a clean loft,
and fresh clean water.  Don't choose those other inferior birds or average
pigeons just because they returned, sometimes hours late on the day, or a day or
two later.  Choose us.  Pamper us.  Devote the entire young bird
loft and all of your energies just to us.  We will race the fastest for you
all by ourselves."  I listened and they delivered.
I am always more thrilled about which young birds arrive first
from a training toss than how many young birds returned as a whole.  As
long as one bird returns, I could care less how many return.  I believe
that the number of young birds on a race team or that survived the race series
is only a "psychological comfort" for fanciers and usually have little to do
with the overall performances at the top of the race sheet.  when fanciers
tell me that they are beginning the race season with 50 to 100 young birds, I
feel like those numbers actually place those fanciers at a distinct
disadvantage.  Unless fancier are retired, in good health, have few
financial concerns, and want to spend the majority of their time training and
racing pigeons, racing 50 to 100 pigeons well is very hard to accomplish.
It is better to race a few pigeons very well than many pigeons poorly.
Although I am preparing on December 1 to raise a great number
of pigeons, my goal in 2009, as it is every year, will be to identify only those
very few that will race home the very fastest.  Breeding young birds is
usually a great deal of work for a very small result.  But the small
result, an Ace champion, is more than worth the effort for me.  The great
Gerald Koopman states that fanciers are very lucky if they find a champion
pigeon in every 200 young birds raised each year.  While Koopman's
definition of champion is probably much different than many American fanciers,
that's the reason I buy breeding stock in Belgium and Holland.  The game
and fanciers' expectations are much more stringent there than in many other
countries.  While I don't mean to denigrate our racing system in America or
insult American fanciers in the slightest, the overall game is more difficult in
Belgium and Holland than it is played in other countries.
I believe that as long as one bird returns, smash training
tosses are good, healthy, and necessary in order to identify the very best young
birds each year.  For me, the game is not about how many pigeons are kept,
saved, or how many return.  The game is about how many young birds return
quickly .  The game is about
speed
rather than general homing
ability.  The game is about how many pigeons we eliminate during the
training phase in order to race a very few high quality potential champions
during the young bird race series.  Each year, only a very few young birds
will rise to an elite level - if any of them rise to that level at all.
Next week the breeding season begins in Belgium, in Holland, in Europe, and at
the Lamberton loft in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  All of the fanciers in these places
will raise as many young birds as possible in order to discover one champion
racer.  A daunting task?  Yes.  But the pot at the end of the
Rainbow has always been a fascinating mystery and a thrilling quest for those
who desire its riches!
11.26.08 - Wednesday
I recently received this email on the Dr. John Lamberton
YouTube page:
Dear Dr Lamberton, First of all would like to congratulate you
on your site as it is very informative and interesting.  I would like to
ask you where you keep the females or males when you remove them from their
partners? Do you keep them in a separate compartment of the whole week and then
you put them back with their mates on the race day only?  Sorry but I just
managed to get a few pigeons which I am using for stock and liked a lot the
widowhood method which I would like to try. As you can see I am a beginner.
Thanks and well done again.
WIDOWHOOD MATES
To answer this new fancier's question, widowhood mates are
removed from the sections of the loft containing the race team to another
section of the loft from Saturday evening after the race to the next Friday
afternoon when they are "shown" to the race team.  It is best to hold
widowhood mates in a room or loft section at the end or on the side of the
widowhood loft sections.  Suggestion:  Construct your loft such that
all you need to do to let the mates into the loft is open a door.  The door
can be a big walk through door or it can be a small door only for pigeons.
Under no circumstances is it practical to hand carry each mate to the racing
loft or even crate the mates to place them in the racing loft.  Whatever
type of loft set-up you use, construct it such that the mates can enter the
racing loft and exit the racing loft with the very least amount of work and
effort on your part as possible.  I open a walk-through door and let the
mates stream into the racing loft.  Pigeons are very smart.  They know
when you open the door and stand away from it that it is time to see their
mates.  They will literally knock you down racing from their loft into the
next loft to see their mates.
I have found that young birds need to see their mates more
often than old birds.  Old birds can generally go one week without seeing
their mates and not lose interest or sulk too much.  Young birds are not as
mentally mature as old birds.  I sometimes show the young bird's mates to
them after a mid-week training toss on Wednesday for races on Saturday.  Young males seem to need to see their
mates more than young females.  Possibly because of their immaturity or
possibly because of their aggression, young males like to see their females for a
few minutes up to an
hour or so after a mid-week toss.  I never let the pigeons together during
a mid-week rendezvous; but lock a mate in one side of the nest box for about
thirty minutes to an
hour.  They can see each other but the males cannot tread the females.
This year racing females and one male, there were no mid-week tosses or mates shown on Wednesdays.
That may have been a mistake.  I don't know.
WHEN SHOULD THE RACE TEAM BE COUPLED?
I received an email from a fancier who wants to pair his
breeders on December 1 and wonders when he should pair his race team in order to
breed a uniform round of young birds.  My answer is as follows: Go ahead
and couple your race birds with your breeders on December 1.  However,
there are two problems that should be considered.  First, if the race team
is placed under lights, they will probably moult earlier than normal next
summer.  If they are raced in April and May, there will be no problem with
the moult beginning too early.  If they are raced later, they may start
moulting during the summer.  I usually prefer to let them raise their
youngsters with normal light.  This can be accomplished in Oklahoma.
It may be different in other parts of the US or another country.  Secondly,
if the race team lays a second round of eggs, they will begin the wing moult.
I often separate the females from the widowhood males before then female lays a second
time when the youngsters are about 10 days old and let the females finish raising
the youngsters.  Since I "creep" feed the youngsters in the nest using a
small clay pot, a single parent can still raise very healthy youngsters.
Because the races in Oklahoma begin the first week in April
and generally end the first week in June, the moult is not often the problem
that it might be in geographic locations where old birds are raced on different
schedules.  If the race team is placed under lights and if their females lay a
second round of eggs, the danger of the wing moult beginning is not too large in
Oklahoma.  But the danger might greater be in other places.  Generally
in Belgium, race teams are coupled on December 1 at the same time as the
breeders; but not allowed to lay a second round of eggs so that the wing moult
will not begin.  Later in the spring, the race team is re-coupled a few
weeks before the race season begins and the eggs are removed after ten days.
As an example, if the races begin in Oklahoma on Saturday, April 5, the race
team would need to be re-coupled about March 8.  If re-coupled on March 8,
the race team will have eggs in 7 to 10 days or March 15 to 18.  On March
25 to 28 the eggs are removed and the males begin widowhood.  The widowhood
males and females are re-coupled in order for them to begin the race season on a
schedule of celibacy during the week and coupling every weekend on race day.
Extended winter lights particularly help younger pigeons
couple.  Again, in Oklahoma, on December 1, the older males on the race
team have little problem coupling if they like their female.  The weather is
usually fairly mild.  Sometimes younger racers are slow to respond without
lights.  Also, extended lights provide breeders with longer hours to feed
youngsters.  But longer hours are not required if breeders and youngsters
are fed in a pot or in a hopper "buffet" style or continuously.  If
youngsters are fed and/or watered in the nest box continuously from the time
they are a week or so old, they do not require the lighting schedule that other
feeding methods may require.  Lights can help fanciers with work schedules
or family obligations who feed in the evening or dark by necessity.
Experiment with your pigeons in your geographic region with your personal work
and family schedule.  You may not need to use extended lighting.  Or,
extended lights may be perfect in your situation.  Your breeding methods
should be based on trial and error and experimentation.  You may discover a
better method than I am describing.  Don't be afraid to take
reasonable
chances.
I know of fanciers who place their youngsters on the floor at
about there weeks of age.  The area on the floor is called a "nursery."
Noisy youngsters will often force non-parental pigeons that are feeding other
youngsters into feeding them.  Also, youngsters on the floor watch the old
birds eat and drink if they are fed and watered on the floor.  I have tried
this method of feeding youngsters in the past and it works very well.  If
you cannot feed in the nest box, may I suggest that you create a nursery on the
floor and place your youngsters there at about three weeks.  As soon as
young birds first begin to walk, they can find their way to food and water.
The physical strain of raising youngsters is greatly lessened on parents whose
youngsters are placed in a nursery.  Further, if you spend time in the loft
in the evening after work, teach the young birds into eating from your hand or
to eat sitting in your lap.  You will raise much tamer pigeons that may
race harder because of this special relationship that they have developed at a
very early age with you.
In conclusion, to be on the safe side, if you couple your
racers next week or during the winter, try to let them raise their youngsters
under normal lighting and don't allow them to raise more than one round of youngsters.
when the youngsters are about 10 days old, separate the mates of the race team
and let the mates care for the youngsters.  See to it that the youngsters
eat well by creep feeding them by themselves or feed them on the floor as part
of a nursery.
11.28.08 - Friday
Referring back to Wednesday discussion of winter-breeding the
race team, it is most desirable for the racers to fly the longer races with a
wing full of flight feathers.  If the wing moult begins early due to
winter-breeding, the wing may not be as full as it should be for extended flight or the racers may be moulting a
longer flight in May or June when the longer races are flown.   That
is why it is best for the old birds to start moulting their flight feathers in
the spring rather than during the winter.
I have watched next week's weather forecast.  Tuesday,
December 2 and Wednesday December 3 are forecasted to be sunny and warm.
The temperature on Tuesday is forecasted at 65 degrees Fahrenheit in Tulsa,
Oklahoma.  Tuesday looks like a perfect day to couple the breeders and the
race team.  If the breeders are not fully coupled by Tuesday evening, I can
still finish on Wednesday - another nice day.  If the weather is too poor
in your area to couple your pigeons on December 1 or next week, wait until the
weather is better.  If that's not a possibility, couple them anyway.
It is not necessary to hatch youngsters exactly on January 1.  In fact,
youngsters hatched in February and March can still race on widowhood.  In
addition to racing older youngsters, a primary reason for breeding early
youngsters is the ease of training a uniform group of young birds.
I just received Antoine Jacops' Sale Catalogue.  The
following page is the Sale Cover.
On the Cover, Antoine features the 1st National Souillac 2005
winner and the 4th Ace in the Antwerp Union 2004.  As it turns out, in
addition to being a great racer, the 4th Ace pigeon, the "076," has been an
excellent breeder.  As it also turns out, a full sister to "076", the "190"
female, is breeding in Tulsa.  This outstanding female just happens to be the
maternal grandmother to
AU 08 ARPU 44435 , the 1st Ace
Young Bird in the Club.  As it seems, the "076" and the "190" are both
excellent breeders on two continents.   GUSTAAF, a foundation breeder
for Gustaaf and Jef Cuypers (my partner in Belgium) was paired with the "190"
female to produce the mother of 44435, AU 06 LAMBERTON 59.  59 was so
spectacular that she was removed from the 2006 young bird race team during
summer training and entered the breeding loft as a future breeder.  44435
is bred from (1) a full brother to the NUDIST, (2) GUSTAAF, a foundation male
for the Cuyper's, and (3) the "190" female that is a full sister to Antoine's
"076."  With this pedigree, 44435 was destined to be a champion racer.
Although I have heard fanciers say that they cannot tell a potential young bird
Ace just by looking at the pigeon, if you had seen 44435 in the summer, it would
have been relatively easy to tell her excellent quality.  Good young birds
show their quality by their posture and poise, their temperament, their eye
clarity, their response time, the way they take off and land, the way they fly,
their feathering, their wattle whiteness, and their reaction and relationship to
their fanciers.  Both 44435 and her mother stuck out like sore thumbs as
six month old young birds.  Their quality was easy to spot.  Both
"076" and "190" are high quality pigeons bred down from high quality pigeons.
Their progeny are winning in the Antwerp Union Belgium and in Tulsa, Oklahoma
USA.
The Cover of Antoine's Sale Catalogue also pictures three
reference pigeons: the SUPER ACE, the KANNIBAAL, and the PICANOL.  These
are additional reasons why Antoine's pigeons have so much quality.  The
SUPER ACE represents Antoine's old family of pigeons while the KANNIBAAL and the
PICANOL represent out-crosses.  The KANNIBAAL was the 1996 1st National Ace
pigeon Middle Distance in Belgium.  The PICANOL was a 1st Provincial Ace
for Gaby Vandenabeele in 1983.  Antoine has also out-crossed other high
quality pigeons into his old family: pigeons from the Janssen Brothers, the Van
Laer Brothers, Flor Engels, and a sister to a 1st National Ace for Tom & Karel
Hufkens.  The extreme high quality of Antoine's out-crosses have infused
his old family with hybrid vigor.  The high quality of the old family has
kept his strain prepotent.  Some families of pigeons become so inbred that
they lose their hybrid vigor, and although they still may breed very well, they
no longer race well.  Conversely, some families of pigeons are so
out-crossed that they may race very well, but they do not breed particularly
well, i.e., many young birds are bred in order to breed one good one.
There is a very delicate balance between prepotency and hybrid vigor that I have
discussed in the past.  Antoine believes that the ratio is 70/30, i.e., 70%
prepotency and 30% hybrid vigor or 70% line-breeding and 30% out-crossing.
The "076" and the "190" female are not excellent breeders by
accident.  Antoine did not just throw a dart at a board.  They are the
result of careful thought, planning, breeding and selection.  Next week is
the beginning of the breeding season in many parts of the pigeon world.
The results of a planning process over the past few months, a planning process
tested by the rigors of the young bird race series, will be put into action.
Breeding excellent racing pigeons does involve a certain degree of luck, but it
also involves hours and hours of thoughtful consideration and planning.
