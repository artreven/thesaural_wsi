sleeping snowy owl
Hey, that's a nice looking owl! It's pretty calm right now, but by the looks of those talons, it's capable of delivering several angry inches of pain if it gets a mind to.

References
The fact that this hatchling is acquired through the zapping of a yo-yo is a reference to the
Vertigo
comics title
The Books of Magic , created by
Neil Gaiman . The protagonist, Tim Hunter, learns that magic is real when
Doctor Occult
turns his yo-yo into an owl, aptly named Yo-Yo (not a snowy owl, though).
In the
Harry Potter books , Harry has a snowy Owl called
Hedwig , who happens to be sleeping a lot.
"Punk with a scar" refers to Harry, who has a scar on his forehead.
The line "you were here first" is a reference to the fact that Tim Hunter (who has a number of coincidental similarities to Harry Potter) is sometimes accused of being a Harry Potter ripoff, but was in fact created well before Harry Potter was.
"Several angry inches" indirectly refers to Harry's owl by way of the movie title
Hedwig and the Angry Inch .
The hidden "O RLY?" refers to the infamous
internet meme .
