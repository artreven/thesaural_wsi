DC vs Marvel Marvel Comics, What Happened?
I'M BACK! and to revamp my blog i decided to bore you all with a big rant about comics. har har!
so you're probably wondering what this post is about - well lately I've really been ranting to my brothers and friends about DC vs Marvel, about their pro's and con's of being comic companies.
I ask the question "Marvel Comics, what happened?" because as this post goes on you'll hear my opinions on what they have done to their 'universe' as opposed to DC comics.
To start off for those who are unfamiliar with comics in general, for DC and Marvel each company has a set world, universe, storyline, whatever you want to call it. The set one is the main universe where comic companies run their regular storyline and usually all of their major comic events each year.
As I've read Marvel and DC comics, I've seen lots of change come to each universe, some that is good some that makes you say "really?....". so I'm going to cover a couple of events that have happened which have (in my opinion) either broken or boosted the comics.
Marvel
As you'll see in the world today, Marvel is a very public and well known comic company especially with trademark characters like Spiderman, Wolverine and The Hulk. Now we have the Avengers to thank for an outstanding introduction into more of the marvel universe. Now even though The marvel Cinematic universe (as its been named) is thriving with great interpretations of favourite heroes and amazing story lines with twist and thrills; i can't help but notice that Marvel's comics have taken a bit of a beating and have the become the abandoned child of their franchise. It feels like they aren't trying as hard on their comics as they were and that the only way to keep selling is with shock value. here are a couple of events that i wanted to cover -
Civil War I still have to get this for my comic library but this comic event for me was so amazing but at the same time ruined the marvel universe. Civil War is about the battle between what's right and what's fair. The American Government have partnered with Tony Stark/Iron Man to pass the 'Superhuman registration act' which makes it mandatory for all super heroes and villains to register their secret identity with the government and receive special training to work with the government. while Stark thinks this is a great idea, Captain America/Steve Rogers is surprisingly the one who opposes the government he stands for, saying that it is unfair to force them to reveal identities. A series of events unfold and it climaxes to the point where Captain America dies.
First off - how Captain America dies is pretty pathetic, he gets shot. i know he's handcuffed and what not but he's fought off countless aliens and armies with his hands behind his back. Another thing was after the events of Civil War, spiderman's universe got flipped around by some magical man, and SHIELD kind of became a dictatorship to superheroes. it was an amazing storyline and the events that happened during the story were great, they were enjoyable but it left the marvel universe in ruins and i felt like Marvel didn't do a good job in picking up the pieces.
Ultimatum﻿
Ultimatum was set in Marvel's "Ultimate" universe and was a big event before marvel rebooted Ultimate Spiderman, Ultimate Iron Man etc into 'Ultimate Comics: Spiderman' 'Ultimate Comics: Iron Man'. Also you should know the Avengers are called "The Ultimates" in this universe.
The Story of Ultimatum was that Magneto was steaming angry with the death of his daughter The Scarlet Witch, so in his anger he flipped the magnetic poles of the earth causing a tidal wave to drown New York City and other anomalies to happen over the globe. with what few superheroes are left, they band together to find magneto and bring him to justice for what he has done.
This event was like Civil War in that it was an amazing story to read and i enjoyed it but at the end it was in ruins, they were lazy in picking up the pieces and even though it was shocking and exciting, they killed off too many characters and unlike DC comics, Marvel can't bring their heroes back to life with style. First of here is a "small" list of people that died - Yellowjacket/Antman, Dr Strange, The Blob, Magneto, Wolverine, Dr Doom, Daredevil, Professor X, Nightcrawler, Cyclops, Beast and Archangel. Then apart from that list we see heroes who seem to go MIA - Thor, Spiderman, Dr strange (even though he dies, someone comes out a light and gets him..dunno). after being left in confusion, i read that marvel released what they called "Requiem" a series of comics covering only spiderman, xmen and fantastic four after the events of Ultimatum. Then in the new "Ultimate Comics:......."  the events of Ultimatum are only mentioned like twice and nothing more is explained. That really annoyed me.....
Other things with Marvel comics is that in the Ultimate Comics: Spiderman, Peter Parker is dead and its now a black Mexican kid filling the role as spiderman in a black and red suit. In my opinion Peter Parker should always be spiderman and if you want to bring in another spiderman, make a storyline like Spiderman 2099 or just create another alternate universe but in the main and ultimate universe's leave it as Peter Parker. Also we see that marvel has used its Shock horror factor and announced the first Homosexual wedding in a comic - this annoys me because i don't care, i really don't care about a fictional characters sexual preference, when i read comics i want action, explosions, twists in a story, but i don't want stupid relationships, even between men and women its boring. This is an event where you can see marvel is running out of idea's and Aren't trying to keep their original characters exciting.
As i look back at what I've just written you probably think I'm a homophobic racist but I'm not, i just don't care for my comics to be Politically correct, let alone even include things about what is happening in the world, i want to read fiction, and that means i don't want current world issues, i read comics to escape the issues of the world, doesn't everyone? So overall breathtaking job on your movies and TV shows Marvel but hire some better writers for your comics.
Other great marvel reads - Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Civil War: Iron Man/Spiderman/Wolverine, Ultimate Spiderman Series, Iron Man: Extremis.
DC Comics
DC has had an amazing past year and has successfully rebooted their main universe and other heroes. With Geoff Johns (the Steven Moffat of Comics) on board, they have released some of the best comic events and done a good job in picking up the pieces in the aftermath. I feel like DC has made a couple of good movies ("amazing" for the batman trilogy) and still put the same effort into their comics, after all we wouldn't have the movies without the comics. if you want to know more about the New 52 Reboot you can read my review of Justice League #1 and Batman #1
here .
Here are some events that have shown the epicocity (is that a word or am i just quoting tobuscus?) of DC's events  -
Blackest Night
About 2 years ago Green Lantern was bought to the front of the DC franchise when we saw him lead the DC universe against the powers of darkness in Blackest Night. In this comic event Nekron the black lantern of death rises to take over the living and wipe out all of the other lanterns as well as life itself. Teaming up with the other lanterns, Hal Jordan fights to keep the light of the lanterns burning. It was a genius idea introducing more Lanterns and using the colour spectrum with emotions. overall it seem like DC sat down to brainstorm and was like "lets do a story about the powers of the colours of a mood ring" so simple but so genius. In this event DC started doing some epic 2 page pictures that made your enthusiasm for the story grow. Following the aftermath of Blackest Night came the event 'Brightest Day' which was nothing like Blackest Night but was still enjoyable and explained further as to why certain heroes and villains were resurrected at the end of Blackest Night.
Flashpoint
I wanted to highlight this comic event because it is the event that ushered in The New 52. Its the event that showed that you can reboot your comics nicely without killing characters and still having it make sense. Flashpoint follows the Flash as he wakes up in an alternate universe where Thomas Wayne (Bruce Wayne's dad) is Batman, Wonder Woman and Aquaman are at war and Superman was captured as a child and put into a government project. It was a good story with a nice twist and this next part, the conclusion and cross into the new 52 I'm going to let wikipedia explain haha -
Traveling back in time, Barry merges with his younger counterpart during the attempt to stop Thawne. While traveling through time, Barry realizes he can see three different timelines — DC,
Vertigo , and
Wildstorm . A mysterious hooded figure, later identified as "Pandora", tells him that the world was split into three to weaken them for an impending threat, and must now be reunited to combat it. The DC, Vertigo, and Wildstorm universes are then merged, creating
a brand new DC Universe . Barry then wakes up in a similar manner to the beginning of Flashpoint. Believing that everything is over, Barry remembers Thomas' letter and gives it to Bruce, who is still the Batman in this timeline. Bruce is deeply touched by his father's sacrifice to ensure his own life, and cries, and is grateful to Barry for informing him of the events that transpired before the timeline was reset ﻿.
Now we have the all New 52 DC comics which so far have been great and i've really enjoyed reading.
Night Of the Owls
I consider this the first of the new 52 and an important DC story arc/event. All throughout Gotham's history there has been an underground council with an assassin known as the court of owls. They have watched over Gotham and kept it running the way they want it. Now they are after the dark knight who is turning Gotham in a direction they aren't happy with. Night of the Owls is a great show of teamwork as it included Robin, Nightwing, Red Robin, Batgirl, Batwoman, Batwing, and other characters of the Batman family each heeding to the call of Alfred after the court of owls sends a city wide order to assassinate Gotham officials. After being tortured mentally and physically by the court Batman becomes stronger and better to take down the court.  I've been subscribing to Batman comics and the lead up to this event has been great and then the execution of the main event was epic!
﻿
Other things with DC are that this year they announced that Green Lantern (not a real green lantern from OA, just some magical crap) Alan Scott was gay, this was a disappointment because it seemed like DC were just trying to compete with Marvel over the whole gay thing. same opinion on that, don't care, don't want it in my comics. Also they have made Starfire look and act like a sleaze, which i know she's looked a bit raunchy at times but don't we all picture her as the lovable and naive teen titan? I haven't got much to say about DC, they seem to know how to keep their character exciting and don't feel the need to change the original character. Lets just say if DC can "kill off" Batman in 'Final Crisis' and bring him back in a smart way then they can do anything and we don't have to worry.
Other great DC Comics reads - Final Crisis, Green Lantern: Rebirth, Flash: Rebirth, The Flash: Dastardly Death of the Rogues (this one shows flash in his prime), SupermanBatman series, Batman: Hush.
If you have any questions about a comic you want to get or recommendations for or from me, feel free to email me or leave a comment. There are also other great comics not published my Marvel and DC. Haven't forgot about The Walking Dead!
Thanks for Reading!
