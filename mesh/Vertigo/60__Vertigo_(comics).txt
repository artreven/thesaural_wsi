Harvey Pekar American comic book writer (American Splendor) and music critic has died he was, 70,
Harvey Lawrence Pekar
was an
American
underground comic book
writer, music critic, and media personality, best known for his
autobiographical
American Splendor
comic series. In
2003, the series inspired a critically acclaimed film adaptation of the
same name .
Pekar described
American Splendor
as "an autobiography written
as it's happening. The theme is about staying alive. Getting a job,
finding a mate, having a place to live, finding a creative outlet. Life
is a war of attrition. You have to stay ac tive on all fronts. It's one
thing after another. I've tried to control a chaotic universe. And it's a
losing battle. But I can't let go. I've tried, but I can't." [ 1 ]
(October 8, 1939 –
July 12, 2010) Early life Harvey Pekar and his younger brother Allen were born in
Cleveland, Ohio
to Saul and Dora Pekar,
immigrants from
Bialystok, Poland .
Saul Pekar was a
Talmudic
scholar who owned a grocery store on Kinsman
Avenue, with the family living above the store. Harvey Pekar graduated
from
Shaker Heights High School
in
1957, then attended
Case Western Reserve University ,
where he dropped out after a year. He then served in the
United States Navy , and after discharge returned to
Cleveland where he worked odd jobs before being hired as file
clerk
at Cleveland's Veteran's Administration Hospital.
He would hold this job even after gaining fame, before retiring in 2001. [ 2 ] Pekar's friendship with
Robert
Crumb
led to the creation of the self-published, autobiographical
comic
book
series
American Splendor . Crumb and Pekar became friends
through their mutual love of
jazz
records [ 3 ]
when Crumb was living in Cleveland in the mid-1960s. Crumb's work in
underground comics led Pekar to see the form's possibilities, saying,
"Comics could do anything that film could do. And I wanted in on it." [ 4 ]
It took Pekar a decade to do so: "I theorized for maybe ten years about
doing comics." [ 5 ]
Pekar laid out some stories with crude stick figures and showed them to
Crumb and another artist, Robert Armstrong. Impressed, they both
offered to illustrate, and soon Pekar's story "Crazy Ed" appeared in
Crumb's
The People's Comics , and Crumb became the first artist to
illustrate
American Splendor . The comic documents daily life in
the aging neighborhoods of Pekar's native Cleveland. The first issue of
American
Splendor
appeared in 1976.
Pekar's most well-known and longest-running collaborators include
Crumb,
Gary Dumm , Greg Budgett,
Spain Rodriguez ,
Joe
Zabel ,
Gerry Shamray ,
Frank
Stack , Mark Zingarelli, and
Joe
Sacco . In the 2000s, he teamed regularly with artists
Dean
Haspiel
and
Josh Neufeld . Others cartoonists who worked
with him include
Jim Woodring ,
Chester
Brown ,
Alison Bechdel ,
Gilbert Hernandez ,
Eddie Campbell ,
David Collier ,
Drew
Friedman ,
Ho Che Anderson ,
Rick
Geary ,
Ed Piskor ,
Hunt
Emerson ,
Bob Fingerman , and Alex Wald; as well as such
non-traditional illustrators as Pekar's wife,
Joyce
Brabner , and comics writer
Alan
Moore .
Stories from the
American Splendor
comics have been collected
in many books and anthologies.
A film adaptation of
American Splendor
was released in 2003,
directed by
Robert Pulcini
and
Shari Springer Berman . [ 6 ]
It featured
Paul Giamatti
as Pekar, as well as appearances
by Pekar himself. Pekar wrote about the effects of the film in
American
Splendor: Our Movie Year .
In 2006, Pekar released a four-issue
American Splendor
miniseries through the
DC Comics
imprint
Vertigo . [ 7 ]
This was collected in the
American Splendor: Another Day
paperback. In 2008 Vertigo released a second "season" of
American
Splendor
that was collected in the
American Splendor: Another
Dollar
paperback.
In addition to his autobiographical work on
American Splendor ,
Pekar wrote a number of
biographies .
The first of these, 2003's
American Splendor: Unsung Hero ,
documented the
Vietnam War
experience of Robert McNeill, one of
Pekar's
African-American
coworkers at Cleveland's
VA
hospital.
Other comics work
On October 5, 2005, the
DC
Comics
imprint
Vertigo
released Pekar's
autobiographical hardcover
The Quitter , with artwork by Dean
Haspiel. The book detailed Pekar's early years.
In 2006 Pekar released another biography for Ballantine/Random House,
Ego & Hubris: The Michael Malice Story , about the life of
Michael Malice, who was the founding editor of
OverheardinNewYork.com [ 8 ]
Pekar was also given the honor of being the first guest editor for
the collection
The Best American Comics 2006
published by
Houghton Mifflin , the first comics
publication in the " Best American series " series.
In June 2007 Pekar collaborated with student Heather Roberson and
artist Ed Piskor on the book
Macedonia , which centers around
Roberson's studies in the
country . [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
January 2008 saw another biographical work from Pekar,
Students
for a Democratic Society: A Graphic History , released through
Hill & Wang .
In March 2009 Pekar released
The Beats , a history of the
Beat Generation
including
Kerouac
and
Ginsberg ,
illustrated by
Ed Piskor . [ 11 ]
In May 2009 he released
Studs Terkel's Working: A Graphic Adaptation .
In 2010, Pekar launched a
webcomic
with the online magazine
Smith , titled
The Pekar Project . [ 12 ]
Theater,
music and media appearances
In the late 1980s, Pekar's comic book success led to eight guest
appearances on
Late Night with David Letterman .
His confrontational style and overt on-air criticism of
General Electric
(which owned
NBC ) led to the
show banning him as a guest until the early 1990s.
Pekar was a prolific freelance
jazz
and book
critic. As a jazz critic he typically focused on significant figures
from jazz's golden age but has also championed such out-of-mainstream
artists as Birth,
Scott Fields ,
Fred
Frith , and
Joe Maneri . He has also won awards for his essays
which were broadcast on
public radio . In August 2007, Pekar was featured on
the Cleveland episode of
Anthony Bourdain: No
Reservations
with host
Anthony Bourdain .
While
American Splendor
theater adaptations have occurred
before, in 2009 Pekar made his theatrical debut with
Leave Me Alone! ,
a
jazz
opera
for
which Pekar wrote the
libretto .
Leave Me Alone!
featured music by
Dan
Plonsey
and premiered at
Oberlin College
on January 31, 2009. [ 13 ]
In 2009, Pekar was featured in
The Cartoonist ,
a documentary film on the life and
work of
Jeff Smith , creator of
Bone . [ 14 ]
Personal life
Pekar was married from 1960 to 1972 to his first wife, Karen Delaney,
a writer and educator. [ 15 ]
He was married twice more. [ 2 ]
Pekar's third wife was writer
Joyce
Brabner , with whom he collaborated on
Our Cancer Year , a
graphic
novel
autobiography of his harrowing yet successful treatment for
lymphoma .
He lived in
Cleveland Heights ,
Ohio with Brabner and their foster daughter Danielle.
Death and legacy
Shortly before 1 a.m. on July 12, 2010, Pekar's wife found him dead
in his
Cleveland Heights ,
Ohio , home. [ 2 ]
Though no immediate cause was determined, Pekar had been suffering from
prostate cancer. [ 2 ]
Assessing his impact and legacy, fellow cartoonist
Seth
said,
The underground cartoonists were a generation — a group of artists
who knocked down the walls between art and commerce, shattering the
traditional shape and meaning of a comic book. Later, the 'alternative'
cartoonists came along — or whatever you wish to call my generation of
cartoonists — who wanted to produce comics as a legitimate art medium.
But in-between these two generations there was Harvey. A generation of
one. Probably the first person who wanted to use the comics medium
seriously as a writer. Certainly the first person to toss every genre
element out the window and try to capture something of the genuine
experience of living: not just some technique of real life glossed onto a
story — not satire, or sick humor or everyday melodrama — but the
genuine desire to transmit from one person to another just what life
feels like." [ 16 ]
Awards
1987:
American Book Award
for the first
American Splendor
anthology [ 2 ] 1995:
Harvey Award
Best Graphic Album of Original
Work (for
Our Cancer Year ) [ 17 ]
