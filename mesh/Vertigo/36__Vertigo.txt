Team Deathmatch in Vertigo
Vertigo
is a
Condemned 2: Bloodshot
multiplayer map. Set on a large suspension bridge just outside of
Metro City,
it is not based on any location seen in singleplayer. Deathmatch, Crime Scene, and Team Deathmatch games can be played here. The stage contains a large number of steel containers arranged in a maze-like fashion. The stage is mostly dark, with the main source of light coming from various objects that are on fire.

Vertigo
is the name of a condition in which a person experiences the feeling of motion even when completely stationary.
The stage may have been named after the classic film,
Vertigo , in which the Golden Gate Bridge, also a suspension bridge, is featured.
