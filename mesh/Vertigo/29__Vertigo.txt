|6.  |BRIEF RESUME OF INTENDED WORK:                               |
|    |                                                             |
|    |6.1 NEED FOR STUDY                                           |
|    |Sinusitis is the most common health complaints encountered by|
|    |physician. There are 24-31 million cases occurring per year  |
|    |all over the world.                                          |
|    |It usually occurred in age between 16 to 35 years. And most  |
|    |frequently diagnosed as having sinusitis.                    |
|    |Sinusitis often associated with mixed infections i.e. viral, |
|    |bacterial etc.                                               |
|    |All types of sinusitis i.e. acute, chronic and sub acute     |
|    |having similar presentations so very difficult to            |
|    |distinguish.                                                 |
|    |Affects the socio-economic status by hampering the work      |
|    |ability.                                                     |
|    |Comparing to the other systems of medicine, Homoeopathy has a|
|    |wide scope and particular approach in the treatment of       |
|    |sinusitis.                                                   |
|    |Homoeopathy is the holistic therapy and Homoeopathic         |
|    |management can certainly ascertain positive results in cases |
|    |of sinusitis.                                                |
|    |The efficacies of various Homoeopathic remedies in sinusitis |
|    |have been proven by our masters and hence a miasmatic        |
|    |interpretation as well as reportorial approach will          |
|    |definitely help in finding the right similimum.              |
|    |HYPOTHESIS:                                                  |
|    |Null Hypothesis: Homoeopathic management of Sinusitis with   |
|    |emphasis on miasmatic interpretation is not effective.       |
|    |                                                             |
|    |6.2  REVIEW OF LITERATURE                                    |
|    |Sinusitis is a common problem caused by acute or chronic     |
|    |inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. The paranasal sinuses |
|    |are aerated cavities in the bones of the face that develop   |
|    |from the nasal cavity and maintain communication with it. The|
|    |main sinuses are the maxillary, the frontal, the ethmoid, and|
|    |the sphenoid sinuses. Maxillary sinusitis is the most common |
|    |type of sinusitis. The ethmoid, frontal and sphenoid sinuses |
|    |are affected less frequently. 1                              |
|    |Classification: By Duration                                  |
|    |Sinusitis can be acute (going on less than four weeks),      |
|    |subacute (48 weeks) or chronic (going on for 8 weeks or     |
|    |more).  All three types of sinusitis have similar symptoms,  |
|    |and are thus often difficult to distinguish. Acute sinusitis |
|    |is very common. Roughly ninety percent of adults have had    |
|    |sinusitis at some point in their life.2                      |
|    |Acute sinusitis                                              |
|    |                                                             |
|    |Acute sinusitis is usually precipitated by an earlier upper  |
|    |respiratory tract infection, generally of viral origin. If   |
|    |the infection is of bacterial origin, the most common three  |
|    |causative agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus   |
|    |influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Until recently,       |
|    |Haemophilus influenzae was the most common bacterial agent to|
|    |cause sinus infections. However, introduction of the H.      |
|    |influenza type B (Hib) vaccine has dramatically decreased H. |
|    |influenza type B infections and now non-typable H. influenza |
|    |(NTHI) are predominantly seen in clinics. Other sinusitis    |
|    |causing bacterial pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus and|
|    |other streptococci species, anaerobic bacteria and, less     |
|    |commonly, gram negative bacteria. Viral sinusitis typically  |
|    |lasts for 7 to 10 days, whereas bacterial sinusitis is more  |
|    |persistent. Approximately 0.5% to 2% of viral sinusitis      |
|    |results in subsequent bacterial sinusitis. It is thought that|
|    |nasal irritation from nose blowing leads to the secondary    |
|    |bacterial infection.                                         |
|    |Acute episodes of sinusitis can also result from fungal      |
|    |invasion. These infections are typically seen in patients    |
|    |with diabetes or other immune deficiencies (such as AIDS or  |
|    |transplant patients on immunosuppressive anti-rejection      |
|    |medications) and can be life threatening. With type I        |
|    |diabetes, ketoacidosis causes sinusitis by Mucormycosis.     |
|    |Chemical irritation can also trigger sinusitis, commonly from|
|    |cigarettes and chlorine fumes. Rarely, it may be caused by a |
|    |tooth infection.1,3                                          |
|    |                                                             |
|    |Chronic sinusitis                                            |
|    |                                                             |
|    |Chronic, by definition, lasts longer than three months and   |
|    |can be caused by many different diseases that share chronic  |
|    |inflammation of the sinuses as a common symptom. Symptoms of |
|    |chronic sinusitis may include any combination of the         |
|    |following: nasal congestion, facial pain, headache,          |
|    |night-time coughing, an increase in previously minor or      |
|    |controlled asthma symptoms, general malaise, thick green or  |
|    |yellow discharge, feeling of facial 'fullness' or 'tightness'|
|    |that may worsen when bending over, dizziness, aching teeth,  |
|    |and/or halitosis. Each of these symptoms has multiple other  |
|    |causes. Unless complications occur, fever is not a feature of|
|    |chronic sinusitis.[citation needed] Often chronic sinusitis  |
|    |can lead to anosmia, a reduced sense of smell. In a small    |
|    |number of cases, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis is     |
|    |associated with a dental infection. Vertigo, lightheadedness,|
|    |and blurred vision are not typical in chronic sinusitis and  |
|    |other causes should be investigated.                         |
|    |Chronic sinusitis cases are subdivided into cases with polyps|
|    |and cases without polyps. When polyps are present, the       |
|    |condition is called chronic hyperplastic sinusitis; however, |
|    |the causes are poorly understood and may include allergy,    |
|    |environmental factors such as dust or pollution, bacterial   |
|    |infection, or fungus (either allergic, infective, or         |
|    |reactive). Non-allergic factors, such as vasomotor rhinitis, |
|    |can also cause chronic sinus problems.[citation needed]      |
|    |Abnormally narrow sinus passages, such as having a deviated  |
|    |septum, can impede drainage from the sinus cavities and be a |
|    |contributing factor. A combination of anaerobic and aerobic  |
|    |bacteria are detected in conjunction with chronic sinusitis, |
|    |including Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative       |
|    |Staphylococci. Typically antibiotic treatment provides only a|
|    |temporary reduction in inflammation, although                |
|    |hyperresponsiveness of the immune system to bacteria has been|
|    |proposed as a possible cause of sinusitis with polyps        |
|    |(chronic hyperplastic sinusitis).                            |
|    |Attempts have been made to provide a more consistent         |
|    |nomenclature for subtypes of chronic sinusitis. The presence |
|    |of eosinophils in the mucous lining of the nose and paranasal|
|    |sinuses has been demonstrated for many patients, and this has|
|    |been termed Eosinophilic Mucin RhinoSinusitis (EMRS). Cases  |
|    |of EMRS may be related to an allergic response, but allergy  |
|    |is not often documented, resulting in further                |
|    |subcategorization into allergic and non-allergic EMRS.       |
|    |A more recent, and still debated, development in chronic     |
|    |sinusitis is the role that fungus plays in this disease.     |
|    |Fungus can be found in the nasal cavities and sinuses of most|
|    |patients with sinusitis, but can also be found in healthy    |
|    |people as well. It remains unclear if fungus is a definite   |
|    |factor in the development of chronic sinusitis and if it is, |
|    |what the difference may be between those who develop the     |
|    |disease and those who remain symptom free. Trials of         |
|    |antifungal treatments have had mixed results.1               |
|    |                                                             |
|    |                                                             |
|    |Classification: By location                                  |
|    |There are several paired paranasal sinuses, including the    |
|    |frontal, ethmoid,maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. The ethmoid |
|    |sinuses is further subdivided into anterior and posterior    |
|    |ethmoid sinuses, the division of which is defined as the     |
|    |basal lamella of the middle turbinate. In addition to the    |
|    |severity of disease, discussed below, sinusitis can be       |
|    |classified by the sinus cavity which it affects:             |
|    |Maxillary sinusitis - can cause pain or pressure in the      |
|    |maxillary (cheek) area (e.g., toothache, headache)           |
|    |Frontal sinusitis - can cause pain or pressure in the frontal|
|    |sinus cavity (located behind/above eyes), headache           |
|    |Ethmoid sinusitis - can cause pain or pressure pain          |
|    |between/behind the eyes and headaches                        |
|    |Sphenoid sinusitis - can cause pain or pressure behind the   |
|    |eyes, but often refers to the vertex, or top of the head     |
|    |Recent theories of sinusitis indicate that it often occurs as|
|    |part of a spectrum of diseases that affect the respiratory   |
|    |tract (i.e., the "one airway" theory) and is often linked to |
|    |asthma.  All forms of sinusitis may either result in, or be a|
|    |part of, a generalized inflammation of the airway, so other  |
|    |airway symptoms, such as cough, may be associated with it.2  |
|    |                                                             |
|    |Signs and symptoms                                           |
|    |                                                             |
|    |Headache/facial pain or pressure of a dull, constant, or     |
|    |aching sort over the affected sinuses is common with both    |
|    |acute and chronic stages of sinusitis. This pain is typically|
|    |localized to the involved sinus and may worsen when the      |
|    |affected person bends over or when lying down. Pain often    |
|    |starts on one side of the head and progresses to both sides. |
|    |Acute and chronic sinusitis may be accompanied by thick nasal|
|    |discharge that is usually green in colour and may contain pus|
|    |(purulent) and/or blood. Often a localized headache or       |
|    |toothache is present, and it is these symptoms that          |
|    |distinguish a sinus-related headache from other types of     |
|    |headaches, such as tension and migraine headaches. Infection |
|    |of the eye socket is possible, which may result in the loss  |
|7.  |of sight and is accompanied by fever and severe illness.     |
|    |Another possible complication is the infection of the bones  |
|    |(osteomyelitis) of the forehead and other facial bones -     |
|    |Pott's puffy tumor.                                          |
|    |Recent studies suggest that up to 90% of "sinus headaches"   |
|    |are actually migraines. The confusion occurs in part because |
|    |migraine involves activation of the trigeminal nerves, which |
|    |innervate both the sinus region and the meninges surrounding |
|    |the brain. As a result, it is difficult to accurately        |
|    |determine the site from which the pain originates.           |
|    |Additionally, nasal congestion can be a common result of     |
|    |migraine headaches, due to the autonomic nerve stimulation   |
|    |that can also cause in tearing (lachrymation) and a runny    |
|    |nose (rhinorrhoea). A study found that patients with "sinus  |
|    |headaches" responded to triptan migraine medications, but    |
|    |stated dissatisfaction with their treatment when they are    |
|    |treated with decongestants or antibiotics.1,2                |
|    |Complications                                                |
|    |The close proximity of   the brain to the sinuses makes the  |
|    |most dangerous complication of sinusitis, particularly       |
|    |involving the frontal and sphenoid sinuses, infection of the |
|    |brain by the invasion of anaerobic bacteria through the bones|
|    |or blood vessels. Abscesses, meningitis, and other           |
|    |life-threatening conditions may result. In extreme cases the |
|    |patient may experience mild personality changes, headache,   |
|    |altered consciousness, visual problems, and, finally,        |
|    |seizures, coma, and possibly death.1,2                       |
|    |Causes                                                       |
|    |Factors which may predispose someone to developing sinusitis |
|    |include: allergies; structural abnormalities, such as a      |
|    |deviated septum, small sinus ostia or a concha bullosa; nasal|
|    |polyps; carrying the cystic fibrosis gene, though research is|
|    |still tentative; and prior bouts of sinusitis, because each  |
|    |instance may result in increased inflammation of the nasal or|
|    |sinus mucosa and potentially further narrow the nasal        |
|    |passageways.                                                 |
|    |Second hand smoke is the cause of about 40% of chronic       |
|    |rhinosinusitis3.                                             |
|    |Pathophysiology                                              |
|    |It has been hypothesized that biofilm bacterial infections   |
|    |may account for many cases of antibiotic-refractory chronic  |
|    |sinusitis.  Biofilms are complex aggregates of extracellular |
|    |matrix and inter-dependent microorganisms from multiple      |
|    |species, many of which may be difficult or impossible to     |
|    |isolate using standard clinical laboratory techniques.       |
|    |Bacteria found in biofilms have their antibiotic resistance  |
|    |increased up to 1000 times when compared to free-living      |
|    |bacteria of the same species. A recent study found that      |
|    |biofilms were present on the mucosa of 75% of patients       |
|    |undergoing surgery for chronic sinusitis.3                   |
|    |                                                             |

|    |Bacterial and viral acute sinusitis are difficult to         |
|    |distinguish. However, if symptoms last less than 7 days, it  |
|    |is generally considered viral sinusitis. When symptoms last  |
|    |more than 7 days, it is considered bacterial sinusitis       |
|    |(usually 30% to 50% are bacterial sinusitis). Hospital       |
|    |acquired acute sinusitis can be confirmed by performing a CT |
|    |scan of the sinuses.4                                        |
|    |Chronic sinusitis                                            |
|    |For sinusitis lasting more than eight weeks, diagnostic      |
|    |criteria are lacking. A CT scan is recommended, but this     |
|    |alone is insufficient to confirm the diagnosis. Nasal        |
|    |endoscopy, a CT scan, and clinical symptoms are all used to  |
|    |make a positive diagnosis. A tissue sample for histology and |
|    |cultures can also be collected and tested. Allergic fungal   |
|    |sinusitis is often seen in people with asthma and nasal      |
|    |polyps. Examining multiple biopsy samples can be helpful to  |
|    |confirm the diagnosis.                                       |
|    |Nasal endoscopy involves inserting a flexible fiber-optic    |
|    |tube with a light and camera at its tip into the nose to     |
|    |examine the nasal passages and sinuses. This is generally a  |
|    |completely painless (although uncomfortable) procedure which |
|    |takes between five to ten minutes to complete.4              |

|    |Miasmatic consideration:                                     |
|    |Here we will have an overview of the manifestations of all   |
|    |the miasms in sinusitis.                                     |
|    |Psora:                                                       |
|    |Psora manifests the symptoms of functional disorders only. No|
|    |structural change can be seen in uncomplicated psora. All the|
|    |sensation as if and characteristic symptoms especially     |
|    |concomitants belongs to psora.                               |
|    |Psora presents with morning constantly returning, persistent,|
|    |usually frontal headaches. These headaches grow worse as the |
|    |sun ascends and decrease as it descends. The headaches are   |
|    |sharp, severe paroxysmal. Usually frontal, temporal, or      |
|    |temporo-parietal, sometimes on vertex. Headaches, which are  |
|    |better by being quiet, rest or sleep. Headaches better by hot|
|    |applications. Headache from hunger.                          |
|    |The psoric cold begins with sneezing, redness, heat, and     |
|    |sensitiveness to touch when blown for some time, discharge   |
|    |thin, watery and acrid. Epistaxis more or less profuse or    |
|    |less frequent. Sensation of dryness in the nose, troublesome |
|    |even when the air passes freely. Senses of smell weak, loss. |
|    |Stoppage of one nose causes mouth breathing.5                |
|    |Sycosis:                                                     |
|    |Sycotic manifestations are characterized by slowness of      |
|    |recovery. Sycosis develops the catarrhal discharge. Pain in  |
|    |frontal or vertex at or after midnight. Headaches of sycotic |
|    |children are more common and are worse at night, producing   |
|    |feverishness, restlessness, crying, fretting and worrying.   |
|    |Better by motion. Headaches worse lying down and at night,   |
|    |especially after midnight. The patient is restless and wants |
|    |to be kept in motion, which ameliorates. Headache worse      |
|    |riding, exertion either mental or physical. Headache usually |
|    |accompanied by sadness and prostration.                      |
|    |There is loss of smell. Nose clear one hour, the next he     |
|    |cannot get a particle of air through his nasal passages. A   |
|    |red nose with enlarged capillaries.                          |
|    |Snuffles in children. This is usually moist and tere is no   |
|    |ulceration and no crusts, or if purulent, is very scanty and |
|    |has the odor of fish brine or stale fish. The stoppage is due|
|    |to local congestion and thickening of the membrane or        |
|    |enlargement of the turbinate due to congestion. The discharge|
|    |is yellowish green, scanty or copious, thin mucous. Children |
|    |from sycotic parents complicated with gout, take cold easily |
|    |at slightest exposure and frequently suffer from acute       |
|    |coryza. Discharge from nose becomes copious, watery and often|
|    |excoriating. The slightest amount of discharge ameliorates.5 |
|    |Syphilis:                                                    |
|    |The chief pathology of the syphilitic miasm will be          |
|    |destruction, deformation, suppuration and ulceration.        |
|    |Degenerative changes are considered as syphilitic. Headaches |
|    |worse at night. They improve in the morning and remain better|
|    |all day until evening when they grow worse as the night      |
|    |advances. Dull, heavy or lancinating, constant, persistent   |
|    |headaches. Usually basilar or linear or one-sided. Headaches |
|    |worse warmth, rest or while attempting to sleep. Headache    |
|    |worse on lying down. Loss of smell. Snuffles in children,    |
|    |ulceration, thick crusts often filling whole nasal cavity.   |
|    |The crusts are dark, greenish black or brown, thick and not  |
|    |always offensive. Bones of nose destroyed. Deposition of     |
|    |crusts in nose with offensive breath.5                       |
|    |                                                             |
|    |Tubercular:                                                  |
|    |Headache occurring every Sunday or on rest days, worse riding|
|    |in carriages or are due to the least unusual ordeal, as      |
|    |preparing for examinations; meeting with strangers and       |
|    |entertaining them. Headache with deathly coldness of hands   |
|    |and feet, with prostration, sadness and general despondency. |
|    |Headache with red face and rush of blood to head, or at      |
|    |certain hours of the day. Usually in the forenoon; headaches |
|    |better by rest, quiet, sleep, eating, nose bleed.            |
|    |Dr. Phyllis Speight says that, a tubercular or syphilitic   |
|    |headache will often last for days and is very severe, often  |
|    |unendurable, sometimes with sensation of bands about the     |
|    |head, cannot hold it up, and sometimes they produce          |
|    |unconsciousness, rolling or boring of the head into the      |
|    |pillow, ocular paralysis, with feverishness and restlessness |
|    |or patient is stupid, dull or listless, even semiconscious.  |
|    |Sometimes headaches are worse by heat. Amelioration by cold  |
|    |is found in the syphilitic miasm. In the syphilitic or       |
|    |tubercular headache of children, they strike, knock or pound |
|    |their heads with their hands or against some object. Great   |
|    |hunger before headache.                                      |
|    |Headache better by nosebleed. Catarrhal discharge is thick,  |
|    |usually yellow and of odor of old cheese or sulphate of      |
|    |hydrogen and in constantly dropping down the throat.5        |
