Update:
On March 15th, 2012, MBC Wednesday and Thursday
drama series The Moon Embracing The Sun rang down the curtain with viewership
ratings of 42.2%. The highest single minute ratings of the day even hit as high
as 48.1%.
Although the audience had already guessed the ending through the
original novel of the same name, but people was still concerned about the
tension development of the plot, until the last moment. The Moon that Embrace
the Sun had been broke in in full fury since debut.

The
South Korean MBC TV historical television series  The Moon that Embraces
the Sun recently was exported to 7 Asian countries -Japan, Thailand, Singapore,
Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Indonesia - the TV series that fetches the
highest price in the history of South Korea’s per episode export price.
This
Hit series also caused
the share prices of many companies involved in the
production to rise sharply.   Source MyDaily
STORY PLOT
The
story of the love shared between Lee Hwon (a fictional king of Joseon) and Wol
(a female shaman) is based on the novel by Jeong Eun Gwol. Yeon Woo (Wol), born
from a noble family was selected to become the Crown Princess of Joseon, until
the Dowager Queen plotted against her (political conspiracy) and secretly
ordered her death.
With the help of the powerful head shaman, Yeon
Woo was given a medicine to fake her death; all including Lee Hwon the Crown
Prince she was to marry, believed her to be dead. Yeon-woo awaken in her grave
six feet under - the shock and trauma robbed her of all past memories. She was
secretly shipped away and lived as a shaman under the care of Jong Nok Young,
the head shaman.
Years later Yeon Woo returns as shaman Wol. Lee
Hwon notices her close resemblance to his 13yr old deceased Crown Princess. “He’s
mistaken her for someone else (Yeon Woo), or that his longing for her has
created such illusions and heartache”. Wol, having no memory of her past,
firmly denies that she is Yeon Woo.
Confused, suspicious yet doubtful, Lee Hwon
secretly begins investigations to find out the truth of the princess’s death
eight years ago and broke down hysterically when he finally discovered the true
identity of Shaman Wol.
Superb
and exceptionally outstanding performances by these beautiful Korean
actresses........

VERTIGO – Simple Exercises
You feel dizzy, unstable, nausea, sweaty, the room is spinning and you are
floating about crazily, try lying down and the moment you rise – starts all
over again.
The first attack caught me by surprise, without
any warning, very scary indeed as I have never been through dizzy spells before. A few hours in
the hospital for thorough examination, tests and observation, the doctor explained
to me what
Vertigo
is all about. Phew… what a relief, something’s
just not right with my inner ears!

I was very lucky my first experiences happened at home but imagine if one is driving a car, swimming, climbing the stairs
or carrying your baby etc?
Roughly a third of patients have such recurrences within
a year of treatment and half have recurrences within five years, do you need to
carry the pills with you at all times?
There are vertigo exercises that you can
do at home to help manage these attacks, simple steps that will take less than
5minutes of your time, it works. There are many videos posted in the internet
to help you with these exercises.

Back to the Kitchen – Cooking Varieties – Chef Dato Dr Rusly
In
Malaysia we have our celebrity chef an Accountant by qualification, the famous
Chef Wan .
And I too have a special friend Wan, also an Accountant by profession who is as
passionate in cooking and shares her special interest blogging on food -
Cooking Varieties.
What
makes
CookingVarieties
exciting is that Wan invites
guest bloggers
from all over
the world to contribute and share their interest in food; recipes, food ideas, tips, suggestions,
health benefits and food jokes etc.
In one of her recent posting on Pancakes we
get to learn of the varieties of pancakes enjoyed by different communities
around the world.
I
have no talent in cooking. Years of being away from home I had no opportunity
to learn to cook from my late mum. When I was home she would rather I not enter
her kitchen – I only mess things up for her. Even at this age I am
struggling, left to cook on my own, I am simply lost. I still need to depend on
cookbooks, surf the net for food blogs and attend cooking lessons - yes, learn
how to cook from scratch.
Chef Dato Dr Rosli
(Chef Li) inspired me the most; his easy simple ways make cooking
bearable
and
fun. I attended many of his classes – tricks, shortcuts and tips from him are priceless.
In one traditional menu “Nasi Lemak” session, within just few hours we can
come up with as many as 25 dishes! Fantastic - learning about his simple paste system, will save us so much time in the kitchen.
And
you get to learn of the little secret ingredients/herbs used, for instance to prepare the
famous Hainanese Chicken Rice. You may try as hard but if just one special ingredient is not added, you may not get the original taste right.
Anyway Chef Li offers a wide selection of menus to choose from - traditional dishes, Chinese, Thai, Western, baking, ice-creams, drinks and also how to process noodles, yoghurt, bean curds etc.
He
is also the author of motivational books such as “Jutawan Senyap”, the Silent
Millionaire, where he encourages others to venture into simple food related business
as means to earn a living.
