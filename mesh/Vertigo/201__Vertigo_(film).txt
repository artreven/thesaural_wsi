directors and illustrators operating in Glasgow today. From running
Techno and Acid nights at the legendary Club 69 in Paisley he moved to
Glasgow for artschool. In that time Tom would ignore briefs and
competitions to make music promos for Jamie Liddell, or he would be
recording classical music to cd-rs and then drawing on the bottom of
them and recording how it made them skip.
In the past few
years, Tom has not stopped, establishing his own studio and label for
experimental noise records ‘Display Copy’ alongside his made numerous
music promo videos, sleeves and visuals for Warp, Mogwai, Underground

John Whitney, Sr.
(April 8, 1917 – September 22, 1995) was an
American
animator ,
composer
and
inventor , widely considered to be one of the fathers of
computer animation . James Whitney
(December 27, 1921 – April 8, 1982), younger brother of
John ,
was a filmmaker regarded as one of the great masters of abstract
cinema. Several of his films are classics in the genre of visual music. John's  first works in film were 8 mm movies of a lunar eclipse which he
made using a home-made telescope. In 1937-38 he spent a year in Paris,
studying
twelve-tone
composition under
Rene Leibowitz . In 1939 he returned to America and began to collaborate with his brother
James
on a series of abstract films. Their work,
Five Film Exercises
(1940-45) was awarded a prize for sound at the First International Experimental Film Competition in
Belgium
in 1949. In 1948 he was awarded a
Guggenheim Fellowship .
During the 1950s Whitney used his mechanical animation techniques to
create sequences for television programs and commercials. In 1952 he
directed engineering films on
guided missile
projects. One of his most famous works from this period was the animated
title sequence
from
Alfred Hitchcock 's 1958 film
Vertigo , which he collaborated on with the graphic designer
Saul Bass .
In 1960, John founded Motion Graphics Incorporated, which used a
mechanical analogue computer of his own invention to create motion
picture and television title sequences and commercials. The following
year, he assembled a record of the visual effects he had perfected using
his device, titled simply
Catalog . In 1966,
IBM
awarded John Whitney, Sr. its first artist-in-residence position.
By the 1970s, John Whitney had abandoned his analogue computer in favour
of faster, digital processes. The pinnacle of his digital films is his
1975 work
Arabesque , characterized by
psychedelic ,
blooming colour-forms. His work during the 1980s and 1990s, benefited
from faster computers and his invention of an audio-visual composition
program called the Whitney-Reed RDTD (Radius-Differential Theta
Differential). Works from this period such as
Moondrum
(1989–1995) used self-composed music and often explored mystical or
Native-American
themes.
James completed a number of short films over four decades, two of
which required at least five years of work. James collaborated with his
brother John for some of his early film work.
Between 1950 and 1955, James laboured to construct a truly astounding masterpiece,
Yantra .
The film was produced entirely by hand. By punching grid patterns in 5"
by 7" cards with a pin, James was able to paint through these pinholes
onto other 5" x 7" cards, to create images of rich complexity and give
the finished work a very dynamic and flowing motion, but the film was
not completed yet. It was first released as a silent film.
A very short, manipulated fragment from an early version of
Yantra
was shown at one of the historic
Vortex Concerts
in
San Francisco 's Morrison
planetarium
in early 1959. Soon after Vortex, the film acquired its soundtrack, when Jordan Belson synchronized it to an excerpt from
Henk Badings ’ "Cain and Abel". This did not occur at the Morrison Planetarium Vortex Concerts, contrary to popular belief (Keefer, 2008).
Analogue computer equipment
developed by brother John, allowed James to complete
Lapis
(1966) in two years, when it might have taken seven years otherwise.
James drew dot patterns again for this film, but the camera was
positioned using computer control, allowing each image to be overlaid
from multiple angles. In this piece, smaller circles oscillate in and
out in an array of colors resembling a
kaleidoscope
while being accompanied by Indian
sitar
music. The patterns become hypnotic and trance inducing.

Art electronics paul granjon performance art
Paul Granjon is an electronic artist who makes short films, songs and machines for experimentation and entertainment. Over 20 years of activity he has invented a wide range of not very useful contraptions which he presents in videos, performances or installations worldwide.
This is a selection of videos from his archive, including Furman the kicking robot, Mofo the disco humanoid, a live song with Robotic ears and tail, Robotic paintball gun, a Fluffy tamagotchi, Fire without matches, the sexually active Sexed robots and a few other home-made machines.
Some of the older footage was made for television, with low-tech semi-fictional inventions. The video props machines gradually made way for fully functional devices that are demonstrated in performances or installed in art galleries. In all cases, Paul Granjon's take on technological art uncommonly features a healthy dose of humour, albeit of the dark kind sometimes. Once the spectator is laughing, the artist slips in some
underlying questions on our relation to technology, and the importance of not being a passive user.
