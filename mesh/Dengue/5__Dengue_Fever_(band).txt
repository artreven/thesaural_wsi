Iris Chang-ing It
I'm looking forward to digging into a few books over the holidays and am sniffing around for ideas.  Came upon
Spike Press '
Chicago Reader , here have a look at some of the promo pics, they're fun:
I'm thinking I want to read
this book
:
Finding Iris Chang .
Dang,
the Chicago Reader costs $95.00 to subscribe to by mail
but is free to the people of Chicago in local bookstores. You Chicagoans don't know how lucky you got it!!
-Also, an essay
Kamen wrote about  Iris Chang for Salon. Chicago Reader has some terrific blogs on it, too...I like this quote:
Bookmark this page so that in a few years if you wonder exactly when
Bjork finished turning into Yoko Ono you can pull up this video and
say, "Oh yeah, that was when."

Miga, Sumi and Quatchi
Okay a bunch of random things :
-Confession time, I have a bit of a thing for the Olympics (winter and summer, its sick. Don't ask I can't explain it.) Hence, I'm geekily on their mailing list and now present the mascots for
Vancouver 2010 . From left to right: Miga, Sumi and my favorite (short for Sasquatch, aw, terrifying mythical beast gets the cute treatment) Quatchi.  I think he looks a little like Jake Gyllenhaal myself.
-Like so I keep hearing a lot about No Age: ( source )
No Age : Everybody's Down.mp3
Is good yes? Party time in the ear canal.
-Two interviews that I read and laughed a lil at...
Funny interview with
Jason Bateman and Ellen Page   (She gives off a slightly lezzie vibe..a Kristy McNichol in
Little Darlings
sassiness. Some of you are probably too young to remember and have noooo idea what I'm talking about. Those of you who are, I'm right, right?)
And
Joel McHale
gets the
LAist treatment . Oh to be that Chihuahua!

Rainbows and Clouds
Howdy! Well here's a whole bunch of mostly
Buzzfeed
newsblips that I will now
refeed
to y'all. How exciting.
-Lindsay Lohan aka "La Smokehan" was photographed pimping
Ariva Lozenges
on her dashboard. Ariva is disposable tobacco to get your tobacco fix without breaking no-smoking laws.
-Presenting:
Nutty Buddy . Company slogan: "Protecting the Boys." Sizes: Mongo, the Hog, the Boss and the Hammer. Not even kidding.
-Also been reading the January issue of
Vanity Fair.
There's the most fascinating article about artists Jeremy Blake and Teresa Duncan that is filled with celebrity, mystery and intrigue ( cue A.J. Benza! ) in the weeks leading up to their double suicides. Of course, I always focus on the wrong things..such as Blake's fixation on the
Winchester Mystery House . Located in San Jose, the Wincheste r House is reportedly haunted, was under construction continuously for 38 years and: According to popular belief, Sarah Winchester thought the house was haunted by the
ghosts
of individuals killed by
Winchester rifles , and that only continuous construction would appease them. -There's a puff piece on Katherine Heigl, star of Grey's Anatomy and Knocked Up, who (and this was the only interesting part of the story) has named her production company after a Robert Frost poem titled
Provide Provide
and the character
Abishag , who represents the transience of beauty and fame.
-And some sad news for the literary world,
Jessica Simpson's book of poetry and photography has been rejected by publishers: An
OK! Magazine
snitch spills:
“She worked so hard on the book, but when Joe pitched it to a major publishing house, it was completely laughed at.”
“It was unreadable. Most of photography of rainbows and clouds were blurred and unprintable.

Chat Stew
Phew! Well things have finally settled down at work a bit and now I can talk about what I really wanted to talk about earlier: Dengue Fever. A lot of people haven't heard of
Dengue Fever , a Los Angeles based group that makes Cambodian surf rock. Yes, you read that correctly, that's not a bunch of jumbled up ideas or crazy spam email-speak (En>>large PLanis Sailboat Europa Size Noww!). Cambodian sounding surf rock, and its better than you might expect.
Escape From Dragon House
was one of the best albums of 2005 and I try to trumpet their awesomeness every chance I get. I think the lead singer, Chhom Nimol is beautiful and has the most interesting twang to her voice. And just think,
if you're ever playing Indie Rock Name Scrabble, her first name has 2 H's!

Dengue Fever:

Video for Sni Bong
P.S. I've seen it spelled both "Sni" and "Sui" Bong..
Also:
-I laughed at
reader Audrey's
comment. And if you haven't downloaded the Wilco I put up a few days, you should.  Much like Spoon's Ga ga ga ga ga, Sky Blue Sky improves with every listening. I'ms about to put up the other scorcher (as much as Wilco can scorch ;)) called
You Are My Face . Its bliss.
Update: I just got an email from their management that it is in fact "Sni" Bong, pronounced "Sneye" and that they have a new album called Venus on Earth coming out on January 22, 2008. AND, if you're in L.A. They have a concert coming up at UCLA on 3/12/08 . Details at their
myspace page.

The Sound and The Fur Lined Boots
I have a huge mountain of things to do so no music or pix today.
Was reading in Time Magazine, who have their of
Best of Lists up btw., (disagree with The Lives of Others and Waitress.) that John McCain's daughter Sydney is on the campaign trail with him and that she packs suitcases of shoes with her. Boots in particular. And there's a quote in the story something to the effect of "If Victoria Beckham can wear heels everywhere and all the time, so can I."
And I've been thinking about how initially I thought that was one of the most idiotic things I'd read in a long time...to model yourself after someone who is in essence a talking mannequin. Then I thought, in a Camille Paglia type moment- one of the only interesting things the Spice Girls did was break down the way women identify themselves into little categories. I was thinking this as I was making a choice between sneakers and heeled boots today... that I'm not a sneakers kind of girl really. My taste will always run "Posh" and never "Sporty." Leather over canvas every time. Now that I've come to this conclusion what does it all mean?!
And there's no point here, other than that Faulkner was wrong and there is no wisdom in idiots.

Shawties
Here are a few quick ones while I'm hopped up on caffeine: - Suggestions for who should play who in the upcoming G.I. Joe Movie.
-Not so fast year end listers!
Yellow Stereo : says that Daft Punk's Alive and Rufus Wainwright's latest offerings are also worth consideration. Also, some news on Mr. Dan Bejar's projects.
- Green Day has a new side project called Foxboro Hot Tubs (why do I have a feeling there will be a copyright infringement suit on that name?) and details on Joe Strummer's coffee table book. So establishment! -Ashlee Simpson says she draws inspiration from Salvador Dali. -
Now MTV freelancers are walking out!

Linkinboots
We'll keep you posted on every detail of this breaking non-news story!! (Seriously, how
huge
are Mike Shinoda's eyes?*) Its gotten to the point where so many clips are tongue-in-cheek, mocumentary style that when you see something real happening in the back of your mind you're wondering why reality can't punch up the humor a bit..hire Ben Stiller and have the old press people do something wilder or more embarrassing,
real life!
Gah, get with the program.
(*Hub: "If we're talkin' Puss In Boots, Shinoda's got nothin' on
Mike Huckabee .")
-I don't know if David Spade is "Young" Hollywood, really. He's always
getting stalked or having his life threatened . Weird.

Peoplesicles

article about moguls/CEOS who are spending copious amounts of doughage to extend their lives or have themselves cryogenically frozen . Which is fine and all... its the hall of fame wall of that creeps me out for no particular reason. Yes, I went to all this trouble just so I could title this post Peoplesicles. (click on pic)

Comma Ride the Train
I dunno,
everywhere I look for the past year or so I've been reading
hype about Vampire Weekend and they're just ai'ight for me, yknow? Whitney Popcandy says that all her readers love them too. Maybe there's just that one song I haven't heard that'll leave me
floored .
I'm willing to give them another listen. Let's cull the web, shall we? ::dracula laugh::

Very busy again today.  Does anyone need anything done for them because apparently someone put a "Go to Gal" sign on the back of my shirt and I've been appointed Do-er of everything for everyone today. Earlier I had planned a witty post that included some very funny jokes about Christmas and truisms by the great philosopher Kim Kardashian on giving and receiving AND about how much I enjoyed reading this
Entertainment Weekly review on the Diver and the Butterfly
and accompanying blurb about artist Julian Schnabel. But dude, I can't do everything I'm only one person! Ack! Happy Hump Day, soggers.

It Used To Be a Zodys
Only time for a quick one today!
Did they used to have Zody's Department stores in other parts of the country?  We used to have them here years and years ago. And I think I might have talked about Zodys on S.O.G. before. Anyway, I got a kick out of the title of
this painting
by
Louie Metz ,
It Used To Be a Zodys:
-Reporters Expose Airport Security by Blowing Up Plane .
-The faster easier way to
stalk
track your favorite shows and celebs.

Christmas Story
Dear Billy, We have no idea who you are as person because of the lack of communication within our dysfunctional family . Happy Holidays! (We have no idea what religion you are either, Billy.)(Your name *is* Billy, isn't it?)

Clayton? Heh Heh Heh.
Despite my levity on this site, I'm really quite a successful and serious person. I bring the same intensity to my regular life that I do to
Stop Okay Go . In fact, when you see me my brow is
often furrowed
in deep thought.  Observers often think to themselves, "What is she thinking about so intently..", crossing to the other side of the street in fear, "..and do you think they're real?" Before they cross back for a better look.
Really I'm thinking about
John Mayer .
I've been resistant to the idea of John Mayer for a long time because he's reaaaallly lame-seeming. Still can't say that I'm a fan, but I no longer despise him for no good reason. So that's a start.
Here's a talk between me and Hub this morning:
Me : You know who is, like, really good? John Mayer. I saw him on Letterman the other and night and as a guitarist, he's up there...like a Stones guitarist or something. I didn't know he was that good. I mean, I knew he could play, like when he was on Chappelle with that one skit...you know the one..
H : Yeah, he's very good. But he's goofy. He makes those faces like the one band leader they had on Saturday Night Live. Good guitarist, huge dork.
Me:
Yeah, blonde guy, ponytail, name with initials .  A.C. Green...or something. A.J. from the Sopranos.
H:  It wasn't bad enough that he was an A-hole who mugged at the cameras, he also had to have an "initials" name. A.H. Bandleader.
M: God, what was his name. M.C. Hammer. That was it.

Footnote: I'll never be completely sold on the dude. Not after the
song
Daught ers , which, apart from being completely corny sounds like he's trying to smooth talk both mothers and daughters into sleeping with him.
