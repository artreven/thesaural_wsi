The life and times of a gay American ex-patriate living and learning in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic

2 Things!
First,
Byron
just got out of the hospital after
getting
Dengue Fever . Well, it is a very serious
disease (spread by mosquitoes) that affects tropical climates. The country is on
a major TV and newspaper campaign to warn the populace about cleaning up any
potential mosquito nests. There is also spraying going on to kill as many
mo squitoes as possible. Just something to be on the lookout for when traveling
to the DR, or any tropical climate. Mosquitoes are not only a nuisance, but a
disease-carrying killer. Also, Byron wanted me to also let people know about the
care he received from the hospital he was treated at,
Clinica Abreu . He said the care was
comparable to the States, and he was checked every 30 minutes while there. It is
also the hospital recommended by the
U. S. Embassy . Yesterday, another
friend of the blog stopped by to tell me of an incident with the police. He was
driving back from one of the casinos on the Malecon, when he was pulled over on
Avenida Independencia. There were 2 cops on a motorcycl e. Told him to turn in on
a side-street. Mistake number 1. They told him he had ran a red light. Of course
he had not, but facts get blurred when you come in contact with some policemen here.
Anyway, long story short, he gave them RD$3,000 pesos (about $93 U.S.), cops saw
money and said no, RD$2,000 (about $62) more. Now let's analyze this.
First, if you are driving and get stopped by the police
NEVER
turn on to a side street. Handle
everything right there.
Second, keep a copy of your passport and driver's
license with you. You can keep your original license with you, but only give the
copies if pulled over by police.
Third, if you have done nothing wrong, then
don't
pay anything. Don't raise your voice, don't talk with indignant " I'm American !" tones. Just stand your ground,
calmly, don't be nervous, again, as long as you have done nothing wrong. But, if
they say we have to take you to jail, tell them okay. When you get there ask
them to call the U.S. Embassy (809.221.2171/24-hour help). Once they know you
are not going to cave, and are not scared, they will wave you
along. Now, every situation is different. I'm not telling you to take a
bullet if you feel threatened. Each situation has to be handled on a
case-by-case basis. Just know that you don't have to take any
bullshit. Okay? Done. Until soon, The

Loose Ends
In my never-ending quest to find about
all things Dominican, I came across a blog that is dedicated to the Dominican
Transgendered
population. As the Transgendered
population is even more marginalized than gay population at-large, I think this
is a great project to bring about some dignity and respect. Also, while reading the blog, I
found out that the
Metropolitan Community
Church
has started Sunday services at
ASA
(Amigos Siempre Amigos). According to the post, the
services are open to the entire gay
community. Beautifulmag , a European blog, has an
interesting article called, " The Real
Beauty of Men, According to Ernest Montgomery . As regular readers to the blog know, I'm a big Ernest
Montgomery fan. And I'm an even bigger fan of his photography. Now, if he would
only let me come over and "help" more. The
New York Times
had a really nice piece the other day about
Robinson
Cano , New York Yankees player. He
is trying to buy an ambulance for his hometown of San Pedro de Marcoris. But, he
doesn't make the millions that other Dominican players make, but he is trying to
do his part. And. He ain't bad on the eyes, if you know what I mean.
Kudos!! Another interesting article I came across is about justice, or
the lack thereof, in Latin America. There is a special blurb about the
Dominican
Republic . Two-thirds of the
prisoners in Dominican jails have not been charged with a crime, tried or
convicted. They use what is called "preventive custody." I love that term. It
basically means you are going to stay in jail until we decide (or your family
comes up with enough money) you should get out. And you thought your life was
difficult. Keeping with the theme above, White Sox player,
Juan
Uribe , is now in the clear. He was
being investigated for shooting 2 people. I wonder how he got out of the country
and didn't have to go into "preventive custody?"

Odds and Ends
The
Miami Herald
newspaper has an extraordinary series they're doing on growing influence of
Afro-Latin Americans. The first two installments are out. There is an article on
Dominicans
entitled, " Black Denial ." There is
a
video
link. Very interesting series, indeed. There are two more articles to come,
which will cover
Brazil
and
Cuba . I think I smell a Pulitzer Prize for this
series. There is a great
graphic
of the route and the number of
slaves brought from Africa, and to which countries they
were taken. ( Link
for the article en Espanol.) Carrying the theme for a bit longer. I
recently ran across the website for
Ruth Ocumarez . She is the first woman of
predominantly African heritage (her words) to win the Miss Dominican Republic
title. Where as the issue above is "black denial," Ms. Ocumarez is known as the
Ebony Goddess . As I was just really
exploring the DR, I was shocked that there had been no one like her before (or
since). Things are changing, not fast enough for some, but they are
changing.
Listin
Diario , the well-respected newspaper of the
Dominican Republic , came out with an
editorial
against Gays frolicking about on
TV. They just find it unseemly, especially with children of impressionable ages
watching. Very interesting, because it does seem to be a lot of gay people on
TV. At least, they seem Gay to me. I'm not quite sure how they would classify
themselves, but ... The next time you are
driving
in the DR, you should
make sure to
NOT
run a red-light. But to
show the seriousness of government, they are detaining some people for 6 hours
for them to attend some type of class. I'm not sure how this will pertain to
foreigners. But hey, just don't go through red lights and all should be
fine. For those who have been looking for information on Dominican
artists, check out this link:

Great source of information. As ever, The

There are 5 Gold's Gyms in the
Dominican Republic . At which location do you think you
could find this man working his magic? He only charges RD$500 pesos (app. $15 U.S.) for

Happy Anniversary
It is not enough to
succeed. Others must fail. -- Gore Vidal The
Monaga Blog
is now 2 years old. Two years of stories, drama, news and information, and my take on the DR. Can't believe
when I started it was really going to be a way for friends to keep in touch with
how I was doing here. I had no plan about what I wanted it to be, or where I
thought it was heading. So, here we are 2 years later, and I still have no plan
or know where it is heading. But as long as I enjoy the journey I will keep it
up. Thanks to all of have encouraged me on this journey. Now, let's see ... what should I write about next?

The latest edition of
FREE
Magazine
is out (though the website hasn't been updated yet!) and they have
a great layout on the Dominican Republic. The photos, taken by photographer
Hassan
Kinley , are beautiful and evoke the essence that is La Republica
Dominicana. All the models are local Dominican talent, except for the absolutely
gorgeous (and extremely nice)
Miguel Perdomo , who is a Dominican from the
States. The whole production was supervised by
Ernest
Montgomery . As someone who was a groupie at different times
during the shoot, I can attest to the hard work that goes into being beautiful
in magazines. It ain't easy. But, then someone has to be beautiful. Right? I
hung out with the crew at the cockfight, but honestly, all I did was drink beer
and watch bags. The sight of "cocks" that lost was not pretty. But, then beauty
is not a pretty business. There is also a story on
Mario Cabral , who is
the owner of several restaurants (one being Aura), lounges and the exclusive
Praia
club in Santo
Domingo. I love the opening blurb of the piece: Mario Cabral can be found one afternoon quietly
sitting in one of his restaurants in the Dominican Republic and the next day can
be seen walking Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. From the Caribbean to the cold,
from business to business, and plane to plane, this is the life of a
30-year-old Dominican entrepreneur. Isn't it great being young,
wealthy and Dominican!

Sunday was such a beautiful day.
Tyson ,
Gerardo
and I went out just driving around. Went to the mall so Tyson could
exchange a blender. Then decided to go to the flea market that takes place on
the Malecon (about 20 minutes west of the Colonial Zone). Gerardo had been
telling me about this place for months. He knows that I am always looking for
things to write about for the blog. Every weekend he would tell me we should get
up at 6:30am to go. That is when the most people and items are there. I like the
blog and all,
BUT , I'm not getting up at
6:30 on a Sunday morning to trek out to a flea market. Flea markets here
are very down-market. Where in the States everyone -- whatever your station in
life -- goes to the flea market in search of a bargain. By the time we got there
most people were starting to pack up and leave. There was a ton of garbage. From
what I can tell they sell mostly clothes, used and new. But there was also tons
of gadgets, bootleg movies, electric razors, and the like. What I would love to
see more would have been some art, furniture, etc. I'm told that they do
come , BUT , you have to get there real
early. Okay, maybe one day. But certainly not one day soon. After that,
we start driving back to home and we stop to look through the fence at the
motorcylce race that was taking place on the Malecon. Quite a big crowd there. Dominicans love
racing cars, bikes, you name it. As we were there looking at this we then notice
across the street is a place selling plants. Tyson just got the cutest apartment
and it has a huge deck that is filled with plants and he wants to add to the
collection. I even purchased two huge potted palms. Getting all the plants
back was a chore. They couldn't all fit in the car, and my potted palms are over
7 feet. I told Tyson and Gerardo to go ahead, I will call a taxi and get a van. Well, you
would've thought that I asked for a private plane. But as I waited for Tyson and
Gerardo to come back, I get a phone call from my friend
David B ., asking if I was still coming by to
see
Vicki 's new apartment and partake of
some Sunday grub. The answer was yes, of course, but I had a potted palm problem
that needed to be taken care of first. David promptly came over with his SUV and
off we went. Vicki just moved into a beautiful apartment not one block
from the Malecon. She is on a high floor with a view of the
sea . We ate and
enjoyed the breeze coming off the Caribbean.
David Lee
was there, rested and relaxed. I keep telling David to blog something so everyone will know he is happy and fine. David, how about it? After chatting and catching up with everyone, we
then made it on home, where I proceeded to take a nap. Only to be awakened by
some fierce thunder and rain. The only thing that could've made this day better would
have been if I were at the 50th annual
Puerto Rican Day Parade
in NYC. Oh, the
memories from parades past! What a Sunday. Just chilling and hanging out with good people.
It doesn't get any better than that. Let's hope the rest of the week can live up
to this great Sunday. And how was your weekend?

U.S. Passport Regulations
Because of a huge backlog of passport
applications, the U.S. State Dept. is suspending the need to have a passport to
travel in the Western Hemisphere (Caribbean, Canada, Mexico). BUT, this only
applies to those who have applied for a passport. If you have
NOT
applied for a passport, you will still have
a problem. But, for those who have applied for a passport, you can travel to the
Dominican Republic with a driver's license and the receipt you got when you
applied for your passport. This regulation is suspended until the end of
September. It seems that the U.S. Govt. didn't take into account how this
new regulation would throw the whole passport situation into disarray. It can
now take up to 12 weeks to get your passport. For more information click
here .

Now, Where Were We?
Since the last time we chatted it seems that
most of the tourists have left town, and things are turning back to normal. I
guess the next big surge will occur around July 4th holiday.
Been getting quite
a bit of rain lately. Didn't really affect the capital to much, but some of the
rural areas got battered pretty badly. Some towns are still struggling to get back on their feet.
Today (June 7), is
a holiday here.
Corpus Christi
Day . Most things will be closed today,
and quite a few people will be using it for the start of a nice long weekend. I
never know when the holidays are coming. I always find out about them the day
before. I need a Dominican calendar. All the buzz was that there would not be a
curfew last night. NOT!
Last Saturday
night,
CHA 's was robbed.
Don't know all the details, but it seems that 4 guys slipped in with the regular
crowd, and later robbed the cashier, while roughing someone up. Many stories are
going around, but it was a little item in one of the newspapers. One of the guys
was/is in the military. He was caught. Will try and find out more
information. One of the models
Paul Culver
shot
(and who I have on the
Monaga
site) is
fea tured in an upcoming movie from
Enrique Cruz . I
know none of the people who read th is blog partake of any pornograph y, but I thought I would include a picture anyway.
( The other picture below I threw in beca use he is also gorgeous )
A good fri end of the blog,
Stanley Bennett
Clay , has a new novel out. It's c all ed
Looker . It's gotten rave reviews on
Amazon ,
Barnes & Noble ,
alon g with
Clikque Magazine .
Look for it in a bookstore near you. There is a new service for those who
want to save money on airline tickets. It's called
Yapta . You sign-up for this service and when you go to travel
sites, like
Expedia
and such,
it will alert you when the fare goes down. Another cool service they have is
that if you have already purchased a ticket, you can put in the
confirmation
number to the site. If the airfare drops it alerts you and tells you how to get
a refund or voucher. Very interesting
site
and could be revolutionary. I don't know if many
of you read the message boards on
DR1 ? But, they can
be very informative. One of the topics that is really hot now is the crime
problem. More specifically, as it relates to foreigners living here. There have
been some brazen robberies on the Northcoast at hotels. Truth be told, there
have been some brazen robberies in Santo Domingo, too. I know several apts. and
businesses that have been robbed. So much for the curfew curbing the crime
problem. Personally, I still feel safe. Crime can (and DOES!) happen anywhere,
so I just stay careful. And if you're visiting here, you should
too. Byron
has finally posted his last entry, but more importantly, he cleared up some misconceptions about his new baby. We'll miss the blogging, Byron. Until soon, The
