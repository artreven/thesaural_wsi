These bloodsuckers have been altered to have shorter lifespans. Actually the modified Aedes aegypti in question are not bloodsuckers.
From the AFP article: In the first experiment of its kind in Asia, about 6,000
male
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were released
...
Like Homo sapiens, only the
females
drain the life out of their victims.
The male Aedes aegypti only feed on plant juices (but I'm guessing pass the short lifespan trait on more effectively).

Male mosquito's cannot drink blood, females of some mosquito species require a meal of blood in order to lay eggs. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito#Feeding_habits_of_adults
[wikipedia.org] "Both male and female mosquitoes are nectar feeders, but the females of many species are also capable of drinking blood from many mammals. Females do not require blood for their own survival, but they do need supplemental substances such as protein and iron to develop eggs. With regard to host location, carbon dioxide and organic substances produced from the host, humidity, and optical recognition play important roles. In Aedes the search for a host takes place in two phases. First, the mosquito exhibits a nonspecific searching behavior until the perception of host stimulants then it follows a targeted approach.[14] Most mosquito species are crepuscular (dawn or dusk) feeders. During the heat of the day most mosquitoes rest in a cool place and wait for the evenings, although they may still bite if disturbed. Some species, like Asian tiger mosquito, are known to fly and feed during daytime. Both male and female are nectar feeders. Mosquitoes are adept at infiltration and have been known to find their way into residences via deactivated air conditioning units.[15] Prior to and during blood feeding, they inject saliva into the bodies of their source(s) of blood. This saliva serves as an anticoagulant: without it, the female mosquito's proboscis would quickly become clogged with blood clots. Female mosquitoes hunt their blood host by detecting carbon dioxide (CO2) and 1-octen-3-ol from a distance. Mosquitoes of the genus Toxorhynchites never drink blood.[16] This genus includes the largest extant mosquitoes, the larvae of which prey on the larvae of other mosquitoes. These mosquito eaters have been used in the past as mosquito control agents, with varying success.[17]"

This is an early experiment, they plan to recapture most of these mosquitoes, presumably to study whether this shorter lifespan is effective in avoiding dengue fever before they start spreading the genetic modification amongst the mosquito population and have them biting people.

Dunno, in order to do that you need to release not 6000 but 6000000 the way they did it with screwworm flies in the south of the USA (and continue in Latin America). The screwworm control method is to release flies sterilised through radiation by the truckload so that most eggs are from at least one sterile parent so they do not hatch - hence no screwworm damage to lifestock. Year after a year after a year until there is no more screwworm fly (USA in 1982). So there is a scientific basis for this, just clearly not enough mosquitoes being released.

Interestingly wolbachia can only be transmitted vertically (ie. from mother to offspring).
Infected females produce more offspring than uninfected females, and if an uninfected female mates with an infected male then some or all of her eggs will die.

AFAIK, female mosquito only mate once, and aggressively fend off further attempts by males (insert joke about marriage here).
So I'm not sure that the length of the males lifespan would be all that critical to whether or not he gets to mate.
The length of the female lifespan, on other hand, would be a bit more important, since they tend to lay at least 2 or 3 batches of eggs. Long story short, I don't actually have a solid answer for ya, but it's wrong to assume that length of life is directly proportional

IAABiologist, and what will most likely happen is that their experiment will die off without affecting the rest of the population. The actual process of disabling or excising a gene would probably take a while, TBH; it's way more likely that evolution will simply select against the released mosquitoes. In order to win, Malaysia would have to replace all of the males in the population, which is just silly, or give their mosquitoes some advantage, like breeding more aggressively (which is how our favourite examples of humans screwing with ecosystems, alien invasive species, become invasive.) But that's not even compatible with their goal!
What they really need to do is to poison the food supply: vaccinate humans with something that targets mosquitoes only.

Shorter-lived mosquitoes have a much smaller chance of doing both.

Or failing that, modify them so that the females quickly die after first exposure to dengue? I'm not really sure that creating a mosquito that lives fast, dies young, and leaves a beautiful corpse really helps with the "not spreading disease" goal... Current gene modification technology basically works by breaking things and looking and what that did. They got a fully functional mosquito that dies faster than the time it takes to infect people on average... they reproduce it in captivity and flood the area with these guys hoping that this will make a significant dent in the rate of infection. Your idea would require technology beyond what people are currently capable of. It would be awesome, but so would jetpacks that suck in mosquitoes for fuel .

What they really need is a genetic modification that leaves the male mosquitos essentially unaltered, but causes the females to have a shortened lifespan, ideally unable to reach sexual maturity.
GM males would continue to compete with normal males for surviving females; each successful mating by a GM male would produce a new generation of GM males to continue the process, but all females of that generation would die before ever having a chance to bite a human or breed.

Dengue is not a human disease. It is a mosquito disease that affects humans. An infected mosquito transmits the virus to her offspring, so it doesn't matter how fast the "turnover" of the colony is, you will still have dengue carrying mosquitoes if the infected parent is allowed to lay eggs. I am assuming that these mosquitoes do survive to lay eggs, otherwise what would be the point of "releasing them" in the first place?
In fact if anything, this could speed up the spread of dengue throughout humans (and mosquitoes) by increasing the amount of eggs laid/time due to the shorter life cycle and thus the population of dengue-infected mosquitoes. Someone hasn't thought this through. If you're going to play god, at least make sure you've considered all the possibilities (including the ones you don't like) first.

Huh? Dengue is very much a human disease. Mosquitoes are a
vector , that is to say a species which can spread the virus among a population of another species. I'm not sure about this specific virus, but there are many cases (especially among plant viruses) where insects can act as a vector for a virus without their cells actually being infected (for example, virus particles can be present in the saliva or stylet of an insect and can be passed to another host much in the same way that sharing unsterilized ne

And yes, IAAB (biologist), and I do have some virology training.
And I'm a physician and I have medical training. Dengue can be transmitted vertically from mosquito to mosquito without the need of humans at all. Therefore we are merely a reservoir for the virus, not a vector. At no time is a human necessary for viral replication if mosquitoes are available - this differentiates dengue from all other mosquito borne parasites/viruses. This is what I meant by "not a human disease". Of course it affects humans

I know the comments so far follow the easy pattern -- either "what could possibly go wrong, lol" and "doesn't evolution kinda favor *longer* lives?"

Dengue Fever
[wikipedia.org] is some serious stuff.
It's called "break-bone fever" for a reason -- the muscle and joint pain is debilitating, and lasts for weeks or months.
It's one of those things that keeps poor communities impoverished -- each person infected requires care-giving, taking two or three healthy people out of the economy for every one infected. There's no vaccine, and nothing on the way until 2015 at least -- like many tropical diseases, there's more money to be made from lengthening a rich white guy's m@nh00d than there is in lengthening a poor brown woman's life. So as leery as I am of making random modifications to the DNA of an uncontrollable pest... I can at least understand the motivation.

Dengue hurts like hell. I've had it twice, and can tell you it's no fun. Still, it doesn't matter what people say: it's not a deadly disease if controlled in time.

Even a small flu can kill a kid in those situations. However, a genetic modification could modify the ecosystem. It's a hard decision, so we'l

In California we release many thousands of sterile male Medflies at the first sign of an infestation. This has been remarkably successful in protecting valuable crops. The dollar value of these crops is well known. What is the dollar value of human lives and health? If that were clearly understood, perhaps more effort would go into eradication of dengue and malaria.
