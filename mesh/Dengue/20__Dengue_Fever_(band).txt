McCain Names Veep Candidate
It's Sarah Palin, Governor of Alaska! According to
Wikipedia , she was a journalism major in college, the 1984 runner-up in the Miss Alaska pageant, a sports reporter, a city council member of Wasilia from 1992 to 1996, and then mayor of Wasilia until her election as governor in 2006.
Judging from those previous positions, she might be the least qualified vice-presidential candidate in American history. Photo: David Fischer

Hest Fest at Lincoln Center
You just can't keep
Charlton Heston
down. He died in April, but this coming week, when his beloved Republicans will be convening in Minneapolis, he'll be the subject of a Lincoln Center tribute. I found much of Heston's politics to be despicable, but at times he did stand up for civil rights and appear in numerous films noteworthy for their artistry and/or camp value. So it's appropriate that the program at the
Walter Reade Theater
includes the "classic"
Touch of Evil
as well as the camp classics
Soylent Green ,
Planet of the Apes , and
Beneath the Planet of the Apes . Also programmed:
Major Dundee ,
Ben-Hur
and
El Cid
(supposedly a stunning widescreen accomplishment) as well as
Will Penny ,
The Omega Man ,
The Greatest Show on Earth , and, um,
Earthquake
( not
in
Sensurround , alas). A lot of films are not included (no
The Ten Commandments !), but I think the most regrettable omission is
The Naked Jungle , which deliciously mixes the artful and the campy in a Buñuelesque tale of an uptight couple and a marauding swarm of killer ants!!! I still haven't found YouTube video of
The Naked Jungle , so you'll just have to settle for this view of New York City in the year 2022. Source

New BAT Challenge, Plus Results!
In the latest
BAT Challenge , it turns out that only
Deborah
had Barack Obama's ear. Articulate and bright and clean and nice-looking, she picked Joe Biden as Obama's ticket mate and did better than I or any other contestant, earning two points in the process. 16 Debbie (Gold Medal and Attendance Award plus unredeemed Silver Medal and
WWI?
and Bronze Medal credits, plus February 2008
WWI?
credit and a March 2008 redeemable point; includes two bonus points) 16 Gary (Silver Medal plus

credits) 8 Deborah
(includes bonus point) 6 Ellen (includes bonus point) 3 David (Bronze Medal) 2 Daniela 2 Dolph (Bronze Medal) 1 bellj 1 Luke N. Atmaguchi (also has April 2008 redeemable point) 1 Myron 1 Trapezia Debbie
and
Gary
and
Scott
can still send in their own photos. Due to federal "equal time" laws, this week's challenge is another
CHOOSE THE VEEP! 1. Name the person who will soon be named as John McCain's running mate.
2. People say that McCain will make the announcement on Friday, August 29—his 72nd birthday. But of course the news could be announced or leaked sooner. Guess when the info will get out—but you can't guess 8/xx on 8/xx. (You'd have to do it on 8/xx-1 at the latest.) In the case of a tie regarding the date, the first correct guess will take, um, precedence. The top scorer(s) will get a point. Anyone who does better than I do gets a point for that. Anyone can play, leaving guesses in the
comments
section using a distinct moniker so everyone can tell everyone from everyone else. (Remember: There's only one Luke N. Atmaguchi.) Enjoy!

Last Weekend for
Playing the Building
As you might've guessed from the header, you've got only two more afternoons to visit and participate in
David Byrne's
Playing the Building . I finally took the plunge yesterday accompanied by
the wonderful Deborah Grumet and her two wonderful daughters . For
Playing the Building , Byrne wired an organ keyboard to a bunch of sound-making devices spaced apart within a large, decrepit room of the old
Battery Maritime Building
(conveniently located near the
Governors Island
ferry). Visitors who sign a waiver can enter the edifice, play the instrument, and listen to others play the instrument.
What I liked best about the experience was going inside the building and taking in the external and internal views: dormant gangways, peeling paint, shadowed corridors, doors to nowhere, still-attractive glasswork above, mysterious basketball markings on one portion of the floor.
I also liked the musical element, but it left something to be desired. Byrne's contraption enables participants to produce at least three types of sound: keys to the left of the participant produce soft "bass" sounds from overhead motors; keys in the center produce hoarse, higher-pitched pipe sounds; keys to the right produce crisp clanking. The best place to hear the sounds is, I believe, in the center of the room, but the organ is perhaps a quarter or a third of the way in. So if you're performing on the organ, it's harder than it ought to be to hear many of the sounds and fully appreciate the surround-sound effect one gets from being centrally located. Compounding this problem is the fact that the line to participate is between the entryway and the organ (at least it was when we were there), so that one has to be off the line and off the organ to "hear the room" to its best advantage. People tended to play the pipes and motors, producing eery hums and whistles, but I wanted to try using the pipes and motors as drones while producing kinetic rhythms using the right side of the keyboard, an approach that might work best with more than person at the keyboard so that one person could work the rhythms while another worked the drones. For something more elaborate than that, one could try to get people to sing and/or contribute other sounds from other places in the room. I think very highly of Byrne, but I still wonder how others might rig up the building. Given enough time, I could probably come up with a bunch of names...but at the moment the one that suggests itself is
Peter Schickele, a.k.a. P.D.Q. Bach . I think he'd have a field day building on the concept with humor as well as musicality. And he might be good at suggesting others who'd be good at playing with it. Here's some guy at the organ. Here's the wiring at the back of the organ. Looks like Byrne's Science Fair Project. Here's the wiring that extends to the skylight. And here's a video about the project. The sound of the music on the video is more "present" (less faint) than what I heard most of the time when I was there. Stay tuned to the video to see other parts of the building that are harder to access. Source

The Waterfalls
Okay, so maybe
Olafur Eliasson's
The New York City Waterfalls
really does pale in comparison with those "saffron"
Gates
of some years back. That doesn't mean one can't get
something
out of them. And just like
The Gates
got people to explore a somewhat untrafficked zone of New York City (Central Park in the winter), so can
The Waterfalls
get people to do very much the same thing.
So far I've gotten the most out of viewing
The Waterfalls
from two "unusual" vantage points. One is
Governors Island , which has been a wonderful "must-see" weekend destination throughout this summer. From Governors Island you can see one waterfall up close ( left ) and also view all four in roughly one glance, appreciating the different ways the water appears to flow.
That was good, but I have to say that the
entire
Governors Island experience overshadowed the
Waterfalls
experience. My very favorite
Waterfalls
experience so far—something that compared favorably with
The Gates —involved walking downtown on a hot night. BAT (and GFNYC) fan Ellen and I ambled through
Chinatown
and discovered a street fair, some dark and mysterious alleyways, and a crowd of women doing a kind of Asian "alley cat" dance in a public park as we wandered to
the shore of the East River by the Manhattan Bridge . Once we got to the walkway, we joined a smattering of people including fishers (no relation) chilling out in view of some of the waterfalls, which were illuminated and fascinating to behold. Suddenly, the work made a lot more sense to me.
Eliasson
is, after all, known for his use of artificial light, which was fully in play around 9pm—though not at each waterfall. (And, if you are unthrilled by the industrial look of the structures, you'll be pleased to find that they are less visible at night.) Give the Chinatown walk and East River vantage point a try, especially if there are any more steamy nights left before
The Waterfalls
runs dry on October 13. And try to take advantage of the visiting hours at Governors Island, too. Photo: David Marc Fischer

Shakespeare in the Park with
Hair
Shakespeare in the Park's
Hair
isn't Shakespeare, but it is very good theater. The production takes the patchwork sprawl of the iconic '60s musical and transforms it into a magical, moving experience using the well-channeled energy of its talented ensemble.
I'd seen the Spring 2001 Encores! revival and
the movie version
(substantially rewritten by Michael Weller), but this ediiton (reworked by
original co-writer James Rado ) seemed almost completely new and fresh, a quilt of skits, parodies, and avant-garde theatrics tied together by threads of plot and character development. Here and there I would have liked the stage action to have given more context to the songs—the action that triggers "Easy to Be Hard" didn't seem sad enough to warrant the song's somberness (see movie counter-example
here ) and "Good Morning Starshine" might have been sung too much to the audience and not enough to the Tribe, with the lyrics possibly coming across as too nonsensical (see
Idina Menzel /Encores! counter-example
here ). But the pieces still came together very well, the climactic "Let the Sun Shine In" a powerful "broken-hearted plea" (as artistic director
Oskar Eustis
put it in the program notes) made all the more touching by an awareness of how rarely it has been taken to heart over the past thirty—no,
forty —years. And
Andrew Kober
did good work in the Margaret Mead sequence. Hair 's run, originally scheduled to end in August, has been lengthened to September 14 thanks to another " Hair
extension." I would be surprised if the show didn't make it to Broadway, but of course this is an opportunity to see it free in Central Park—at a price. For most people, it takes time and effort to get the tickets. And there can be emotional costs as well. Oh yes, it's true. So here are tips on getting tickets on weekdays (especially good weather Tuesdays through Thursdays). Keep in mind that, as the run continues, the recommended times will probably tend to be earlier and earlier. You can join a
"virtual line"
for one or two tickets per person every performance day until the 1:00pm cut-off time—don't count on getting those tickets, though.
Currently the best time to get in
the morning line
for one or two tickets per person seems to be before 8:00am; the earlier you get there, the better off you will be. The ticket distribution takes places around 1:00pm. The current best time to get in
the standby line
for
one ticket per person
is before 4:00pm—there is no cutting in this line, so if you show up after your partner(s), the best thing to do is suck it up immediately and go to wherever the back of the line happens to be. (If you wait and then someone narcs on you, then you'll probably end up much farther back in the line.) Don't expect to get a standby ticket until the last minute, so bring your own victuals or be ready to get some from a vendor or the concessions stand or get something delivered from a nearby deli. (Security mentions one deli in particular.) You can probably expect some passersby to offer a spare ticket, or you
might
be able to get the consent to replace someone who leaves the line (after that person gives up on the line, accepts a giveaway ticket, or moves back in the line to be with a latecomer) on a
one-for-one
basis, but don't count on either contingency actually occurring! I have to say that the pain involved in getting tickets for these free events is a major downside for me. Last night, for instance, I ended up being a very conflicted "hall monitor" on the standby line. Out of the people immediately in front of me, one woman was joined by another woman, and then (if memory serves) a guy was joined by about five family members. That's when I piped up, said I hated being a hardass, and went over the no-cutting, one person/one ticket rule. The guy very nicely explained that he'd be moving with his family to the back of the line anyway, but the two women stuck together...and then the woman in front of me said that someone would be joining
her .
Much closer to curtain time—at a point when Security people had finally started showing up and explaining the policy to everyone on the line—I reluctantly confronted the two women again, and they eventually wound up going away, blaming me for ruining peoples' evenings. By this time, the woman's companion had finally arrived and cut in front of the
mass
of people who had arrived before him, including the family that had moved back. He too was furious at me—but it turned out that he was able to qualify for a one-for-one place exchange with one of the women who went away. (I immediately realized that the women who left might have been able to take advantage of the one-for-one exchange because of the guy who had moved back to be with his family, but by then they were long gone.) I did get support from some people around me, but it was still upsetting to play the role of The Man (especially for
Hair !) and be the target of so much anger from people. And it turned out that it was all in vain anyway, because the cut-off point for the tickets was
just
in front of all of us. So ultimately
none
of us were close enough to the front of the line to get a ticket. I did get in, though, because a friend who'd arrived earlier but had already seen the show decided to give me his ticket. So I guess I'm not totally unlikeable. (Thanks, Steve!) Anyway, I wish the line systems at Shakespeare in the Park and the Met could be improved to avoid that kind of conflict and pain. It just sucks to leave the people in line to play such a big role in enforcing the strict rules. There's got to be a better way. Handing out place tickets in the order of arrival might be the best strategy.

Rent Stabilization 2008
Each year I try to take a look at the state of rent stabilization so I can better understand how it's doing. My conclusion is that this is a worse-than-average year for tenants, especially those with rents under $1000/month.
The increases [PDF]
are higher-than-average—and in some cases they're record-setting for the past twenty years. As of October 1, 2008, the basic rent increases for apartments where the tenant pays for the heat is 4.5% for a one-year lease and 8.5% for a two-year lease. (Knock off 0.5% for tenants who pay for their own heat.) However, for long-term tenants (6 years or more) whose rent is less than $1,000, the increase for a heat-included apartment is a flat $45 for a one-year lease or $85 for a two-year lease. That means a $750/month rent would go up 6% on a one-year lease and 11.33% on a two-year lease.
(Note that there are distinction regarding the circumstances of the tenants and the size and quality of the apartment. A shabby $750/month studio would get the same increase as a well-maintained $750/month three-bedroom apartment.) Let's go for the historical perspective.
According to my records, the basic one-year increase of 4.5% has been met or exceeded only five times since 1988: 2003 (4.5%), 1996 (5%), 1990 (4.5%), 1989 (5.5%), and 1988 (6%). But if you're a longtime tenant with a rent lower than $750, it would be the highest increase for that period. Also according to my records, to find a higher rate than the basic two-year increase of 8.5%, you'd have to go back to 1988 and 1989 (9% each). If you're a longtime tenant with a rent lower than, say, approximately $940, there's a good chance you've got what would be an increase higher than anything in that period. The basic one-year increase of 4.5% is 40.625% higher than the average one-year increase from 1998-2007 (3.2%) and 30.435% higher than the average one-year increase from 1988-2007 (3.45%). The basic two-year increase of 8.5% is 50.442% higher than the average two-year increase from 1998-2007 (5.65%) and 45.299% higher than the average two-year increase from 1988-2007 (5.85%). To reiterate: This year's increases are on the high end, particularly for longterm tenants paying rents of $750 or less, regardless of their personal circumstances and the size and condition of the apartment. I also think that it continues to be hard for tenants to figure out whether a one-year or two-year lease would be more advantageous. Anyone have a clue about that? You might think that people who complain about their stabilized rents don't appreciate how lucky they are considering the "market" rents at this time. I think it's reasonable for people who appreciate their stabilized rents to want to hold on to them as long as possible, especially if they are not independently wealthy or raking in high salaries. The faster that stabilized rents go up, the faster those rents will go off the system. People trying to slow down that process are understandably trying to preserve the system. Landlords and others who push for high increases are
both pushing the stabilized rents out of the system and increasing the rents in an arguably inflationary manner that would push the "market" rate higher.
Also on the downside for tenants: Landlords can still invest security deposits in individual low-interest bank accounts, take a cut for maintaining the accounts, and leave only a tiny (and taxable!) amount behind for their tenants. This strikes me as advantageous to banks (who benefit from the low interest rates on huge amounts of money) and landlords (who take a cut of the interest from masses of tenants) while being of no advantage for the tenants, who continue to kick in increases to their security deposits. A more equitable plan would involve the money being considered as pooled into a huge high interest account, perhaps at a rate negotiated by the city or state. In other words, a landlord with 100 $1000/month tenants theoretically opens 100 separate $1000 security deposit accounts at low interest rates commensurate with the low deposits, takes a cut of the interest for maintenance, and then leaves the rest for the tenants, who upon renewal have to kick in an additional amount to keep up with the increase in rent. Instead, the security deposits could be pooled in the equivalent of one $100,000 account, which would merit a premium interest rate. The interest gained could often if not always cover the average one-year increase of around 3.24-3.45%, precluding the need for tenants to kick in any additional amount, and also leave room for others (i.e. the landlord and/or the government) to take a cut (though I'm not sure why that would be necessary). I have no issue with the custom of landlords holding a security deposit; I just think the current system could be reformed to be better for the tenants without putting landlords at a disadvantage. Your thoughts are welcome!

Erwin Schulhoff (1894-1942)
Tomorrow will be the 66th anniversary of the death of Czech-born musician
Erwin Schulhoff , who died from tuberculosis in a Nazi concentration camp. Last year
I noted that Schulhoff had written a silent work that predated John Cage's
4'33" , and I also drew attention to some of Schulhoff's excellent, crowd-pleasing string music. This year I ask you to consider one of his more avant-garde works,
Sonata Erotica
(1919).
Jeremy Eichler
wittily called it "a sort of German Dadaist version of Meg Ryan's famous diner scene in 'When Harry Met Sally.'" Here's a performance by
Quirine Melssen , who does it from memory. Source
(5:57) And here's a different interpretation (especially in the last movement) by
Helena Remeijers Moloek , who mostly reads off the (very cool-looking) score. Source

Lincoln Center, Malcolm McDowell Salute Lindsay Anderson
Lindsay Anderson
(1923-1994) was a key figure in propelling British motion pictures into adventurous, surrealistic, WTF territory in the 1960s. His
If....
(1968), which helped moved the British boarding school drama into the age of rock 'n' roll, was also the debut of
Malcolm McDowell , whose edgy, proto-punk student Mick Travis was a forerunner of his character Alex in
A Clockwork Orange .
Over the next fourteen years Anderson and McDowell brought back Mick Travis two more times, in
O Lucky Man!
(1973) and
Britannia Hospital
(1982). The resulting Mick Travis trilogy is rarely projected in New York City, but this month you have a chance at seeing all three in order as part of the Lindsay Anderson tribute at the
Walter Reade Theater . As you can see, the key is catching

Mona Lisa (Druck)
Does anyone in America today stimulate our imaginations more than
Lisa Druck , a.k.a.
Rielle Hunter ? What secrets lie behind her enigmatic smile and distinctive gaze?? Mulling over such questions, I consulted with artist
Deborah Grumet , who responded with this modern masterpiece, known as the
Mona Lisa (Druck) .
It felt awfully good to finally join with
Marcel Duchamp ,
Salvador Dalí and Philippe Halsman ,
Andy Warhol , and the countless others who have also improved upon
Leonardo's rough original . For other examples, see
McAdam's Mona Lisa Page ,
the many Monas of Robert A. Baron , and
Mega Mona Lisa . Mona Lisa (Druck)

Deborah Grumet

Isaac Hayes (1942-2008)
Isaac Hayes
wrote some great soul music, including the Sam and Dave hits "Soul Man" and "Hold On I'm Comin'," before he became most closely identified with his own brilliantly orchestrated performance of his Oscar- and Grammy-winning "Theme from
Shaft ."
Here's how it's used in the opening of
Shaft , as Richard Roundtree makes the rounds of the old Times Square, not bothering to wait for traffic lights. Note how this sequence, directed by
Gordon Parks , anticipated John Travolta's walk through Bay Ridge to the strains of "Stayin' Alive" in
Saturday Night Fever . Also note the many location details, including an advertisement for the show
Hair . Source

Dengue Fever Performs "Tiger Phone Card"
Dengue Fever 's Cambodian-Californian musical fusion? Refreshing! I recently saw the band play a late-night gig at Joe's Pub ( right )—too bad none of those fans accepted the invitation to join the group onstage! I'm not thrilled by the Dengue Fever videos that I've seen so far on YouTube, but the audio files on
the band's MySpace page
are just fine.
Here, as the header broadly hints, is "Tiger Phone Card." I haven't been able to get it out of my head for a day or so. Source

French
Noir
Fest at Film Forum
Bruce Goldstein's exploration of French crime and suspense dramas continues this summer with a series
that kicks off with the famous heist movie
Rififi
(August 8/9) . But that's not even the high point of the festival, as far as I'm concerned. I haven't seen all of the offerings, but out of the ones I've seen, I'd say the must-sees are
the double bill
Le doulos / Classe tous risques
(August 24/25)
and
The Wages of Fear
(September 4) , which remains the all-time greatest movie about driving truckloads of nitroglycerine on bumpy roads. And there's also
Le Cercle rouge
(August 15/16) ,
Bob le flambeur
( pictured , August 17/18, on a double bill with
Touchez pas au grisbi ) ,
Eyes Without a Face
(August 27, on a double bill with
Diabolique ) , and the double bills
Breathless / Band of Outsiders
(August 31/September 1)
and
Quai des Orfèvres / Pépé le Moko
(September 3/4). The whole series seems to be very strong. I'm not sure that any of them rate less than an isolated 6.7 on IMDB. Out of what I haven't seen, the ones with the highest IMDB ratings are the charmingly titled
We Are All Murderers
(8.2, on a double bill with
Riptide
on August 18) and
Casque d'or
(8.0, on a double bill with
Goupi mains rouges
on September 2). Here are three or four amazing clips from
The Wages of Fear . If you haven't seen it, think twice before seeing anything after the first clip. Spoilers, you know. Source

The New Mel Brooks Musical Young Frankenstein
The New Mel Brooks Musical Young Frankenstein
is a very solid musical—and the "solidity" is its weakness as well as its strength. The production values are high, the music well-written, the performances professional. Most audience members should be satisfied, especially if they can take advantage of discounted tickets from sources such as
Playbill.com .
But when it comes to the laff factor—the musical's ability to live up to the high low comedy standard established by
the original
movie —that's where the show falls as short as its title is long. When I saw it on June 15 (when many of the original leads were in it,
with Jon Patrick Walker doing good understudy work as Frederick Frankenstein ), I left with a greater appreciation of the cartoonishness of the
movie
characters. In the film, Gene Wilder swung wildly between meekness and madness, Teri Garr was a deceptively ditzy sexpot, Madeline Kahn was a prissy prude, Marty Feldman was a pop-eyed Igor, Cloris Leachman a brilliantly brittle Blücher, Kenneth Mars a mechanical marvel, and so on and so forth. In contrast, the Broadway characters came across as bland, not as kooky. Musical Maven Myra has noted that at least two songs could easily be cut from the show's 160 minute running time. She seems right about that—though it's possible that the "extra" songs give the company time to change scenes. What I don't understand is why the silliness that worked so well in the movie seemed to be lost in the transition to the stage. I'm sure that the production remains very solid—"the best that money can buy"—but I hope that the producers try to juice the show by encouraging the actors to make their characters more comical. Just look at how goofy the comedy can be in this trailer—not at first, but eventually. It's enhanced by the camera work, which gives audiences a more intimate perspective than the stage (especially in the doleful glances Peter Boyle gives the camera), but there's still got to be a way to raise the comic quotient in the theater.

Name That Punctuation!
Readers of Blog About Town tend to enjoy contests and typography, so I want to make sure that all of you are aware of a punctuation-naming event at Emdashes, which is itself named after punctuation. The challenge is to come up with a name for the upside-down question mark familiar in Spanish.
So far I'm especially impressed by
Carolita Johnson 's
quiggle , which sounds delightfully naughty to me. My own suggestion is
interroflip , a spin on
interrobang .
So I suppose the upside-down exclamation mark might be called a
bangflip
or a
flipbang .

Jo Stafford (1917-2008)
One of my favorite freelance gigs involved working on liner notes for pop vocalist
par excellence
Jo Stafford . Her lovely, perfectly modulated singing endeared her to countless soldiers during World War II and topped the charts for many years. But she also had a very clever, ironic side, heard mainly in hillbilly and lounge act parodies performed by her alter-egos Cinderella G. Stump and Darlene Edwards, respectively.
Here's an example of Stafford's "serious" side, as she swings "The Gentleman is a Dope" in the 1950s. Consider listening with your eyes closed, just to concentrate on her vocal panache. Source
