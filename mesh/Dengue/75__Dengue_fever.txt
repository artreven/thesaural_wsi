I have fulfilled my greatest dreams abroad, and currently live in Paradise: also known as Railay Beach!
This blog shares stories, advice, anecdotes and hard-learned lessons from my years abroad.

Travel Thailand (Part 2): 30 Do's and Don'ts Daily Etiquette
Daily Etiquette in Thailand,
30 Do's and Don'ts: 1.) The monarchy and religion are interconnected, so gu ard your tongue and behavior with absolute respect at all times. 2.) Any image or icon of the King & royal family are treasured, and anything with the King's face should neve r be dropped or stepped on (including money.) 3.)
Criticizing the royal family is illegal , and will serve you a lifetime or 2 of a prison sentence. 4.) Whenever the National and/or Roy al anthem are played, pay respect to the image of the King by standing straight, still and remaining silent. Everything stops during the anthems.
This happens in city streets all over usually at 8 am and again at 6 pm. This happens also in the cinemas before any film is played. 5.)
When visiting temples dress conservatively , always. Some temples in Bangkok will deny you entry if you're not dressed appropriately, other temples in the countryside won't. Part of the 'saving face' concept means that even if you're causing offence or embarrassment to yourself or the locals, Thai people will never inform you of your wrong-doing. Cover the shoulders, wear knee-length or longer, and always take off your shoes before entering any
temple buildings. 6.) Buddha images and revered objects include statues, hand prints or footprints, jewelry or icons once worn or associated with Buddha & amulets. These are always lifted off the ground, on altars. The m ain Buddha image is always in the main hall of a temple, where people come to pray and pay respect to Buddha. Always sit in front of him, keep your head below his to show respect.
Keep yo ur feet tucked under or behind you away from the Buddha image , since your feet (the dirtiest part of your body) pointed at anyone is considered rude.
7.) If you take pictures of Buddha, do so from a seated position, and never pose in front of one.
Never touch any of the Buddha images , and certainly don't climb up on one.
8.)
Women never touch a monk , (a special, time consuming cleansing ceremony is required if ever a monk is accidentally brushed up upon.) If women would like to make an offering to a monk, it should be placed within reach of the monk , or on a special cloth and placed in the alms 'offering' bowl t hat's part of their daily attire.
9.) Never step on the threshold of a building (the raised wooden step in the doorway). In temples and homes as well, a spirit guards the doorway of every building, and stepping on the threshold is the ultimate disrespect. Step over it.
10.)
Do make a small donation after visiting temples .
It's good karma for you and a good gesture of faith for the locals. 11.) Feet are the lowest, dirtiest part of your body. Never put your feet up on a chair or bench, and
never point your feet at peopl e . If for some reason you do need to climb on a chair or seat, take your shoes off first. 12.)
Always take your shoes off
before entering a home, since traditionally Thais eat, sleep and entertain on the floo r. To keep the floor clean, there is usually a washing bucket nearby the house entrance to wash your feet in before entering. 13.) Some businesses or guesthouses also request 'shoes off', your cue will be whether there's a rack of shoes left of the entrance or not.
14.)
Never step over people , and if being fed or napping on a mat on the floor take your shoes off first. If eating or sitting in a
group setting, be conscious of your feet placement, keep them tucked away 'temple style.' 15.) Never use your feet as extra hands: don't close doors with feet, don't point with your toes & don't stomp on something if it blows away. 16.)
Never touch the heads of others
(even if in a playful manner like ruffling hair.) This is an insult. 17.) Don't sit on pillows meant for heads. 18.) Don't touch a Thai person's amulet necklace, the Buddha image is considered highly revered and should only be handled by the owner. 19.) If someone 'wais' a greeting to you, always bow and 'wai' back unless it's from a small child where a small nod will suffice. 20.)
"Sawat dee kaa" if you're female, "Sawat dee kup" if you're male
is 'hello' and always welcomed with a smile. 21.) Public displays of affection are uncomfortable in any culture. PDA in cities outside of big cities like Bangkok and Chiang Mai are rude and inappropriate, especially for the older generations. 22.)
Don't shake hands with the left hand , the left hand is unofficially known as 'the wiping hand. 23.) Nude sunbathing is never OK, considering that most of Thailand's
5% Muslim population
lives in the Southern islands.
24.) Walking around towns shirtless or in skimpy singlets is also inappropriate. (*Something I saw today: Walking in a mall wearing a sarong as a dress is NOT OK!*) I know it's hot, but suck it up. Light loose layers (cotton tunics are best) and shower 2 or 3 times a day, just as the locals do. 25.)
Don't throw toilet paper down any western or squat toilet , use the bin nearby to dispose. (Use the hose first to clean, the paper should just be for drying.) 26.) Think consciously of supporting children selling flowers or food on the streets. Where do they come from? What's their story? 27.)
Do Not Ride an Elephant ! The treatment of elephants in the tourism industry is cruel and abusive, visit Elephant Nature Park
and support a conservation project instead. You'll have more fun here, I guarantee it. 28.)
Ping Pong shows
and sex shows are usually women who have been illegally trafficked and enslaved by mob bosses...please treat these shows as forced prostitution. 29.) If visiting the hill tribe minority groups, please respect their animist beliefs.
Do not take photos without asking permission first , many of the elders believe they will lose their soul to a flash in a camera. 30.) If visiting villages with totem-like poles, altars or sacred objects dangling from trees these are religious symbols that can not be touched. Ask first before touching or posing for photos. Last Minute Extra Survival Tips!! Visas:
If arriving by plane you get 30 days upon arrival automatically for most countries, if you cross a land border you only get 15 days. You can only apply for a 60 day tourist visa outside of Thailand. Multiple entries, and multipes visas are available for free right now, enquire at your local consulate. Health:
Take serious precaution against mosquitoes.
Dengue Fever
and Malaria are mosquito borne viruses that are life-threatening. I've had Dengue Fever once already and it nearly killed me...I wish that upon no one! Purchase health/travel insurance, I'm a personal fan of
STA Travel's
plan.
Update your standard immunizations: Hepatitis A & B, Tetanus boosters and Typhoid. Yellow Fever is not required. Don't drink the tap water (ice served in restos OK), invest in a water purifier or bottled water. Watch your food and make sure meat is always properly cooked before consuming. Safety:
Most crimes and murders in Thailand are 'crimes of passion.' So be careful who you mess around with! The Police have a foreigner friendly
emergency number 1155
(similar to our 911) use any public phone for free and the operators speak English.
Currency:
Access to cash is best. Debit machines are widely available at 7-11s and markets. Credit cards are also accepted, but not widely used outside of stores or boutique shops. Currency exchange locations and banks are widely available, as well as money transfers like Western Union should an emergency arise. Tipping is not common, but leaving behind small change leftover from a paid bill is a polite gesture. Drugs:
Trafficking of drugs is not taken lightly. Life prison sentences are paid out, without bail without a trial jury and the conditions inside of a Thai jail are less than desired with physical abuse and violence common. Some trafficking offences even warrant the death penalty, only pardoned by the King. Don't be an idiot here. Scams:
Don't be a sucker for fake gems and jewelry. General rule, don't accept offers of free shopping or sightseeing from strangers, commissions are being made on your behalf.
Gem scams in Bangkok
have become notorious. TRAVEL THAILAND (PART 1): Intro to Thai Culture Any more tips about etiquette and travel friendly advice I'm missing? Please share! For further reading, especially about Health and Pre-Travel Planning I recommend
