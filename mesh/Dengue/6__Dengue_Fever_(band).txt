for all those recently passed, and those they left behind
everyone’s right and no one is sorry
that’s the start and the end of this story
from the sharks and the jets
to the call in the morning
everyone’s right and no one is sorry
that’s the start and the end of this story
from the sharks and the jets
to the call in the morning
and life is just bets anyway
look alive, see these bones
what you are now, we were once
try as they might, no one’s immune to
misfiring and acting on the wrong clues
and thinkin’ it’s time to redo and redo
i feel rain in the movies and the talk before the screen lights
i hear strings in the park
i don’t like to call her right, except when its too late at night
i mostly just think in the dark
look alive, see these bones
what you are now, we were once
just like we are, you’ll be dust
and just like we are, permanent
you were too tired to eat, too hungry to sleep
just imagine the speed, it’s just what you need
look alive, see these bones
what you are now, we were once
and just like we are, you’ll be dust
and just like we are, permanent
the lights in the city are more or less blinking
which side of the story decides what you’re thinking
warm arms and cold faces
we’re squinting, we’re hurrying
we’ll take inventory
we’re digging, we’re burying
do you remember when the line was blown
do you remember when it fell
do you remember when you went to her house, remember ringing the bell
look alive, see these bones
what you are now, we were once
just like we are, you’ll be dust
just like we are, permanent

odd memories

so many things to post about, in fact i’ve been making a list of thoughts and ideas.  tonight, however, i have to study for a big test tomorrow (yes, a test on saturday! i take weekend classes), so no big post yet.
from the amusing blog of a charming ex- of mine: “I’ll just say it:
I’m thrilled Jason ________ is not coming back to Washington University . I would write more, but he’s not worth my time.”
honestly, i was quite amused! :)  i got curious, so i looked for other amusing gems, like this one from July, 2004:
“Ashlee Simpson’s song “Lala” makes me all bothered. Like… in a naughty kind of bothered way. Except.. I’m not a ho like jason. My turtle is older than his mini-stalker:) Eh.. whatev. He’s not all bad…he just should have to become a monk or something.”
odd, humorous memories.  i’m betting next-to-noone will understand this entry.

i’m putting myself on a mission to (with rachel’s help) aggressively research schools so that i can finish my major, look into other job options to increase my financial flexibility/independence, and rework my finances to pay off my student loans, and pay for the aforementioned schooling.  so far, i’m pretty amped about the whole thing.
rachel helped me pull together information about schools, and i’ve been narrowing down the options.  i’m looking most closely at harvard, bu, and northeastern programs, and i’m going to schedule meetings with admissions counselors from each tomorrow on my lunch break.  right now, i’m most excited about NEU’s
Cohort program
(just accidentally typed progasm?!?), which is an 18-month intensive program that would cost about 1/2 of northeastern or bu’s full program.
my second choice is bu’s
bs in mgmt studies , with a concentration in information systems.  this would give me quite an edge, knowing finance AND basic financial systems programming stuff.  the only downside is the extra time, and more importantly the doubled cost.  neu’s
bs in finance & accting mgmt , which is also double the cost of the Cohort program, but otherwise very attractive.
harvard has a b.a., but no applicable concentration areas, so for now that option’s on the back burner.
job searching tomorrow night, we’ll see what else is out there…it’s kinda tough thinking of leaving my current job, because i really love the work and the people, and i feel like they’ve all made both an actual and an emotional investment in me, but i have to at least look to see what’s out there.  i can’t stand the thought of myself becoming stagnant, and settling for the comfortable certainty of a current job, rather than looking around for new, rewarding opportunities.
more to come, for sure….
PS climbing mt washington was phenomenal, but i’ll leave it to rachel to describe that for now…i’m busy researching :)

dreams

ilmenolimone @ 6:33 am
I just woke from the trippiest dream i’ve ever had without having taken benadryl before bed.
I took a 4 day last-minute vacation (like I actually am going to do in a couple weeks), but the part of my vacation I remember is arriving (by air?) in st louis.
I whisked away to wash u so quickly that I almost teleported.
I buzzed through campus, saying a quick hello to the occasional person I knew.
I also was looking to see kevin (don’t know why he was in st louis), and I finally found him towards the very end of my couple-hour stay.
I then enlisted the help (or the phone, because mine was dying) of some faceless young blond girl, a friend of mine supposedly, and called a cab (which we drove to meet, can’t figure the logic in that).
what I remember most clearly about my time in st louis (in addition to crashing an a cappella concert, examining a strange map of the village house that had a new overabundance of ATMs, and the odd absence of the sexual or even romantic symbolism usually present in some capacity in every one of my dreams, though in a highly stylized and vague way) was the way in which my moverments felt continuously restricted.
I was constantly getting myself caught in low-ceilinged stairways, contortionist-maze railings, and unnecessary escapes through small windows.
anyway, after some undefined amount of time, I find myself back in eighth grade, in mr squeglia’s math class, facing a test I just learned about, for which I had not studied a bit.
I attempted to get a day extension, but when I was (with logic and fairness, two traits squeglia never possessed in spades) denied, I sat down to cram.
as I scanned the textbook, I began to realize the strangeness of the material.
the whole chapter focussed on definitions (and presumably applications) of a whole new class of movement in 4 (or more?) dimensions.
the particular words melted together upon waking, but I remember actually being able to discern text at the time, and remember actual terms like ‘hyperglide’, ‘hyperslide’, and something like ‘glot’ and ‘polyglodt’.
I recall that the picture of one of them indicated several jumps between different parallel planes in a snake-like arrangement, like some far more complex version of the 3-D chess board from star trek.
whether these movements were actual math (it seemed a bit like calc 3, with its vectors and complex motion in space), complex future-chess strategy, or part of an academic approach to aquiring the skills of inter-dimensional travel (as I am inclined to believe), i’m going to remain quite perplexed and fascinated by them for some time.
and if I ever do perfect inter-dimensional travel, i’ll let you guys know, though i’ll probably be quite hard to find.

sense of T

ilmenolimone @ 8:38 am
interesting observations riding the T this morning.  i’m always a bit of a people watcher/observer, especially when riding mass transit (this may be part of why i love public transportation so much), but this morning i noticed two things that i found especially interesting.
firstly, i saw two people on the T that looked like other people i know.  true, this happens all the time, but one of the two looked exactly like my friend Lara, in fact so much like her that though i was only 2 feet away from her, i had to keep checking periodically to make sure she wasn’t Lara for real.
even stranger this morning was the behavior of a young woman that was standing next to me for part of the ride.  normally, when two people touch in the T, they quickly jerk away with an apology and a sense of aversion, especially if the physical contact is skin-on-skin.  this morning, however, the car was so crowded that there wasn’t enough room to move away without seeming really awkward and making a mini-scene.  what was strange was that, though we didn’t look at each other or acknowledge the contact in any way, we were both quite aware of the touching of our arms.  the added motion of the train created a strange sensation, which was comforting rather than awkward or inappropriate, and though i can’t explain exactly how, there was an unspoken understanding of the innocence of the moment.
all very strange, especially coming from such a ‘germaphobe’, as Rachel calls me.

‘Christopher Hitchens, a Washington-based journalist known for his support of the Iraq war and the U.S. war on terror, has subjected himself to waterboarding.
The experiment was done in answer to critics who challenged him to try it after he defended U.S. treatment of Muslim prisoners.’
this is a must-read:

rachel and I just got out of the
Dengue Fever
concert, which was phenomenal!
i’d enjoyed the little bit of their music that i’d heard from their
myspace
page, but I was in no way prepared for the awesomeness that awaited us.
before the concert, we went to the
museum café , and I had my first ‘eating at the MFA’ experience.
the menu was entirely spanish-themed, in honor of the
el greco to velazquez
exhibit that we went to last thursday.
rachel ordered what was essentially a fancy, spanish-esque caesar salad, with a nicely-cheesy parmiagian & peppercorn dressing, and big flakes of manchego cheese, one of the many rachel and I have recently sampled.
I ordered a salad of arugala, peaches, caramelized vidalia onion, and cold duck, with a really interesting, though undecipherable, dressing.
it was essentially a flavorful but simple vinagarette, though the particular spice mix eluded us both (rachel supposed a bit of vanilla or cinnamon, and it seemed almost right to me).
a bit of wonderfully spiced but refreshing sangria complemented the meal well.
the real surprise for me was the near-orgasmic dulce de leche cheesecake that I ordered for dessert.
it was a treat to see a small, single-serving personal cheesecake when i’d been expecting a slice.
I guess I don’t eat at fancy restaurants enough.
rachel was quite amused by this observation of mine – apparently, I was the last to get the fancy cheesecake memo.
the cake was lighter than a usual cheesecake, but somehow quite rich at the same time.
it had a well-executed presentation that included an almost spicy caramel sauce and a dark chocolate drizzle.
rachel, ever the artist, entertained herself and me by drawing out the two different sauces into flowing shapes of trees, flames, and curls.
more about the concert itself sometime tonight…

visualizing magnetic fields

Magnetic fields are all around us, but they’re usually invisible. Not when British filmmakers Ruth Jarman and Joe Gerhardt get a hold of them. Their film group, called Semiconductor, created “Magnetic Movie,” where they’ve turned audio recordings of magnetic fields into arty animations. This innovative work won them honors as Best Film at Cutting Edge at the British Animation Awards 2008.
Next, these creative filmmakers might want to scare up everyone with animation of the waves swirling around all of us 24/7 from cell phones, television, power lines, microwaves, radio and the sun. Let’s just hope all this stuff doesn’t
cause cancer . Either way, any more movies like this one, and we’ll all feel like wearing tinfoil hats.
