AM, Meiko, Jesca Hoop & Everest @ Make Music Pasadena, 6/21/08

Part two of two.
As mentioned previously, on Saturday, Levitt Pavilions Free Music across America presented the inaugural edition of
Make Music Pasadena
( MySpace ), with performances on
six main stages
and
24 other locations
around the city.
The artists on the
Emerging Artists Stage
at One Colorado Courtyard, which was where last year's
Pasadena Music Festival
was held, included
Princeton
( MySpace ), Adele Jacques ( MySpace ) with Antipop, DJ Antipop ( MySpace ) from Telepopmusik ( MySpace ),
Stonehoney
( MySpace ),
AM
( MySpace ),
Meiko
( MySpace ),
Jesca Hoop
( MySpace ), and
Everest
( MySpace ).
For
Dengue Fever
and Everest, Saturday was the last time they'll be performing locally for awhile, with Dengue Fever departing for a European/American tour through September and Everest on a European tour through mid-July.
So it was befitting that Dengue Fever appeased their hometown fans with an encore performance, much to the chagrin of the stage manager.
Special thanks to AM, Meiko, Jesca Hoop, Everest, and Make Music Pasadena.
