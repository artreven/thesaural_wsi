O Flower of Battambang
A number of Cambodia's 24 provinces feature in the popular music of the country and bus journeys between them are notable for the almost constant stream of Khmer music, typically with accompanying video.  (On one bus I travelled in, the owner had replaced his rear view mirror with a small TV screen for benefit of his passengers!)
Although Battambang is over a day by bus from Kratie, and I'm yet to visit, one song that has caught my attention is
'Champa Battambang'
(literally
'Flower of Battambang' ).  I hadn't heard it for some time so today I Googled it and found the recording above from
Sinn Sisamouth , a star of the Khmer music scene in the 50s, 60s and 70s believed to have been killed by the Khmer Rouge.  Many of his recordings were destroyed but this and others have surfaced and, luckily for me, loaded to Youtube.  (An mp3 is available
here .)
The song is full of sadness already but the old posters in the video add to this when you imagine what was lost in terms of arts and culture in 1975.  Artists were a target of the killing fields and you can only wonder what people like Sinn Sisamouth might have gone onto if his career hadn't been horrifically cut short.  Thankfully groups like
Cambodian Living Arts
are working to rebuild this once vibrant part of Cambodian life.
The lyrics of the song have been translated as follows, perhaps
Dengue Fever
should do a version as part of their own revival of the Khmer rock and roll scene (one American band and countless others have already done so, see below).
Oh Battambang! The centre of my heart! It was hard to say goodbye Since the day I’ve been away from you I worry and think about everytime
Oh Battambang! The cycle of my destiny I can’t stop missing you If you were my spouse’s previous life May you not forget our past time
It’s been long time ago, do you remember? You are my breath To you I always hope Smile and hope to be yours
Oh Battambang! Since long time I wanted you When will I see you again? I feel sad everyday Because of wanting Tchampa Battambang!

danny 30 May 2011 at 09:54 Hi Sam I thought you were posting about Leandra when I saw this flagged on my e.mail... for a moment I was very interested! I like the last version you posted.
Is that Sihanouk who is signing? D Reply Delete Sam Roberts 30 May 2011 at 10:06 That's funny, I've told Leandra you said that.
It could well be the Sihanouk, there are some references to him in the comments on
the Youtube video page . Reply Delete Charlie Glasser 13 July 2011 at 20:05 Really cool to see Dengue Fever aren't the only foreigners playing Cambodian music. Reply Delete Add comment Load more...
