A
planet
(from
Greek
πλανήτης
αστήρ
planētēs astēr
"wandering star") is a
celestial body
orbiting
a
star
or
stellar remnant
that is massive enough to be rounded by its own
gravity , is not massive enough to cause
thermonuclear fusion , and has
cleared its neighbouring region
of
planetesimals . [a] [1] [2]
The term
planet
is ancient, with ties to
history ,
science ,
mythology , and
religion . The planets were originally seen by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of the
gods .
As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets
changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the
International Astronomical Union
officially adopted a resolution
defining planets
within the
Solar System .
This definition has been both praised and criticized, and remains
disputed by some scientists since it excludes many objects of
planetary mass
based on where or what they orbit.
The planets were thought by
Ptolemy
to orbit the Earth in
deferent and epicycle
motions. Though the idea that the
planets orbited the Sun
had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first
telescopic
astronomical observations, performed by
Galileo Galilei . By careful analysis of the observation data,
Johannes Kepler
found the planets' orbits to be not circular, but
elliptical . As observational tools improved,
astronomers
saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as
ice caps
and
seasons . Since the dawn of the
Space Age , close observation by
probes
has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as
volcanism ,
hurricanes ,
tectonics , and even
hydrology .
Planets are generally divided into two main types: large, low-density
gas giants , and smaller, rocky
terrestrials . Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the
Sun , they are the four terrestrials,
Mercury ,
Venus ,
Earth , and
Mars , then the four gas giants,
Jupiter ,
Saturn ,
Uranus , and
Neptune . Six of the planets are orbited by one or more
natural satellites . Additionally, the Solar System also contains at least five
dwarf planets [3]
and hundreds of thousands of
small Solar System bodies .
Since 1992, hundreds of planets around other stars (" extrasolar planets " or "exoplanets") in the
Milky Way Galaxy
have been discovered. As of February 14, 2012, 760 known
extrasolar planets
(in 609
planetary systems
and 100
multiple planetary systems ) are listed in the
Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia , ranging in size from that of terrestrial planets similar to
Earth
to that of gas giants larger than
Jupiter . [4]
On December 20, 2011, the
Kepler Space Telescope
team reported the discovery of the first
Earth-sized
extrasolar planets ,
Kepler-20e [5]
and
Kepler-20f , [6]
orbiting a
Sun-like star ,
Kepler-20 . [7] [8] [9]
A 2012 study, analyzing
gravitational microlensing
data, estimates an
average
of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way. [10]

History of astronomy  and  Definition of planet

Timeline of solar system astronomy
Printed rendition of a geocentric cosmological model from
Cosmographia , Antwerp, 1539
The idea of planets has evolved over its history, from the divine
wandering stars
of antiquity to the earthly objects of the scientific age. The concept
has expanded to include worlds not only in the Solar System, but in
hundreds of other extrasolar systems. The ambiguities inherent in
defining planets have led to much scientific controversy.
The five
classical planets , being visible to the naked eye, have been known since ancient times, and have had a significant impact on
mythology ,
religious cosmology , and ancient
astronomy .
In ancient times, astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the
sky in relation to the other stars. Ancient Greeks called these lights
πλάνητες ἀστέρες
( planetes asteres
"wandering stars") or simply " πλανήτοι " ( planētoi
"wanderers"), [11]
from which today's word "planet" was derived. [12] [13]
In ancient
Greece ,
China ,
Babylon
and indeed all pre-modern civilisations, [14] [15]
it was almost universally believed that Earth was in the
center of the Universe
and that all the "planets" circled the Earth. The reasons for this
perception were that stars and planets appeared to revolve around the
Earth each day, [16]
and the apparently
common-sense
perception that the Earth was solid and stable, and that it was not moving but at rest.
The name for planets in
Chinese astronomy
had the same motive as the Greek name,
行星
"moving star". In Japanese during the
Edo period
there were two competing terms, 惑星 " confused
star" and 遊星 " wandering
star". In modern Japan, terminology was unified in favour of 惑星, but in
science fiction
the alternative term 遊星 retains some currency. [ citation needed ]

Babylon
Main article:
Babylonian astronomy
The first civilization known to possess a functional theory of the planets were the
Babylonians , who lived in
Mesopotamia
in the first and second millennia BC. The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian
Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa ,
a 7th century BC copy of a list of observations of the motions of the
planet Venus, that probably dates as early as the second millennium BC. [17]
The
MUL.APIN
is a pair of
cuneiform
tablets dating from the 7th century BC that lays out the motions of the Sun, Moon and planets over the course of the year. [18]
The
Babylonian astrologers
also laid the foundations of what would eventually become
Western astrology . [19]
The
Enuma anu enlil , written during the
Neo-Assyrian
period in the 7th century BC, [20]
comprises a list of
omens
and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including the motions of the planets. [21] [22]
Venus ,
Mercury
and the outer planets
Mars ,
Jupiter
and
Saturn
were all identified by
Babylonian astronomers . These would remain the only known planets until the invention of the
telescope
in early modern times. [23]

Because they were not as interested in divination as the Babylonians [ citation needed ] , the ancient Greeks initially did not attach as much significance to the planets. The
Pythagoreans ,
in the 6th and 5th centuries BC appear to have developed their own
independent planetary theory, which consisted of the Earth, Sun, Moon,
and planets revolving around a "Central Fire" at the center of the
Universe.
Pythagoras
or
Parmenides
are said to have first identified the evening star and morning star ( Venus ) as one and the same. [24]
In the 3rd century BC,
Aristarchus of Samos
proposed a
heliocentric
system, according to which the Earth and planets revolved around the
sun. However, the geocentric system would remain dominant until the
Scientific Revolution .
By the 1st century BC, during the
Hellenistic period ,
the Greeks had begun to develop their own mathematical schemes for
predicting the positions of the planets. These schemes, which were based
on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the Babylonians, would
eventually eclipse the Babylonians' theories in complexity and
comprehensiveness, and account for most of the astronomical movements
observed from Earth with the naked eye. These theories would reach their
fullest expression in the
Almagest
written by
Ptolemy
in the 2nd century CE. So complete was the domination of Ptolemy's
model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained
the definitive astronomical text in the Western world for 13 centuries. [17] [25]
To the Greeks and Romans there were seven known planets, each presumed to be
circling the Earth
according to the complex laws laid out by Ptolemy. They were, in
increasing order from Earth (in Ptolemy's order): the Moon, Mercury,
Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. [13] [25] [26]

India
Main articles:
Indian astronomy
and
Hindu cosmology
In 499 CE, the Indian astronomer
Aryabhata
propounded a planetary model which explicitly incorporated the
Earth's rotation
about its axis, which he explains as the cause of what appears to be an
apparent westward motion of the stars. He also believed that the orbit
of planets are
elliptical . [ unreliable source? ] [27]
Aryabhata's followers were particularly strong in
South India ,
where his principles of the diurnal rotation of the earth, among
others, were followed and a number of secondary works were based on
them. [28] [ page needed ]
In 1500,
Nilakantha Somayaji
of the
Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics , in his
Tantrasangraha , revised Aryabhata's model. [29] [ citation needed ] [30]
In his
Aryabhatiyabhasya , a commentary on Aryabhata's
Aryabhatiya ,
he developed a planetary model where Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and
Saturn orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the Earth, similar to the
Tychonic system
later proposed by
Tycho Brahe
in the late 16th century. Most astronomers of the Kerala school who followed him accepted his planetary model. [29] [ citation needed ] [30] [31]

In the 11th century, the

was observed by
Avicenna , who established that
Venus
was, at least sometimes, below the Sun. [32]
In the 12th century,
Ibn Bajjah
observed "two planets as black spots on the face of the Sun," which was later identified as a
transit of Mercury
and Venus by the
Maragha
astronomer
Qotb al-Din Shirazi
in the 13th century. [33]
However, Ibn Bajjah could not have observed a transit of Venus, as none occurred in his lifetime. [34]

Heliocentrism
With the advent of the
Scientific Revolution , understanding of the term "planet" changed from something that moved across the sky (in relation to the
star field );
to a body that orbited the Earth (or that were believed to do so at the
time); and in the 16th century to something that directly orbited the
Sun when the
heliocentric model
of
Copernicus ,
Galileo
and
Kepler
gained sway.
Thus the Earth became included in the list of planets, [35]
while the Sun and Moon were excluded. At first, when the first
satellites of Jupiter and Saturn were discovered in the 17th century,
the terms "planet" and "satellite" were used interchangeably – although
the latter would gradually become more prevalent in the following
century. [36]
Until the mid-19th century, the number of "planets" rose rapidly since
any newly discovered object directly orbiting the Sun was listed as a
planet by the scientific community.

In the 19th century astronomers began to realize that recently
discovered bodies that had been classified as planets for almost half a
century (such as
Ceres ,
Pallas , and
Vesta ) were very different from the traditional ones. These bodies shared the same region of space between Mars and Jupiter (the
Asteroid belt ), and had a much smaller mass; as a result they were reclassified as " asteroids ."
In the absence of any formal definition, a "planet" came to be
understood as any "large" body that orbited the Sun. Since there was a
dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the planets, and the spate
of new discoveries seemed to have ended after the discovery of Neptune
in 1846, there was no apparent need to have a formal definition. [37]

However, in the 20th century,

the object was immediately accepted as the ninth planet. Further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller: in 1936,
Raymond Lyttleton
suggested that Pluto may be an escaped satellite of
Neptune , [39]
and
Fred Whipple
suggested in 1964 that Pluto may be a comet. [40]
However, as it was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist within a larger population, [41]
it kept its status until 2006.

In 1992, astronomers
Aleksander Wolszczan
and
Dale Frail
announced the discovery of planets around a
pulsar ,
PSR B1257+12 . [42]
This discovery is generally considered to be the first definitive
detection of a planetary system around another star. Then, on October 6,
1995,
Michel Mayor
and
Didier Queloz
of the
University of Geneva
announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary
main-sequence
star ( 51 Pegasi ). [43]
The discovery of extrasolar planets led to another ambiguity in
defining a planet; the point at which a planet becomes a star. Many
known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of Jupiter, approaching
that of stellar objects known as " brown dwarfs ". [44]
Brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their ability to fuse
deuterium , a heavier isotope of
hydrogen .
While stars more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter fuse hydrogen,
stars of only 13 Jupiter masses can fuse deuterium. However, deuterium
is quite rare, and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium
long before their discovery, making them effectively indistinguishable
from supermassive planets. [45]
[ edit ]
21st century
With the discovery during the latter half of the 20th century of more
objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars,
disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There was
particular disagreement over whether an object should be considered a
planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a
belt , or if it was large enough to generate energy by the
thermonuclear fusion
of
deuterium .
A growing number of astronomers argued for Pluto to be declassified
as a planet, since many similar objects approaching its size had been
found in the same region of the Solar System (the
Kuiper belt ) during the 1990s and early 2000s. Pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands.
Some of them including
Quaoar ,
Sedna , and
Eris
were heralded in the popular press as the
tenth planet ,
failing however to receive widespread scientific recognition. The
announcement of Eris in 2005, an object 27% more massive than Pluto,
created the necessity and public desire for an official definition of a
planet.
Acknowledging the problem, the IAU set about creating the
definition of planet , and produced one in August 2006. The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had
cleared their orbit
(Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), and a new class of
dwarf planets
was created, initially containing three objects ( Ceres ,
Pluto
and
Eris ). [46]
[ edit ]
Extrasolar planet definition
In 2003, The
International Astronomical Union
(IAU) Working Group on Extrasolar Planets made a position statement on
the definition of a planet that incorporated the following working
definition, mostly focused upon the boundary between planets and brown
dwarfs: [2]
Artistic comparison of
Eris ,
Pluto ,
Makemake ,
Haumea ,
Sedna ,
Orcus ,

Quaoar , and
Earth
(scales are outdated)
Objects with
true masses
below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium
(currently calculated to be 13 times the mass of Jupiter for objects
with the same
isotopic abundance
as the Sun [47] )
that orbit stars or stellar remnants are "planets" (no matter how they
formed). The minimum mass and size required for an extrasolar object to
be considered a planet should be the same as that used in the Solar
System.
Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are " brown dwarfs ", no matter how they formed or where they are located.
Free-floating objects in young
star clusters
with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of
deuterium are not "planets", but are "sub-brown dwarfs" (or whatever
name is most appropriate).
This definition has since been widely used by astronomers when publishing discoveries of exoplanets in
academic journals . [48]
Although temporary, it remains an effective working definition until a
more permanent one is formally adopted. However, it does not address the
dispute over the lower mass limit, [49]
and so it steered clear of the controversy regarding objects within the
Solar System. This definition also makes no comment on the planetary
status of objects orbiting brown dwarfs, such as
2M1207b .
One definition of a
sub-brown dwarf
is a planet-mass object that formed through cloud-collapse rather than
accretion. This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a
planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two
camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet as part
of its division in classification. [50]
One reason for the dissent is that oftentimes it may not be possible to
determine the formation process: for example an accretion-formed planet
around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating,
and likewise a cloud-collapse-formed sub-brown dwarf formed on its own
in a star cluster may get captured into orbit around a star.
Dwarf planets 2006–present
Ceres
Pluto
Makemake
Haumea
Eris
The 13 Jupiter-mass cutoff is a rule of thumb rather than something
of precise physical significance. The question arises: what is meant by
deuterium burning ?
This question arises because large objects will burn most of their
deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the 13 MJ value
is somewhere in between. The amount of deuterium burnt depends not only
on mass but also on the composition of the planet, on the amount of
helium
and
deuterium
present. [51]
Another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs, rather
than deuterium burning, formation process or location is whether the
core
pressure
is dominated by coulomb pressure or electron degeneracy. [52] [53]
[ edit ]
2006 definition
Main article:
IAU definition of planet
The matter of the lower limit was addressed during the 2006 meeting of the
IAU's General Assembly .
After much debate and one failed proposal, the assembly voted to pass a
resolution that defined planets within the Solar System as: [1]
A celestial body that is (a) in orbit around the Sun, (b) has
sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so
that it assumes a
hydrostatic equilibrium
(nearly round) shape, and (c) has
cleared the neighbourhood
around its orbit.
Under this definition, the Solar System is considered to have eight
planets. Bodies which fulfill the first two conditions but not the third
(such as Pluto, Makemake and Eris) are classified as
dwarf planets , provided they are not also
natural satellites
of other planets. Originally an IAU committee had proposed a definition
that would have included a much larger number of planets as it did not
include (c) as a criterion. [54]
After much discussion, it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets. [55]
This definition is based in theories of planetary formation, in which
planetary embryos initially clear their orbital neighborhood of other
smaller objects. As described by astronomer
Steven Soter : [56]
The end product of secondary disk accretion is a small number of
relatively large bodies (planets) in either non-intersecting or resonant
orbits, which prevent collisions between them. Asteroids and comets,
including KBOs [Kuiper belt objects], differ from planets in that they
can collide with each other and with planets.
In the aftermath of the IAU's 2006 vote, there has been controversy and debate about the definition, [57] [58]
and many astronomers have stated that they will not use it. [59]
Part of the dispute centres around the belief that point (c) (clearing
its orbit) should not have been listed, and that those objects now
categorised as dwarf planets should actually be part of a broader
planetary definition.
Beyond the scientific community, Pluto has held a strong cultural
significance for many in the general public considering its planetary
status since its discovery in 1930. The discovery of Eris was widely
reported in the
media
as the
tenth planet
and therefore the reclassification of all three objects as dwarf
planets has attracted a lot of media and public attention as well. [60]

Mythology and naming
See also:
Weekday names  and
Naked-eye planet
The gods of
Olympus , after whom the Solar System's planets are named
The names for the planets in the Western world are derived from the
naming practices of the Romans, which ultimately derive from those of
the Greeks and the Babylonians. In
ancient Greece , the two great luminaries the Sun and the Moon were called
Helios
and
Selene ; the farthest planet was called
Phainon , the shiner; followed by
Phaethon , "bright"; the red planet was known as
Pyroeis , the "fiery"; the brightest was known as
Phosphoros , the light bringer; and the fleeting final planet was called
Stilbon , the gleamer. The Greeks also made each planet sacred to one among their pantheon of gods, the
Olympians : Helios and Selene were the names of both planets and gods; Phainon was sacred to
Cronus , the
Titan
who fathered the Olympians; Phaethon was sacred to
Zeus , Cronus's son who deposed him as king; Pyroeis was given to
Ares , son of Zeus and god of war; Phosphoros was ruled by
Aphrodite , the goddess of love; and
Hermes , messenger of the gods and god of learning and wit, ruled over Stilbon. [17]
The Greek practice of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets
was almost certainly borrowed from the Babylonians. The Babylonians
named
Phosphoros
after their goddess of love,
Ishtar ; Pyroeis after their god of war,
Nergal , Stilbon after their god of wisdom
Nabu , and Phaethon after their chief god,
Marduk . [63]
There are too many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions for them to have arisen separately. [17]
The translation was not perfect. For instance, the Babylonian Nergal
was a god of war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares. However,
unlike Ares, Nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld. [64]
Today, most people in the western world know the planets by names
derived from the Olympian pantheon of gods. While modern Greeks still
use their ancient names for the planets, other European languages,
because of the influence of the
Roman Empire
and, later, the
Catholic Church , use the Roman (or Latin) names rather than the Greek ones. The Romans, who, like the Greeks, were
Indo-Europeans , shared with them a
common pantheon
under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that Greek poetic culture had given
their gods . During the later period of the
Roman Republic ,
Roman writers borrowed much of the Greek narratives and applied them to
their own pantheon, to the point where they became virtually
indistinguishable. [65]
When the Romans studied Greek astronomy, they gave the planets their own gods' names:
Mercurius
(for Hermes),
Venus
(Aphrodite),
Mars
(Ares),
Iuppiter
(Zeus) and
Saturnus
(Cronus). When subsequent planets were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, the naming practice was retained with
Neptūnus
( Poseidon ). Uranus is unique in that it is named by a
Greek deity
rather than his
Roman counterpart .
Some
Romans , following a belief possibly originating in
Mesopotamia
but developed in
Hellenistic Egypt ,
believed that the seven gods after whom the planets were named took
hourly shifts in looking after affairs on Earth. The order of shifts
went Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon (from the farthest
to the closest planet). [66]
Therefore, the first day was started by Saturn (1st hour), second day
by Sun (25th hour), followed by Moon (49th hour), Mars, Mercury, Jupiter
and Venus. Since each day was named by the god that started it, this is
also the order of the
days of the week
in the
Roman calendar
after the
Nundinal cycle
was rejected – and still preserved in many modern languages. [67]
Sunday, Monday, and Saturday are straightforward translations of these
Roman names. In English the other days were renamed after
Tiw , (Tuesday)
Wóden
(Wednesday),
Thunor
(Thursday), and
Fríge
(Friday), the
Anglo-Saxon gods
considered similar or equivalent to Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus respectively.
Earth is the only planet whose name in English is not derived from
Greco-Roman mythology. Since it was only generally accepted as a planet
in the 17th century, [35]
there is no tradition of naming it after a god (the same is true, in
English at least, of the Sun and the Moon, though they are no longer
considered planets). The name originates from the 8th century
Anglo-Saxon
word
erda , which means ground or soil and was first used in writing as the name of the sphere of the Earth perhaps around 1300. [68] [69]
As with its equivalents in the other
Germanic languages , it derives ultimately from the
Proto-Germanic
word
ertho , "ground," [69]
as can be seen in the English
Earth , the German
Erde,
the Dutch
Aarde , and the Scandinavian
Jord.
Many of the
Romance languages
retain the old Roman word
terra
(or some variation of it) that was used with the meaning of "dry land" (as opposed to "sea"). [70]
However, the non-Romance languages use their own respective native words. The Greeks retain their original name,
Γή
( Ge
or
Yi ).
Non-European cultures use other planetary naming systems.
India
uses a naming system based on the
Navagraha , which incorporates the seven traditional planets ( Surya
for the Sun,
Chandra
for the Moon, and
Budha ,
Shukra ,
Mangala ,
Bṛhaspati
and
Shani
for the traditional planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) and the ascending and descending
lunar nodes
Rahu
and
Ketu .
China
and the countries of eastern Asia historically subject to
Chinese cultural influence
(such as
Japan ,
Korea
and
Vietnam ) use a naming system based on the
five Chinese elements :
water
(Mercury),
metal
(Venus),
fire
(Mars),
wood
(Jupiter) and
earth
(Saturn). [67]

Formation
Main article:
Nebular hypothesis
It is not known with certainty how planets are formed. The prevailing theory is that they are formed during the collapse of a
nebula
into a thin disk of gas and dust. A
protostar
forms at the core, surrounded by a rotating
protoplanetary disk . Through
accretion
(a process of sticky collision) dust particles in the disk steadily
accumulate mass to form ever-larger bodies. Local concentrations of mass
known as
planetesimals
form, and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in
additional material by their gravitational attraction. These
concentrations become ever denser until they collapse inward under
gravity to form
protoplanets . [71]
After a planet reaches a diameter larger than the Earth's moon, it
begins to accumulate an extended atmosphere, greatly increasing the
capture rate of the planetesimals by means of
atmospheric drag . [72]
An artist's impression of protoplanetary disk
When the protostar has grown such that it ignites to form a
star , the surviving disk is removed from the inside outward by
photoevaporation , the
solar wind ,
Poynting–Robertson drag
and other effects. [73] [74]
Thereafter there still may be many protoplanets orbiting the star or
each other, but over time many will collide, either to form a single
larger planet or release material for other larger protoplanets or
planets to absorb. [75]
Those objects that have become massive enough will capture most matter
in their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets. Meanwhile,
protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become
natural satellites
of planets through a process of gravitational capture, or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or
small bodies .
The energetic impacts of the smaller planetesimals (as well as
radioactive decay )
will heat up the growing planet, causing it to at least partially melt.
The interior of the planet begins to differentiate by mass, developing a
denser core. [76]
Smaller terrestrial planets lose most of their atmospheres because of
this accretion, but the lost gases can be replaced by outgassing from
the mantle and from the subsequent impact of
comets . [77]
(Smaller planets will lose any atmosphere they gain through various
escape mechanisms .)
With the discovery and observation of
planetary systems
around stars other than our own, it is becoming possible to elaborate, revise or even replace this account. The level of
metallicity
– an astronomical term describing the abundance of
chemical elements
with an
atomic number
greater than 2 ( helium ) – is now believed to determine the likelihood that a star will have planets. [78]
Hence, it is thought that a metal-rich
population I star
will likely possess a more substantial planetary system than a metal-poor,
population II star .

List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System
According to the
IAU , there are eight planets and five recognized dwarf planets in the
Solar System . In increasing distance from the
Sun , the planets are:
Mercury
Venus
Earth
Mars
Jupiter
Saturn
Uranus
Neptune
Jupiter is the largest, at 318 Earth masses, while Mercury is smallest, at 0.055 Earth masses.
The planets of the Solar System can be divided into categories based on their composition:
Terrestrials : Planets that are similar to Earth, with bodies largely composed of
rock :
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. At 0.055 Earth masses, Mercury is the
smallest terrestrial planet (and smallest planet) in the Solar System,
while Earth is the largest terrestrial planet.
Gas giants
(Jovians) : Planets largely composed of
gaseous
material and significantly more massive than terrestrials: Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Jupiter, at 318 Earth masses, is the largest
planet in the Solar System, while Saturn is one third as big, at 95
Earth masses.
Ice giants ,
comprising Uranus and Neptune, are a sub-class of gas giants,
distinguished from gas giants by their significantly lower mass (only 14
and 17 Earth masses), and by depletion in hydrogen and helium in their
atmospheres together with a significantly higher proportion of rock and
ice.
Dwarf planets : Before the
August 2006 decision ,
several objects were proposed by astronomers, including at one stage by
the IAU, as planets. However in 2006 several of these objects were
reclassified as dwarf planets, objects distinct from planets. Currently
five dwarf planets in the Solar System are recognized by the IAU: Ceres,
Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris. Several other objects in both the
Asteroid belt
and the
Kuiper belt
are under consideration, with as many as 50 that could eventually
qualify. There may be as many as 200 that could be discovered once the
Kuiper belt has been fully explored. Dwarf planets share many of the
same characteristics as planets, although notable differences remain –
namely that they are not
dominant in their orbits . By definition, all dwarf planets are members of larger
populations . Ceres is the largest body in the
asteroid belt , while Pluto, Haumea, and Makemake are members of the Kuiper belt and Eris is a member of the
scattered disc . Scientists such as
Mike Brown
believe that there are probably over one hundred
trans-Neptunian objects
that qualify as dwarf planets under the IAU's recent definition. [79]

Extrasolar planets
Main article:
Extrasolar planet
Exoplanets, by year of discovery, through 2011-07-10.
In early 1992, radio astronomers
Aleksander Wolszczan
and
Dale Frail
announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the
pulsar
PSR 1257+12 . [42]
This discovery was confirmed, and is generally considered to be the
first definitive detection of exoplanets. These pulsar planets are
believed to have formed from the unusual remnants of the
supernova
that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of
gas giants
that survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits.
The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star occurred on 6 October 1995, when
Michel Mayor
and
Didier Queloz
of the
University of Geneva
announced the detection of an exoplanet around
51 Pegasi . Of the 760 extrasolar planets discovered by February 14, 2012, [4]
most have masses which are comparable to or larger than Jupiter's,
though masses ranging from just below that of Mercury to many times
Jupiter's mass have been observed. [4]
The smallest extrasolar planets found to date have been discovered orbiting burned-out star remnants called
pulsars , such as
PSR B1257+12 . [81]
There have been roughly a dozen extrasolar planets found of between 10 and 20 Earth masses, [4]
such as those orbiting the stars
Mu Arae ,
55 Cancri
and
GJ 436 . [82]
Another new category are the so-called " super-Earths ", possibly
terrestrial planets
larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune or Uranus. To date, about
twenty possible super-Earths (depending on mass limits) have been found,
including
OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb
and
MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb , frigid icy worlds discovered through
gravitational microlensing , [83] [84]
Kepler 10b , a planet with a diameter roughly 1.4 times that of Earth, (making it the smallest super-Earth yet measured) [85]
and five of the six planets orbiting the nearby
red dwarf
Gliese 581 .
Gliese 581 d
is roughly 7.7 times Earth's mass, [86]
while
Gliese 581 c
is five times Earth's mass and was initially thought to be the first terrestrial planet found within a star's
habitable zone . [87]
However, more detailed studies revealed that it was slightly too close
to its star to be habitable, and that the farther planet in the system,
Gliese 581 d, though it is much colder than Earth, could potentially be
habitable if its atmosphere contained sufficient amounts of greenhouse
gases. [88]
Another super-Earth,
Kepler-22b , was later confirmed to be orbiting comfortably within the habitable zone of its star. [89]
On December 20, 2011, the
Kepler Space Telescope
team reported the discovery of the first
Earth-size
extrasolar planets ,
Kepler-20e [5]
and
Kepler-20f , [6]
orbiting a
Sun-like star ,
Kepler-20 . [7] [8] [9]
Comparison of
Kepler-20e [5]
and
Kepler-20f [6]
with
Venus
and
Earth .
It is far from clear if the newly discovered large planets would
resemble the gas giants in the Solar System or if they are of an
entirely different type as yet unknown, like ammonia giants or
carbon planets . In particular, some of the newly discovered planets, known as
hot Jupiters , orbit extremely close to their parent stars, in nearly circular orbits. They therefore receive much more
stellar radiation
than the gas giants in the Solar System, which makes it questionable
whether they are the same type of planet at all. There may also exist a
class of hot Jupiters, called
Chthonian planets ,
that orbit so close to their star that their atmospheres have been
blown away completely by stellar radiation. While many hot Jupiters have
been found in the process of losing their atmospheres, as of 2008, no
genuine Chthonian planets have been discovered. [90]
Size comparison of
HR 8799 c
(gray) with
Jupiter . Most exoplanets discovered thus far are larger than Jupiter.
More detailed observation of extrasolar planets will require a new generation of instruments, including
space telescopes . Currently the
COROT
and
Kepler
spacecraft are searching for stellar luminosity variations due to
transiting planets .
Several projects have also been proposed to create an array of space
telescopes to search for extrasolar planets with masses comparable to
the Earth. These include the proposed NASA's,
Terrestrial Planet Finder , and
Space Interferometry Mission
programs, and the CNES'
PEGASE . [91]
The
New Worlds Mission
is an occulting device that may work in conjunction with the
James Webb Space Telescope .
However, funding for some of these projects remains uncertain. The
first spectra of extrasolar planets were reported in February 2007 ( HD 209458 b
and
HD 189733 b ). [92] [93]
The frequency of occurrence of such terrestrial planets is one of the variables in the
Drake equation
which estimates the number of
intelligent, communicating civilizations
that exist in our galaxy. [94]
[ edit ]
Planetary-mass objects
A
planetary-mass object ,
PMO , or
planemo
is a
celestial object with a mass that falls within the range of the
definition of a planet: massive enough to achieve hydrostatic
equilibrium (to be rounded under its own gravity), but not enough to
sustain core fusion like a star. [95]
By definition, all planets are
planetary-mass objects , but the purpose of the term is to describe objects which do not conform to typical expectations for a planet. These include
dwarf planets , the larger
moons ,
free-floating planets not orbiting a star, such as rogue planets
ejected from their system, and objects that formed through
cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called
sub-brown dwarfs ).
[ edit ]
Rogue planets
Main article:
Rogue planet
Several
computer simulations
of stellar and planetary system formation have suggested that some
objects of planetary mass would be ejected into interstellar
space . [96]
Some scientists have argued that such objects found roaming in deep
space should be classed as "planets", although others have suggested
that they could be low-mass stars. [97] [98]
[ edit ]
Sub-brown dwarfs
Main article:
Sub-brown dwarf
Stars form via the gravitational collapse of gas clouds, but smaller
objects can also form via cloud-collapse. Planetary-mass objects formed
this way are sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs. Sub-brown dwarfs may be
free-floating such as
Cha 110913-773444 , or orbiting a larger object such as
2MASS J04414489+2301513 .
For a brief time in 2006, astronomers believed they had found a binary system of such objects,
Oph 162225-240515 ,
which the discoverers described as "planemos", or "planetary-mass
objects". However, recent analysis of the objects has determined that
their masses are probably each greater than 13 Jupiter-masses, making
the pair
brown dwarfs . [99] [100] [101]
[ edit ]
Former stars
In close
binary star
systems one of the stars can lose mass to a heavier companion. See
accretion-powered pulsars . The shrinking star can then become a planetary-mass object. An example is a Jupiter-mass object orbiting the
pulsar
PSR J1719-1438. [102]
[ edit ]
Satellite planets and belt planets
Some large satellites are of similar size or larger than the planet
Mercury , e.g. Jupiter's
Galilean moons
and
Titan .
Alan Stern
has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical
attributes should be taken into account in the definition of a planet,
and proposes the term
satellite planet
for a planet-sized satellite. Likewise, dwarf planets in the
asteroid belt
and
Kuiper belt
should be considered planets according to Stern. [103]
[ edit ]
Attributes
Although each planet has unique physical characteristics, a number of
broad commonalities do exist among them. Some of these characteristics,
such as rings or natural satellites, have only as yet been observed in
planets in the Solar System, whilst others are also common to extrasolar
planets.
[ edit ]
Dynamic characteristics

Kepler's laws of planetary motion
[ edit ]
Orbit
The orbit of the planet Neptune compared to that of
Pluto . Note the elongation of Pluto's orbit in relation to Neptune's ( eccentricity ), as well as its large angle to the ecliptic ( inclination ).
According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential " rogue planets "
are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the
same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above
the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet,
WASP-17b , has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. [104]
The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its
sidereal period
or
year . [105]
A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a
planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must
travel, but also the slower its speed, as it is less affected by the
star's
gravity .
Because no planet's orbit is perfectly circular, the distance of each
varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is
called its
periastron
( perihelion
in the Solar System), while its farthest separation from the star is called its
apastron
( aphelion ).
As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades
gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling
object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron,
its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows
down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory. [106]
Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of
elements :
The
eccentricity
of an orbit describes how elongated a planet's orbit is. Planets with
low eccentricities have more circular orbits, while planets with high
eccentricities have more elliptical orbits. The planets in the Solar
System have very low eccentricities, and thus nearly circular orbits. [105]
Comets and Kuiper belt objects (as well as several extrasolar planets)
have very high eccentricities, and thus exceedingly elliptical orbits. [107] [108]
Illustration of the semi-major axis
The
semi-major axis
is the distance from a planet to the half-way point along the longest
diameter of its elliptical orbit (see image). This distance is not the
same as its apastron, as no planet's orbit has its star at its exact
centre. [105]
The
inclination
of a planet tells how far above or below an
established reference plane its orbit lies. In the Solar System, the
reference plane is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the
ecliptic . For extrasolar planets, the plane, known as the
sky plane
or
plane of the sky , is the plane of the observer's line of sight from Earth. [109]
The eight planets of the Solar System all lie very close to the ecliptic; comets and
Kuiper belt objects
like Pluto are at far more extreme angles to it. [110]
The points at which a planet crosses above and below its reference plane are called its
ascending
and
descending nodes . [105]
The
longitude of the ascending node
is the angle between the reference plane's 0 longitude and the planet's ascending node. The
argument of periapsis
(or perihelion in the Solar System) is the angle between a planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star. [105]
[ edit ]
Axial tilt
Earth's axial tilt is about 23°.
Planets also have varying degrees of
axial tilt ; they lie at an angle to the
plane
of their
stars' equators .
This causes the amount of light received by each hemisphere to vary
over the course of its year; when the northern hemisphere points away
from its star, the southern hemisphere points towards it, and vice
versa. Each planet therefore possesses
seasons ;
changes to the climate over the course of its year. The time at which
each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its
solstice .
Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has
its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter
solstice, when its day is shortest. The varying amount of light and heat
received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns
for each half of the planet. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its
seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial
tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its
hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in
darkness around the time of its solstices. [111]
Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts are not known for certain, though
most hot Jupiters are believed to possess negligible to no axial tilt,
as a result of their proximity to their stars. [112]
[ edit ]
Rotation
The planets rotate around invisible axes through their centres. A planet's
rotation period
is known as a
stellar day .
Most of the planets in the Solar System rotate in the same direction as
they orbit the Sun, which is counter-clockwise as seen from above the
sun's
north pole , the exceptions being Venus [113]
and Uranus [114]
which rotate clockwise, though Uranus's extreme axial tilt means there
are differing conventions on which of its poles is "north", and
therefore whether it is rotating clockwise or anti-clockwise. [115]
However, regardless of which convention is used, Uranus has a
retrograde rotation
relative to its orbit.
The rotation of a planet can be induced by several factors during formation. A net
angular momentum
can be induced by the individual angular momentum contributions of
accreted objects. The accretion of gas by the gas giants can also
contribute to the angular momentum. Finally, during the last stages of
planet building, a
stochastic process
of protoplanetary accretion can randomly alter the spin axis of the planet. [116]
There is great variation in the length of day between the planets, with
Venus taking 243 Earth days to rotate, and the gas giants only a few
hours. [117]
The rotational periods of extrasolar planets are not known; however their proximity to their stars means that hot Jupiters are
tidally locked
(their orbits are in sync with their rotations). This means they only
ever show one face to their stars, with one side in perpetual day, the
other in perpetual night. [118]
[ edit ]
Orbital clearing
The defining dynamic characteristic of a planet is that it has
cleared its neighborhood . A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the
planetesimals
in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to
sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This
characteristic was mandated as part of the
IAU 's official
definition of a planet
in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as
Pluto ,
Eris
and
Ceres
from full-fledged planethood, making them instead
dwarf planets . [1]
Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a
number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence
suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar
discs. [119]
[ edit ]
Physical characteristics
[ edit ]
Mass
A planet's defining physical characteristic is that it is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the
electromagnetic forces
binding its physical structure, leading to a state of
hydrostatic equilibrium .
This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up
to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that
point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object,
gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until
the object collapses into a sphere. [120]
Mass is also the prime attribute by which planets are distinguished from
stars . The upper mass limit for planethood is roughly 13 times Jupiter's mass for objects with solar-type
isotopic abundance , beyond which it achieves conditions suitable for
nuclear fusion .
Other than the Sun, no objects of such mass exist in the Solar System;
but there are exoplanets of this size. The 13MJ limit is not universally
agreed upon and the
Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia
includes objects up to 20 Jupiter masses, [121]
and the
Exoplanet Data Explorer
up to 24 Jupiter masses. [122]
The smallest known planet, excluding dwarf planets and satellites, is
PSR B1257+12A , one of the first extrasolar planets discovered, which was found in 1992 in orbit around a
pulsar . Its mass is roughly half that of the planet Mercury. [4]
The smallest planet orbiting a main-sequence star other than the Sun is
Kepler-20e , with a mass roughly similar to that of
Venus .

Internal differentiation
Illustration of the interior of Jupiter, with a rocky core overlaid by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen
Every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state; in early
formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving
the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a
differentiated
interior consisting of a dense
planetary core
surrounded by a
mantle
which either is or was a
fluid . The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard
crusts , [123]
but in the gas giants the mantle simply dissolves into the upper cloud
layers. The terrestrial planets possess cores of magnetic elements such
as
iron
and
nickel , and mantles of
silicates .
Jupiter
and
Saturn
are believed to possess cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of
metallic hydrogen . [124]
Uranus
and
Neptune , which are smaller, possess rocky cores surrounded by mantles of
water ,
ammonia ,
methane
and other
ices . [125]
The fluid action within these planets' cores creates a
geodynamo
that generates a
magnetic field . [123]
[ edit ]
Atmosphere
See also:
Extraterrestrial atmospheres
Earth's atmosphere
All of the Solar System planets have
atmospheres
as their large masses mean gravity is strong enough to keep gaseous
particles close to the surface. The larger gas giants are massive enough
to keep large amounts of the light gases
hydrogen
and
helium
close by, while the smaller planets lose these gases into
space . [126]
The composition of the Earth's atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various
life
processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular
oxygen . [127]
The only solar planet without a substantial atmosphere is Mercury which
had it mostly, although not entirely, blasted away by the
solar wind . [128]
Planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying degrees of energy
received from either the Sun or their interiors, leading to the
formation of dynamic
weather systems
such as
hurricanes , (on Earth), planet-wide
dust storms
(on Mars), an Earth-sized
anticyclone
on Jupiter (called the
Great Red Spot ), and
holes in the atmosphere
(on Neptune). [111]
At least one extrasolar planet,
HD 189733 b , has been claimed to possess such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large. [129]
Hot Jupiters have been shown to be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation, much like the tails of comets. [130] [131]
These planets may have vast differences in temperature between their day and night sides which produce supersonic winds, [132]
although the day and night sides of HD 189733 b appear to have very
similar temperatures, indicating that that planet's atmosphere
effectively redistributes the star's energy around the planet. [129]

Magnetosphere
Schematic of
Earth's magnetosphere
One important characteristic of the planets is their intrinsic
magnetic moments
which in turn give rise to
magnetospheres .
The presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still
geologically alive. In other words, magnetized planets have flows of
electrically conducting
material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields.
These fields significantly change the interaction of the planet and
solar wind. A magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind
around itself called magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate. The
magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself. In contrast,
non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by
interaction of the
ionosphere
with the solar wind, which cannot effectively protect the planet. [133]
Of the eight planets in the Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a magnetic field. [133]
In addition, the moon of Jupiter
Ganymede
also has one. Of the magnetized planets the magnetic field of Mercury is the weakest, and is barely able to deflect the
solar wind .
Ganymede's magnetic field is several times larger, and Jupiter's is the
strongest in the Solar System (so strong in fact that it poses a
serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons). The
magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in
strength to that of Earth, but their magnetic moments are significantly
larger. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted
relative the rotational
axis
and displaced from the centre of the planet. [133]
In 2004, a team of astronomers in Hawaii observed an extrasolar planet around the star
HD 179949 ,
which appeared to be creating a sunspot on the surface of its parent
star. The team hypothesised that the planet's magnetosphere was
transferring energy onto the star's surface, increasing its already high
7,760 °C temperature by an additional 400 °C. [134]
[ edit ]
Secondary characteristics
Several planets or dwarf planets in the Solar System (such as Neptune and Pluto) have orbital periods that are in
resonance
with each other or with smaller bodies (this is also common in satellite systems). All except Mercury and Venus have
natural satellites , often called "moons". Earth has one, Mars has two, and the
gas giants
have numerous moons in complex planetary-type systems. Many gas giant
moons have similar features to the terrestrial planets and dwarf
planets, and some have been studied as possible abodes of life
(especially
Europa ). [135] [136] [137]
The
rings of Saturn
The four gas giants are also orbited by
planetary rings
of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny ' moonlets '
whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although the
origins of planetary rings is not precisely known, they are believed to
be the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent
planet's
Roche limit
and were torn apart by
tidal forces . [138] [139]
No secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets. However the
sub-brown dwarf
Cha 110913-773444 , which has been described as a
rogue planet , is believed to be orbited by a tiny
protoplanetary disc . [97]

/ s r iː ˈ l æ ŋ k ə / ; [8] [9]
Sinhala :
ශ්‍රී ලංකා ,
Tamil :

Indian subcontinent
in
South Asia . Known until 1972 as
Ceylon
(   / s ɨ ˈ l ɒ n / ,
/ s eɪ ˈ l ɒ n / , or
/ s iː ˈ l ɒ n / ), Sri Lanka is an
island
surrounded by the
Indian Ocean , the
Gulf of Mannar , the
Palk Strait , and lies in the vicinity of
India
and the
Maldives .
As a result of its location in the path of major sea routes, Sri Lanka is a strategic naval link between
West Asia
and
South East Asia . [10]
It was an important stop on the ancient
Silk Road . [11]
Sri Lanka has also been a center of the
Buddhist
religion and culture from ancient times, and is one of the few remaining abodes of
Buddhism
in
South Asia
along with
Ladakh ,
Bhutan
and the
Chittagong hill tracts . [12]
The
Sinhalese
community forms the majority of the population;
Tamils , who are concentrated in the north and east of the island, form the largest
ethnic minority . Other communities include
Moors ,
Burghers ,
Kaffirs ,
Malays
and the aboriginal
Vedda people . [13]
Sri Lanka is a
republic
and a
unitary state
which is governed by a
semi-presidential system
with its official
seat of government
in
Sri Jayawardenapura-Kotte , the
capital . The country is famous for the production and export of
tea ,
coffee ,
coconuts ,
rubber
and
cinnamon , the last of which is native to the country. [14]
The natural beauty of Sri Lanka has led to the title
The Pearl of the Indian Ocean . [15]
The island is laden with lush
tropical forests , white beaches and diverse landscapes with rich
biodiversity .
The country lays claim to a long and colorful history of over three
thousand years, having one of the longest documented histories in the
world. [16]
Sri Lanka's rich culture can be attributed to the many different communities on the island. [17]
Sri Lanka is a founding member state of
SAARC
and a member
United Nations ,
Commonwealth of Nations ,
G77
and
Non-Aligned Movement . As of 2010, Sri Lanka was one of the
fastest growing economies
of the world. Its
stock exchange
was Asia's best performing stock market during 2009 and 2010. [18]

Etymology
Main article:
Names of Sri Lanka
In ancient times, Sri Lanka was known by a variety of names: Known in
India as Lanka or Singhala, ancient Greek geographers called it
Taprobane [19]
/ t ə ˈ p r ɒ b ə n iː /
and
Arabs
referred to it as
Serendib
(the origin of the word " serendipity "). [20]
Ceilão
was the name given to Sri Lanka by the
Portuguese
when they arrived in 1505, [21]
which was transliterated into English as
Ceylon . [22]
As a
British
crown colony , the island was known as
Ceylon , and achieved independence under the name
Dominion of Ceylon
in 1948.
In
Sinhala
the country is known as ශ්‍රී ලංකා
śrī laṃkā ,
IPA:  [ʃɾiːˈlaŋkaː] , and the island itself as ලංකාව
laṃkāva ,
IPA:  [laŋˈkaːʋə] . In
Tamil
they are both இலங்கை
ilaṅkai ,
IPA:  [iˈlaŋɡai] . The name derives from the
Sanskrit
श्री लंका
śrī
(venerable) and
lankā
(island), [23]
the name of the island in the ancient Indian epics
Mahabharata
and the
Ramayana .
In 1972, the official name of the country was changed to "Free,
Sovereign and Independent Republic of Sri Lanka". In 1978 it was changed
to the " Democratic Socialist
Republic of Sri Lanka". [24]
The name Ceylon is still in use in the names of a number of
organisations; in 2011, the Sri Lankan government announced a plan to
rename all of those for which it is responsible. [25]

Main article:
Prehistory of Sri Lanka
The pre-history of Sri Lanka dates back over 125,000 years
Before Present
(BP) and possibly even as early as 500,000 BP. [26]
The era spans the
Palaeolithic ,
Mesolithic
and early
Iron ages . Among the
Paleolithic
( Homo Erectus ) human settlements discovered in Sri Lanka,
Pahiyangala
(named after the
Chinese
traveler
monk
Fa-Hsien ), which dates back to 37,000 BP, [27]
Batadombalena
(28,500 BP) [28]
and
Belilena
(12,000 BP) are the most important. The remains of
Balangoda Man , an
anatomically
modern
human , found inside these caves, [29]
suggests that they may have engaged in
agriculture
and kept domestic dogs for driving game. [30]

One of the first written references to the island is found in the Indian
epic
Ramayana , which provides details of a kingdom named
Lanka
that had been created by the divine sculptor
Vishwakarma , for
Kubera , the lord of wealth. [31]
It is said that Kubera was overthrown by his demon stepbrother
Ravana , the powerful Emperor who built a mythical
flying machine
named
Dandu Monara . [32]
The modern city of
Wariyapola
is described as Ravana's airport. [33]
Ravana belonged to the tribe
Raksha , which lived alongside four
Hela
tribes named
Yaksha ,
Deva ,
Naga
and
Gandharva . [34]
These early inhabitants of Sri Lanka were probably the ancestors of the
Vedda people , [35]
an indigenous community living in modern-day Sri Lanka, which numbers approximately 2,500. Irish historian
James Emerson Tennent
theorised
Galle , a southern city in Sri Lanka, was the ancient seaport of
Tarshish , from which
King Solomon
is said to have drawn
ivory ,
peacocks
and other valuables. Early inhabitats of the country spoke the
Elu language , which is considered the early form of the modern
Sinhala language . [36]

Ancient Sri Lanka

Ancient history of Sri Lanka
The
Rankot Vihara
or the Golden Pinnacle Dagoba in Polonnaruwa, 12th century
According to the
Mahāvamsa , a chronicle written in
Pāli
language, the ancient period of Sri Lanka begins in 543 BC with the
landing of Vijaya , a semi-legendary king who arrived in the country with 700 followers from the southwest coast of what is now the
Rarh region
of
West Bengal . [37]
He established the
Kingdom of Tambapanni , near modern day
Mannar . Vijaya is the first of the approximately 189 native
monarchs
of Sri Lanka, the chronicles like
Dipavamsa , Mahāvamsa,
Chulavamsa
and Rājāvaliya describe. ( see
List of Sri Lankan monarchs ) Sri Lankan dynasty spanned over a period of 2359 years, from 543 BC to 1815 AD, until it came under the rule of
British Empire . [38]
The
Sigiriya
rock fortress.
The Kingdom of Sri Lanka moved to
Anuradhapura
in 380 BC, during the reign of
Pandukabhaya . Since then, Anuradhapura served as the
capital
of the country for nearly 1400 years. [39]
Ancient Sri Lankans excelled in
various constructions
such as
tanks ,
dagobas
and palaces. [40]
The society underwent a major transformation during the reign of
Devanampiya Tissa , with the arrival of
Buddhism
from India. In 250 BC, [41]
bhikkhu
Mahinda , the son of the
Mauryan
Emperor
Ashoka
arrived in
Mihintale , carrying the message of Buddhism. [42]
His mission won over the monarch, who embraced the faith and propagated it throughout the
Sinhalese population . [43]
The succeeding kingdoms of Sri Lanka would maintain a large number of
Buddhist schools
and monasteries, and support the propagation of Buddhism into other countries in
Southeast Asia
as well. [44]
In 245 BC,
bhikkhuni
Sangamitta
arrived with the
Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi
tree, which is considered to be a sapling from the historical
Bodhi tree
under which
Gautama Buddha
became enlightened. [45]
It is considered the oldest tree in the world, with a continuous historical record. ( Bodhivamsa ) [46]
Sri Lanka experienced the first foreign invasion during the reign of
Suratissa , who was defeated by two horse traders named
Sena and Guttika
from
South India . [43]
The next invasion came immediately in 205 BC by a
Chola
king named
Elara , who overthrew
Asela
and ruled the country for 44 years.
Dutugemunu , the eldest son of the southern regional sub-king,
Kavan Tissa , defeated Elara in the
Battle of Vijithapura . He built
Ruwanwelisaya , the second stupa in ancient Sri Lanka, and the
Lovamahapaya . [47]
During its two and half millenias of existence, kingdom of Sri Lanka
was invaded at least 8 times by neighbouring South Asian dynastys such
as
Chola ,
Pandya ,
Chera
and
Pallava . [48]
There had also been incursions by the kingdoms of
Kalinga
(modern
Orissa ) and from
Malay Peninsula
as well.
Kala Wewa
and the
Avukana Buddha statue
were built during the reign of
Dhatusena . [49]
Claudius Ptolemy 's
map
of Ceylon, 1st century AD
Sri Lanka was the first Asian country to have a female ruler;
Queen Anula
who reigned from 47–42 BC. [50]
Sri Lankan monarchs have attained some remarkable construction achievements like
Sigiriya , the so-called "Fortress in the Sky". It was a constructed during the reign of
Kashyapa I .
Sigiriya is a rock fortress surrounded by an extensive network of
gardens, reservoirs, and other structures. The 5th century palace is
also renowned for
frescos
on the rock the surface. [49]
It has been declared by the
UNESCO
as the 8th
Wonder of the world . [51] [52]
Among the other constructions, large
reservoirs , important for conserving water in a climate that alternates rainy seasons with dry times, and elaborate
aqueducts , some with a slope as finely calibrated as one inch to the mile are dominant. Biso Kotuwa, a peculiar construction inside a
dam , is a technological marvel based on precise
mathematics , allowing water to flow outside the dam keeping the pressure to a minimum. [53]
Ancient Sri Lanka was the first country in the world to have established a dedicated hospital; in
Mihintale
in the 4th century. [54]
It was also the leading exporter of
cinnamon
in the ancient world, and has maintained close ties with European civilizations including the
Roman Empire . For example, King Bhatikabhaya (BC 22 - 7 AD) had sent an embassy to Rome and got down
coral
for a net to be cast over the
Ruwanwelisaya . [55]
Bhikkhuni Devasāra and ten other fully ordained bhikkhunis from Sri
Lanka had went to China and established the bhikkhuni sāsana there in
429 AD. [45]

Medieval Sri Lanka
Main article:
Medieval history of Sri Lanka
A Buddhist statue in the ancient capital city of
Polonnaruwa , 12th century
The medieval period of Sri Lanka begins with the fall of
Anuradhapura . In 993 AD, the invasion of
Chola emperor
Rajaraja I
forced the then Sri Lankan ruler
Mahinda V
to flee to the southern part of the country. [56]
Taking advantage of this situation,
Rajendra I
son of Rajaraja I, launched a large invasion in 1017 AD. Mahinda V was captured and taken to India, and the Cholas
sacked the city of Anuradhapura . [56]
Subsequently, they moved the capital to
Polonnaruwa . [57]
This marked the end of the two great houses of dynasties of ancient Sri
Lanka, Moriya and the Lambakanna. Following a seventeen year long
campaign,
Vijayabahu I
successfully drove the Chola out of Sri Lanka in 1070, reuniting the country for the first time in over a century. [58] [59]
Upon his request, ordained monks were sent from
Burma
to Sri Lanka to re-establish Buddhism which had almost disappeared from the country during the Chola reign. [60]
During the medieval period, Sri Lanka was divided to three sub-territories, namely
Ruhunu , Pihiti and
Maya . [61]
Kuttam Pokuna
or the Twin Ponds, Anuradhapura, 8th century
Sri Lanka's
irrigation system
was extensively expanded during the reign of
Parākramabāhu the Great
(1153–1186 AD). [62]
This period is considered as a time when Sri Lanka was at the height of its power. [63] [64]
He built 1470 reservoirs - highest number by any ruler in the history,
repaired 165 dams, 3910 canals, 163 major reservoirs, and 2376 mini
reservoirs. [65]
His famous construction is the
Parakrama Samudra , [66]
the largest irrigation project of medieval Sri Lanka. Parākramabāhu's
reign is memorable for two major campaigns — in the south of India as
part of a Pandyan war of succession, and a punitive strike against the
kings of Ramanna ( Myanmar ) for various perceived insults to Sri Lanka. [67]
After his demise, Sri Lanka gradually decayed in power. In 1215 AD,
Kalinga Magha , a South Indian with uncertain origins, invaded and captured the
Kingdom of Polonnaruwa
with a 24,000 strong army from
Kalinga . [65]
Unlike the previous invaders, he
looted , ransacked and destroyed everything in the ancient Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Kingdoms beyond recovery. [68]
His priorities in ruling were to extract as much as possible from the land and overturn as many of the traditions of
Rajarata
as possible. His reign saw the massive migration of native
Sinhalese people
to the south and west of Sri Lanka, and into the mountainous interior,
in a bid to escape his power. Sri Lanka never really recovered from the
impact of Kalinga Magha's invasion. King Vijayabâhu III, who led the
resistance, brought the kingdom to
Dambadeniya . The north, in the meanwhile, eventually evolved into the
Jaffna kingdom . [69] [70]
Jaffna kingdom never came under the rule of the kingdom of south except
on one occasion; in 1450, following the conquest led by king
Parâkramabâhu VI 's adopted son,
Prince Sapumal . [71]
He ruled the North from 1450 to 1467 AD. [72]
The next three centuries stating from 1215 were marked by
kaleidoscopically shifting collection of kingdoms in south and central
Sri Lanka, including
Dambadeniya ,
Yapahuwa ,
Gampola ,
Raigama ,
Kotte , [73]
Sitawaka
and finally,
Kandy .

Early modern Sri Lanka
Main article:
Colonial history of Sri Lanka
Joris van Spilbergen
meeting king Vimaladharmasuriya in 1602.
The early modern period of Sri Lanka begins with the arrival of
Portuguese
soldier
and
explorer
Lorenzo de Almeida , the son of
Francisco de Almeida
in 1505. [74]
The Portuguese founded a fort at the port city of
Colombo
in 1517 and gradually extended their control over the coastal areas. In 1592
Vimaladharmasuriya I
moved the kingdom to the inland city of
Kandy , a location more secure against an attack from western invaders. [75]
Intermittent warfare continued through the 16th century. In 1619, due to the attacks of Portuguese, independent existence of
Jaffna kingdom , came to an end. [76]
Colonial Coat of arms of
British Ceylon
During the reign of the
Rajasinghe II ,
Dutch
explorers arrived in the island. In 1638, the king signed a
treaty
with the
Dutch East India Company
to get rid of Portuguese who ruled most of the coastal areas. [77]
The following
Dutch–Portuguese War
resulted in Dutch victory, with Colombo falling into Dutch hands by
1656. Dutch remained in the areas they captured, violating the treaty.
An ethnic group named
Burgher people
integrated into the Sri Lankan society as a result of
Dutch rule . [78]
The
Kingdom of Kandy
was the last independent
monarchy
of Sri Lanka. [79]
In 1595, Vimaladharmasurya brought the sacred
Tooth Relic
- the traditional symbol of royal and religious authority amongst the
Sinhalese
- to Kandy, and built the
Temple of the Tooth . [79]
Even with intermittent warfare with Europeans, the kingdom was able to
survive. A succession crisis emerged in Kandy, upon king
Vira Narendrasinha 's death in 1739. He was married to a
Telugu -speaking
Nayakkar
princess from South India and was childless by them. [79]
Eventually, with the support of
bhikku
Weliwita Sarankara, the crown passed to the brother of one of Narendrasinha's princess, overlooking the right of
"Unambuwe Bandara" , Narendrasinha's own son by a Sinhalese
concubine . [80]
The new king was crowned
Sri Vijaya Rajasinha
later that year. Kings of Nayakkar dynasty, launched several attacks on
Dutch controlled areas, which proved to be unsuccessful. [81]
During the
Napoleonic Wars , fearing that
French
control of the
Netherlands
might deliver Sri Lanka to the French,
Great Britain
occupied the coastal areas of the island (which they
called
Ceylon) with little difficulty in 1796. [82]
Two years later, in 1798,
Rajadhi Rajasinha , 3rd of the four Nayakkar kings of Sri Lanka died of a fever. Following the death, a nephew of Rajadhi Rajasinha, 18-year-old
Konnasami
was crowned. [83]
The new king,
Sri Vikrama Rajasinha
faced a
British
invasion in 1803, but was able to retaliate successfully. By then, the entire coastal area was under the
British East India Company , as a result of the
Treaty of Amiens . But on 14 February 1815, Kandy was occupied by the British, in the
second Kandyan War , finally ending Sri Lanka's independence. [83]
Sri Vikrama Rajasinha , the last native monarch of Sri Lanka was exiled to India. [84]
Kandyan convention
formally ceded the entire country to the
British Empire . Attempts of Sri Lankan noblemen to undermine the British power in 1818 during the
Uva Rebellion
were thwarted by
Governor
Robert Brownrigg . [85]
[ edit ]
Modern Sri Lanka
[ edit ]
Sri Lanka under the British rule
Tea plantation
was introduced to Sri Lanka by
James Taylor , a British planter in 1867.
The beginning of the modern period of Sri Lanka is marked by the
Colebrooke-Cameron reforms
of 1833. [86]
They introduced a
utilitarian
and
liberal
political culture to the country based on the
rule of law
and amalgamated the Kandyan and maritime provinces as a single unit of government. [86]
An
Executive Council
and a
Legislative Council
were established, later becoming the foundation of representative legislature in the country. By this time, experiments with
coffee
plantation were largely successful. Soon it grew to become the primary
commodity export of the country. The falling coffee prices as a result
of the
depression of 1847
stalled economic development and prompted the governor to introduce a
series of taxes on firearms, dogs, shops, boats, etc., and reintroduce a
form of
rajakariya , requiring six days free labour on roads or payment of a cash equivalent. [87]
These harsh measures antagonized the locals, and
another rebellion
broke out in 1848. [88]
A devastating leaf disease,
Hemileia vastatrix ,
struck the coffee plantations in 1869, destroying the entire industry
within 15 years. The British officials desperately searched for a
substitute, and the promising replacement they found was
tea .
Production of tea in Sri Lanka
thrived within the decades to come.
By the end of the 19th century, a new educated
social class
which transcended the divisions of race and
caste
was emerging as a result of British attempts to nurture a range of professionals for the
Ceylon Civil Service
and for the legal, educational, and medical professions. [89]
The country's new leaders represented the various ethnic groups of the population in the
Ceylon Legislative Council
on a communal basis. In the meantime, attempts were underway for Buddhist and Hindu revivalism and to react against
Christian missionary
activities on the island. [90] [91]
The first two decades in the 20th century are distinguished for the
harmony that prevailed among Sinhalese and Tamil political leadership,
which has not been the case ever since. [92]
In 1919, major Sinhalese and Tamil political organizations united to
form the Ceylon National Congress, under the leadership of
Ponnambalam Arunachalam . [93]
It kept pressing the colonial masters for more constitutional reforms.
But due to its failure to appeal to the masses and the governor's
encouragement for "communal representation" by creating a "Colombo seat"
that dangled between Sinhalese and Tamils, the Congress lost its
momentum towards the mid 1920s. [94]
The
Donoughmore reforms
of 1931 repudiated the communal representation and introduced
universal adult franchise
(the franchise stood at 4% before the reforms). This step was strongly
criticized by the Tamil political leadership, who realized that they
would be reduced to a minority in the newly created
State Council of Ceylon , which succeeded the legislative council. [95] [96]
In 1937, Tamil leader
G. G. Ponnambalam
demanded a 50-50 representation (50% for the Sinhalese and 50% for
other ethnic groups) in the State Council. However, this demand was not
met by the
Soulbury reforms
of 1944/45.
[ edit ]
Post independence Sri Lanka
The Soulbury constitution ushered the
Dominion status
for Ceylon, delivering it independence on 4 February 1948. [97]
The office of
Prime Minister of Ceylon
was created in advance of independence, on 14 October 1947,
D. S. Senanayake
being the first prime minister. [98]
Prominent Tamil leaders like Ponnambalam and A. Mahadeva joined his cabinet. [95] [99]
Although the country gained independence in 1948, the
British Royal Navy
stationed at
Trincomalee
remained until 1956.
1953 hartal , against the withdrawal of the rice ration, resulted in the resignation of the then prime minister,
Dudley Senanayake . [100]
With the election of
S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike
to the prime ministership in 1956, Ceylon began moving towards better relations with the
communist bloc .
Bandaranaike's 3 year rule had a profound impact on the direction of
the country. He emerged as the "defender of the besieged Sinhalese
culture" and promised radical changes in the system. [101]
He introduced the controversial
Sinhala Only Act , recognising
Sinhala
as the sole official language of the government. Although it was
partially reversed in 1958, the bill posed a grave concern for the Tamil
community, which perceived their language and culture were threatened. [102] [103]
The
Federal Party
(FP) launched
satyagraha
against the move, which prompted Bandaranaike to reach an agreement ( Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact ) with
S. J. V. Chelvanayakam , leader of the FP, to resolve the looming ethnic conflict. [104]
However the pact was not carried out due to protests by opposition and
the Buddhist clergy. The bill, together with various government
colonisation schemes , contributed much towards the political rancour between Sinhalese and Tamil political leaders. [105]
Bandaranaike was
assassinated
by an extremist Buddhist monk in 1959. [106]
The formal ceremony marking the start of self rule, with the opening of the first parliament at
Independence Square .
Sirimavo Bandaranaike , the widow of late S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, took office as prime minister in 1960, but faced an
attempted coup d'état
in 1962. During the second term as prime minister, her government
instituted socialist economic polices, further strengthening ties with
the
Soviet Union
and later
China , while promoting a policy of non-alignment. However in 1971, Ceylon experienced a
Marxist insurrection , which was quickly suppressed. In 1972, with the adoption of a new constitution, the country became a
republic , repudiating the
Dominion
status and changing its name to Sri Lanka. Prolonged minority
grievances
and the use of communal emotionalism as an election campaign weapon by
both Sinhalese and Tamil leaders abetted a fledgling Tamil militancy in
the north, during 1970s. [107]
The
policy of standardization
by Sirimavo government to rectify disparities created in university enrollment, which was in essence an
affirmative action
to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education, [108]
in turn reducing the number of Tamil students within the Sri Lankan
university student populace; acted as the immediate catalyst for the
rise of militancy. [109] [110]
Assassination of
Jaffna
Mayor
Alfred Duraiyappah
in 1975 marked an important turn of the events. [111] [112]
The Government of
J. R. Jayawardene
swept to power in 1977, defeating the largely unpopular
United Front
government, towards its final years. [113]
Jayawardene introduced a
new constitution , together with a powerful
executive presidency
modelled after
France , and a
free market economy . It made Sri Lanka the first
South Asian
country to
liberalise
its economy. [114]
However from 1983, ethnic tensions blew into on-and-off insurgency ( see
Sri Lankan Civil War ) against the government by the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(the LTTE, also known as the Tamil Tigers), a militant group emerged in early 1970s. Following the
riots
in July 1983, more than 150,000 Tamil civilians fled the island, seeking asylum in other countries. [115]
Lapses in foreign policy resulted in neighbouring India strengthening the Tigers by providing arms and training. [116] [117] [118]
In 1987, the
Indo-Sri Lanka Accord
was signed and
Indian Peace Keeping Force
(IPKF) was deployed in northern Sri Lanka to stabilize the region by neutralising the LTTE. [119]
The same year, the
JVP
launched its
second insurrection
in Southern Sri Lanka. [120]
As their efforts did not become successful, IPKF was called back in 1990. [121]
Sri Lanka was affected by the devastating
2004 Asian tsunami , which left at least 35,000 people dead. [122]
From 1985 to 2006, Sri Lankan government and Tamil insurgents held 4
rounds of peace-talks, none of them helping a peaceful resolution of the
conflict. In 2009, under the
Presidency
of
Mahinda Rajapaksa
the
Sri Lanka Armed Forces
defeated the LTTE, and re-established control of the entire country under the Sri Lankan Government. [123] [124]
The 26 year war caused up to 100,000 deaths. [125]
Following the LTTE's defeat,
Tamil National Alliance , the largest political party in Sri Lanka dropped its demand for a
separate state , in favour of a
federal
solution. [126] [127]
The final stages of the war left some 294,000 people displaced. [128] [129]
According to the Ministry of Resettlement, most of the displaced
persons had been released or returned to their places of origin, leaving
only 6,651 in the camps as of December 2011. [130]
Sri Lanka, emerging after a 26 year war, has become one of the
fastest growing economies
of the world. [131]

Geography
Main article:
Geography of Sri Lanka
Topographic map of Sri Lanka
Aerial view from space (Courtesy: NASA)
The island of Sri Lanka lies atop the
Indian tectonic plate , a minor plate within the
Indo-Australian Plate . [132]
It is positioned in the Indian Ocean, to the southwest of the
Bay of Bengal , between latitudes
5°
and
10°N , and longitudes
79°
and
82°E . [133]
Sri Lanka is separated from the
Indian subcontinent
by the
Gulf of Mannar
and the
Palk Strait . According to the
Hindu mythology , a
land bridge
existed between the Indian mainland and Sri Lanka. It now amounts to only a chain of limestone shoals remaining above
sea level . [134]
It was reportedly passable on foot up to 1480 AD, until
cyclones
deepened the channel. [135] [136]
The island consists mostly of flat-to-rolling coastal plains, with
mountains rising only in the south-central part. Amongst these is the
highest point
Pidurutalagala , reaching 2,524 metres (8,281 ft) above sea level. The climate of Sri Lanka can be described as
tropical
and warm. Its position endows the country with a warm climate moderated
by ocean winds and considerable moisture. The mean temperature ranges
from about
17 °C
(62.6 °F)
in the
central highlands , where frost may occur for several days in the winter, to a maximum of approximately
33 °C
(91.4 °F)
in other low-altitude areas. The average yearly temperature ranges from
28 °C
(82.4 °F)
to nearly
31 °C
(87.8 °F) . Day and night temperatures may vary by
14 °C
(57.2 °F)
to
18 °C
(64.4 °F) . [137]
A view of
Sripada
from
Maskeliya
Rainfall pattern of the country is influenced by
Monsoon
winds from the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. The "wet zone" and some
of the windward slopes of the central highlands receive up to 2,500
millimetres (98.4 in) of rain each month, but the leeward slopes in the
east and northeast receive little rain. Most of the east, southeast, and
northern parts of the country comprise the "dry zone", which receives
between 1,200 mm (47 in) and 1,900 mm (75 in) of rain annually. [138]
The arid northwest and southeast coasts receive the least amount of
rain at 800 mm (31 in) to 1,200 mm (47 in) per year. Periodic squalls
occur and sometimes
tropical cyclones
bring overcast skies and rains to the southwest, northeast, and eastern
parts of the island. Humidity is typically higher in the southwest and
mountainous areas and depends on the seasonal patterns of rainfall. [139]
Longest of the 103 rivers in the country is
Mahaweli River , covering a distance of 335 kilometres (208 mi). [140]
These waterways give rise to 51 natural waterfalls, having a height of 10 meters or more. The highest one is
Bambarakanda Falls , with a height of 263 metres (863 ft). [141]
Sri Lanka's coastline is 1,585 km long. [142]
It claims to an
Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ) extending 200
nautical miles .
This is approximately 6.7 times the country’s land area. The coastline
and adjacent waters support highly productive marine ecosystems such as
fringing
coral reefs , shallow beds of coastal and
estuarine
seagrasses . [143]
Sri Lanka inherits 45
estuaries
and 40
lagoons
too. [142]
Country's
mangrove
ecosystem which spans over 7,000
hectares , played a vital role in buffering the force in the waves of
2004 Indian Ocean tsunami . [144]
The island is rich with minerals such as
Ilmenite ,
Feldspar ,
Graphite ,
Silica ,
Kaolin ,
Mica
and
Thorium . [145] [146]
Existence of
Petroleum
in the
Gulf of Mannar
has also been confirmed and extraction attempts are underway. [147]

Flora and fauna
Main articles:
Environment of Sri Lanka
and
Wildlife of Sri Lanka
Sri Lankan Elephant
is one of three recognized
subspecies
of the
Asian Elephant , and native to Sri Lanka. According to the 2011 elephant census, the country is home to at least 5879 elephants. [148]
Lying within the
Indomalaya ecozone , Sri Lanka is one of the 25
biodiversity hotspots
in the world. [149]
Although the country is relatively small in size, it has the highest
biodiversity
per 10,000 square km in
Asia . [150]
Remarkably high proportion of the species among its flora and fauna, 27% of the 3,210
flowering plants
and 22% of the
mammals
( see
List ), are
endemic . [151]
Sri Lanka has declared 24 wildlife reserves, which are home to a wide range of native species such as
Asian elephants ,
leopards ,
sloth bears , the unique small loris, a variety of deer, the
purple-faced langur , the endangered
wild boar ,
porcupines
and
anteaters . [152]
The
Sri Lankan Leopard
( Panthera pardus kotiya )
is an
endangered
subspecies of
leopard
native to Sri Lanka.
Varieties of flowering
acacias
are well adapted to the arid conditions and flourish on the
Jaffna Peninsula . Among the trees of the dry-land forests, are some valuable species such as
satinwood ,
ebony ,
ironwood ,
mahogany
and
teak . In the wet zone, the dominant vegetation of the lowlands is a tropical
evergreen forest ,
with tall trees, broad foliage, and a dense undergrowth of vines and
creepers. Subtropical evergreen forests resembling those of
temperate climates
flourish in the higher altitudes. [153]
The
Yala National Park
in the southeast protects herds of elephant,
deer , and
peacocks , and the
Wilpattu National Park , the largest national park in Sri Lanka, in the northwest preserves the habitats of many water birds, such as
storks ,
pelicans ,
ibis , and
spoonbills . The island has four
biosphere reserves ,
Bundala ,
Hurulu Forest Reserve , the
Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya , and
Sinharaja . [154]
Out of these, Sinharaja forest reserve is home to 26 endemic birds and 20 rainforest species, including the elusive
Red-faced Malkoha ,
Green-billed Coucal
and
Sri Lanka Blue Magpie .
The untapped genetic potential of Sinharaja flora is enormous. Out of
the 211 woody trees and lianas so far identified within the reserve, 139
(66%) are endemic. The Total vegetation density, including trees,
shrubs, herbs and seedlings has been estimated to be around 240,000
individuals per
hectare .
In addition, Sri Lanka is home to over 250 types of resident birds ( see
List ). It has declared several bird sanctuaries including Kumana. [155]
During the Mahaweli Program of the 1970s and 1980s in northern Sri
Lanka, the government set aside four areas of land totalling 1,900 km 2
(730 sq mi) as national parks. However the country's forest cover,
which was around 49% in 1920, had been fallen to approximately 24% by
2009. [156] [157]

Politics
Main article:
Politics of Sri Lanka
The old parliament building of Sri Lanka, near the
Galle Face Green , now the
Presidential Secretariat .
Sri Lanka is the oldest
democracy
in
South Asia . [158] [159]
The
Donoughmore Constitution , drafted by the
Donoughmore Commission
in 1931 enabled
general elections
with adult
universal suffrage
(universal adult franchise) in the country. [160]
It was the first time a non- caucasian
country within the empires of
Western Europe
was given
one man, one vote
and the power to control domestic affairs. The
first election
under the universal adult franchise, held in June 1931, for the
Ceylon State Council . [158]
Sir
D. B. Jayatilaka
was elected as the Leader of the House. [161]
In 1944, the
Soulbury Commission
was appointed to draft a new constitution. During this time, struggle
for Independence was fought on "constitutionalist" lines under the
leadership of
D. S. Senanayake . [162]
The draft constitution was enacted in the same year and Senanayake was appointed as the Prime Minister from the
parliamentary election in 1947 . The Soulbury constitution ushered in
Dominion
status and Independence to Sri Lanka in 1948. [160]
Current politics in Sri Lanka is a contest between two rival coalitions led by the
centre-leftist
and
progressivist
United People's Freedom Alliance
(UPFA), an offspring of
Sri Lanka Freedom Party
(SLFP), and the comparatively
right-wing
and pro- capitalist
United National Party
(UNP). [163]
Sri Lanka is essentially a multi-party democracy with many smaller
Buddhist, socialist and Tamil nationalist political parties. As of July
2011, the number of registered political parties in the country is 67. [164]
Out of these, the
Lanka Sama Samaja Party
(LSSP), established in 1935 is the oldest. [165]
UNP, established by D. S. Senanayake in 1946, was considered to be the largest single political party until recently. [166]
It is the only political group which had a representation in all parliaments since the independence. [166]
SLFP was founded by
S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike , who was the
Cabinet minister
of Local Administration, before he left the UNP in July 1951. [167]
SLFP registered its first victory in 1956, defeating the ruling UNP in
1956 Parliamentary election . [167]
Following the parliamentary election in
July 1960 ,
Sirimavo Bandaranaike
became the prime minister and the world's first elected
female head of state . [168]
G. G. Ponnambalam , the
Tamil nationalist
counterpart of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, [169]
founded the
All Ceylon Tamil Congress
(ACTC) in 1944. As an objection to Ponnambalam's cooperation with D. S. Senanayake, a dissident group led by
S.J.V. Chelvanayakam
broke away in 1949 and formed the
Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi
(ITAK)
aka
Federal Party. It was the main Tamil political party in Sri Lanka for next 2 decades. [170]
Federal party advocated a more aggressive stance vis-à-vis the Sinhalese. [171]
With the constitutional reforms of 1972, these parties created a common front, the Tamil United Front (later
Tamil United Liberation Front ).
Tamil National Alliance ,
formed in October 2001 is the current successor of these Tamil
political parties which had undergone much turbulences as Tamil
militants' rise to power in late 1970s. [171] [172]
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna , a
Marxist-Leninist
political party, founded by
Rohana Wijeweera
in 1965, serves as the 3rd force in the current political context. [173]
It endorses radical leftist policies, with respect to the traditionalist leftist politics of LSSP and
Communist Party . [171]
Founded in 1981,
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress
is the largest Muslim political party in Sri Lanka. [174]

Sri Lanka is a
democratic ,
socialist
republic
and a
unitary state
which is governed by a
semi-presidential system , with a mixture of a
presidential system
and a
parliamentary system . [177]
It constitutes a
parliamentary system
governed under the
Constitution of Sri Lanka . Most provisions of the Constitution of Sri Lanka can be amended by a
two-thirds majority
in
Parliament of Sri Lanka .
However, the amendment of certain basic features such as the clauses on
language, religion, and reference to Sri Lanka as a unitary state
require both a two-thirds majority and approval at a nation-wide
referendum .
The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, Colombo
The Sri Lankan government has 3 branches:
Executive : The
President of Sri Lanka
is the
head of state , the
commander in chief
of the
armed forces , as well as
head of government , and is popularly elected for a six-year term. [178]
In the exercise of duties, the President is responsible to the parliament. The President appoints and heads a
cabinet
of
ministers
composed of elected
members of parliament . [179]
President is immune from legal proceedings while in office in respect
of any acts done or omitted to be done by him either in his official or
private capacity. [180]
With the 18th amendment to the constitution in 2010, the President has no term limit, which previously stood at 2. [181]
Legislative : The
Parliament of Sri Lanka , is a
unicameral
225-member
legislature
with 196 members elected in multi-seat
constituencies
and 29 by
proportional representation . [182]
Members are elected by universal (adult) suffrage based on a modified
proportional representation
system by district to a six-year term. The president may summon,
suspend, or end a legislative session and dissolve Parliament any time
after it has served for one year. The parliament reserves the power to
make all laws. [183]
President's deputy, the
Prime Minister , leads the
ruling party
in parliament and shares many executive responsibilities, mainly in domestic affairs.
Judicial : Sri Lanka's judiciary consists of a
Supreme Court
- the highest and final superior court of record, [183]
a Court of Appeal, High Courts and a number of subordinate courts. Its
highly complex legal system reflects diverse cultural influences. [184]
The
Criminal law
is almost entirely based on
British law . Basic
Civil law
relates to the
Roman law
and
Dutch law . Laws pertaining to marriage, divorce, and inheritance are
communal . [185]
Due to ancient customary practices and/or religion, the Sinhala customary law (Kandyan law), the
Thesavalamai
and the
Sharia law
too are followed on special cases. [186]
The President appoints judges to the Supreme Court, the Court of
Appeal, and the High Courts. A judicial service commission, composed of
the
Chief Justice
and two Supreme Court judges, appoints, transfers, and dismisses lower court judges.

For administrative purposes, Sri Lanka is divided into 9
provinces [187]
and 25
districts . [188]
Provinces
Provinces ( Sinhala :
පළාත Tamil :
மாகாணம் )
have existed in Sri Lanka since the 19th century. But they didn't have
any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the 1978
Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils following
several decades of increasing demand for a
decentralisation
of the
Government of Sri Lanka . [189]
The provincial council is an autonomous body and is not under any
Ministry. It undertakes activities which had earlier been undertaken by
the Central Government Ministries, Departments, Corporations and
Statutory Authorities. [189]
But importantly, land and police authorities are not given to provincial councils in practice. [190] [191]
Between 1988 and 2006, the Northern and Eastern provinces were temporarily merged to form the
North-East Province . [192] [193]
Prior to 1987, all administrative tasks were handled by a
district-based
civil service which had been in place since
colonial times . Now each province is administered by a directly elected provincial council:

Districts and local authorities
Sri Lanka is also divided into 25
districts
( Sinhala :
දිස්ත්‍රි‌ක්‌ක
sing.
දිස්ත්‍රික්කය Tamil :
மாவட்டம் ). [194]
Each district is administered under a
District Secretariat . The districts are further subdivided into 256
divisional secretariats , and these in turn, to approximately 14,008
Grama Niladhari
divisions. [195]
The Districts are known in Sinhala as
Disa
and in Tamil as
Māwaddam . Originally a Disa (usually rendered into English as Dissavony) was a
duchy , notably Matale and Uva. The
Government Agent , who is known as
District Secretary , administers a district.
There are 3 other types of local authorities: Municipal Councils (18), Urban councils (13) and Pradeshiya Sabha ( aka
Pradesha Sabhai, 256). [196]
Local authorities were originally based on the feudal
counties
named
korale
and
rata , and were formerly known as 'D.R.O. divisions' after the 'Divisional Revenue Officer'. [197]
Later the D.R.O.s became 'Assistant Government Agents' and the divisions were known as 'A.G.A. divisions'. These
Divisional Secretariats
are currently administered by a 'Divisional Secretary'.

Since its independence in 1948, Sri Lanka has maintained and expanded
relationships with most of the countries in the world. Analysis of its
foreign relationships helps to recognise two most important traits. One
is its commitment in principle to nonalignment, being a founding member
of the
Non-Aligned Movement
(NAM). Second one is the attempt to preserve satisfactory relations with
India
without sacrificing its independence. [199]
It became a member of the
United Nations
in 1955. Sri Lanka also is a member of the
Commonwealth , the
SAARC ,
World Bank ,
International Monetary Fund ,
Asian Development Bank
and the
Colombo Plan .
Sri Lanka continues its active participation in the NAM, while also
stressing the importance it places on regionalism by playing a strong
role in SAARC.
One of the two parties that have governed Sri Lanka since its independence,
UNP , is traditionally biased towards the West, with respect to its left-leaning counterpart,
SLFP . [199]
Sri Lankan Finance Minister J. R. Jayewardene, together with the then
Australian Foreign Minister Sir Percy Spencer, proposed the
Colombo Plan
at Commonwealth Foreign Minister’s Conference held in Colombo in 1950. [200]
In a remarkable move, Sri Lanka spoke in defence for a free
Japan , while many countries were reluctant to allow a free Japan, at the
San Francisco Peace Conference
in 1951, and refused to accept the payment of reparations for that damage it had done to the country during
World War II , that would harm Japan's economy. [201]
Sri Lanka-China relations started as soon as the
PRC
was formed in 1949. Two countries signed an important Rice-Rubber Pact in 1952. [202]
Sri Lanka played a vital role in
Asian–African Conference
in 1955, which was an important step toward the crystallization of the NAM. [203]
The Bandaranaike government of 1956 significantly digressed from the
pro-western policies of UNP government. Sri Lanka immediately recognised
the new
Cuba
under
Fidel Castro
in 1959. Shortly after, Cuba's legendary revolutionary
Ernesto Che Guevara
paid a visit to Sri Lanka. [204]
The
Sirima - Shastri
Pact
of 1964 [205]
and
Sirima- Gandhi
Pact
of 1974 [206]
were signed between Sri Lankan and Indian leaders in an attempt to solve the
long standing dispute
over the status of
plantation workers of Indian origin . In 1974,
Kachchatheevu , a small island in
Palk Strait
was formally ceded to Sri Lanka. [207]
By this time, Sri Lanka was strongly involved in the NAM and
Colombo
held the fifth NAM summit of 1976. [208]
The relationship between Sri Lanka and India became tensed under the government of
J. R. Jayawardene . [121] [209]
As a result, India
intervened
in Sri Lankan Civil War and subsequently deployed the
Indian Peace Keeping Force
in 1987. [210]
In the present, Sri Lanka enjoys extensive relations with China, [211]
Russia [212]
and
Pakistan . [213]
Boats belonging to the
Sri Lanka Navy
The
Sri Lanka Armed Forces , comprising the
Sri Lanka Army , the
Sri Lanka Navy
and the
Sri Lanka Air Force , comes under the
purview
of the
Ministry of Defence
(MoD). [214]
The total strength of the three services is around 259,000 personnel, with nearly 36,000 reserves. [215]
Sri Lanka has not enforced
military conscription . [216]
Paramilitary units include the
Special Task Force , the
Civil Security Force
and the
Sri Lanka Coast Guard [217] [218]
Since independence from Britain in 1948, the primary focus of the
armed forces has been on internal security, due to three major
insurgencies, two by
Marxist
militants of the
JVP
and a 30 year long conflict with the
LTTE
which has been
proscribed
as a
terrorist organisation
by
32 countries .
Due to these conflicts, the armed forces had expanded to its current
size and are in a continuous mobilized state for the last 30 years. [219]
Marking a rare occurrence in modern military history, Sri Lankan military was able to bring a decisive end to the
Sri Lankan Civil War
in May 2009. [220]
Sri Lanka claimed itself the first country in the modern world to eradicate
terrorism
on its own soil. [221]
Sri Lankan Armed Forces have engaged in
United Nations
peacekeeping
operations since the early 1960s. It has contributed with forces as
permanent contingents deployed in several UN peacekeeping missions in
Chad ,
Lebanon
and
Haiti . [222]

According to the
International Monetary Fund , Sri Lanka claims to a US$50 billion economy as of 2010. [5]
It has a
GDP
of US$106.5 billion in terms of
purchasing power parity . Sri Lanka is next only to
Maldives
in the South Asian region in terms of
per capita income , with a nominal value of US$2,435 and PPP value of US$5,220. [5]
It recorded a GDP growth of 8.2% in 2010 and it is estimated that GDP will grow by 9.5% in 2011, becoming one of the
fastest growing economies
of the world. [5]

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Sri Lanka became a
plantation economy , famous for its production and export of
cinnamon ,
rubber
and
Ceylon tea , which remains a trademark national export. [223]
The development of modern ports under British rule raised the strategic importance of the island as a centre of trade. [224]
From 1948 to 1977
socialism
strongly influenced the government's economic policies. Colonial
plantations were dismantled, industries were nationalised and a
welfare state
established. In 1977 the
Free market economy
was introduced to the country, incorporating
privatisation ,
deregulation
and the promotion of
private enterprise . [114]
While the production and export of tea, rubber, coffee, sugar and
other agricultural commodities remains important, the nation has moved
steadily towards an industrialised economy with the development of
food processing ,
textiles ,
telecommunications
and
finance . Main economic sectors of the country are
tourism ,
tea export ,
clothing ,
rice production and other agricultural products. In addition to these
economic sectors, overseas employment contributes highly in foreign
exchange, most of them from the
Middle East . [225]
As of 2010, service sector makes up 60% of GDP, industrial sector 28% and agriculture sector 12%. [225]
Private sector accounts for 85% of the economy. [226]
India is the largest trading partner of Sri Lanka. [227]
Economic disparies exist between the provinces, with
Western province
contributing to 45.1% of the GDP,
Southern province
and
Central province , 10.7% and 10% respectively. [228]
With the end of the war,
Northern province
reported a record 22.9% GDP growth in 2010. [229]
Sri Lanka's most widely known export,
Ceylon tea , which is considered the "cleanest" tea in the world. Sri Lanka is also the world's 2nd largest exporter of tea. [230]
The per capita income of Sri Lanka has doubled since 2005. [231]
During the same period, poverty has dropped from 15.2% to 7.6%, unemployment has dropped from 7.2% to 4.9%,
market capitalization
of
CSE
has quadrupled and
budget deficit
has doubled. [225]
90% of the households in Sri Lanka are electrified, 87.3% of the
population have access to safe drinking water and 39% have access to
pipe-borne water. [225]
Income inequality has also dropped in recent years, indicated by a
gini coefficient
of 0.36 in 2010. [6]
Sri Lanka's cellular subscriber base has shown a staggering 550% growth, from 2005 to 2010. [225]
Sri Lanka was the first country in the South Asian region to introduce
3G
(Third Generation), 3.5G
HSDPA , 3.75G
HSUPA
and 4G
LTE
mobile broadband Internet technologies. [232]
The
Global Competitiveness Report
published by the
World Economic Forum
has listed Sri Lanka as a transitive economy, from factor-driven stage
to efficiency-driven stage, ranking 52nd in the global competitiveness. [233]
It also ranked 45th in health and primary education, 32nd in business
sophistication, 42nd in innovation and 41st in goods market efficiency
out of the 142 countries surveyed. Sri Lanka ranks 8th in the
World Giving Index , registering high levels of contentment and charitable behaviour in its society. [234]
In 2010,
The New York Times
placed Sri Lanka at number 1 position in 31 places to visit. [235]
Dow Jones
classified Sri Lanka as an
emerging market
in 2010, and
Citigroup
classified it as a
3G country
in February 2011. [236]
Sri Lanka ranks well above other South Asian countries in
Human Development Index
(HDI) with 0.658 points. [237]
Although poverty has reduced by 50% during last 5 years,
malnutrition
remains a problem among children. 29% of the children under 5 years of age are reported to be underweight. [238]
Nearly 58% of infants between 6 and 11 months and 38% of children between 12 and 23 months are
anaemic . While
Dengue
remains the major infectious disease, [239]
non-communicable diseasees
(NCDs) account for 85% of ill health, disability and early death in Sri Lanka. [240]
Sri Lankans have a
life expectancy
of 77.9 years at birth, which is 10% higher than the world average. [225]
Infant mortality rate stands at 8.5 per 1000 births and maternal
mortality rate at 0.39 per 1000 births, which is in par with figures of
the developed countries. The universal, "pro-poor" [241]
health care system adopted by the country has contributed much towards these figures. [242]
Sri Lanka has a A and B class road network exceeding 12,000 kilometres (7,460 mi). [243]
It consists of 35
A grade highways
and
an expressway , connecting major cities. In addition, several other

Sri Lanka is the 53rd most populated nation in the world, with an annual population growth rate of 0.73%. [246]
Sri Lanka has a
birth rate
of 17.6 births per 1,000 people and a
death rate
of 6.2 deaths per 1,000 people. [225]
Population density is highest in western Sri Lanka, especially in and around the capital.
Sinhalese
constitute the largest ethnic group in the country, with 74% of the total population. [214]
Sri Lankan Tamils
are the second major ethnic group in the island, with a percentage of 12.6.
Sri Lankan Moors
comprise 7.4%.
Tamils of Indian origin
were brought into the country as indentured labourers by British
colonists to work on estate plantations. Nearly 50% of them were
repatriated
following independence in 1948, [247]
They are distinguished from the native Tamil population that has
resided in Sri Lanka since ancient times. There are also small ethnic
groups such as the
Burghers
(of mixed European descent) and
Austronesian peoples
from Southeast Asia. Moreover, there is a small population of
Vedda people
whom are believed to be the original indigenous group to inhabit the island. [248]
Temple of the Tooth

Buddhism in Sri Lanka , 16th century.
Sinhalese

of Sri Lanka. [249]
Constitution defines
English
as the link language. English is widely used for education, scientific and commercial purposes. Members of the
Burgher
community speak variant forms of
Portuguese Creole
and Dutch with varying proficiency, while members of the Malay community speak a form of
Creole
Malay
that is unique to the island. [250]
Sri Lanka is also a multi-religious country.
Buddhism
constitutes the religious faith of about 70% of the population of the island, [251]
most of whom follow the
Theravada
school of Buddhism. [252]
Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka in the 2nd century BCE by Venerable
Mahinda . [252]
A sapling of the
Bodhi Tree
under which
the Buddha
attained enlightenment was brought to Sri Lanka during the same time. The
Pali Canon
( Thripitakaya ), having previously been preserved as an oral tradition, was first committed to writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE. [253]
Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any predominately Buddhist nation, [252]
with the
Sangha
having existed in a largely unbroken lineage since its introduction in
the 2nd century BCE. During periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic
lineage was revived through contact with
Thailand
and
Burma . [253]
The
Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil ,
Jaffna
is one of the most sacred places for
Hinduism in Sri Lanka , 10th century.
Hinduism
is the second most prevalent religion in Sri Lanka which also arrived
from India. Hinduism is dominant in Northern, Eastern and Central Sri
Lanka. It was primarily established in Sri Lanka by migrants and often
invaders from southern India, [254]
Islam
is the third most dominant religion in the country, having first been
brought to the island by Arab traders over the course of many centuries,
most are
Sunni
who follow the
Shafi'i
school. [255]
Most followers of
Islam in Sri Lanka
today are believed to be descendants of these Arab traders and the
local women they married. In addition about 5% of the followers of Islam
in the country comprise of Malays who descend from Malay Military
regiments brought to the country during British colonial rule and
political exiles from Indonesian islands and Malay peninsula during the
same colonial period.

Around 8% of the Sri Lankan population are Christians. Out of them, 88% are
Roman Catholics , who trace their religious heritage directly to the Portuguese. Rest of the Christians are evenly split between the
Anglican Church of Ceylon
and other
Protestant faiths . [258]
There is also a small population of
Zoroastrian
immigrants from India ( Parsis ) who settled in Ceylon during the period of British rule. [259]
But the community has steadily dwindled in recent years. [260]
Religion plays a prominent role in the life and culture of Sri Lankans. The
Buddhist
majority observe Poya Days, once per month according to the
Lunar calendar . The
Hindus
and
Muslims
also observe their own holidays. Sri Lanka was ranked the 3rd most religious country in the world by a 2008
Gallup poll , with 99% of Sri Lankans saying religion is an important part of their daily life. [261]

Culture
Main article:
Culture of Sri Lanka
Hindu Devotess engaing in 'Kavadi' at a Vavuniya temple.
The culture of Sri Lanka dates back over 2500 years. [262]
It is influenced primarily by
Buddhism
and
Hinduism . [263]
According to Islamic folklore,
Adam and Eve
were offered refuge on the island as solace for their expulsion from the
Garden of Eden . [264]
The island is the home to two main traditional cultures: the Sinhalese
(centred in the ancient cities of Kandy and Anuradhapura) and the Tamil
(centred in the city of Jaffna). In more recent times, the British
colonial culture has also influenced the locals. Sri Lanka claims a
democratic tradition matched by few other developing countries. [264]
The first Tamil immigration was probably around the 3rd century BC. [263]
Tamils co-existed with the Sinhalese people since then, and the early
mixing rendered the two ethnic groups almost physically indistinct. [265]
Ancient Sri Lanka is marked for its genius in
hydraulic engineering
and
architecture .
The rich cultural traditions is the basis of the country's long life
expectancy, advanced health standards and high literacy rate. [264]

("appa"), etc. [266]
Jackfruit
may replace rice and curries at times. Traditional meals are usually served on
plantain leaf .
Middle Eastern influences and practices are found in traditional
Moor
dishes. While Dutch and Portuguese influences are found with the
island's Burgher community preserving their culture through traditional
favourites such as Lamprais (rice cooked in stock and baked in a banana
leaf), Breudher (Dutch
Christmas cake ) and Bolo Fiado (Portuguese-style layer cake).
Every year in mid April, Sri Lankans celebrate the
Sinhalese
and
Hindu
new year festival. [267]
In addition,
Esala Perahera , a symbolic
Buddhist festival
consisting of dances and richly decorated elephants, is held in

A view of the
Kandy
Esala Perahera .
The movie
Kadawunu Poronduwa
(The broken promise), produced by S. M. Nayagam of Chitra Kala Movietone, heralded the coming of Sri Lankan cinema in 1947.
Ranmuthu Duwa
(Island of treasures, 1962) marked the transition cinema from
black-and-white
to color. It in the recent years has featured subjects such as family
melodrama , social transformation and the years of conflict between the military and the
LTTE . [269]
Their cinematic style is similar to the
Bollywood
movies. In 1979, movie attendance rose to an all-time high, but recoded a gradual downfall since then. [270]
Undoubtedly the most influential and revolutionary filmmaker in the history of Sri Lankan cinema is
Lester James Peiris , who has directed a number of movies which led to global acclaim, including
Rekava
(Line of destiny, 1956),
Gamperaliya
(The changing village, 1964),
Nidhanaya
(The treasure, 1970) and
Golu Hadawatha
(Cold heart, 1968). [271]
The earliest music in Sri Lanka came from theatrical performances such as
Kolam ,
Sokari
and
Nadagam . [272]
Traditional music instruments such as
Béra ,
Thammátama ,
Daŭla
and
Răbān
were performed at these dramas. The first music album,
Nurthi , was released through
Radio Ceylon , in 1903. Songwriters like
Mahagama Sekara
and
Ananda Samarakoon
and musicians such as
W. D. Amaradeva ,
H. R. Jothipala
and
Clarence Wijewardene
have contributed much towards the upliftment of Sri Lankan music. [273]
Baila
is another popular
music genre
in the country, originated among
Kaffirs
or the or Afro-Sinhalese community. [274]
A Low Country drummer, playing the traditional

There are three main styles of Sri Lankan classical dance. They are, the
Kandyan dances , low country dances and
Sabaragamuwa
dances. Out of these, the Kandyan style, which flourished under kings of the
Kingdom of Kandy , is more prominent. It is a sophisticated form of dance, [275]
that consists of five sub-categories:
Ves dance ,
Naiyandi dance ,
Udekki dance ,
Pantheru dance
and
18 Vannam . [276]
An elaborate headdress is worn by the male dancers and a drum called
Geta Béraya
is used to assist the dancer to keep on rhythm. [275]
In addition, four folk drama variants named
Sokri ,
Kolam ,
Nadagam ,
Pasu , and several devil dance variants such as
Sanni Yakuma
and
Kohomba Kankariya
can be also observed. [276]
An example of Sri Lankan handicrafts.
The history of Sri Lankan painting and sculpture can be traced as far back as to the 2nd or 3rd century BC. [277]
The earliest mention about the art of painting on Mahavamsa, is to the
drawing of a palace on cloth using cinnabar in the 2nd century BC. The
chronicles have description of various paintings in relic-chambers of
Buddhist stupas, and in monastic residence.
Theatre
moved into the country when a
Parsi
company from
Mumbai
introduced
Nurti , a blend of European and Indian theatrical conventions to the Colombo audience in 19th century. [276]
The golden age of Sri Lankan drama and theatre began with the staging of
Maname , a play written by
Ediriweera Sarachchandra
in 1956. [278]
It was followed by a series of popular dramas like
Sinhabāhu ,
Pabāvatī ,
Mahāsāra ,
Muudu Puththu
and
Subha saha Yasa .
The history of Sri Lankan literature runs at least two millennia back, and is heir to the
Aryan
literary tradition as embodied in the hymns of the
Rigveda . [279]
The
Pāli Canon , the standard collection of
scriptures
in the
Theravada
Buddhist
tradition, was written down in Sri Lanka during the
Fourth Buddhist council , at the Alulena cave temple,
Kegalle , as early as 29 BC. [280]
Ancient chronicles such as Mahāvamsa, which was written in 6th century
provide vivid descriptions of Sri Lankan dynasty. According to the
German philosopher
Wilhelm Geiger , the chronicles are based on Sinhala
Atthakatha
(commentary), that dates few more centuries back. [279]
The oldest surviving prose work is the
Dhampiya-Atuva-Getapadaya , compiled in the 9th century. [279]
The greatest literary feats of medieval Sri Lanka include
Sandesha Kāvya
(poetic messages) such as
Girā Sandeshaya
(Parrot message),
Hansa Sandeshaya
(Swan message) and
Salalihini Sandeshaya
(Myna message). Poetry including
Kavsilumina ,
Kavya-Sekharaya
(diadem of poetry) and proses such as
Saddharma-Ratnāvaliya ,
Amāvatura
(Flood of nectar) and
Pujāvaliya
are also notable works of this period, which is considered to be the golden age of Sri Lankan literature. [279]
The first modern-day novel,
Meena , a work of Simon de Silva appeared in 1905, [276]
and was followed by a number of revolutionary literary works.
Martin Wickramasinghe , the author of
Madol Doova
is considered the iconic figure of Sri Lankan literature. [281]

With a

of 92.5%, [225]
Sri Lanka has one of the most
literate
populations
amongst
developing nations . [282]
Its youth literacy rate stands at 98%, [283]
computer literacy rate at 35%, [284]
and primary school enrolment rate at over 99%. [285]
An education system which dictates 9 years of
compulsory schooling
for every child is in place. The
free education system
established in 1945, [286]
is a result of the initiative of
C. W. W. Kannangara
and A. Ratnayake. [284] [287]
It is one of the few countries in the world that provides universal free education from primary to tertiary stage. [288]
Kannangara led the establishment of the
Madhya Maha Vidyalayas
(Central Schools) in different parts of the country in order to provide education to Sri Lanka's rural children. [284]
In 1942 a special education committee proposed extensive reforms to establish an efficient and quality
education system
for the people. However in the 1980s changes to this system saw the
separation the of administration of schools between the central
government and the provincial government. Thus the elite
National Schools
are controlled directly by the
Ministry of Education
and the provincial schools by the provincial government. Sri Lanka has
approximately 9675 government schools, 817 private schools and
Pirivenas . [225]
The number of
public universities
in Sri Lanka is 15. [289]
However, lack of responsiveness of the education system to labor market
requirements, disparities in access to quality education, lack of an
effective linkage between secondary and tertiary education remain major
challenges for the education sector. [290]
A number of private, degree awarding institutions have emerged in
recent times to fill in these gaps. But still, the participation at
tertiary level education hovers around 5.1%. [291]

Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation
(formerly
Radio Ceylon ) is the oldest-running radio station in Asia. [292]
It was established in 1923 by
Edward Harper
just three years after broadcasting was launched in Europe. [292]
The station broadcasts services in Sinhalese, Tamil, English and
Hindi .
Since the 1980s, a large number of private radio stations have also
been introduced. Broadcast television was introduced to the country in
1979 when the
Independent Television Network
was launched. Initially all Television stations were state controlled,
but private television networks began broadcasts in 1992. [293]
As of 2010, 51 newspapers (30 Sinhala, 10 Tamil, 11 English) are
published and 34 TV stations and 52 radio stations are operated in the
country. [225]
However in the recent years,
freedom of the press
in Sri Lanka has been widely criticised by media freedom groups. [294]
Human rights as ratified by the
United Nations
are guaranteed by the constitution of Sri Lanka. However the
human rights in Sri Lanka
has also come under criticism by human rights groups such as
Amnesty International
and
Human Rights Watch , [295]
as well as the
United States Department of State . [296]
Both the separatist
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) and the
government of Sri Lanka
are accused of violating
human rights . A
report by an advisory panel to the UN secretary-general
has accused both Sri Lankan government and the LTTE on
alleged war crimes
committed during final stages of the civil war. [297]

Dengue fever
( UK:  /ˈdɛŋɡeɪ/ ,
US:  /ˈdɛŋɡiː/ ), also known as
breakbone fever , is an infectious
tropical disease
caused by the
dengue virus . Symptoms include
fever ,
headache ,
muscle
and
joint pains , and a characteristic
skin rash
that is
similar to measles . In a small proportion of cases the disease develops into the life-threatening
dengue hemorrhagic fever , resulting in
bleeding ,
low levels of blood platelets
and blood plasma leakage, or into
dengue shock syndrome , where
dangerously low blood pressure
occurs.
Dengue is transmitted by several species of
mosquito
within the
genus
Aedes , principally
A. aegypti . The virus has four different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong
immunity
to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent
infection with a different type increases the risk of severe
complications. As there is no
vaccine , prevention is sought by reducing the habitat and the number of mosquitoes and limiting exposure to bites.
Treatment of acute dengue is supportive, using either oral or intravenous
rehydration
for mild or moderate disease, and
intravenous fluids
and
blood transfusion
for more severe cases. The
incidence
of dengue fever has increased dramatically since the 1960s, with around
50–100 million people infected yearly. Early descriptions of the
condition date from 1779, and its viral cause and the transmission were
elucidated in the early 20th century. Dengue has become a global problem
since the
Second World War
and is
endemic
in more than 110 countries. Apart from eliminating the mosquitoes, work
is ongoing on a vaccine, as well as medication targeted directly at the
virus.

Signs and symptoms
Schematic depiction of the symptoms of dengue fever
Typically, people infected with dengue virus are
asymptomatic
(80%) or only have mild symptoms such as an uncomplicated fever. [1] [2] [3]
Others have more severe illness (5%), and in a small proportion it is life-threatening. [1] [3]
The
incubation period
(time between exposure and onset of symptoms) ranges from 3–14 days, but most often it is 4–7 days. [4]
Therefore, travelers returning from endemic areas are unlikely to have
dengue if fever or other symptoms start more than 14 days after arriving
home. [5]
Children often experience symptoms similar to those of the
common cold
and
gastroenteritis
(vomiting and diarrhea), [6]
but are more susceptible to the severe complications. [5]
[ edit ]
Clinical course
The characteristic symptoms of dengue are sudden-onset fever,
headache (typically located behind the eyes), muscle and joint pains,
and a rash. The alternative name for dengue, "break-bone fever", comes
from the associated muscle and joint pains. [1] [7]
The course of infection is divided into three phases: febrile, critical, and recovery. [8]
The febrile phase involves high fever, often over
40 °C
(104 °F) , and is associated with generalized pain and a headache; this usually lasts two to seven days. [7] [8]
At this stage, a rash occurs in approximately 50–80% of those with symptoms. [7] [9]
It occurs in the first or second day of symptoms as
flushed skin , or later in the course of illness (days 4–7), as a
measles-like
rash. [9] [10]
Some
petechiae
(small red spots that do not disappear when the skin is pressed, which are caused by broken
capillaries ) can appear at this point, [8]
as may some mild bleeding from the
mucous membranes
of the mouth and nose. [5] [7]
The fever itself is classically
biphasic
in nature, breaking and then returning for one or two days, although
there is wide variation in how often this pattern actually happens. [10] [11]
In some people, the disease proceeds to a critical phase, which
follows the resolution of the high fever and typically lasts one to two
days. [8]
During this phase there may be significant fluid accumulation in the
chest
and
abdominal cavity
due to increased
capillary permeability
and leakage. This leads to
depletion of fluid from the circulation
and
decreased blood supply to vital organs . [8]
During this phase, organ dysfunction and severe
bleeding , typically from the
gastrointestinal tract , may occur. [5] [8]
Shock
(dengue shock syndrome) and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever) occur in less than 5% of all cases of dengue, [5]
however those who have previously been infected with other
serotypes
of dengue virus ("secondary infection") are at an increased risk. [5] [12]
The recovery phase occurs next, with resorption of the leaked fluid into the bloodstream. [8]
This usually lasts two to three days. [5]
The improvement is often striking, but there may be severe
itching
and a
slow heart rate . [5] [8]
During this stage, a
fluid overload
state may occur; if it
affects the brain , it may cause a
reduced level of consciousness
or
seizures . [5]
[ edit ]
Associated problems
Dengue can occasionally affect several other
body systems , [8]
either in isolation or along with the classic dengue symptoms. [6]
A decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0.5–6% of severe cases, which is attributable either to
infection of the brain by the virus
or indirectly as a result of impairment of vital organs, for example, the
liver . [6] [11]
Other neurological disorders have been reported in the context of dengue, such as
transverse myelitis
and
Guillain-Barré syndrome . [6]
Infection of the heart
and
acute liver failure
are among the rarer complications. [5] [8]

Virology
Main article:
Dengue virus
A
TEM
micrograph
showing dengue virus
virions
(the cluster of dark dots near the center)
Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an
RNA virus
of the family
Flaviviridae ; genus
Flavivirus . Other members of the same genus include
yellow fever virus ,
West Nile virus ,
St. Louis encephalitis virus ,
Japanese encephalitis virus ,
tick-borne encephalitis virus ,
Kyasanur forest disease virus , and
Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus . [11]
Most are transmitted by
arthropods
(mosquitoes or
ticks ), and are therefore also referred to as
arboviruses
( ar thropod- bo rne viruses). [11]
The dengue virus
genome
(genetic material) contains about 11,000
nucleotide bases , which
code
for the three different types of protein molecules (C, prM and E) that form the
virus particle
and seven other types of protein molecules (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a,
NS4b, NS5) that are only found in infected host cells and are required
for replication of the virus. [12] [13]
There are four strains of the virus, which are called
serotypes , and these are referred to as DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. [2]
All four serotypes can cause the full spectrum of disease. [12]
Infection with one serotype is believed to produce lifelong immunity to
that serotype but only short term protection against the others. [2] [7]
The severe complications on secondary infection occurs particularly
if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 then contracts serotype
DENV-2 or serotype DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to type
DENV-3 then acquires DENV-2. [13]
[ edit ]
Transmission
The mosquito
Aedes aegypti
feeding off a human host
Dengue virus is primarily transmitted by
Aedes
mosquitoes, particularly
A. aegypti . [2]
These mosquitoes usually live between the
latitudes
of 35° North and 35° South below an
elevation
of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). [2]
They bite primarily during the day. [14]
Other
Aedes
species that transmit the disease include
A. albopictus ,
A. polynesiensis
and
A. scutellaris . [2]
Humans are the primary
host
of the virus, [2] [11]
but it also circulates in nonhuman
primates . [15]
An infection can be acquired via a single bite. [16]
A female mosquito that takes a blood meal from a person infected with
dengue fever becomes itself infected with the virus in the cells lining
its gut. About 8–10 days later, the virus spreads to other tissues
including the mosquito's
salivary glands
and is subsequently released into its saliva. The virus seems to have
no detrimental effect on the mosquito, which remains infected for life.
Aedes aegypti
prefers to lay its eggs in artificial water containers, to live in
close proximity to humans, and to feed off people rather than other
vertebrates. [17]
Dengue can also be transmitted via infected
blood products
and through
organ donation . [18] [19]
In countries such as
Singapore , where dengue is endemic, the risk is estimated to be between 1.6 and 6 per 10,000
transfusions . [20]
Vertical transmission
(from mother to child) during pregnancy or at birth has been reported. [21]
Other person-to-person modes of transmission have also been reported, but are very unusual. [7]
[ edit ]
Predisposition
Severe disease is more common in babies and young children, and in
contrast to many other infections it is more common in children that are
relatively well nourished. [5]
Women are more at risk than men. [13]
Dengue can be life-threatening in people with
chronic diseases
such as
diabetes
and
asthma . [13]
Polymorphisms
(normal variations) in particular
genes
have been linked with an increased risk of severe dengue complications.
Examples include the genes coding for the proteins known as
TNFα ,
mannan-binding lectin , [1]
CTLA4 ,
TGFβ , [12]
DC-SIGN , and particular
forms
of
human leukocyte antigen . [13]
A common genetic abnormality in Africans, known as
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency , appears to increase the risk. [22]
Polymorphisms in the genes for the
vitamin D receptor
and
FcγR
seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary dengue infection. [13]
[ edit ]
Mechanism
When a mosquito carrying dengue virus bites a person, the virus
enters the skin together with the mosquito's saliva. It binds to and
enters
white blood cells ,
and reproduces inside the cells while they move throughout the body.
The white blood cells respond by producing a number of signaling
proteins, such as
interferon ,
which are responsible for many of the symptoms, such as the fever, the
flu-like symptoms and the severe pains. In severe infection, the virus
production inside the body is greatly increased, and many more organs
(such as the
liver
and the
bone marrow )
can be affected, and fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall
of small blood vessels into body cavities. As a result, less blood
circulates in the blood vessels, and the blood pressure becomes so low
that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs. Furthermore,
dysfunction of the bone marrow leads to reduced numbers of platelets,
which are necessary for effective blood clotting; this increases the
risk of bleeding, the other major complication of dengue fever. [22]
[ edit ]
Viral reproduction
Once inside the skin, dengue virus binds to
Langerhans cells
(a population of
dendritic cells
in the skin that identifies pathogens). [22]
The virus
enters the cells
through binding between viral proteins and
membrane proteins
on the Langerhans cell, specifically the
C-type lectins
called DC-SIGN,
mannose receptor
and
CLEC5A . [12]
DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, seems to be the main point of entry. [13]
The dendritic cell moves to the nearest
lymph node . Meanwhile, the virus genome is replicated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's
endoplasmic reticulum ,
where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral
proteins, and the viral RNA is copied. Immature virus particles are
transported to the
Golgi apparatus , the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains ( glycoproteins ). The now mature new viruses bud on the surface of the infected cell and are released by
exocytosis . They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as
monocytes
and
macrophages . [12]
The initial reaction of infected cells is to produce
interferon , a
cytokine
that raises a number of defenses against viral infection through the
innate immune system
by augmenting the production of a large group of proteins mediated by the
JAK-STAT pathway . Some serotypes of dengue virus appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process. Interferon also activates the
adaptive immune system , which leads to the generation of
antibodies
against the virus as well as
T cells
that directly attack any cell infected with the virus. [12]
Various antibodies are generated; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for
phagocytosis
(ingestion by
specialized cells
and destruction), but some bind the virus less well and appear instead
to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not
destroyed but is able to replicate further. [12]
[ edit ]
Severe disease
Further information:
Antibody-dependent enhancement
It is not entirely clear why secondary infection with a different
strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever
and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that
of
antibody-dependent enhancement
(ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It may be caused by
poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong
compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for
destruction. [12] [13]
There is a suspicion that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications, [1]
and various lines of research have implied a role for
T cells
and soluble factors such as
cytokines
and the
complement system . [22]
Severe disease is marked by two problems: dysfunction of
endothelium
(the cells that line blood vessels) and disordered
blood clotting . [6]
Endothelial dysfunction leads to the leakage of fluid from the blood
vessels into the chest and abdominal cavities, while coagulation
disorder is responsible for the bleeding complications. Higher viral
load in the blood and involvement of other organs (such as the
bone marrow
and the
liver )
are associated with more severe disease. Cells in the affected organs
die, leading to the release of cytokines and activation of both
coagulation and
fibrinolysis
(the opposing systems of blood clotting and clot degradation). These
alterations together lead to both endothelial dysfunction and
coagulation disorder. [22]

Diagnosis
Warning signs [23]
Abdominal pain
Ongoing vomiting
Liver enlargement
Mucosal bleeding
High
hematocrit
with low
platelets
Lethargy
The diagnosis of dengue is typically made clinically, on the basis of reported symptoms and
physical examination ; this applies especially in endemic areas. [1]
However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other
viral infections . [5]
A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following:
nausea
and vomiting, rash, generalized pains,
low white blood cell count , positive
tourniquet test , or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an
endemic
area. [23]
Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. [8]
The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no
laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the
application of a
blood pressure cuff
for five minutes, followed by the counting of any
petechial
hemorrhages; a higher number makes a diagnosis of dengue more likely. [8]
It can be difficult to distinguish dengue fever and
chikungunya , a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue. [7]
Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as
malaria ,
leptospirosis ,
typhoid fever , and
meningococcal disease . [5]
The earliest change detectable on laboratory investigations is a low white blood cell count, which may then be followed by
low platelets
and
metabolic acidosis . [5]
In severe disease, plasma leakage results in
hemoconcentration
(as indicated by a rising
hematocrit ) and
hypoalbuminemia . [5]
Pleural effusions
or
ascites
can be detected by physical examination when large, [5]
but the demonstration of fluid on
ultrasound
may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. [1] [5]
The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. [1]
[ edit ]
Classification
The
World Health Organization 's 2009 classification divides dengue fever into two groups: uncomplicated and severe. [1] [23]
This replaces the 1997 WHO classification, which needed to be
simplified as it had been found to be too restrictive, though the older
classification is still widely used. [23]
The 1997 classification divided dengue into undifferentiated fever, dengue fever, and dengue hemorrhagic fever. [5] [24]
Dengue hemorrhagic fever was subdivided further into grades I–IV. Grade
I is the presence only of easy bruising or a positive tourniquet test
in someone with fever, grade II is the presence of spontaneous bleeding
into the skin and elsewhere, grade III is the clinical evidence of
shock , and grade IV is shock so severe that
blood pressure
and
pulse
cannot be detected. [24]
Grades III and IV are referred to as "dengue shock syndrome". [23] [24]
[ edit ]
Laboratory tests
Dengue fever may be diagnosed by microbiological laboratory testing. [23]
This can be done by virus isolation in
cell cultures ,
nucleic acid detection
by
PCR , viral
antigen
detection or specific
antibodies
(serology). [13] [25]
Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than
antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their
greater cost. [25]
All tests may be negative in the early stages of the disease. [5] [13]
These laboratory tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute
phase of the illness with the exception of serology. Tests for dengue
virus-specific antibodies, types
IgG
and
IgM ,
can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the
infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest
levels ( titres )
of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also
produced in secondary and tertiary infections. The IgM becomes
undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following
re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years
and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past
infection. After a primary infection the IgG reaches peak levels in the
blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier
and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective
immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus. In the laboratory test
the IgG and the IgM antibodies can cross-react with other flaviviruses,
such as
yellow fever virus , which can make the interpretation of the serology difficult. [7] [13] [26]
The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood
samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase
in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the
detection of IgM is considered diagnostic. [26]
[ edit ]
Prevention
A 1920s photograph of efforts to disperse standing water and thus decrease mosquito populations
There are no approved
vaccines
for the dengue virus. [1]
Prevention thus depends on control of and protection from the bites of the mosquito that transmits it. [14] [27]
The World Health Organization recommends an Integrated Vector Control
program consisting of five elements: (1) Advocacy, social mobilization
and legislation to ensure that public health bodies and communities are
strengthened, (2) collaboration between the health and other sectors
(public and private), (3) an integrated approach to disease control to
maximize use of resources, (4) evidence-based decision making to ensure
any interventions are targeted appropriately and (5) capacity-building
to ensure an adequate response to the local situation. [14]
The primary method of controlling
A. aegypti
is by eliminating its
habitats . [14]
This is done by emptying containers of water or by adding
insecticides
or
biological control agents
to these areas, [14]
although spraying with
organophosphate
or
pyrethroid
insecticides is not thought to be effective. [3]
Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification
is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative
health effect from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with
control agents. [14]
People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using
mosquito netting
while resting, and/or the application of
insect repellent
( DEET
being the most effective). [16]
[ edit ]
Management
There are no specific treatments for dengue fever. [1]
Treatment depends on the symptoms, varying from
oral rehydration therapy
at home with close follow-up, to hospital admission with administration of
intravenous fluids
and/or
blood transfusion . [28]
A decision for hospital admission is typically based on the presence of
the "warning signs" listed in the table above, especially in those with
preexisting health conditions. [5]
Intravenous hydration is usually only needed for one or two days. [28]
The rate of fluid administration is titrated to a
urinary output
of 0.5–1 mL/kg/hr, stable
vital signs
and normalization of
hematocrit . [5]
Invasive medical procedures such as
nasogastric intubation ,
intramuscular injections
and arterial punctures are avoided, in view of the bleeding risk. [5]
Paracetamol
(acetaminophen) is used for fever and discomfort while
NSAIDs
such as
ibuprofen
and
aspirin
are avoided as they might aggravate the risk of bleeding. [28]
Blood transfusion is initiated early in patients presenting with unstable vital signs in the face of a
decreasing hematocrit , rather than waiting for the hemoglobin concentration to decrease to some predetermined "transfusion trigger" level. [29]
Packed red blood cells
or
whole blood
are recommended, while
platelets
and
fresh frozen plasma
are usually not. [29]
During the recovery phase intravenous fluids are discontinued to prevent a state of
fluid overload . [5]
If fluid overload occurs and vital signs are stable, stopping further fluid may be all that is needed. [29]
If a person is outside of the critical phase, a
loop diuretic
such as
furosemide
may be used to eliminate excess fluid from the circulation. [29]

Epidemiology

Most people with dengue recover without any ongoing problems. [23]
The mortality is 1–5% without treatment, [5]
and less than 1% with adequate treatment; [23]
however severe disease carries a mortality of 26%. [5]
Dengue is
endemic
in more than 110 countries. [5]
It infects 50 to 100 million people worldwide a year, leading to half a million hospitalizations, [1]
and approximately 12,500–25,000 deaths. [6] [30]
The most common viral disease transmitted by
arthropods , [12]
dengue has a
disease burden
estimated to be 1600
disability-adjusted life years
per million population, which is similar to other childhood and tropical diseases such as
tuberculosis . [13]
As a tropical disease dengue is deemed only second in importance to
malaria , [5]
though the World Health Organization counts dengue as one of sixteen
neglected tropical diseases . [31]
The incidence of dengue increased 30 fold between 1960 and 2010. [32]
This increase is believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and
global warming . [1]
The geographical distribution is around the equator with 70% of the
total 2.5 billion people living in endemic areas from Asia and the
Pacific. [32]
In the United States, the rate of dengue infection among those who return from an endemic area with a fever is 2.9–8.0%, [16]
and it is the second most common infection after malaria to be diagnosed in this group. [7]
Until 2003, dengue was classified as a potential
bioterrorism
agent, but subsequent reports removed this classification as it was deemed too difficult to transfer and only caused
hemorrhagic fever
in a relatively small proportion of people. [33]
Like most arboviruses, dengue virus is maintained in nature in cycles
that involve preferred blood-sucking vectors and vertebrate hosts. The
viruses are maintained in the forests of Southeast Asia and Africa by
transmission from female
Aedes
mosquitoes—of species other than
A. aegypti —to her offspring and to lower primates. In rural settings the virus is transmitted to humans by
A. aegypti
and other species of
Aedes
such as
A. albopictus . In towns and cities, the virus is primarily transmitted to humans by
A. aegypti ,
which is highly domesticated. In all settings the infected lower
primates or humans greatly increase the number of circulating dengue
viruses. This is called amplification. [34]
The urban cycle is the most important to infections of humans and dengue infections are primarily confined to towns and cities. [35]
In recent decades, the expansion of villages, towns and cities in
endemic areas, and the increased mobility of humans has increased the
number of epidemics and circulating viruses. Dengue fever, which was
once confined to Southeast Asia, has now spread to Southern China,
countries in the Pacific Ocean and America, [35]
and might pose a threat to Europe. [3]
[ edit ]
History
The first record of a case of probable dengue fever is in a Chinese medical encyclopedia from the
Jin Dynasty
(265–420 AD) which referred to a "water poison" associated with flying insects. [36] [37]
There have been descriptions of epidemics in the 17th century, but the
most plausible early reports of dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780,
when an epidemic swept Asia, Africa and North America. [37]
From that time until 1940, epidemics were infrequent. [37]
In 1906, transmission by the
Aedes
mosquitoes was confirmed, and in 1907 dengue was the second disease (after
yellow fever ) that was shown to be caused by a virus. [38]
Further investigations by
John Burton Cleland
and
Joseph Franklin Siler
completed the basic understanding of dengue transmission. [38]
The marked spread of dengue during and after the
Second World War
has been attributed to ecologic disruption. The same trends also led to
the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to
the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever. This severe form of the
disease was first reported in the
Philippines
in 1953; by the 1970s, it had become a major cause of
child mortality
and had emerged in the Pacific and the Americas. [37]
Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first noted in
Central and South America in 1981, as DENV-2 was contracted by people
who had previously been infected with DENV-1 several years earlier. [11]
[ edit ]
Etymology
The origins of the word "dengue" are not clear, but one theory is that it is derived from the
Swahili
phrase
Ka-dinga pepo , which describes the disease as being caused by an
evil spirit . [36]
The Swahili word
dinga
may possibly have its origin in the Spanish word
dengue , meaning fastidious or careful, which would describe the gait of a person suffering the bone pain of dengue fever. [39]
However, it is possible that the use of the Spanish word derived from the similar-sounding Swahili. [36]
Slaves in the West Indies having contracted dengue were said to have the posture and gait of a
dandy , and the disease was known as "dandy fever". [40] [41]
The term "break-bone fever" was first applied by physician and
Founding Father
Benjamin Rush , in a 1789 report of the 1780 epidemic in
Philadelphia . In the report he uses primarily the more formal term "bilious remitting fever". [33] [42]
The term dengue fever came into general use only after 1828. [41]
Other historical terms include "breakheart fever" and "la dengue". [41]
Terms for severe disease include "infectious thrombocytopenic purpura"
and "Philippine", "Thai", or "Singapore hemorrhagic fever". [41]

Research efforts to prevent and treat dengue include various means of vector control, [43]
vaccine development, and
antiviral drugs . [27]
With regards to vector control, a number of novel methods have been
used to reduce mosquito numbers with some success including the
placement of the guppy ( Poecilia reticulata ) or
copepods
in standing water to eat the mosquito larvae. [43]
There are ongoing programs working on a dengue vaccine to cover all four serotypes. [27]
One of the concerns is that a vaccine could increase the risk of severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement. [44]
The ideal vaccine is safe, effective after one or two injections,
covers all serotypes, does not contribute to ADE, is easily transported
and stored, and is both affordable and cost-effective. [44]
As of 2009, a number of vaccines were undergoing testing. [13] [33] [44]
It is hoped that the first products will be commercially available by 2015. [27]
Apart from attempts to control the spread of the
Aedes
mosquito and work to develop a vaccine against dengue, there are ongoing efforts to develop
antiviral drugs
that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications. [45] [46]
Discovery of the structure of the viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. [46]
There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with
nucleoside analogs . Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific
inhibitors
of the viral
protease
(coded by NS3), which
splices
viral proteins. [47]
Finally, it may be possible to develop
entry inhibitors , which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the
5′ capping
process, which is required for viral replication. [45]

Livestock
refers to one or more
domesticated
animals
raised in an agricultural setting to produce
commodities
such as
food ,
fiber
and
labor . The term "livestock" as used in this article does not include
poultry
or farmed
fish ; however the inclusion of these, especially poultry, within the meaning of "livestock" is common.
Livestock generally are raised for
subsistence
or for profit. Raising animals ( animal husbandry ) is an important component of modern
agriculture . It has been practised in many cultures since the transition to
farming
from
hunter-gather
lifestyles.

History
Animal-rearing has its origins in the transition of cultures to settled farming communities rather than
hunter-gatherer
lifestyles. Animals are ‘domesticated’ when their breeding and living
conditions are controlled by humans. Over time, the collective
behaviour,
life cycle , and
physiology
of livestock have changed radically. Many modern farm animals are unsuited to life in the wild.
Dogs
were domesticated in East Asia about 15,000 years ago,
Goats
and
sheep
were domesticated around 8000 BCE in
Asia .
Swine or pigs
were domesticated by 7000 BCE in the
Middle East
and
China . The earliest evidence of
horse
domestication dates to around 4000 BCE [1]
Older English sources, such as the
King James Version of the Bible ,
refer to livestock in general as "cattle", as opposed to the word
"deer", which then was used for wild animals which were not owned. The
word
cattle
is derived from Middle English
chatel , which meant all kinds of movable personal property, [2]
including of course livestock, which was differentiated from non-movable real-estate (" real property ").
In later English, sometimes smaller livestock was called "small cattle"
in that sense of movable property on land, which was not automatically
bought or sold with the land. Today, the modern meaning of "cattle",
without a qualifier, usually refers to domesticated bovines (see
Cattle ). [ citation needed ]
Other
species
of the
genus
Bos
sometimes are called wild cattle.
[ edit ]
Types
The term "livestock" is nebulous and may be defined narrowly or
broadly. On a broader view, livestock refers to any breed or population
of animal kept by humans for a useful, commercial purpose. This can mean
domestic animals ,
semi -domestic animals, or
captive
wild animals .
Semi-domesticated refers to animals which are only lightly domesticated
or of disputed status. These populations may also be in the process of
domestication . Some people may use the term livestock to refer to only domestic animals or even to only
red meat
animals.

Animal rearing
A
Brown Swiss
cow in the
Swiss Alps
‘Livestock’ are defined, in part, by their end purpose as the production of food, fiber and/or labor.
The economic value of livestock includes:
Meat
the production of a useful form of dietary
protein
and energy
Dairy
products
Mammalian livestock can be used as a source of
milk , which can in turn easily be processed into other dairy products, such as
yogurt ,
cheese ,
butter ,
ice cream ,
kefir , and
kumis . Using livestock for this purpose can often yield several times the
food energy
of
slaughtering
the animal outright.
Fiber
Livestock produce a range of fiber/textiles. For example,
sheep
and
goats
produce wool and mohair;
cows ,
deer , and
sheep
skins can be made into leather; and
bones ,
hooves
and
horns
of livestock can be used.
Fertilizer
Manure
can be spread on fields to increase crop yields. This is an important reason why historically,
plant
and animal
domestication
have been intimately linked. Manure is also used to make plaster for
walls and floors, and can be used as a fuel for fires. The
blood
and
bone
of animals are also used as fertilizer.
Labor
Animals such as
horses ,
donkey , and
yaks
can be used for mechanical energy. Prior to
steam power ,
livestock were the only available source of non-human labor. They are
still used for this purpose in many places of the world, including
ploughing
fields, transporting goods, and
military
functions.
Land management
The grazing of livestock is sometimes used as a way to control weeds
and undergrowth. For example, in areas prone to wild fires, goats and
sheep are set to graze on dry scrub which removes combustible material
and reduces the risk of fires.
During the history of
animal husbandry , many secondary products have arisen in an attempt to increase carcass utilization and reduce waste. For example, animal
offal
and non-edible parts may be transformed into products such as pet food
and fertilizer. In the past, such waste products were sometimes also fed
to livestock as well. However, intra-species recycling poses a disease
risk, threatening animal and even human health (see
bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE),
scrapie
and
prion ).
Due primarily to BSE (mad cow disease), feeding animal scraps to
animals has been banned in many countries, at least in regards to
ruminants
and
pigs .

Farming practices

Spain
Main article:
animal husbandry
Farming practices vary dramatically worldwide and between types of
animals. Livestock are generally kept in an enclosure, are fed by
human-provided food [ citation needed ]
and are intentionally bred, but some livestock are not enclosed, or are
fed by access to natural foods, or are allowed to breed freely, or any
combination thereof. Livestock raising historically was part of a
nomadic
or
pastoral
form of
material culture . The herding of camels and reindeer in some parts of the world remains unassociated with
sedentary
agriculture . The
transhumance
form of
herding
in the
Sierra Nevada Mountains
of
California
still continues, as cattle, sheep or goats are moved from
winter
pasture
in lower elevation valleys to
spring
and
summer
pasture in the foothills and
alpine
regions, as the seasons progress. Cattle were raised on the
open range
in the Western United States and Canada, on the
Pampas
of
Argentina , and other
prairie
and
steppe
regions of the
world .
The enclosure of livestock in
pastures
and
barns
is a relatively new development in the
history of agriculture . When cattle are enclosed, the type of ‘enclosure’ may vary from a small crate, a large
fenced
pasture
or a
paddock . The type of feed may vary from natural growing grass, to
highly sophisticated processed feed .
Animals are usually intentionally bred through artificial insemination
or through supervised mating. Indoor production systems are generally
used only for
pigs
and
poultry ,
as well as for veal cattle. Indoor animals are generally farmed
intensively, as large space requirements would make indoor farming
unprofitable and impossible. However, indoor farming systems are
controversial due to the waste they produce, odour problems, the
potential for
groundwater
contamination and animal welfare concerns. (For further discussion on intensively farmed livestock, see
factory farming , and
intensive pig farming ).
Other livestock are farmed outside, although the size of enclosure
and level of supervision may vary. In large open ranges animals may be
only occasionally inspected or yarded in "round-ups" or a
muster (livestock) .
Herding dogs
may be used for mustering livestock as are
cowboys ,
stockmen
and
jackaroos
on horses, or with vehicles and also by helicopters. Since the advent of
barbed wire
(in the 1870s) and
electric fence
technology, fencing pastures has become much more feasible and pasture
management simplified. Rotation of pasturage is a modern technique for
improving nutrition and health while avoiding environmental damage to
the land. In some cases very large numbers of animals may be kept in
indoor or outdoor feeding operations (on
feedlots ), where the animals' feed is processed, offsite or onsite, and stored on site then fed to the animals.
Livestock - especially cattle - may be
branded
to indicate ownership and age, but in modern farming identification is more likely to be indicated by means of
ear tags
than branding. Sheep are also frequently marked by means of ear marks and/or ear tags. As fears of
mad cow disease
and other
epidemic illnesses
mount, the use of
implants
to monitor and trace animals in the
food production
system is increasingly common, and sometimes required by government regulations.
Modern
farming
techniques seek to minimize human involvement, increase yield, and improve animal health.
Economics , quality and consumer safety all play a role in how animals are raised.
Drug
use and feed supplements (or even feed type) may be regulated, or
prohibited, to ensure yield is not increased at the expense of consumer
health, safety or animal welfare. Practices vary around the world, for
example
growth hormone
use is permitted in the
United States , but not in stock to be sold to the
European Union . The improvement of health, using modern
farming
techniques, on the part of animals has come into question. Feeding corn
to cattle, which have historically eaten grasses, is an example; where
the cattle are less adapted, the rumen pH changes to more acidic,
leading to liver damage and other difficulties. [ citation needed ]
The US F.D.A. still allows feedlots to feed nonruminant animal proteins
to cattle. For example, feeding chicken manure and poultry meal is
acceptable for cattle, and beef or pork meat and bone meal is being fed
to chickens.
[ edit ]
Predation
Livestock farmers had suffered from
wild animal
predation and theft by
rustlers . In North America,
gray wolf ,
grizzly bear ,
cougar ,
black bear , and
coyote
are sometimes considered a threat to livestock. In Eurasia and Africa, wolf,
brown bear ,
leopard ,
tiger ,
lion ,
dhole ,
black bear ,
spotted hyena , and
others
caused livestock deaths. In Australia, the
dingo , foxes,
wedge-tailed eagles , hunting and domestic dogs (especially) cause problems for graziers because they often kill for fun. [6] [7]
In
Latin America ,
feral dogs
cause livestock deaths in nightfall.
[ edit ]
Disease
Livestock diseases compromise animal welfare, reduce productivity,
and can infect humans. Animal diseases may be tolerated, reduced through
animal husbandry, or reduced through antibiotics and vaccines. In
developing countries, animal diseases are tolerated in animal husbandry,
resulting in considerably reduced productivity, especially given the
low health-status of many developing country herds. Disease management
for gains in productivity is often the first step taken in implementing
an agriculture policy.
Disease management can be achieved through changes in animal
husbandry. These measures may aim to control spread using biosecurity
measures, such as controlling animal mixing, controlling entry to farm
lots and the use of protective clothing, and quarantining sick animals.
Diseases also may be controlled by the use of vaccines and antibiotics.
Antibiotics in sub-therapeutic doses may also be used as a
growth-promoter, increasing growth by 10-15%. [8]
The issue of
antibiotic resistance
has limited the practices of preventative dosing such as antibiotic-laced feed. Countries will often require the use of
veterinary
certificates before transporting, selling or showing animals.
Disease-free areas often rigorously enforce rules for entry of
potentially diseased animals, including quarantine.

Transportation and marketing

Main article:
Livestock transportation
Since many livestock are herd animals, they were historically
driven to market
"on the hoof" to a town or other central location. During the period after the
American Civil War , the abundance of
Longhorn cattle
in
Texas , and the demand for beef in Northern markets, led to the implementation of the
Old West
cattle drive . The method is still used in some parts of the world.
Truck
transport is now common in developed countries. Local and regional livestock
auctions
and
commodity markets
facilitate trade in livestock. In other areas, livestock may be bought and sold in a
bazaar , such as may be found in many parts of
Central Asia , or a
flea market
type setting.
Stock shows
and
fairs
are events where people bring their best livestock to compete with one another. Organizations like
4-H ,
Block & Bridle , and
FFA
encourage young people to raise livestock for show purposes. Special
feeds are purchased and hours may be spent prior to the show grooming
the animal to look its best. In cattle, sheep, and swine shows, the
winning animals are frequently auctioned off to the highest bidder, and
the funds are placed into a scholarship fund for its owner. The movie
Grand Champion , released in 2004, is the story of a young Texas boy's experience raising a prize steer.

Animal welfare
A
shepherd
boy in India. Livestock are extremely important to the livelihoods of rural
smallholder
farmers, particularly in the developing world.
The issue of raising livestock for human benefit raises the issue of
the relationship between humans and animals, in terms of the status of
animals and obligations of people.
Animal welfare
is the viewpoint that animals under human care should be treated in
such a way that they do not suffer unnecessarily. What is ‘unnecessary’
suffering may vary. Generally, though, the animal welfare perspective is
based on an interpretation of scientific research on farming practices.
By contrast,
animal rights
is the viewpoint that using animals for human benefit is, by its
nature, generally exploitation, regardless of the farming practices
used. Animal rights activists would generally be vegan or vegetarian,
whereas it is consistent with the animal welfare perspective to eat
meat, depending on production processes.
Animal welfare
groups generally seek to generate public discussion on livestock
raising practices and secure greater regulation and scrutiny of
livestock industry practices.
Animal rights
groups usually seek the abolition of livestock farming, although some
groups may recognise the necessity of achieving more stringent
regulation first. Animal welfare groups, such as the RSPCA, are often,
in first world countries, given a voice at governmental level in the
development of policy. Animal rights groups find it harder to find
methods of input, and may go further and advocate civil disobedience or
violence.
A number of animal husbandry practices have been the subject of
campaigns in the 1990s and 2000s and have led to legislation in some
countries. Confinement of livestock in small and unnatural spaces is
often done for economic or health reasons. Animals may be kept in the
minimum size of cage or pen with little or no space to exercise. Where
livestock are used as a source of power, they may be pushed beyond their
limits to the point of exhaustion. The public visibility of this abuse
meant it was one of the first areas to receive legislation in the
nineteenth century in European countries, but it still goes on in parts
of Asia. Broiler hens may be de-beaked, pigs may have deciduous teeth
pulled, cattle may be de-horned and branded, dairy cows and sheep may
have tails cropped, merino sheep may be mulesed, and many types of male
animals are castrated. Animals may be transported long distances to
market and slaughter. Overcrowded conditions, heat from tropical-area
shipping and lack of food, water and rest breaks have been subject to
legislation and protest. (See
Live Export )
Slaughter of livestock
was an early target for legislation. Campaigns continue to target
Halal
and
Kosher
religious ritual slaughter.

Environmental impact
See also:
Environmental effects of meat production
At first reports like the
United Nations
report " Livestock's Long Shadow "
cast a pall over the livestock sector (primarily cattle, chickens, and
pigs) for 'emerging as one of the top two or three most significant
contributors to our most serious environmental problems.' The
United Nations
controversially [ citation needed ]
included emissions from
deforestation
as part of its methodology. Rather than the 18% figure that placed on
the sector as major contributor to emissions, the real figure, less
deforestation is actually 12% [ citation needed ] .
In April 2008, the [United States Environmental Protection Agency]
released a major stocktake of emissions in the United States entitled
Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2006 . [9]
On 6.1 it found "In 2006, the agricultural sector was responsible for emissions of 454.1 teragrams of CO 2
equivalent (Tg CO 2
Eq.), or 6 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions." By way of
comparison, transportation in the US produces more than 25% of all
emissions.
The issue of livestock as a major policy focus remains, especially when dealing with problems of
deforestation
in neotropical areas,
land degradation ,
climate change
and
air pollution ,
water shortage
and
water pollution , and loss of
biodiversity . A research team at
Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine
in
Hokkaidō
found that supplementing the animals' diet with cysteine, a type of
amino acid, and nitrate can reduce the methane gas produced, without
jeopardising the cattle's productivity or the quality of their meat and
milk. [10]
Deforestation
Deforestation impacts the carbon cycle (and
global and regional climate) and causes habitat loss of many species.
Forests that are sinks for the carbon cycle are lost through
deforestation. Forests are either logged or burned to make room for
grasslands, often the area needed is extensive. Deforestation can also
create fragmentation, allowing only patches of habitat for species to
live. If patches are distant and small, gene flow is reduced, habitat is
altered, edge effects will occur and there will be more opportunities
for invasive species to intrude. [11]
Land Degradation
Research from the University of
Botswana
in 2008 has found that farmers' common practice of overstocking cattle
to cope with drought losses made ecosystems more vulnerable and risked
long term damage to cattle herds, in turn, by actually depleting scarce
biomass. The study of the Kgatleng district of Botswana predicted that
by 2050, the cycle of mild drought is likely to become shorter for the
region (18 months instead of two years) due to climate change. [12]
Climate Change & Air Pollution
Methane is one of the
gasses emitted from livestock manure; it persists for long periods of
time and is a green house gas. It is the second most abundant green
house gas after carbon dioxide. [13]
Even though there is less methane then carbon dioxide its ability to warm the atmosphere is 25 times greater. [13]
Water Shortage
Livestock require water for consumption but
also for watering drops necessary for feed. Grains are often used to
feed live stock about 50% of US grains produced does and 40% of world
grains produced does as well. [14]
Grain and in general crop production requires various amounts of water,
it takes 100,000 liters of water for a kilogram of grain fed beef,
compared to wheat, which takes 900 liters. [14]
Water Pollution
Fertilizers that often contain manure are used
to grow such crops (as cereal and fodder) that have phosphorus and
nitrogen in them, 95% of which is estimated to be lost to the
environment. [15]
The pollutants then cause dead zones for plants and aquatic animals due to the lack of oxygen in the water. [16]
The lack of oxygen is known as eutrophication, where organisms present
in the water grow excessively and then later decompose using up the
oxygen in the water. The most prominent example of such is the Gulf of
Mexico, where much of the nutrients in fertilizer used in the mid west
are funneled down the Mississippi River into the Gulf causing massive
dead zones. Another pollutant not most commonly though of is antibiotics
and hormones. In southern Asia vultures that consumed carcasses of
livestock declined 95% due to antibiotic known as Diclofenac. [11]
Alternatives
Researchers in Australia are looking into the
possibility of reducing methane from cattle and sheep by introducing
digestive bacteria from kangaroo intestines into livestock. [17]
In semi arid rangelands such as the Great Plains in the U.S., there
has been research that provides evidence that livestock can be
beneficial to maintaining grassland habitats. Livestock create and
maintain habitat for big game species
[18]
[ edit ]
Legal definitions
United States federal legislation sometimes more narrowly defines the
term to make specified agricultural commodities either eligible, or
ineligible, for a program or activity. For example, the
Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of 1999
(P.L. 106-78, Title IX) defines livestock only as cattle, swine, and
lambs. However, 1988 disaster assistance legislation defined the term as
“cattle, sheep, goats, swine, poultry (including egg-producing
poultry), equine animals used for food or in the production of food,
fish used for food, and other animals designated by the Secretary.” [19]

(March 2009)
Only 29 percent of the world surface is land. The rest is ocean, home to
the marine lifeforms. The oceans average four kilometers in depth and
are fringed with coastlines that run for nearly 380,000 kilometres.
Marine biology
is the scientific study of organisms in the
ocean
or other
marine
or
brackish
bodies of water. Given that in
biology
many
phyla , families and
genera
have some species that live in the
sea
and others that live on land, marine biology classifies species based on the
environment
rather than on
taxonomy . Marine biology differs from
marine ecology
as marine ecology is focused on how organisms interact with each other and the environment, and
biology
is the study of the organisms themselves.
Marine life is a vast resource, providing food, medicine, and raw materials, in addition to helping to support
recreation
and
tourism
all over the world. At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine
the very nature of our planet. Marine organisms contribute
significantly to the
oxygen cycle , and are involved in the regulation of the Earth's
climate . [1]
Shorelines
are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land. [2]
Marine biology covers a great deal, from the microscopic, including most
zooplankton
and
phytoplankton
to the huge
cetaceans
(whales) which reach up to a reported 30
meters
(98
feet ) in length.
The habitats studied by marine biology include everything from the
tiny layers of surface water in which organisms and abiotic items may be
trapped in
surface tension
between the ocean and atmosphere, to the depths of the
oceanic trenches , sometimes 10,000 meters or more beneath the surface of the ocean. It studies habitats such as
coral reefs ,
kelp forests ,
tidepools ,
muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean (pelagic) zone,
where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only
visible boundary.
A large proportion of all
life on Earth
exists in the oceans. Exactly how large the proportion is unknown,
since many ocean species are still to be discovered. While the oceans
constitute about 71% of the Earth's surface, due to their depth they
encompass about 300 times the habitable volume of the terrestrial
habitats on Earth.
Many species are economically important to humans, including
food fish .
It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms
and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways. The human body
of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and
important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made
nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the
carbon cycle ) and of air (such as
Earth's respiration , and movement of energy through
ecosystems
including the ocean). Large areas beneath the ocean surface still remain effectively unexplored.

Subfields
Coral reefs
form complex marine ecosystems with tremendous
biodiversity .
The
marine ecosystem
is large, and thus there are many sub-fields of marine biology. Most
involve studying specializations of particular animal groups, such as
phycology ,
invertebrate zoology
and
ichthyology .
Other subfields study the physical effects of continual immersion in
sea water
and the ocean in general, adaptation to a salty environment, and the
effects of changing various oceanic properties on marine life. A
subfield of marine biology studies the relationships between oceans and
ocean life, and global warming and environmental issues (such as
carbon dioxide
displacement).
Recent marine
biotechnology
has focused largely on
marine biomolecules , especially
proteins ,
that may have uses in medicine or engineering. Marine environments are
the home to many exotic biological materials that may inspire
biomimetic materials .

Marine biology is a branch of
oceanography
and is closely linked to
biology . It also encompasses many ideas from
ecology .
Fisheries science
and
marine conservation
can be considered partial offshoots of marine biology (as well as

Reptiles
Main article:
Marine reptile
Reptiles
which inhabit or frequent the sea include
sea turtles ,
sea snakes ,
terrapins , the
marine iguana , and the
saltwater crocodile . Most
extant
marine reptiles, except for some sea snakes, are
oviparous
and need to return to land to lay their eggs. Thus most species,
excepting sea turtles, spend most of their lives on or near land rather
than in the ocean. Despite their marine adaptations, most sea snakes
prefer shallow waters nearby land, around islands, especially waters
that are somewhat sheltered, as well as near estuaries. [3] [4]
Some
extinct
marine reptiles, such as
ichthyosaurs , evolved to be
viviparous
and had no requirement to return to land.
[ edit ]
Fungi
Main article:
Marine fungi
Over 1500 species of
fungi
are known from marine environments. [5]
These parasitize
marine algae
or animals, or are
saprobes
on algae, corals, protozoan cysts, sea grasses, wood and other substrata, and can also be found in
sea foam . [6]
Spores of many species have special appendages which facilitate attachment to the substratum. [7]
A very diverse range of unusual secondary
metabolites
is produced by marine fungi. [8]
[ edit ]
Plants and algae
Plant life is widespread and very diverse under the ocean.
Microscopic photosynthetic algae contribute a larger proportion of the
worlds photosynthetic output than all the terrestrial forests combined.
Most of the
niche
occupied by sub plants on land is actually occupied by macroscopic
algae
in the ocean, such as
Sargassum
and
kelp , which are commonly known as
seaweeds
that creates
kelp forests . The non algae plants that survive in the sea are often found in shallow waters, such as the
seagrasses
(examples of which are eelgrass,
Zostera , and turtle grass,
Thalassia ). These plants have adapted to the high salinity of the ocean environment. The
intertidal zone
is also a good place to find plant life in the sea, where
mangroves
or
cordgrass
or
beach grass
might grow. Microscopic algae and plants provide important habitats for
life, sometimes acting as hiding and foraging places for larval forms
of larger fish and invertebrates.
[ edit ]
Microscopic life
A
copepod .
Microscopic life undersea is incredibly diverse and still poorly understood. For example, the role of
viruses
in marine ecosystems is barely being explored even in the beginning of the 21st century.
The role of
phytoplankton
is better understood due to their critical position as the most numerous
primary producers
on Earth. Phytoplankton are categorized into
cyanobacteria
(also called blue-green algae/bacteria), various types of
algae
(red, green, brown, and yellow-green),
diatoms ,
dinoflagellates ,
euglenoids ,
coccolithophorids ,
cryptomonads ,
chrysophytes ,
chlorophytes ,
prasinophytes , and
silicoflagellates .
Zooplankton
tend to be somewhat larger, and not all are microscopic. Many
Protozoa
are zooplankton, including dinoflagellates,
zooflagellates ,
foraminiferans , and
radiolarians .
Some of these (such as dinoflagellates) are also phytoplankton; the
distinction between plants and animals often breaks down in very small
organisms. Other zooplankton include
cnidarians ,
ctenophores ,
chaetognaths ,
molluscs ,
arthropods ,
urochordates , and
annelids
such as
polychaetes .
Many larger animals begin their life as zooplankton before they become
large enough to take their familiar forms. Two examples are
fish larvae
and sea stars (also called
starfish ).

Marine habitats
Marine habitats can be divided into
coastal
and
open ocean
habitats. Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from the
shoreline
to the edge of the
continental shelf .
Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf
area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean
habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental
shelf
Alternatively, marine habitats can be divided into
pelagic
and
demersal
habitats. Pelagic habitats are found near the surface or in the open
water column ,
away from the bottom of the ocean. Demersal habitats are near or on the
bottom of the ocean. An organism living in a pelagic habitat is said to
be a pelagic organism, as in
pelagic fish . Similarly, an organism living in a demersal habitat is said to be a demersal organism, as in
demersal fish . Pelagic habitats are intrinsically shifting and ephemeral, depending on what
ocean currents
are doing.
Marine habitats can be modified by their inhabitants. Some marine organisms, like corals, kelp and seagrasses, are
ecosystem engineers
which reshape the marine environment to the point where they create further habitat for other organisms.

Intertidal and shore
Tide pools with sea stars and
sea anemone
in Santa Cruz,
California
Intertidal zones , those areas close to shore, are constantly being exposed and covered by the ocean's
tides . A huge array of life lives within this zone.
Shore habitats span from the upper intertidal zones to the area where
land vegetation takes prominence. It can be underwater anywhere from
daily to very infrequently. Many species here are scavengers, living off
of sea life that is washed up on the shore. Many land animals also make
much use of the shore and intertidal habitats. A subgroup of organisms
in this habitat bores and grinds exposed rock through the process of
bioerosion .

Reefs
Main article:
Coral reef
Reefs
comprise some of the densest and most diverse habitats in the world. The best-known types of reefs are
tropical
coral reefs
which exist in most tropical waters; however, reefs can also exist in cold water. Reefs are built up by
corals
and other
calcium -depositing
animals, usually on top of a rocky outcrop on the ocean floor. Reefs
can also grow on other surfaces, which has made it possible to create
artificial reefs . Coral reefs also support a huge community of life, including the corals themselves, their symbiotic
zooxanthellae , tropical fish and many other organisms.
Much attention in marine biology is focused on coral reefs and the
El Niño
weather phenomenon. In 1998, coral reefs experienced the most severe
mass bleaching events on record, when vast expanses of reefs across the
world died because sea surface temperatures rose well above normal. [9] [10]
Some reefs are recovering, but scientists say that between 50% and 70%
of the world's coral reefs are now endangered and predict that
global warming
could exacerbate this trend. [11] [12] [13] [14]
[ edit ]
Open ocean
Main article:
Pelagic zone
The open ocean is relatively unproductive because of a lack of
nutrients, yet because it is so vast, in total it produces the most
primary productivity. Much of the
aphotic zone 's energy is supplied by the open ocean in the form of
detritus . The open ocean consists mostly of
jellyfish
and its predators such as the
mola mola .
[ edit ]
Deep sea and trenches
The deepest recorded
oceanic trenches
measure to date is the
Mariana Trench , near the
Philippines , in the
Pacific Ocean
at 10,924 m (35,838 ft). At such depths,
water pressure
is extreme and there is no sunlight, but some life still exists. A white
flatfish , a shrimp and a jellyfish were seen by the American crew of the
bathyscaphe
Trieste
when it dove to the bottom in 1960. [15]
Other notable oceanic trenches include
Monterey Canyon , in the eastern Pacific, the
Tonga Trench
in the southwest at 10,882 m (35,702 ft), the
Philippine Trench , the
Puerto Rico Trench
at 8,605 m (28,232 ft), the
Romanche Trench
at 7,760 m (24,450 ft),
Fram Basin
in the
Arctic Ocean
at 4,665 m (15,305 ft), the
Java Trench
at 7450 m (24,442 ft), and the
South Sandwich Trench
at 7,235 m (23,737 ft).
In general, the deep sea is considered to start at the
aphotic zone , the point where sunlight loses its power of transference through the water. [ citation needed ]
Many life forms that live at these depths have the ability to create their own light known as
bio-luminescence .
Marine life also flourishes around
seamounts
that rise from the depths, where fish and other sea life congregate to spawn and feed.
Hydrothermal vents
along the
mid-ocean ridge
spreading centers act as
oases , as do their opposites,
cold seeps . Such places support unique
biomes
and many new
microbes
and other lifeforms have been discovered at these locations . [ citation needed ]
[ edit ]
Distribution factors
An active research topic in marine biology is to discover and map the
life cycles
of various species and where they spend their time. Marine biologists study how the
ocean currents ,
tides
and many other oceanic factors affect ocean lifeforms, including their
growth, distribution and well-being. This has only recently become
technically feasible with advances in
GPS
and newer underwater visual devices. [ citation needed ]
Most ocean life breeds in specific places, nests or not in others,
spends time as juveniles in still others, and in maturity in yet others.
Scientists know little about where many species spend different parts
of their life cycles. For example, it is still largely unknown where
sea turtles
and some
sharks
travel. Tracking devices do not work for some life forms, and the ocean is not friendly to
technology .
This is important to scientists and fishermen because they are
discovering that by restricting commercial fishing in one small area
they can have a large impact in maintaining a healthy fish population in
a much larger area far away.
