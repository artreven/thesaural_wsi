The Good News and the Bad News
My husband has not been doing very well since he
fell sick
on Monday. Body aches, diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of appetite, rashes and headaches were constantly happening to him for the past couple of days. Total bed rest and doctor's prescribed medications didn't do much justice on his sickness.
After few persuasive talking attempts, finally, my husband listened to his Mom's advice to get himself medically checked once again and his parents took him to one of the private hospitals in town this afternoon. The doctor in the hospital immediately ran a blood test on him and gave him IV therapy as fluid replacement.
Few hours of waiting later, his blood test result came out. The good news is my husband is
not
contracting
German measles or Rubella
as per his previous doctor's diagnosis. His blood test result reveals that he is infected by
Dengue
virus, possibly from our Indonesia trip last week. This said, I can put worries about Rubella and its potential hazards on our unborn baby behind and will have no problem in having direct interaction with my husband as per normal.
My husband's IV therapy at the hospital.
The bad news is, my husband needs to be hospitalized for at least 3-4 days. This means instead of having him in the other room in the house like these two days, we will have to live separately for a few days.
Now I really understand the miserable feeling when our spouse falls ill and has to live away from us for quite some time. The first one gives us uneasy and worry-some feelings and the latter makes us a lonesome. Nevertheless, I really hope there is nothing serious with my husband's Dengue fever so he can recover fast and come home soon.
*can't wait to see him tonight*
Lesson learnt here is to go seek second opinion when one's sickness is not improving in few days' time. Doctor's wrong diagnosis happens everywhere, all the time.

Tina Bk May 9, 2012 at 7:39 PM I am glad that he is in recovery and that the finally landed on the correct diagnosis!
I am sure you do not like his absences, but I imagine the homecoming will be all worth it.
Spousal illness can be a scary thing, it really does make you think of how fragile life really can be.
Enjoy the day. Reply Delete Christine May 9, 2012 at 9:06 PM Hi Tina, thank you for the kind words. You are right, spousal illness is indeed a scary thing. I am looking forward to see my healthy husband again. Meanwhile, I have to be able to entertain myself during his absence. Cheers and all the best to you and your family too.
