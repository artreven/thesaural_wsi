Oh, The Joys
WHERE EVERY DAY IS THE SAME...

Mi'ma'amakim
Yesterday, when I was driving to my office, I heard a hauntingly melodic song on the radio. It was in a language I didn’t recognize so I had no idea what they were saying, but I really liked the song. Unfortunately, the DJ didn’t announce the name of the song or artist before I got out of the car. Later that afternoon, I stopped at the library to pick up a
Dengue Fever
CD that I had requested and was waiting on hold for me. I decided to browse the library’s CD collection. Always a sucker for those
Putumayo
world music collections, I found myself in that section staring at a
CD with a man in desert boots, fatigues and dreadlocks on the cover. I had never heard of The Idan Raichel Project.
Regardless,
I decisively put the CD in my pile to check out.
When I got home I put the CD in my computer and began listening to the first track.
I liked it, but something inside me told me to skip to the second track. It was the song from the morning. I was stunned! What are the chances? I looked up and the first thing I saw was the picture of my grandparents that sits next to my desk. My
Granny
looked incredibly pleased with herself and my Ady’s face was filled with laughter. The hair on my forearm stood up. I remembered a while back
screaming at this very picture . After
the close-talking, dragon-breathed, evangelical woman tried to save my soul in the thrift store
I
informed
my Granny that if she wanted to send me a message that she’d better do it in
a way that I would trust . Staring at their picture I suddenly needed to know what the lyrics to the song meant. Mi'ma'amakim From
deep depths I called to you to come to me
with your return the light in my eyes will come back
it's not finished,
I am not leaving the touch of your hands The sound of your laughter shall glow here again. From deep depths I called to you to come to me the moonlight I will again light your way to me they're spread out and melted again the touch of your hands I whisper, ask in your ears: Who is it that calls to you tonight - listen who sings aloud to you under your window who stakes his soul just for you to be happy who will lend his hand to build you a home who lay his life down underneath you who like the earth at your feet shall live on who will love you better than all your lovers who will save you from all evil spirits from the depths. From depths I called to you to come to me the moonlight will shine your way back to me spread out and melted to
the touch of your hand I whisper in your ears and ask Who is it that calls to you tonight. As it turns out, the song is sung in a blend of Hebrew and Amharic. I thought of the place my grandparents must be and imagined all the languages of the world united in one universal form. How much they must understand now. Thankfully, they remain
all around me everywhere ,
showing me the way
with and
without
them.

Thank you so much for sharing this beautiful story.
Most people think I'm insane when I try to explain things like this.
Probably because I don't have your gift with words, alas.
And thank you also for telling us the name of the artist and album; I'm on my way to the library right now!

Lovely - and what a beautiful and touching story. It's my granny's 92nd birthday today and even though she's still alive, I feel like I am losing her slowly, slowly.

Oh, how wonderful. For weeks and months after my dad died, I heard "American Pie" on the radio whenever I was in the car. Recently I cleaned out our den to make way for the new baby and I found some of his sheet music, for his guitar. It was "American Pie." I believe they were speaking to you.

The bulk of the song is in Hebrew, only the chorus is not.
It's lovely and such an interesting and inpiring story. Thanks for telling it.

Awesome story!
That's quite the coincidence.
I tried playing the video, but it didn't work, so I'm going to try again some other time.

How wondrous that Jen linked to us both about our visits, and so I cam, to read yours remembering my grandfather, a man fluent in Hebrew and a devout lover of music. May you find her again and again in the song of a summer's breeze.

Mi'Ma'amakim
Psalms 130
OUT of the depths I have cried to You, O LORD;
Lord, hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications.
If You, LORD, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
But there is forgiveness with You, That You may be feared.
I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, And in His word I do hope.
My soul waits for the Lord More than those who watch for the morning Yes, more than those who watch for the morning. O Israel, hope in the LORD; For with the LORD there is mercy, And with Him is abundant redemption.
And He shall redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
