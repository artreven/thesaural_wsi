Hello, Just about to embark on my trip to thailand, and wondering if anyone has recently been infected with malaria? I have pills but they are a nuicance in that I have to take them 2 days before my trip, during my trip and 4 weeks after my trip! that and the fact they are an antibiotic, cause the usual malaria pill that's used in the Caribbean is ineffective. Thoughts please.

Malaria pills for Thailand? Where, pray tell, are you specifically planning on going in Thailand that requires them?

I'm not aware of malaria being a problem anywhere in Thailand.
Dengue Fever , however, is a reality there, at least in the Gulf. It won't kill a healthy adult, but it can make you very miserable for a few weeks. I wasn't afflicted, but I ran into a few travelers who'd had it, and it didn't sound fun. I really don't think you need an anti-malarial, but it would be smart to take some good mosquito repellant.

For Thailand, malaria prophylaxis isn't strictly necessary, but it depends on which region you want to travel to. Here is the malaria risk

from the NHS. I second Mini Manta's advise. Not only are mozzies a nuisance, but cases of Dengue fever are on the increase during the rainy season, so use repellants (there's no vaccine).
See where I'm at!

Whalewatcher -
Thank you so much for posting that link to the Fit for Travel site.
I love the malaria maps, and have already checked them out for my next few destinations - Bali/Lombok, Singapore, Hong Kong, and China.
Please private message me if you know whether Doxycycline is available over the counter in Bali (I want to visit Lombok which is listed as a malaria risk area).
Cheers!

We all know, that I am against taking the prophylactic treatment. Here another
treatmen study
study that supports this, at least for low-risk areas (such as Thailand).
