The
Dominican Republic
( i
/ d ə ˌ m ɪ n ɪ k ən
r ɪ ˈ p ʌ b l ɪ k / ;
Spanish :
República
Dominicana ,
pronounced  [reˈpuβlika
ðominiˈkana] ) is a nation on the island of
Hispaniola , part of the
Greater Antilles
archipelago in the Caribbean region. The
western third of the island is occupied by the nation of
Haiti ,
making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands that are
shared
by two countries. Both by area and population, the
Dominican Republic is the second largest Caribbean nation (after
Cuba ),
with 48,442 square kilometres (18,704 sq mi) and an estimated 10
million people. [2] [7]
Inhabited by
Taínos
since the 7th century, the territory of the Dominican
Republic was reached by
Christopher Columbus
in 1492 and became the site of the
first permanent
European settlement
in the
Americas , namely
Santo Domingo , the country's capital and Spain's first
capital in the
New World . In Santo Domingo stand, among other firsts in the
Americas, the
first university ,
cathedral , and
castle , the latter two in the
Ciudad Colonial
area, a
UNESCO
World Heritage Site . [2] [8]
After three centuries of Spanish rule, with French and
Haitian interludes, the country became independent in 1821 but
was quickly
taken over by Haiti . Victorious in the
Dominican War of Independence
in 1844, Dominicans
experienced mostly internal strife, and also a brief return to
Spanish rule, over the next 72 years. The United States
occupation of 1916–1924, and a subsequent, calm and prosperous
six-year period under
Horacio Vásquez Lajara , were followed by the dictatorship of
Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina
until 1961. The civil war of
1965, the country's last, was ended by
a U.S.-led intervention , and was followed by the
authoritarian rule of
Joaquín Balaguer , 1966–1978. Since then, the Dominican
Republic has moved toward
representative democracy , [1]
and has been led by
Leonel Fernández
for most of the time after 1996.
The Dominican Republic has the second largest economy in the
Caribbean and Central American region. [9] [10]
Though long known for sugar production, the economy is now
dominated by services. [1]
The country's economic progress is exemplified by its advanced
telecommunication
system. [11]
Nevertheless, unemployment, [1]
government corruption, and inconsistent electric service remain
major Dominican problems. The country also has "marked income
inequality". [1]
International migration greatly affects the country, as it
receives and sends large flows of migrants. Haitian immigration
and the integration of Dominicans of Haitian descent are major
issues; the total population of Haitian origin is estimated to
be 800,000. [12]
A large Dominican
diaspora
exists, most of it in the United States, where it
comprises 1.3 million. [13]
They aid national development as they send billions of dollars
to their families, accounting for one-tenth of the Dominican
GDP . [1] [14]
The Dominican Republic has become the Caribbean's largest
tourist destination; the country's year-round golf courses are
among the top attractions. [11]
In this mountainous land is located the Caribbean's highest
mountain,
Pico Duarte , as is
Lake Enriquillo , the Caribbean's largest lake and lowest
elevation. [15]
Quisqueya, as Dominicans often call their country, has an
average temperature of 26  °C
(78.8 °F) and great biological diversity. [11]
Music and sport are of the highest importance in Dominican
culture, with
merengue
as the national dance and song and
baseball
the favorite sport. [2]

History of the Dominican Republic
and
Colony of Santo Domingo
The
Taínos
The
Arawakan-speaking
Taínos
moved into Hispaniola, displacing earlier
inhabitants, [16]
circa A.D. 650. They engaged in farming and fishing, [17]
and hunting and gathering. [16]
The fierce
Caribs
drove the Taínos to the northeastern Caribbean during
much of the 15th century. [18]
The estimates of Hispaniola's population in 1492 vary widely,
including one hundred thousand, [19]
three hundred thousand, [16]
and four hundred thousand to two million. [20]
Determining precisely how many people lived on the island in
pre-Columbian times is next to impossible, as no accurate
records exist. [21]
By 1492 the island was divided into five Taíno chiefdoms. [ citation
needed ]
The Spanish arrived in 1492. After initially friendly
relationships, the Taínos resisted the conquest, led by the
female Chief
Anacaona
of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief Caonabo of
Maguana, as well as Chiefs
Guacanagarix ,
Guamá ,
Hatuey , and
Enriquillo . The latter's successes gained his people an
autonomous enclave for a time on the island. Nevertheless,
within a few years after 1492 the population of Taínos had
declined drastically, due to
smallpox
and other diseases that arrived with the Europeans, [22]
and from other causes discussed below. 1514 census records
reveal that 40% of Spanish men in the colony of Santo Domingo
had Taíno wives. [23]
The decline continued, and by 1711 the Taíno numbered just
21,000. [24]
The last record of pure Taínos in the country was from 1864. Due
to intermarriage over the centuries, many Dominicans have Taíno
ancestry. [25] [26]
Remnants of the Taino culture include their cave paintings, [27]
as well as pottery designs which are still used in the small
artisan village of Higüerito,
Moca .
Spanish
rule
Alcázar de Colón , located in Santo Domingo, is
the oldest Viceregal residence in America.
Christopher Columbus
arrived on Hispaniola on December 5,
1492, during the first of his
four voyages
to America. He claimed the island for Spain and
named it
La Española . In 1496
Bartholomew Columbus , Christopher's brother, built the city
of Santo Domingo, Europe's first permanent settlement in the " New
World ". The Spaniards created a plantation economy on the
island. [19]
The colony was the springboard for the further Spanish conquest
of America and for decades the headquarters of Spanish power in
the hemisphere. Christopher was buried in Santo Domingo upon his
death in 1506.
The Taínos nearly disappeared, above all, from European
infectious diseases
to which they had no immunity. [28]
Other causes were abuse, suicide, the breakup of family,
starvation, [16]
enslavement, forced labor, torture, war with the Spaniards,
changes in lifestyle, and even
miscegenation . Laws passed for the Indians' protection
(beginning with the
Laws of Burgos, 1512–1513 ) [29]
were never truly enforced. Yet as stated above, the Taínos did
survive. Some scholars believe that las Casas exaggerated [30]
the Indian population decline in an effort to persuade
King Carlos
to intervene, and that
encomenderos
also exaggerated it, in order to receive
permission to import more African slaves. Moreover, censuses of
the time omitted the Indians who fled into remote communities, [25]
where they often joined with runaway Africans ( cimarrones ),
producing
Zambos . Also,
Mestizos
who were culturally Spanish were counted as
Spaniards, some Zambos as black, and some Indians as
Mulattos . [25]
Santo Domingo's population saw a spectacular increase during
the 18th century, as it rose from some 6,000 in 1737 to about
125,000 in 1790. Approximately, this was composed of 40,000
white landowners, 25,000 black or mulatto freedmen, and 60,000
slaves. [31]
After her conquest of the
Aztecs
and
Incas , Spain neglected her Caribbean holdings. French
buccaneers
settled in western Hispaniola, and by the 1697
Treaty of Ryswick , Spain ceded the area to France. France
created the wealthy colony Saint-Domingue there, with a
population 90% slave, and overall four times as populous
(500,000 to 125,000) as the Spanish area at the end of the 18th
century. [31]
French
rule
France came to own the island in 1795, when by the
Peace of Basel
Spain ceded Santo Domingo as a consequence of
the
French Revolutionary Wars . At the time, Saint-Domingue's
slaves, led by
Toussaint Louverture , were in revolt against France. In 1801
they captured Santo Domingo, thus controlling the entire island;
but in 1802 an army sent by
Napoleon
captured Toussaint Louverture and sent him to
France as prisoner. However, Toussaint Louverture's lieutenants,
and
yellow fever , succeeded in expelling the French again from
Saint-Domingue, which in 1804 the rebels made independent as the
Republic of Haiti. Eastwards, France continued to rule Spanish
Santo Domingo.
In 1808, following
Napoleon's invasion of Spain , the
criollos
of Santo Domingo revolted against French
rule and, with the aid of
Great Britain
(Spain's ally) and Haiti, [32]
returned Santo Domingo to Spanish control. [33]
The
Ephemeral Independence and Haitian occupation
Juan Pablo Duarte
is widely considered the
architect of the Dominican Republic and its
independence
from
Haitian
rule in 1844.
After a dozen years of discontent and failed independence
plots by various groups, Santo Domingo's former
Lieutenant-Governor (top administrator),
José Núñez de Cáceres , declared the colony's independence,
on November 30, 1821. He requested the new state's admission to
Simón Bolívar 's republic of
Gran Colombia , but Haitian forces, led by
Jean-Pierre Boyer , invaded just nine weeks later, in
February 1822. [34]
As Toussaint Louverture had done two decades earlier, the
Haitians abolished slavery. But they also nationalized most
private property, including all the property of landowners who
had left in the wake of the invasion; much
Church
property; as well as all property belonging to the
former rulers, the
Spanish Crown . Boyer also placed more emphasis on
cash crops
grown on large plantations, reformed the tax
system, and allowed foreign trade. But the new system was widely
opposed by Dominican farmers, although it produced a boom in
sugar and coffee production. All levels of education collapsed;
the university was shut down, as it was starved both of
resources and students, since young Dominican men from 16 to
25-years-old were drafted into the Haitian army. Boyer's
occupation troops, who were largely Dominicans, were unpaid, and
had to "forage and sack" from Dominican civilians. Haiti imposed
a "heavy tribute" on the Dominican people. [35] :page

Many whites fled Santo Domingo for
Puerto Rico
and
Cuba
(both still under Spanish rule),
Venezuela , and elsewhere. In the end the economy faltered
and taxation became more onerous. Rebellions occurred even by
Dominican freedmen, while Dominicans and Haitians worked
together to oust Boyer from power. Anti-Haitian movements of
several kinds — pro-independence, pro-Spanish, pro-French,
pro-British, pro-United States — gathered force following the
overthrow of Boyer in 1843. [35] :page

Independence

Dominican War of Independence
Flag of the
Trinitaria
from 1844 to 1849
In 1838
Juan Pablo Duarte
founded a secret society called
La Trinitaria , which sought the complete independence of
Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention. [36] :p147–149
Ramón Matías Mella
and
Francisco del Rosario Sánchez , despite not being among the
founding members of La Trinitaria, were decisive in the fight
for independence. Duarte and they are the three Founding Fathers
of the Dominican Republic. [ citation
needed ]
On February 27, 1844, the
Trinitarios
(the members of La Trinitaria), declared the independence from
Haiti. They were backed by
Pedro Santana , a wealthy cattle rancher from
El Seibo , who became general of the army of the nascent
Republic. The Dominican Republic's first
Constitution
was adopted on November 6, 1844, and was
modeled after the
United States Constitution . [17]
The decades that followed were filled with tyranny,
factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of
government, and exile for political opponents. Threatening the
nation's independence were renewed Haitian invasions occurring
in 1844, 1845–49, 1849–55, and 1855–56. [35] :page

Meanwhile, archrivals Santana and
Buenaventura Báez
held power most of the time, both ruling
arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new
nation to another power: Santana favored Spain, and Báez the
United States.
The
voluntary colony and the Restoration republic
See also:
Dominican Restoration War
General Gregorio Luperón , Restoration hero and
later President of the Republic
In 1861, after imprisoning, silencing, exiling, and executing
many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons,
Santana signed a pact with the Spanish Crown and reverted the
Dominican nation to colonial status, the only Latin American
country to do so. His ostensible aim was to protect the nation
from another Haitian annexation. [37]
But opponents launched the
War of the Restoration
in 1863, led by
Santiago Rodríguez ,
Benito Monción , and
Gregorio Luperón , among others. Haiti, fearful of the
re-establishment of Spain as colonial power on its border, gave
refuge and supplies to the revolutionaries. [37]
The United States, then fighting its own
Civil War , vigorously protested the Spanish action. After
two years of fighting, Spain abandoned the island in 1865. [37]
Political strife again prevailed in the following years;
warlords ruled, military revolts were extremely common, and the
nation amassed debt. It was now Báez's turn to act on his
plan of annexing the country to the United States , where two
successive presidents were supportive. [17] [34] [38]
U.S. President Grant desired a naval base at
Samaná
and also a place for resettling newly freed
Blacks . [39]
The treaty, which included U.S. payment of $1.5 million for
Dominican debt repayment, was defeated in the
United States Senate
in 1870 [34]
on a vote of 28–28, two-thirds being required. [40] [41] [42]
Ulises 'Lilís' Heureaux , President of the
Republic 1882–84, 1886–99
Báez was toppled in 1874, returned, and was toppled for good
in 1878. A new generation was thence in charge, with the passing
of Santana (he died in 1864) and Báez from the scene. Relative
peace came to the country in the 1880s, which saw the coming to
power of General
Ulises Heureaux . [43]
"Lilís", as the new president was nicknamed, enjoyed a period
of popularity. He was, however, "a consummate dissembler", who
put the nation deep into debt while using much of the proceeds
for his personal use and to maintain his police state. Heureaux
became rampantly despotic and unpopular. [43] [44]
In 1899 he was assassinated. However, the relative calm over
which he presided allowed improvement in the Dominican economy.
The sugar industry was modernized, [45] :p10
and the country attracted foreign workers and immigrants, both
from the
Old World
and the
New .
From 1902 on, short-lived governments were again the norm,
with their power usurped by
caudillos
in parts of the country. Furthermore, the national
government was bankrupt and, unable to pay Heureaux's debts,
faced the threat of military intervention by France and other
European creditor powers. [46]
U.S.
interventions and occupation
See also:
1916 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic
U.S. President
Theodore Roosevelt
sought to prevent European intervention,
largely to protect the routes to the future
Panama Canal , as the canal was already under construction.
He made a small military intervention to ward off the European
powers, proclaimed his famous
Roosevelt Corollary
to the
Monroe Doctrine , and in 1905 obtained Dominican agreement
for U.S. administration of Dominican customs, then the chief
source of income for the Dominican government. A 1906 agreement
provided for the arrangement to last 50 years. The United States
agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense
foreign debt of the Dominican Republic, and assumed
responsibility for said debt. [17] [46]
After six years in power, President
Ramón Cáceres
(who had himself assassinated Heureaux) [43]
was assassinated in 1911. The result was several years of great
political instability and civil war. U.S. mediation by the
William Howard Taft
and
Woodrow Wilson
administrations achieved only a short respite
each time. A political deadlock in 1914 was broken after an
ultimatum by Wilson telling Dominicans to choose a president or
see the U.S. impose one. A provisional president was chosen, and
later the same year relatively free elections put former
president (1899–1902)
Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra
back in power. In order to
achieve a more broadly supported government, Jimenes named
opposition individuals to his Cabinet. But this brought no peace
and, with his former Secretary of War Desiderio Arias
maneuvering to depose him and despite a U.S. offer of military
aid against Arias, Jimenes resigned on May 7, 1916. [47]
U.S. Marines
during the 1916 occupation
Wilson thus ordered the U.S. occupation of the Dominican
Republic.
U.S. Marines
landed on May 16, 1916, and had control of the
country two months later. The military government established by
the U.S., led by Rear Admiral
Harry Shepard Knapp , was widely repudiated by Dominicans.
Some Cabinet posts had to be filled by
U.S. naval
officers, as Dominicans refused to serve in the
administration. Censorship and limits on public speech were
imposed. The guerrilla war against the U.S. forces was met with
a vigorous, "often brutal" response. [47]
But the occupation regime, which kept most Dominican laws and
institutions, largely pacified the country, revived the economy,
reduced the Dominican debt, built a road network that at last
interconnected all regions of the country, and created a
professional National Guard to replace the warring partisan
units. [47]
Opposition to the occupation continued, however, and after
World War I it increased in the U.S. as well. There, President
Warren G. Harding
(1921–23), Wilson's successor, worked to
end the occupation, as he had promised to do during his
campaign. U.S. government ended in October 1922, and elections
were held in March 1924. [47]
The victor was former president (1902–03)
Horacio Vásquez Lajara , who had cooperated with the U.S. He
was inaugurated on July 13, and the last U.S. forces left in
September. Vásquez gave the country six years of good
government, in which political and civil rights were respected
and the economy grew strongly, in a peaceful atmosphere. [47] [48]
The
Trujillo Era
Rafael Leónidas Trujillo
ruled the Dominican
Republic from 1930 to 1961.
When Vásquez attempted to win another term, opponents
rebelled in February, 1930, in secret alliance with the
commander of the National Army (the former National Guard),
General
Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina , by which the latter
remained 'neutral' in face of the rebellion. Vásquez resigned.
Trujillo then stood for election himself, and in May was elected
president virtually unopposed, after a violent campaign against
his opponents. [48]
There was considerable economic growth during Trujillo's long
and iron-fisted regime, although a great deal of the wealth was
taken by the dictator and other regime elements. There was
progress in healthcare, education, and transportation, with the
building of hospitals and clinics, schools, and roads and
harbors. Trujillo also carried out an important housing
construction program and instituted a pension plan. He finally
negotiated an undisputed border with Haiti in 1935, and achieved
the end of the 50-year customs agreement in 1941, instead of
1956. He made the country debt-free in 1947, [17]
a proud achievement for Dominicans for decades to come.
This was accompanied by absolute repression and the copious
use of murder, torture, and terrorist methods against the
opposition. Moreover, Trujillo's
megalomania
was on display in his renaming after himself the
capital city
Santo Domingo
to "Ciudad Trujillo" (Trujillo City), [17]
the nation's—and the Caribbean's—highest mountain Pico Duarte
(Duarte Peak) to "Pico Trujillo", and many towns and a province.
Some other places he renamed after members of his family. By the
end of his first term in 1934 he was the country's wealthiest
person, [36] :p360
one of the wealthiest in the world by the early 1950s, [49]
and near the end of his regime his fortune was an estimated $800
million. [45] :p111
In 1937
Trujillo
(who was himself one-quarter Haitian), [50]
in an event known as the
Parsley Massacre
or, in the Dominican Republic, as
El
Corte
(The Cutting), [51]
ordered the Army to kill Haitians living on the Dominican side
of the border. The Army killed an estimated 17,000 to 35,000
Haitians over six days, from the night of October 2, 1937
through October 8, 1937. To avoid leaving evidence of the Army's
involvement, the soldiers used
machetes
rather than bullets. [34] [50] [52]
The soldiers of Trujillo were said to have interrogated anyone
with dark skin, using the
shibboleth
perejil
( parsley )
to tell Haitians from Dominicans when necessary; the 'r' of
perejil
was of difficult pronunciation for Haitians. [51]
As a result of the massacre, the Dominican Republic agreed to
pay Haiti US$750,000, later reduced to US$525,000. [37] [48]
On November 25, 1960 Trujillo killed three of the four
Mirabal sisters , nicknamed
Las Mariposas
(The
Butterflies). The victims were Patria Mercedes Mirabal (born on
February 27, 1924), Argentina Minerva Mirabal (born on March 12,
1926), and Antonia María Teresa Mirabal (born on October 15,
1935). Minerva was an aspiring lawyer who was extremely opposed
to Trujillo's dictatorship since Trujillo had begun to make rude
sexual advances towards her. The sisters have received many
honors posthumously, and have many memorials in various cities
in the Dominican Republic. Salcedo, their home province, changed
its name to
Provincia Hermanas Mirabal
(Mirabal Sisters Province). The
International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women
is observed on the anniversary of their deaths.
For a long time, the US and the Dominican elite supported the
Trujillo government. This support persisted despite the
assassinations of political opposition, the massacre of
Haitians, and Trujillo's plots against other countries. The US
believed Trujillo was the lesser of two or more evils. [51]
The U.S. finally broke with Trujillo in 1960, after Trujillo's
agents attempted to assassinate the Venezuelan president,
Rómulo Betancourt , a fierce critic of Trujillo. [48] [53]
Trujillo was assassinated on May 30, 1961. [48]
Post-Trujillo
In February 1963, a democratically elected government under
leftist
Juan Bosch
took office but was overthrown in September. In
April 1965, after nineteen months of military rule, a pro-Bosch
revolt broke out. Days later, U.S. President
Lyndon Johnson , concerned that
Communists
might take over the revolt and create a "second
Cuba", sent the Marines, followed immediately by the Army's 82d
Airborne Division and other elements of the XVIIIth Airborne
Corps in
Operation Powerpack . "We don't propose to sit here in a
rocking chair with our hands folded and let the Communist set up
any government in the western hemisphere", Johnson said. [54]
The forces were soon joined by comparatively small contingents
from the
Organization of American States . All these remained in the
country for over a year and left after supervising elections in
1966 won by
Joaquín Balaguer , who had been Trujillo's last
puppet-president. [17] [55]
Balaguer remained in power as president for twelve years. His
tenure was a period of repression of
human rights
and civil liberties, ostensibly to keep
pro-Castro or pro-communist parties out of power. His rule was
further criticized for a growing disparity between rich and
poor. It was, however, praised for an ambitious infrastructure
program, which included large housing projects, sports
complexes, theaters, museums, aqueducts, roads, highways, and
the massive
Columbus Lighthouse , completed in a subsequent tenure in
1992.
1978
to present
In 1978, Balaguer was succeeded in the presidency by
opposition candidate
Antonio Guzmán Fernández , of the
Dominican Revolutionary Party
(PRD). Another PRD win in 1982
followed, under
Salvador Jorge Blanco . Under the PRD presidents, the
Dominican Republic experienced a period of relative freedom and
basic human rights. Balaguer regained the presidency in 1986,
and was re-elected in 1990 and 1994, this last time just
defeating PRD candidate
José Francisco Peña Gómez , a former mayor of Santo Domingo.
The 1994 elections were flawed, bringing on international
pressure, to which Balaguer responded by scheduling another
presidential contest in 1996. [1]
This time
Leonel Fernández
achieved the first-ever win for the
Dominican Liberation Party
(PLD), which Bosch founded in
1973 after leaving the PRD (also founded by Bosch). Fernández
oversaw a fast-growing economy, averaging 7.7% per year, with a
drop in unemployment and stable exchange and inflation rates. [56]
In 2000 the PRD's
Hipólito Mejía
won the election. This was a time of economic
troubles, [56]
and Mejía was defeated in his re-election effort four years
later by Fernández, who won re-election in 2008. [14]
Fernández and the PLD are credited with initiatives that have
moved the country forward technologically, such as the
construction of the
Metro Railway
("El Metro"). On the other hand, his
administrations have also been accused of corruption. [56]
Geography
Main article:

Hydroelectricity and dams in the Dominican Republic
Map of the Dominican Republic
The Dominican Republic is situated on the eastern part of the
second-largest island in the
Greater Antilles ,
Hispaniola . It shares the island roughly at a 2:1 ratio with
Haiti .
The country's area is reported variously as 48,442 km² (by the
embassy in the United States) [2]
and 48,730 km² (by the U.S. CIA), [1]
) making it the second largest country in the
Antilles , after
Cuba .
The country's capital and greatest metropolitan area,
Santo Domingo , is located on the southern coast.
There are many small offshore islands and
cays
that are part of the Dominican territory. The two largest
islands near shore are
Saona , in the southeast, and Beata, in the southwest. To the
north, at distances of 100–200 kilometres (62–124 mi), are three
extensive, largely submerged
banks , which geographically are a southeast continuation of
the Bahamas :
Navidad Bank ,
Silver Bank , and
Mouchoir Bank . Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been
officially claimed by the Dominican Republic.
The country's mainland has four important mountain ranges.
The most northerly is the
Cordillera Septentrional
("Northern Mountain Range"), which extends from the northwestern
coastal town of
Monte Cristi , near the Haitian border, to the Samaná
Peninsula in the east, running parallel to the Atlantic coast.
The highest range in the Dominican Republic — indeed, in the
whole of the West Indies — is the
Cordillera Central
("Central Mountain Range"). It
gradually bends southwards and finishes near the town of
Azua , on the Caribbean coast. In the Cordillera Central are
found the four highest peaks in the Caribbean: Pico Duarte
(3,098
metres  / 10,164  feet )
above
sea level ), La Pelona (3,094 metres / 10,151 feet), La
Rucilla (3,049 metres / 10,003 feet) and Pico Yaque (2,760
metres / 9,055 feet).

Pico Duarte , with La Pelona in the background
In the southwest corner of the country, south of the
Cordillera Central, there are two other ranges. The more
northerly of the two is the
Sierra de Neiba , while in the
south the
Sierra de Bahoruco
is a continuation of the
Massif de la Selle
in Haiti. There are other, minor mountain
ranges, such as the
Cordillera Oriental
("Eastern
Mountain Range"),
Sierra Martín García ,
Sierra de
Yamasá
and
Sierra de Samaná .
Between the Central and Northern mountain ranges lies the
rich and fertile
Cibao
valley. This major valley is home to the city of
Santiago
and most of the farming areas in the nation. Rather
less productive is the semi-arid San Juan Valley, south of the
Central Cordillera. Still more arid is the Neiba Valley, tucked
between the Sierra de Neiba and the Sierra de Bahoruco. Much of
the land in the
Enriquillo
Basin is below sea level, with a hot, arid,
desert-like environment. There are other smaller valleys in the
mountains, such as the
Constanza ,
Jarabacoa ,
Villa Altagracia , and
Bonao
valleys.
Cayo Levantado in
Samana Bay
is one of the many cays in the D.R.
The
Llano Costero del Caribe
("Caribbean Coastal
Plain") is the largest of the plains in the Dominican Republic.
Stretching north and east of
Santo Domingo , it contains many sugar plantations in the
savannahs
that are common there. West of Santo Domingo its
width is reduced to 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) as it hugs the coast,
finishing at the mouth of the Ocoa River. Another large plain is
the
Plena de Azua
("Azua Plain"), a very dry region in
Azua Province .
A few other small coastal plains are in the northern coast
and in the
Pedernales
Peninsula.
South shore of Lake Enriquillo, looking northward to
the Sierra de Neiba
Four major rivers drain the numerous mountains of the
Dominican Republic. The
Yaque del Norte
is the longest and most important Dominican
river. It carries excess water down from the Cibao Valley and
empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the
Yuna River
serves the
Vega Real
and empties into Samaná Bay, in the northeast.
Drainage of the San Juan Valley is provided by the San Juan
River,
tributary
of the
Yaque del Sur , which empties into the Caribbean, in the
south. The
Artibonito
is the longest river of
Hispaniola
and flows westward into Haiti.
There are many lakes and coastal
lagoons . The largest lake is
Enriquillo , a
salt lake
at 40 metres (131 ft) below sea level, the lowest
point in the Caribbean. Other important lakes are Laguna de
Rincón or Cabral, with
freshwater , and Laguna de Oviedo, a lagoon with
brackish water .
Climate
Main article:
Climate of the Dominican Republic
The climate of the Dominican Republic is mostly
tropical . The annual average temperature is 25 °C (77 °F).
At higher elevations, the temperature averages 18 °C (64.4 °F)
while near
sea level
the average temperature is 28 °C (82.4 °F). Low
temperatures of 0 °C (32 °F) are possible in the mountains while
high temperatures of 40 °C (104 °F) are possible in protected
valleys. January and February are the coolest months of the
year, while August is the hottest month. Some snowflakes can
fall in rare occasions on the top of the Pico Duarte. [57]
The
wet season
along the northern coast lasts from November
through January. Elsewhere, the wet season stretches from May
through November, with May being the wettest month. Average
annual rainfall is 1,500 millimetres (59.1 in) countrywide, with
individual locations in the Valle de Neiba seeing averages as
low as 350 millimetres (13.8 in) while the Cordillera Oriental
averages 2,740 millimetres (107.9 in). The driest part of the
country lies in the west.
Tropical cyclones
strike the country every couple of years,
with 65 percent of the impacts along the southern coast.
Hurricanes are most likely between August and October. [57]
The last time a category 5 hurricane struck the country was
Hurricane David
in 1979. [58]
Environmental
issues
Bajos de Haina , 12 miles (19 km) west of Santo Domingo, was
included on the
Blacksmith Institute 's list of the world's 10 most polluted
places, released in October 2006, due to
lead poisoning
by a
battery recycling
smelter closed in 1999. Cleanup of the
site began in 2008, but children continue to be born with high
lead levels, causing
learning disabilities , impaired physical growth and
kidney
failure. [59] [60]

Symbols
and country's names
Some of the important symbols include the
flag ,
the coat of arms , and the national anthem, titled
Himno Nacional . The flag has a large white cross that
divides it into four quarters. Two quarters are red and two are
blue. Red represents the blood shed by the liberators. Blue
expresses God's protection over the nation. The white cross
symbolizes the struggle of the liberators to bequeath future
generations a free nation. An alternate interpretation is that
blue represents the ideals of progress and liberty, whereas
white symbolizes peace and unity amongst Dominicans. [61]
In the center of the cross is the Dominican coat of arms, in the
same colors as the national flag. The coat of arms pictures a
red, white and blue flag-draped shield with a Bible and cross;
the shield is surrounded by an olive branch (on the left) and a
palm branch (on the right). A blue ribbon above the shield
reads, "Dios, Patria, Libertad" (meaning "God, Fatherland,
Liberty"). A red ribbon under the shield reads, "República
Dominicana" (meaning "Dominican Republic"). Out of all the flags
in the world, the depiction of a Bible is unique to the
Dominican flag.
The
national flower
is that of the West Indian Mahogany ( Swietenia
mahagoni ). [62]
The national bird is the
Cigua Palmera
or
Palmchat
( Dulus dominicus ). [63]
For most of its history (up to independence) the colony was
known as Santo Domingo, [31]
the name of its present capital, and its patron saint,
Saint Dominic . The residents were called "Dominicanos"
(Dominicans), which is the adjective form of "Domingo", and the
revolutionaries named their newly independent country "La
República Dominicana". At present, the Dominican Republic is one
of two nations worldwide (along with the Central African
Republic) with only a demonym-based name. [64]
In the national anthem of the Dominican Republic ( Himno
Nacional ) the term 'Dominican' never appears. The author of
its lyrics Emilio Prud'homme consistently uses the poetic term
Quisqueyanos , that is, "Quisqueyans".

Demographics
Main article:
Demographics of the Dominican Republic
Population
The population of the Dominican Republic in 2007 was
estimated by the United Nations at 9,760,000, [65]
which placed it number 82 in population among the 193 nations of
the world. In that year approximately 5% of the population was
over 65 years of age, while 35% of the population was under 15
years of age. There were 103 males for every 100 females in the
country in 2007. [1]
According to the UN, the annual population growth rate for
2006–2007 is 1.5%, with the projected population for the year
2015 at 10,121,000.
It was estimated by the Dominican government that the
population density in 2007 was 192 per km² (498 per sq mi), and
63% of the population lived in urban areas. [7]
The southern coastal plains and the Cibao Valley are the most
densely populated areas of the country. The capital city, Santo
Domingo, had a population of 3,014,000 in 2007. Other important
cities are
Santiago de los Caballeros
(pop. 756,098),
La Romana
(pop. 250,000),
San Pedro de Macorís ,
San Francisco de Macorís ,
Puerto Plata , and
La Vega . Per the United Nations, the urban population growth
rate for 2000–2005 was 2.3%. [66]

Ethnicity
Dominican girls at carnival, in
Taíno
garments and makeup (2005)
The ethnic composition of the Dominican population is 73%
multiracial, 16% white, and 11% black. [1]
The multiracial population is primarily a mixture of
European
and
African , but there is as well a significant Taíno element in
the population; [25]
recent research has shown that at least 15% of Dominicans have
Taíno
ancestry. [68]
The country's population also includes a large
Haitian
minority. Other ethnic groups in the country include
West Asians —mostly
Lebanese ,
Syrians
and
Palestinians . [69]
A significant presence of
East Asians , primarily
ethnic Chinese
and
Japanese , can also be found. [69]
Europeans are represented mostly by
Spanish ,
German Jews ,
Italians ,
Portuguese ,
British ,
Dutch ,
Danes , and
Hungarians . [69] [70] [71]
There are also tens of thousands of US citizens. [72]
A
system of racial stratification
was imposed on Santo Domingo
by Spain, as elsewhere in the Spanish Empire. [ citation
needed ]
Its effects have persisted, reaching their
culmination in the
antihaitianismo
of the
Trujillo
regime, as the dictator used racial persecution and
nationalistic fervor against Haitians. [51] [73]
A U.N. envoy in October 2007 found racism against blacks in
general, and Haitians in particular, to be rampant in every
segment of Dominican society. [74]
According to a study by the
CUNY
Dominican Studies Institute, about 90% of the
contemporary Dominican population has West African ancestry to
varying degrees. [75]
However, most Dominicans do not self-identify as black, in
contrast to people of West African ancestry in other countries.
A variety of terms are used to represent a range of skin tones,
such as
moreno/a
(brown),
canelo/a
(red/brown)
["cinnamon"],
indio/a
(Indian),
blanco/a oscuro/a
(dark white), and
trigueño/a
(literally "wheat colored",
or olive skin). [76]
Ramona Hernández, director of the Dominican Studies Institute
at
City College of New York
asserts that the terms were
originally a defense against racism: "During the Trujillo
regime, people who were dark skinned were rejected, so they
created their own mechanism to fight it." She went on to
explain, "When you ask, 'What are you?' they don't give you the
answer you want ... saying we don't want to deal with our
blackness is simply what you want to hear." [77]
Religion
Main article:
Religion in the Dominican Republic
The Dominican Republic is 95.2% Christian, including 88.6%
Roman Catholic
and 4.2%
Protestant . Recent immigration, as well as proselytizing,
has brought other religions, with the following shares of the
population:
Spiritist : 2.2%, [78]
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints : 1.1%, [79]
Buddhist : 0.10%,
Bahá'í : 0.1%, [78]
Islam :
0.02%,
Judaism : 0.01%,
Chinese Folk Religion : 0.1%. [78]
There is an unknown number of voodoo practitioners.
The nation has two patroness saints:
Nuestra Señora de la
Altagracia
(Our Lady Of High Grace) is the patroness of the
Dominican people, and
Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes
(Our
Lady Of Mercy) is the patroness of the Dominican Republic.
The Catholic Church began to lose popularity in the late 19th
century. This was due to a lack of funding, of priests, and of
support programs. During the same time, the Protestant
evangelical
movement began to gain support. Religious
tension between Catholics and Protestants in the country has
been rare.
There has always been religious freedom throughout the entire
country. Not until the 1950s were restrictions placed upon
churches by Trujillo. Letters of protest were sent against the
mass arrests of government adversaries. Trujillo began a
campaign against the church and planned to arrest priests and
bishops who preached against the government. This campaign ended
before it was even put into place, with his assassination.
During World War II, a group of
Jews
escaping
Nazi Germany
fled to the Dominican Republic and founded the
city of
Sosúa .
It has remained the center of the Jewish population since. [80]
Their settlement was in part an effort by Trujillo to "whiten"
the population.
Languages
Main article:
Dominican Spanish
The Dominican Republic is almost entirely Spanish speaking.
Schools are based on a bilingual education, [ citation
needed ]
therefore English is a secondary language.
Haitian Creole
is spoken by much of the population of
Haitian descent. There is a community of about 8,000 speakers of
Samaná English
in the Samaná Peninsula. They are the
descendants of formerly enslaved African Americans who arrived
in the 19th century. [81]
Tourism, American pop culture, the influence of
Dominican Americans , and the country's economic ties with
the United States motivate other Dominicans to learn English.
French is also spoken by a good portion of the population.
Education
Primary education is officially free and compulsory for
children between the ages of 5 and 14, although those who live
in isolated areas have limited access to schooling. Primary
schooling is followed by a two-year intermediate school and a
four-year secondary course, after which a diploma called the
bachillerato
(high school diploma) is awarded. Relatively
few lower-income students succeed in reaching this level, due to
financial hardships and limitation due to location. Most of the
wealthier students attend private schools, which are frequently
sponsored by religious institutions. Some public and private
vocational schools are available, particularly in the field of
agriculture, but this too reaches only a tiny percentage of the
population. [82]
Health
In 2007 the Dominican Republic had a
birth rate
of 22.91 per 1000, and a
death rate
of 5.32 per 1000. [1]
The prevalence of
HIV/AIDS
in the Dominican Republic in 2003 stood at an
estimated 1.7 percent, with an estimated 88,000
HIV/AIDS-positive Dominicans. [83]
A mission based in the United States is helping to combat AIDS
in the Dominican Republic. [84]
Dengue
is endemic to the country, and there are cases of
malaria. [85]
The practice of
abortion
is illegal in all cases in the Dominican Republic,
a ban that includes conceptions following rape, incest, and in
situations where the health of the mother is in danger. This ban
was reiterated by the Dominican government in a September 2009
provision of a constitutional reform bill. [86]
Crime
The Dominican Republic has become a trans-shipment point for
Colombian drugs destined to Europe as well as the United States
and Canada. [1] [87]
Money laundering via the Dominican Republic is favored by
Colombian drug cartels for the ease of illicit financial
transactions. [1]
In 2004 it was estimated that 8% of all cocaine smuggled into
the United States had come through the Dominican Republic. [88]
The Dominican Republic responded with increased efforts to seize
drug shipments, arrest and extradite those involved, and combat
money-laundering.
The often light treatment of violent criminals has been a
continuous source of local controversy. In April 2010, five
teenagers ages 15 to 17 (including 2 females) shot and killed
two taxi drivers and killed another five by forcing them to
drink drain cleaning acid. On September 24, 2010, the teens were
sentenced to only 3–5 year prison terms, despite the protests of
the taxi drivers' families. [89]
Immigration
Main article:
Japanese settlement in the Dominican Republic
Main article:
History of the Jews in the Dominican Republic
In the 20th century, many
Arabs
(primarily from
Lebanon
and
Syria ),
Japanese , and, to a lesser degree,
Koreans
settled in the country as agricultural laborers and
merchants. The Chinese, who were fleeing the
Chinese Communist
People's Liberation Army
(PLA), found work in mines and
building railroads. The current Chinese Dominican population
totals
50,000 . [ citation

The
Arab
community is rising at an increasing rate. Estimates
are at 3,400. [ citation

Japanese immigrants, who mostly work in
the business districts and markets, are at an estimate of 1,900
living in the country. [ citation
needed ]
The Korean presence is minor but evident,
at a population of 500. [ citation
needed ]
In addition, there are descendants of immigrants who came
from other Caribbean islands, including
St. Kitts and Nevis ,
Dominica ,
Antigua ,
St. Vincent ,
Montserrat ,
Tortola ,
St. Croix ,
St. Thomas ,
Martinique , and
Guadeloupe . They worked on sugarcane plantations and docks
and settled mainly in the cities of
San Pedro de Macoris
and
Puerto Plata . They are believed to number 28,000. Before and
during World War II 800 Jewish refugees moved to the Dominican
Republic. [90]
Illegal
Haitian immigration
A border

Haiti, located in the
Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic
Haiti is much poorer than the Dominican Republic. In 2003,
80% of all Haitians were poor (54% in abject poverty) and 47.1%
were illiterate. The country of nine million people has a
fast-growing population, but over two-thirds of the labor force
lack formal jobs. Haiti's per capita GDP (PPP) was $1,300 in
2008, or less than one-sixth of the Dominican figure. [1] [91]
As a result, hundreds of thousands of Haitians have migrated to
the Dominican Republic, with some estimates of 800,000 Haitians
in the country, [12]
while others put the Haitian-born population as high as one
million. [92]
They usually work at low-paying and unskilled jobs in building
construction, household cleaning, and in sugar plantations. [93]
There have been accusations that some Haitian immigrants work in
slavery-like conditions. [94]
Children of illegal Haitian immigrants are often
stateless
and denied services, as their parents are denied
Dominican nationality because they are deemed to be transient
residents, due to their illegal or undocumented status, and the
children, though often eligible for Haitian nationality, [95]
are denied it by Haiti because of a lack of proper documents or
witnesses. [96] [97] [98] [99]
A large number of Haitian women, often arriving with several
health problems, cross the border to Dominican soil during their
last weeks of pregnancy to obtain much-needed medical attention
for
childbirth , since Dominican public hospitals do not refuse
medical services based on nationality or legal status.
Statistics from a hospital in Santo Domingo report that over 22%
of childbirths are by Haitian mothers. [100]
In 2005 Dominican President Leonel Fernández criticized
collective expulsions of Haitians as having taken place "in an
abusive and inhuman way". [101]
After a UN delegation issued a preliminary report stating that
it found a profound problem of racism and discrimination against
people of Haitian origins, Dominican
Foreign Minister
Carlos Morales Troncoso
issued a formal statement denouncing
it and asserting that "Our border with Haiti has its problems,
this is our reality and it must be understood. It is important
not to confuse national sovereignty with indifference, and not
to confuse security with xenophobia". [102]
Emigration
Main article:
Dominican American
Main article:
Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico
The first of three, late-20th century emigration waves began
in 1961, after the assassination of dictator Trujillo, [103]
due to fear of retaliation by Trujillo's allies, and political
uncertainty in general. In 1965, the United States began a
military occupation of the Dominican Republic to end a civil
war. Upon this, the U.S. eased travel restrictions, making it
easier for Dominicans to obtain U.S. visas. [104]
From 1966 to 1978, the exodus continued, fueled by high
unemployment and political repression. Communities established
by the first wave of immigrants to the U.S. created a network
that assisted subsequent arrivals. In the early 1980s,
underemployment, inflation, and the rise in value of the dollar
all contributed to a third wave of emigration from the island
nation. Today, emigration from the Dominican Republic remains
high. [105]
In 2006, there were approximately 1.3 million people of
Dominican descent in the US, counting both native- and
foreign-born. [13]

Culture of the Dominican Republic
The culture and people of the Dominican Republic, like its
Spanish Caribbean
neighbors, is a blend of the cultures of
the Spanish colonists, African slaves, and Taíno natives.
European, African and Taíno cultural elements are most prominent
in food, family structure, religion and music. Many Arawak/Taíno
names and words are used in daily conversation and for many
foods native to the Dominican Republic. [1]
Cuisine
Main article:
Cuisine of the Dominican Republic
Dominican cuisine is predominantly Spanish, Taíno, and
African. The typical cuisine is quite similar to what can be
found in other Latin American countries, but many of the names
of dishes are different. One breakfast dish consists of eggs and
mangú
(mashed, boiled plantain), a dish that the
Dominican Republic shares with Cuba and Puerto Rico. For
heartier versions,
mangú
is accompanied by deep-fried
meat (Dominican salami, typically) and/or cheese. Similarly to
Spain, lunch is generally the largest and most important meal of
the day. Lunch usually consists of rice, meat (such as chicken,
beef, pork, or fish), beans, and a side portion of salad. "La
Bandera" (literally "The Flag") is the most popular lunch dish;
it consists of meat and red beans on white rice.
Sancocho
is a stew often made with seven varieties of
meat.
Meals tend to favor starches and meats over dairy products
and vegetables. Many dishes are made with
sofrito , which is a mix of local herbs and spices
sautéed to bring out all of the dish's flavors. Throughout the
south-central coast,
bulgur , or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in
quipes
or
tipili
(bulgur salad). Other
favorite Dominican foods are
chicharrón ,
yuca ,
casabe ,
pastelitos
( empanadas ),
batata ,
yam ,
pasteles en hoja ,
chimichurris ,
tostones . Some treats Dominicans enjoy are
arroz con dulce
(or
arroz con leche ),
bizcocho
dominicano
(lit. Dominican cake),
habichuelas con dulce ,
flan ,
frío frío
(snow cones),
dulce de leche , and
caña
( sugarcane ).
The beverages Dominicans enjoy include
Morir Soñando ,
rum ,
beer ,
Mama Juana ,
batida
(smoothie), jugos naturales
(freshly squeezed fruit juices),
mabí ,
coffee, and
chaca
(also called
maiz con dulce
and
maiz con
leche ), the last item being only found in the southern
provinces of the country such as San Juan.
Music
Main article:
Music of the Dominican Republic
Musically, the Dominican Republic is known for the creation
of the musical style called
merengue , [106] :376–7
a type of lively, fast-paced rhythm and dance music consisting
of a tempo of about 120 to 160 beats per minute (though it
varies) based on musical elements like drums, brass, chorded
instruments, and accordion, as well as some elements unique to
the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, such as the
tambora
and
güira .
Its
syncopated beats
use
Latin percussion ,
brass instruments ,
bass , and
piano
or
keyboard . Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted
internationally by Dominicans groups like Billo's Caracas Boys,
Chapuseaux and Damiron "Los Reyes del Merengue", Joseito Mateo,
and others. Radio, television, and international media
popularized it further. Some well-known merengue performers
include
Johnny Ventura , singer/songwriter
Juan Luis Guerra ,
Fernando Villalona ,
Eddy Herrera ,
Sergio Vargas ,
Toño Rosario ,
Milly Quezada , and
Chichí Peralta . Merengue became popular in the United
States, mostly on the
East Coast , during the 1980s and 90s, [106] :375
when many Dominican artists, among them Victor Roque y La Gran
Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferreira, Aventura, Milly, and
Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos, residing in the U.S. (particularly
New York ) started performing in the Latin club scene and
gained radio airplay. The emergence of
bachata , along with an increase in the number of
Dominicans living among other
Latino
groups in New York,
New Jersey , and
Florida
have contributed to Dominican music's overall growth
in popularity. [106] :378

Bachata , a form of music and dance that originated in the
countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican
Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects
are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak
and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was
amargue
("bitterness", or "bitter music", or blues music),
until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term
bachata
became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely
related to, the pan-Latin American romantic style called
bolero . Over time, it has been influenced by merengue
and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.
Dominican rock
is also popular. Many, if not the majority,
of its performers are based in Santo Domingo and Santiago.
Particularly among the young, hip-hop/rap has been growing in
popularity in recent years. Also known as
Rap del Patio
("backyard rap"), Dominican rap is created by Dominican crews
and solo artists. Originating in the early 2000s with crews such
as
Charles Family , successful rappers such as
Lapiz Conciente ,
Vakero ,
Toxic Crow , and
R-1
emerged. The youth have embraced the music, sometimes
over merengue, merengue típico, bachata, as well as
salsa , and, most recently,
reggaeton . Dominican rap differs from reggaeton in the fact
that Dominican rap does not use the traditional
Dem Bow
rhythm frequently used in reggaeton, instead using
more hip hop-influenced beats. [ citation

Government
and politics
National Palace in Santo Domingo
Main article:
Government of the Dominican Republic
The Dominican Republic is a
representative democracy
or
democratic republic , [1] [2] [14]
with three branches of power:
executive ,
legislative , and
judicial . The
President of the Dominican Republic
heads the executive
branch and executes laws passed by the
Congress , appoints the Cabinet, and is commander in chief of
the
armed forces . The president and vice-president run for
office on the same ticket and are elected by direct vote for
4-year terms. The national legislature is bicameral, composed of
a
Senate , which has 32 members, and the
Chamber of Deputies , with 178 members. [14]
Judicial authority rests with the
Supreme Court of Justice 's 16-members. They are appointed by
a council composed of the President, the leaders of both houses
of Congress, the President of the Supreme Court, and an
opposition or non–governing-party member. The Court "alone hears
actions against the president, designated members of his
Cabinet, and members of Congress when the legislature is in
session." [14]
The president appoints the governors of the thirty-one
provinces. Mayors and municipal councils administer the 124
municipal districts and the National District (Santo Domingo).
They are elected at the same time as congressional
representatives. [14]
The Dominican Republic has a multi-party political system.
Elections are held every two years, alternating between the
Presidential elections , which are held in years evenly
divisible by four, and the Congressional and municipal
elections, which are held in even-numbered years not divisible
by four. "International observers have found that presidential
and congressional elections since 1996 have been generally free
and fair." [14]
The Central Elections Board (JCE) of 9 members supervises
elections, and its decisions are unappealable. [14]
There are
many political parties
and
advocacy groups
and, new on the scene,
civil organizations . The three major parties are the
conservative
Social Christian Reformist Party
(Spanish: Partido
Reformista Social Cristiano [PRSC]), in power 1966–78 and
1986–96; the
social democratic
Dominican Revolutionary Party
(Spanish: Partido
Revolucionario Dominicano [PRD]), in power in 1963, 1978–86, and
2000–04); and the originally leftist, increasingly conservative
Dominican Liberation Party
(Spanish: Partido de la
Liberación Dominicana [PLD]), in power 1996–2000 and since 2004.
The
presidential elections of 2008
were held on May 16, 2008,
with incumbent Leonel Fernández winning with 53% of the vote. [112]
He defeated Miguel Vargas Maldonado, of the PRD, who achieved a
40.48% share of the vote. Amable Aristy, of the PRSC, achieved
4.59% of the vote. Other minority candidates, which includes
former Attorney General
Guillermo Moreno
from the
Movement for Independence, Unity and Change
(Movimiento
Independencia, Unidad y Cambio [MIUCA]) and PRSC former
presidential candidate and defector Eduardo Estrella obtained
less than 1% of the vote.
Economy
Santo Domingo , the capital of the Republic and
its largest city.

Economy of the Dominican Republic
See also:
Dominican Peso
The Dominican Republic has the second largest economy [9]
(the largest, according to the U.S. State Department) [14]
in Central America and the Caribbean. It is an upper
middle-income
developing country , [113]
with a 2007
GDP
per capita of $9,208, in
PPP
terms, which is relatively high in Latin America. In the
trimester of January–March 2007 it experienced an exceptional
growth of 9.1% in its GDP, which was actually below the previous
year's 10.9% in the same period. Growth was led by
imports , followed by exports, with finance and foreign
investment the next largest factors. [114]
Santiago de los Caballeros , the second largest
city in the country
The D.R. is primarily dependent on natural resources and
government services. Although the service sector has recently
overtaken agriculture as the leading employer of Dominicans (due
principally to growth in tourism and
Free Trade Zones ), agriculture remains the most important
sector in terms of domestic consumption and is in second place,
behind
mining , in terms of
export
earnings. The service sector in general has
experienced growth in recent years, as has construction. Free
Trade Zone earnings and tourism are the fastest-growing export
sectors.
Real estate
tourism alone accounted for $1.5 billion in
earnings for 2007. [115]
Remittances
from Dominicans living abroad amounted to nearly
$3.2 billion in 2007. [14]
The Naco sector, in Santo Domingo, with a view of
Tiradentes Avenue
Economic growth takes place in spite of a chronic energy
shortage, [116]
which causes frequent blackouts and very high prices. Despite a
widening merchandise
trade deficit , tourism earnings and remittances have helped
build
foreign exchange reserves . The Dominican Republic is current
on foreign
private debt . [ citation

Following economic turmoil in the late 1980s and 1990, during
which the
gross domestic product
(GDP) fell by up to 5% and consumer
price
inflation
reached an unprecedented 100%, the Dominican
Republic entered a period of growth and declining inflation
until 2002, after which the economy entered a
recession . [14]
La Trinitaria in Santiago de Los Caballeros is an
area of increasing development.
This recession followed the collapse of the second-largest
commercial bank
in the country,
Baninter , linked to a major incident of
fraud
valued at $3.5 billion, during the administration of President
Hipólito Mejía
(2000–2004). The Baninter fraud had a
devastating effect on the Dominican economy, with GDP dropping
by 1% in 2003 while inflation ballooned by over 27%. All
defendants, including the star of the trial, Ramon Baez
Figueroa, were found guilty and convicted; one subpoena failed
to be delivered upon the United States denial of extradition. [ citation

According to the 2005 Annual Report of the United Nations
Subcommittee on Human Development in the Dominican Republic, the
country is ranked #71 in the world for resource availability,
#79 for human development, and #14 in the world for resource
mismanagement. These statistics emphasize national government
corruption, foreign economic interference in the country, and
the rift between the rich and poor.
Currency
The
Dominican peso
(DOP, or RD$) [117]
is the national currency, although
United States dollars
(USD) and the
euro
(EUR) are also accepted at most tourist sites. The U.S. dollar
is implicated in almost all commercial transactions of the
Dominican Republic; such
dollarization
is common in high inflation economies. The
peso was worth the same as the USD until the 1980s, but has
depreciated. The exchange rate in 1993 was 14.00 pesos per USD
and 16.00 pesos in 2000, but it jumped to 53.00 pesos per USD in
2003. In 2004, the exchange rate was back down to around 31.00
pesos per USD. As of November 2010 the exchange rate was 1 DOP =
0.0273 USD, i.e. 36.6 DOP per USD; 1 DOP = 0.020 euro (EUR, or
€); and 1 DOP = 2.294
Japanese yen
(JPY, or ¥). [117]
Tourism
The green mountain hills of the Dominican Republic,
ideal for
biking
and
bird-watching , are major tourist attractions.
Tourism is fueling the Dominican Republic's economic growth.
For example, the contribution of travel and tourism to
employment is expected to rise from 550,000 jobs in 2008—14.4%
of total employment or 1 in every 7 jobs—to 743,000 jobs—14.2%
of total employment or 1 in every 7.1 jobs by 2018. [118]
With the construction of projects like
Cap Cana , San Souci Port in Santo Domingo, and Moon Palace
Resort in
Punta Cana , the Dominican Republic expects increased tourism
activity in the upcoming year.
Ecotourism
has been a topic increasingly important in the
nation, with towns like
Jarabacoa
and neighboring
Constanza , and locations like the Pico Duarte, Bahia de Las
Aguilas and others becoming more significant in efforts to
increase direct benefits from tourism.

Communications in the Dominican Republic
The Dominican Republic has a well-developed
telecommunications
infrastructure, with extensive
mobile phone
and
landline
services.
Cable Internet
and
DSL
are available in most parts of the country, and many
Internet service providers
offer
3G
wireless internet service. The reported speeds are from 256
kbit/s / 128 kbit/s for residential services, up to 5 Mbit/s / 1
Mbit/s for residential service. For commercial service there are
speeds from 256 kbit/s up to 154 Mbit/s. (Each set of numbers
denotes
downstream/upstream speed ; i.e. to the user/from the user.)
Projects to extend
Wi-Fi
hot spots have been made in Santo Domingo. The country's
commercial radio stations and television stations are in the
process of transferring to the
digital spectrum , via
HD Radio
and
HDTV . The telecommunications regulator in the country is
INDOTEL ( Instituto Dominicano de Telecomunicaciones ).
The largest telecommunications company is
Claro Codetel , a provider of wireless, landline, broadband,
and
IPTV
services which is part of
Carlos Slim Helú 's
América Móvil .
Indotel reports that as of June 5, 2009 there are more than 8
million phone line subscribers (land and cell users) in the
D.R., representing 81% of the country's population and a
fivefold increase since the year 2000, when there were 1.6
million. The communications sector generates about 3.0% of the
GDP. [119]
Indotel reports 6,807,831 prepaid and just under a million
(994,027) post-pay (under-contract) cell user accounts. For
fixed phone lines (non-cell) it reports 678,901 dedicated lines
in use for residential services. For business lines it reports
266,341. For public phones/services it reports 13,639. As of the
second quarter of 2008, there are no more analog lines in the
trunk services by local providers. Indotel reports 2,439,997
Internet users in the country for the end of March 2009. [120]
In November 2009, the Dominican Republic became the first
Latin American country to pledge to include a "gender
perspective" in every information and communications technology
(ICT) initiative and policy developed by the government. [121]
The Dominican Republic is leading Latin American governments’
thinking around gender and technology as part of the regional
eLAC2010
plan. The tool the Dominicans have chosen to design
and evaluate all the public policies is the APC
Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM) .
Electricity
Electric power service has been unreliable since the Trujillo
era, and as much as 75% of the equipment is that old. Sometimes
the power goes out every day. [ citation
needed ]
The country's antiquated power grid causes
transmission losses which account for a large share of billed
electricity from generators. The privatization of the sector
started under a previous administration of Leonel Fernández. [56]
The recent investment in a "Santo Domingo-Santiago Electrical
Highway" to carry 345
KV
power, [122]
with reduced losses in transmission, is being heralded as a
major capital improvement to the national grid since the
mid-1960s.
During the Trujillo regime, electrical service was introduced
to many cities; still, almost 95% of usage was not billed at
all. Around half of the Dominican Republic's 2.1 million houses
have no meters and so most do not pay or just pay a fixed
monthly rate for their electric service. [123]
Household and general electrical service is delivered at 110
volts
alternating at 60  Hz ;
electrically powered items from the United States work with no
modifications. The majority of the country has access to
electricity. Still, in 2007 some areas have outages lasting as
long as 20 hours a day. Tourist areas tend to have more reliable
power, as do business, travel, healthcare, and vital
infrastructure. The situation improved in 2006, with 200
circuits (40% of the total) providing permanent electricity, as
85% of electric demand overall was met and blackouts were
reduced from 6.3 hours per day to 3.7. [ citation
needed ]
Concentrated efforts were announced to
increase efficiency of delivery to places where the collection
rate reached 70%. [124]
The electricity sector is highly politicized. Some generating
companies are undercapitalized and at times unable to purchase
adequate fuel supplies. [14]
Transportation
Main article:
Highways and Routes in the Dominican Republic
The Dominican Republic has five major highways which take
travelers to every important town in the country. The three
major highways are
DR-1 ,
DR-2 ,
and
DR-3 , which go to the northern, southwestern, and eastern
parts of the country, respectively. There is a new,
106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the
country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in
the Samaná Peninsula in less than two hours. Most routes
interconnecting small towns in the country are unpaved, but
improving.
The
Santo Domingo Metro
is the first mass transit system in the
country, and second in the Caribbean and Central American
nations, after the Tren Urbano in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On
February 27, 2008 president Leonel Fernández test rode the
system for the first time and free service was offered
thereafter several times. Commercial service started on January
30, 2009. Several additional lines are currently being planned.
The
Santiago light rail
system is in planning stages.
There are two transportation services in the Dominican
Republic: one controlled by the government, through the Oficina
Técnica de Transito Terrestre (O.T.T.T.) and the Oficina
Metropolitana de Servicios de Autobuses (OMSA); and the other
controlled by private business, among them, Federación Nacional
de Transporte La Nueva Opción (FENATRANO) and the Confederacion
Nacional de Transporte (CONATRA). The government transportation
system covers large routes in metropolitan areas, such as
Santo Domingo
and
Santiago .
Military
Main article:
Military of the Dominican Republic
Congress
authorizes a combined military force of 44,000
active duty personnel. Actual active duty strength is
approximately 32,000. However, approximately 50% of those are
used for non-military activities such as security providers for
government-owned non-military facilities, highway toll stations,
prisons, forestry work, state enterprises, and private
businesses. The Commander in Chief of the military is the
President. The principal missions are to defend the nation and
protect the territorial integrity of the country. The army,
larger than the other services combined with approximately
20,000 active duty personnel, consists of six infantry
brigades , a combat support brigade, and a combat service
support brigade. The air force operates two main bases, one in
the southern region near Santo Domingo and one in the northern
region near Puerto Plata. The navy operates two major naval
bases, one in Santo Domingo and one in Las Calderas on the
southwestern coast, and maintains 12 operational vessels. In the
Caribbean, only Cuba has a larger military force. [14]
The armed forces have organized a Specialized Airport
Security Corps (CESA) and a Specialized Port Security Corps
(CESEP) to meet international security needs in these areas. The
Secretary of the Armed Forces has also announced plans to form a
specialized border corps (CESEF). Additionally, the armed forces
provide 75% of personnel to the National Investigations
Directorate (DNI) and the Counter-Drug Directorate (DNCD). [14]
The Dominican National Police force contains 32,000 agents.
The police are not part of the Dominican armed forces, but share
some overlapping security functions. Sixty-three percent of the
force serve in areas outside traditional police functions,
similar to the situation of their military counterparts. [14]
