Break out the DEET
2012
June 21
by Mike
We find it interesting that, although we’re anchored in a largely mangrove-bordered bay, we see very few mosquitos here. And that’s a good thing too because we’ve heard that there have been at least a few cases of
Dengue Fever
reported on the island.
I first became aware of
Dengue Fever
when we were traveling to
Brazil
for our honeymoon. I’m not sure what is worse, the name
Dengue Fever , which in my mind conjures up images of some exotic tropical jungle disease, or its nickname,
Breakbone Fever . On second thought, I think the nickname is worse. Regardless of what you call it though, the disease, which is transmitted by mosquitos, is not something that we wish to acquire, especially given that there is no real treatment other than rest and hydration.
We seldom wear bug repellent around here but I do think that when we next venture into the rainforest, we will.
Note:
I know that when some people read things like this they think “ OMG, we had better not go there… I don’t want to get that illness .” We NEVER think like that. I’m posting this information here conversationally, not as a dire warning to coat your body with
DEET
before you step outdoors.

Not that I can recall. The breeze at anchor keeps most pests at bay. We have been bothered most by bugs the few times we have stayed in marinas where the breeze does not always align with the hatches.

Mike,
I you were in Brazil probably you already know, anyway being a Brazilian I need to comment.
The dengue moskito looks for water that is traped on things or plants (like a tire with water inside or those big plants that can trap water) to lay their eggs.
A Mangrove is not their prefered ground since there are fish on the water that can eat the eggs.
Anyway, watch out and enjoy.

Hi Ricardo
Yes, what you have said about the static water makes sense. In the rainy season here there is lot more standing water on the flats which I assume would be excellent breeding grounds for the mosquitos.

Mosquitoes need fresh or stagnant water in which to lay eggs.
Any moving water, such as tidal, rivers or streams won’t attract them – but, like Ricardo says, pools and puddles of fresh water are their favourite egg-laying domains.
I had dengue as a kid, growing up in Fiji.
All I can remember is the sweats, the fever and the soaked sheets.
Not a great time.
It took me some time to recover and I even had relapses for some years whenever I got run down.
A little tip – if you get a mosquito bite, rub a little saliva on it to seal it from the air.
It takes away the itch and the desire to scratch it.
Each time it itches, repeat the saliva trick.
It’ll be gone in a couple of days.

I’m sure having dengue was NOT a good time! Like I said, definitely something to avoid.
Strangely back home in Canada there were way more mosquitos bothering us than there are here!

Mike,
I second John’s question above, specifically related to noseeums: have there been any islands/beaches where you ran into problems with these truly awful POSs?
Glad you’re being safe re Dengue Fever. Hong Kong has its few cases every year given the prevalence of mossies, and it is not something to trifle with. We now take precautions as we can. Hope you guys do the same, esp on your hikes.

The daughter-in-law of a friend of mine, who lives in Singapore
(the daughter -in- law that is) , contracted Denge Fever recentlyon a business trip to Bangcock. on her sickly return to Singapore, when she notified her medical practice! they immediately diagnosed
it
and supplied an almost “Ghost-busters” eradication team that took apart he local neighberhood in case she had contacted it in
Singapore? They obviously take it seriously there. She was told that the first time you contract it its not usually deadly. but
the second time it can be but the third time could be the end! So be careful you guys I am told that a simple spray of oily soap or a fine oil y dissinfectant on a stagnant pool will prevent the mossie egs from developing? Deet is used by most military institutions and the most effective I am told mind your eyes!:o))

Rob: I found it amusing to envision the Ghost Busters team searching for mosquito eggs! Hope the young lady that you spoke of recovered fully.

Angela: There are noseeums here and at times, they can be a problem, if you don’t have any bug repellant on. They seldom bother Rebecca or I all that much but just the other day I had a terrible time with them. Very strange. It’s certainly not enough of a problem to keep us away from the beach but they can be annoying around dusk.
