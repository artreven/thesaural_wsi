Thanksgiving last Thurs was great - we hosted. Sarah took off from work the day before and prepped a ton of food. With some help from me she made: two turkey breasts, one herb garlic and one with bbq spices; stuffing, one veg and one not; cole slaw, one dairy and one not; green beans with mushrooms and crispy onions; fresh cranberry sauce; gravy; mashed potatoes; sweet potatoes; salad, and apple crisp. I made pumpkin pie and Ruth made coconut cream pie. Corbin and Theresa joined us and it was excellent!

We ate some amazing food last weekend at
Estadio . Also enjoyed
Bier Baron . Also
enjoyed
GBD
though we were drunk from the Bier Baron, which may have biased us. Visited a
museum
we'd never tried before,
and saw some great Faith Ringgold paintings from before she started quilting. Hirshhorn's current "Damage Control" exhibition includes Bruce Conner's
'A Movie'
which was very good. Saw
muhly grass
for the first time. Made it to Eden Ctr for tasty lunch. Staying with Bob and Bernie was really inspiring, too.

Friday dinner at Cantina with Matte, then Unblurred crawl. Slept in Sat, took bike to shop, got some snazzy Paul Smith trousers at Hey Betty. Date night with Sarah with roof top confab, then on to Nico's, then to Curto Park for fireworks. Gorgeous Sunday: lox omelet courtesy of Mom, coffee with Ed and Lil, finally back home after renters left, jogging, hanging with Ian, supper at Thai Cuisine.
Jul 29:
Friday had drinks with Momjo at Howler's. Saturday saw
Turbo
with the Boviers then cooked them a decent dinner at home including teeny, tiny orange tomatoes from the garden. Sunday super chill, lonely, but included a run about 4pm, and a walk with kids to Mercurio's after supper. Kids at Almost Authors this week. ... Writer

Thursday, my mother-in-law treated for ice cream at Page's for the last day of school. Friday night we had supper at mom's then took kids to the Arts Festival at the Point downtown. We heard Red Baraat, saw lots of friends and acquaintances, had beautiful weather, saw and made giant bubbles near the fountain. Sat we hit up Penn Ave Arts in Motion, played some badminton, Sarah and I ate a good meal outside at the Cantina. Sunday my wife cooked us huevos, then we went to see the Pirates. Got downtown early, saw some Pride paraders, got great parking as usual, walked across the bridge in the rain. During the rain delay had a great meal and service at the Hall of Fame club, then watched 2/3 of a great game, then drove 45 mins north for volleyball which was very fun. Even phoned my dad, who was in the middle of getting a transfusion at home. Beautiful weekend.
Jun 10:
Fri skipped opening night of arts festival and watched Pens lose their final game of the season. Sat walked early and got strawbs at farmers market, made unglaublich strawberry-rhubarb pie from
Pie , hockey w Des out back, played in Tova's last soccer gm of the season, then Desi's bday party at Jen's. Got to listen to Paula talk and found out dad is ill. Over-carbed and crashed hard! Sunday drove to Better Maid but they were closed. Took Abby to summer reading extravaganza at CLP. Biked to Regent Sq, down and up part of the Braddock Trail in Frick Park, saw the really good
Frances Ha , lots of fresh fruit all weekend, lots of time outside.
Jun 5:
Today is Desmond's birthday. He is beloved to me.
May 28:
This was one of those long weekends hard to remember what we did. Fri night asked the kids to pick dinner out and unanimously they voted for Jimmy Wan's, then watched the Pens at home. Sat hit the ELib farmers market for rhubarb, took Tova to art store, moved a buncha belgian block and soil around, made pie, had supper at OTBicycle, and Sarah prepped slaw and beans for Sun. Sun made
brek
at home, then picnic at Ruth's in Wilkinsburg. Mon was cycling from Wash Landing to casino and back, then drove to Clem's in Blairsville (good, but not worth an hour drive). Not too hot yet. Super relaxing weekend.

Fri nite: Manilow. Mom had a great time. Pasta trio at Lidia's can't lose. Sat morn: Julie R's move cancelled, so went to
Better Maid
instead. Learned they are OPEN SUNDAY wtf this is excellent news dunno how this fact escaped me. Then, another perfect gyro omelet at
Lindo's . Sat noon: tried to hit up
Amazing Books , but they have no Saturday hours.
Sat 2pm: daughters soccer game freezing wind at Schenley oval, team lost. Sat eve: heavy but tasty dinner with Sarah, a good step meeting, then a lovely gathering tho maybe the last at Madge and Rich's in Mt Olly. Sun:
Mike
and
Heidi
visiting from Bklyn, hosted brunch at our place so they could see a bunch of their old friends at one shot. Plus, sunshine. Plus, stopped in to see Katie and Christa's great progress on their home reno around the corner. Plus, a bike ride right before sunset which woke me up after all that brunchin'.
Apr 15:
A lovely weekend! Movie and pizza Friday at home with the kids: Tova had Sabrina over, adults watched
Perks of Being a Wallflower
downstairs. Saturday chilly and sunny included morning workout with Desi in tow, Tova's soccer game. Sat night anniversary date at Stagioni and Inn Termission. Sunday chores, biked to tacos, much warmer.
Mar 4:
Fine long weekend while Sarah was living it up in NOLA. Normal weeknight Thurs, had Erika over Fri for old fashioned chat, took Abby to ceramics Sat morn, Kiran and Malikah came over, enjoyed
Jack the Giant Slayer
in 2d. Sunday was mac-n-cheese omelets, snow tubing, soccer, groceria, airport. Forgot what it's like to all the cooking and all the cleaning! Very satisfying but not sure I would want to do it all the time. We have good children.
Feb 28:
Payday! Hard to get used to being paid monthly. Sarah left this morning for NOLA for four days with three other married lady friends. Too bad our kids are not yet trained cooks or bartenders!
Jan 28:
Spent a chill weekend with my gorg wife and kids this weekend. Watched
Skyfall
and
Golden Boy,
put bunk beds together, bought a dress suit (Alfani, made in India, at Macy's) and a new waterproof biking shell, went to the first
mayoral
debate. Seemed like Bill Peduto was a bit flushed and flagging by the end of the 80 minutes; the mayor seemed in trouble on police issues; Lamb seemed informed and competent.
Jan 2:
Just back from a beautiful trip to Chicago with Sarah. Weds we drove through the snow and bad roads to Maumee, OH to hand Abby off to her grandparents. Many hours and miles later, checked in with the great
Hampus and Maggie
then over to Stacey and Dinesh's for vino and catching up. Thurs was
Art Inst
and Al's Beef (ok) and figuring out the trains (exc) during the day, Thai food with JFen at night. Friday was
Frontera
where my food (pork meatball taco, mole trio) was excellent but Sarah was disappointed, plus
MCA , drinks on the
96th floor , and later thee excellent
Heligoats
and Ezra Furman at the Hideout. Saturday was an early trip to
Edelman
and then Sarah's best lunch ever in the US (!) at
Ikram , shopping in Wicker Park, Big Star tacos, drinks at
Violet Hour
and
Waco Bros
at Schuba's. Yup.

It's bad enough that staunchly anti-union workplaces like Wal-Mart give "temporary part-time" employees, that actually work there for years, so few hours and so little pay that the workers rely on public assistance to support their families. But it's even worse when the same practices are followed by a non-profit, non-taxpaying employer like
UPMC . And then, on top of it all:
this outrage .
Dec 10:
This week's going to be crazy busy with Abby choir stuff, Chanukah stuff, Bill Peduto fundraiser and hosting brunch next Sunday whilst sober. Weekend good, Steelers bad.
Dec 3:
A nice weekend. Planted trees Saturday morning all along
our street , organized by TreeVitalize and City Forestry dept and ELDI. Burgatory and
ARGO
Sat night. Sunday was 5-year anniversary of meeting Sarah! We went out to the same place we met: brunch at Max's Allegheny Tavern. Thank God I met Sarah. ...Then the Steelers
won .
Nov 29:
Made a pie! Came out good.
Cranberry and pear
with cardamom and cinnamon and a pistachio crumb crust.
Nov 28:
Darlene (boss) finally returned. I dared to go say 'hi' and she was pleasant as usual. She apologized for not looking over my work yet. Now I'm invited to a 2pm meeting. Found cardamom and pears but no pecans at the indian mart, so I got some pricey pistachios already shelled for this pie tonight. ... Black Angels .
Nov 27:
NYC wrap up! Arrived Weds at our traditional spot, the Budd Lake Holiday Inn, then went out to see
Lincoln.
In the morning, the egg-sammy joint was closed for Tgiving but four yards later we found a small diner open. Arrived at
Mike and Heidi 's place in Sunset Park. Lunched at the excellent
Rico's Tacos
a block from where we were staying.
Supper Thursday at my sister Tmima's was amazing: her stepson Yossi made as many dishes as there were folks in attendance. Saw Joel and Dvora and Phyllis and Albee there and spent some time with Tmima's daughter Zahava and Yossi's daughter Eliza.
Spent the day Friday at MoMA where we saw many great things; I especially liked the drawn studies for sculptures by Alina Szapocznikow. Friday night we attended the informal Tappan Zee HS reunion happy hour in Nyack, where many drinks were drunken and we got to hang with Andy and Lesley Malin, Marc Egezarian, Joe Galarneau, and Jen Ullman.
Sat morn brought the first egg sammies. We visited the
Earth Room
and
The Broken Kilometer , walked around SoHo and watched a short docu at the Tenement Museum. Late lunch was at the incredible
Mission Chinese .
We heard Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers play their last show ever, at Webster Hall. Almost everyone there was a huge fan and we didn't know anything about the band. Sincere stuff, not always the most artful lyrics, but good. Caught the Notre Dame game at
Standings
on E7th. Got a very late bite at
Parm.
Sunday we took our hosts and their charming kids Hâ€“ and Sâ€“ out for brunch at
606 R&D
where I had an exc horseradish sammy with egg and bacon. Then to
The Distinguished Wakamba Cocktail Lounge
which was odd and not endearing, for one drink, but then to
Hibernia
in Hell's Kitchen for Steelermania and one of the worst games our team has played in a long time.
Sweet Nick Monsour met us there at 4. At 7:30 we went to
Asssscat 3000
for pretty good improv including Bobby (Snooki) Moynihan. On our way out Monday morn, had to get one more egg sammy (love it when the counter girl asks 'salt-pepper-ketchup?') at
Generoso's . Whew!
Nov 19:
This Weds we are leaving for NY. Thurs at Tmima's, Friday night in Rockland, Sat night at Webster Hall to catch Stephen Kellogg & the Sixers, Sunday brunch with Mike and Heidi and Sunday night seeing UCB. Hoping for a peaceful trip.

We had a great time celebrating, with a cla$$y March weekend just squeaked in b4 April.
Stayed at
Baricelli Inn
in their little Italy.
Had one of the best lunches of my life at
La Dolce Vita : calamari with zucchini in a slightly spicy tomato sauce. Walked to and thru the 2/3-closed
art museum . Free valet parking downtown courtesy
CIFF ! Ate well at
Lola
â€“ I had beef cheek pierogi w horseradish cream, and lobster soup; she had hanger steak w pickle sauce and the best fries I think I ever ate.
Drank forreal cheap at Ontario St Cafe and watched Pitt lose.
Enjoyed the new Johnnie To film. Then spent Sunday on a self-guided driving tour and saw so many cool buildings and park spaces and industrial stuff and shoreline. Brought back some cannoli. Cleveland (apparently) rocks.

Here's a kooky idea: make the needy auto companies produce a "national" car that does not change from year to year, is inexpensive, fuel-efficient and easy to fix at home, like the Beetle was in 1938.
If they don't agree to produce a minimum number of these cars for 5 straight years, then no bailout. The companies would still be able to produce as many other car styles as they like.

I
got to eat well at

at Two Boots, Telephone Bar & Grill (stilton fritters and cranberry relish, mmm), and Chip
Shop. I got to drive back and forth with Ian, and we heard Lila Downs at Prospect Park free. And a lovely visit with Mochan! And ate turkey burgers at my cousin MIke's
annual b-b-q! Walked Central Park with my uncle Joel ... and got to see the Mets win on the last at-bat. I walked a LOT, rode the subway, and had a pretty relaxin

The
latest chapter
in PATransit woes.
The P-G reported in Nov that what had
been estimated to be a $31.5mil deficit in this year's $347.5mil operating budget would end up at about $20 million as a result of savings and a few small gains in revenue.
Weren't these gains in revenue due in some great part to high gasoline prices? I believe public transit, and less so the roads and bridges maintenance, are a matter of
security .
Maybe not "national security" but call it what you like - maybe "commonwealth security." If there were really some emergency, it would of course be easier to
make sure 8 bus depots were supplied with gasoline, instead of 2000 private gasoline stations.
Add a dollar to the state gasoline tax, which will both push people to use the
public transit more, and fund the shortfalls in the state budget for transit and road and bridge maintenance. I hate when Orie and other state senators want to say this is a
regional and not a state problem.

I think Jon Stewart started a bit slow but lots of funny stuff in
the show .
The Colbert fake ads were great, and I thought Ben Stiller was great - he even read the nominees' names funny.
Stewart had a couple of great lines after 36Mafia won.
I liked Clooney's speech and I thought the president of the academy's speech was great too.
Streep and Tomlin were excellent, and Streep might have been the best dressed of the night. I teared up when Witherspoon talked about her granny.
I am a sucker for this show every year.
Altman gave a good speech.
Overall it was a good show I thought.
I felt terrible for Lauren Bacall - she should have gotten a standing ovation as soon as she appeared on stage, and they gave her this huge introduction to say.
Compare it with the three-line intro they wrote for Samuel Jackson to say, and it was just not right.

This blog never includes real writing. Mebbe as Bovier says, it's time for a change of pace. Now that I'm rockin it (more like emo-ing it) single stizz, you can see me regularly mopin it quietly and catching some great tunes at the hott spots of the east end.
And that means I can see you too.
Though long gone from the blogworld, I seen
Jilly

Juli , looking better than ever and helping to make me feel not
too
too old (thx also to George and Lloyd for this ;).

Bye.

Jan 18:
I wonder if
this
news
really means savings for the city, or just a shift in police spending.
The P-G doesn't get into the politics of why a supposedly good commander is being moved from a higher-crime area to the new mayor's neighborhood, doesn't comment on the mayor's seemingly large influence on decisions that would seem best suited to the police chief (the mayor just replaced the chief with a temp, who'll be followed by a cop who's not been on the Pgh force in years).
City council seems out-of-the-loop on this, especially, though not surprisingly, Twanda Carlisle (chairwoman of council's Public Safety Committee). And no comment from anyone in the police union leadership? ...Congrats to the
Union Project .
