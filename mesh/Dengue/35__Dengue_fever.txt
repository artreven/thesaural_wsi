translation. It's a fucking big jump, unless they smocked the same shit SubaHibi's group did 3 weeks ago I'm gonna have to assume they randomly posting data like 11eyes translator did.
-
Aroduc's
new random title is "Immaterial Braves: Ignite!......Sub-title: Moge!", go figure it out lol.
-
Shinigami No kiss
is close to completion, give it 6 more weeks and they will probably finish.

Your source?
Remember, each week the title changes so it's impossible to know what the heck he's translating.

Ooo, an RPG! Don't see a whole ton of those translated. Looks interesting. (Although in the NSFW pic, the blonde girls breasts seem to have grown a few cup sizes from her other screenshots and the cover o_O)
Edit: Aroduc did Kamidori didn't he?

It could very well be Material Brave. I was leaning towards Soukoku no Arterial at first.... although this could just be a troll :S

but hopefully there is one and it's good

That would really piss me off. Thankfully, that's not the case. Various editors on Tlwiki say that they are working on the project, like
DxS
and
Herkz . Ah well, just gotta wait and find out.
