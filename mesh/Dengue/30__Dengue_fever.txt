Warning on Skin Whiteners
Posted on
August 2, 2011
by
biomartasia
A warning has been raised by the local anti-toxic watchdog EcoWaste Coalition on several brands of skin whiteners.  Samplings were purchased last July 23 from two drug stores, one cosmetics shop, and two sidewalk vendors all located in Quiapo, Manila, and had been found to carry mercury levels up to 28,600 ppm.
According to the group, the chemically-tainted products, mostly imported from China, has exceeded the 1 ppm standard limit under the “Hygienic Standards for Cosmetics” of the People’s Republic of China.
Visiting Chicago-based scientist Dr. Joe DiGangi tested the
skin whitening
products using the XRay Fluorescence (XRF) device, a chemical analyzer used by private companies and regulatory agencies in the United States.
“We are shocked to find outrageously high levels of mercury in the cosmetics we tested that ranged from 1,085 to 28,600 ppm, in brazen breach of the country’s regulatory limit,” EcoWaste’s Safe Cosmetics campaigner Aileen Lucero said.
“None of the 11 products listed mercury as ingredient in their labels, indicating the manufacturers’ failure to provide truthful information that can help consumers make sound choices,” she pointed out.
Lucero further noted that five brands had been recalled in 2010 by the Food and Drugs Administration ( FDA ) for containing excessive mercury.
“The other brands have not been recalled yet and should be recalled now for the safety of cosmetic consumers,” she said.
DiGangi explained that skin whitening products such as creams, lotions or soaps sometimes contain toxic mercury chloride and/or
ammoniated mercury , or hydroquinone, which is also highly toxic.
Mercury use in cosmetics products, according to the
United Nations Environment Program
(UNEP), can have adverse effects including skin rashes, discoloring and scarring and can reduce skin’s resistance to bacterial and mycotic skin disorders.
The UNEP publication “Mercury in Products and Wastes” also warned that direct and prolonged exposure through the skin during repeated applications can cause damage to the brain, nervous system and kidneys.
EcoWaste proposed a multistakeholders’ campaign to crack down against unscrupulous importers, distributors and retailers in the interest of consumer safety.
The group identified the FDA, Bureau of Customs, Philippine National Police, local government units, consumer protection groups, local authorities and the media as key players in keeping the market free of toxic cosmetics.
Among the skin whitening creams that failed the regulatory limit on mercury were Miss Beauty Magic Cream (28,600 ppm), Jiaoli 7-Day Specific Eliminating Freckle AB Set Cream (12,400 ppm), JJJ Magic Spots Removing Cream (9,610 ppm), Flower Woman 7-Day Whitening and Spot and Night Set Cream (7,754 ppm), Jiaoli Miraculous Cream (7,665 ppm), Sara Glutathione Sheep Placenta Whitening and Anti-Spot Cream (6,210 ppm), Szitang 7-Day Specific Whitening and Spot AB Set Cream (5,886 ppm), Beauty Girl Natural Olive and Sheep Essence 10-Day Double Whitening Cream (3,638 ppm), Miss Beauty Excellent Therapy Whitening Cream (2,304 ppm), Aichun Beauty Green Tea Whitening Speckle Removing Series Cream (1,820 ppm), and Aichun Beauty Whitening Freckle Day and Night Cream (1,574 ppm).

Summer time is finally over; Dengue-watch is on
Posted on
June 26, 2011
by
biomartasia
As per PAGASA-DOST ( Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration
under the
Department of Science and Technology ), SUMMER is officially over.  After measuring a certain amount of
rainfall
for three straight days, rainy days are finally here.  The
Philippines
has two seasons:  dry and
wet seasons .  However, with the
La Nina
phenomenon which is a consequence of the
global warming
this year, summer days were shortened to one and a half months while rainy days will bring more rains than average.
Last year, 2010, we saw only 11
typhoons
and predictively, with La Nina in effect, there will be an annual number of 19 to 21 typhoons this year but with more volume of rainwater, meaning expect high floodwaters.  The likes of
Ondoy -type flooding is not remote.
Preparation for the rainy season is advised.  One may experience a hot and humid weather in the mornings and mid-afternoons but would rain heavily in the late afternoons.  The employees usually complain about this, it usually rains when it is time to go home.
Dengue virus cases is still on the rise.  As per Department of Health (DOH)  records, there are more than 23,000 cases from the period of January to May this year.  This is 8% higher compared to the same period last year.  Case fatality is .62% or 141 deaths.
Most of the cases came from the National Capital Region (6,732 or 30%), Central Luzon (4,181 or 18%) and CALABARZON (CAvite, LAguna, BAtangas, Rizal and QueZON or Region IV-A) with 3,555 or 15% of the 22,903 cases.
From the National Capital Region, the breakdown are as follows:  Quezon City with 1,694 or 25%, Manila with 824 or 12%, Kalookan City with 775 or 11.2%, Pasig with 592 or 8.7%, Valenzuela with 466 or 7%  and Paranaque City with 407 or 6%.
Age of those afflicted are from less than a month to 89 years, or pratically everyone is prone if one is not careful and aware of his or her environment.

The Miracle Tree:
Moringa or Malunggay
Posted on
May 12, 2011
by

Moringa Malunggay for Tea and Garnish
One of the popular herbs we often hear on the health features is the malunggay plant, or scientifically named Moringa oleifera.  Almost all parts of the tree are used to extract the benefits of its highly nutritional and medicinal properties.  The Moringa tree is seen and cultivated extensively in Central and South America, Africa, Mexico and the Asian countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and India. It is known in the Philippines as malunggay, muringa in India, Sajina in Bangladesh and .  There are lots of benefits that you can get from this tree, nutrition-wise and medicinal value:  Vitamins A, B, C, D and E and minerals like potassium, calcium, iron, selenium and magnesium.  It has also full of potent and disease-preventing nutrients. We sometimes see the Moringa leaves in our Filipino daily food fare as ingredients in soup.  One of those who benefit from this high amino acid content, 2,500 times more than green tea and 242 times more than an apple, are the breastfeeding mothers as these are known to increase the volume of milk.  There are no known negative side-effects, nor toxic elements reported. Moringa leaves are used to make Moringa tea.  It contains anti-oxidant properties that inhibits the effects of free radicals.  For diabetics, it is a plus factor as it manages glucose levels in the blood and help promotes better sleep.  It is said to be an excellent energy booster but lacks the presence of caffeine that is present with other energy drinks, coffee or other tea. Moringa oil, an extract taken from the seeds of the tree, is likely to be used as a cooking or salad oil alternative just like olive oil or sunflower oil.  It is well-known for its remarkable oxidative stability. Being a light textured oil, Moringa oil is also used for body massage and aromatherapy procedures with its high concentration of Oleic, Lenoleic and Palmitoleic acids that gives nourishing and moisturizing properties. As an antiseptic, Moringa oil is good in alleviating and soothing discomfort from insect bites, rashes, and minor burns, bruises and scratches. As we seen on the market today, there are several products derived from this miracle tree that is beneficial to man.  The Moringa leaves are grinded and mixed with almost what we normally eat daily.  There is malunggay pancit or noodles, malunggay loaf bread or pandesal.  The Filipino school children are given the benefits of having malunggay or moringa in their pandesal or bread.  As for convenience, the Moringa leaves are grounded and mixed with other nutritious herbs either in capsule or herbal tea form. Biomart Asia sees the potential benefits of moringa and presents it in the form of Moringa Tea.  All the benefits of the moringa leaves, among this is amino acid which is 2,500 times more than the popular green tea, are conveniently prepared for you as you sip your daily tea.  It also contains anti-oxidants that help prevent chronic diseases such as cancer, arthritis and heart and kidney diseases and serves as an anti-aging supplement. As one of the miracle tree, we have not seen the best of what this tree can do.  Extensive research and development are being undertaken to extract or further improve of what nutritional and medicinal values we can derive from this miracle tree.

Free Month-long Anti-Measles drive is on
Posted on
April 15, 2011
by
biomartasia
Don’t miss this chance for your children’s care or prevention against this highly contagious disease.  Ask your health center for the schedule when the shots will be given in your area.  Anyway, it is free.
With the onset of summer, so are the diseases that goes with the weather.  One is
measles
or tigdas.  Measles is a
viral infection
affecting the
respiratory system
and is highly contagious.  The
Department of Health , in its yearly campaign against the disease, has launched its anti-measles campaign.  The campaign started last April 4 and would last until May 4 nationwide.   The first stop is at Brgy. San Antonio, Paranaque City, which had a reported total no. of 40 cases of measles.  Last year, the city got 132 confirmed cases.  The goal of the annual campaign is to make the country free from measles for 2012.  The one-month campaign targets 18 million kids.  The Department of Health would do a house-to-house campaign, rich or poor.
Symptoms of measles include a
high fever
for four days, cough,
runny nose
and red eyes eventually leading to itchy rashes in the skin. According to Dr. Oyie Balburias, Pinoy MD host (of GMA Channel 7)/internist, there are also several myths about measles that practically have no medical basis like taking a bath with or drinking kolantro. But it is better to have safety precautions before administering the vaccine. It’s not recommended for kids to be vaccinated if they already have a very high fever or if they had a history of
allergic reaction
to the shot.
Dr. Oyie also said that most kids already had anti-measles shots when they were 6 – 9 months old. From 9 months to 7 years old, kids should have booster doses.

2011 Summer is officially here!!!
Posted on
April 13, 2011
by
biomartasia
Usually, we feel the cold weather stopping at around the first week of March as it is also called fire prevention month with a large number of fire occurring at this time.
Most probably due to the world’s global warming effect, summer is late this year and it is already the middle of the month of April. With the northeast monsoon gone, Filipinos can now expect warmer days ahead as summer has officially begun, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said.
PAGASA noted the temperature in most parts of the country has gradually risen, and wind direction has shifted from northeasterly to easterly and southeasterly.
“The shift of wind pattern signifies the start of warmer days ahead. The associated weather condition will be generally good weather in most parts of the country aside from isolated to scattered afternoon rainshowers and thunderstorms particularly over Visayas and Mindanao due to the expected oscillation of Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and passage of easterly wave,” it posted on its bulletin.
However, PAGASA said there are times that strong easterly wind will prevail particularly over Eastern Luzon and Visayas associated with moderate to rough coastal waters.
Predictions made by PAGASA says that this year is a wet summer.
By the way, with you and your family under the sun this summer, great care of the skin, hair and face is recommended.

WHO Declares Dengue a Major Health Threat
Posted on
November 24, 2010
by
biomartasia
The
World Health Organization (WHO)
has warned that dengue has developed into a major threat to global public health.  It would get worser if countries do not act now to strengthen their response.
“National resources need to be mobilized to sustain dengue prevention and control, and the disease’s profile needs to be raised on the global health agenda to stimulate the interest of international agencies and donors,” WHO regional director for the Western Pacific, Dr Shin Young-soo, said at a meeting in Putrajaya, Malaysia.
Speaking at the annual meeting here of WHO’s Regional Committee for the Western Pacific, Shin called on governments to display strong leadership and commitment, greater advocacy and investment, and better clinical management of cases. Regional collaboration was also vital, he said.
Overall, the number of cases in the Western Pacific Region has more than doubled over the past 10 years. Many countries have experienced a significant increase in cases this year, with the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and the
Philippines
particularly badly hit, he said.
Shin said that of the about 2.5 billion people at risk of dengue globally, about 1.8 billion or more than 70 percent live in Asia Pacific countries.
He attributed the growing threat of the disease to the higher temperatures and rainfall in many parts of the region this year, encouraging mosquito breeding; growing population densities; greater international travel by infected people and higher awareness levels and better surveillance systems in some countries.
While there was as yet no clear evidence that the increase in cases was due to global warming, climatic changes play an important role in the nature of mosquitoes, including the aedes aegypti, which is responsible for the spread of dengue.
Dr Hans Troedsson, Western Pacific Region’s director for Program Management, underlined the need for governments to take a broad approach to the problem, involving urban planning, and sanitation and environment. “This is not just a health problem. This is an inter-sectoral problem,” Hans said.
At the community level, elimination of mosquito breeding sites, such as water jars, building sites and discarded garbage, is essential. “The fight against this disease is everybody’s problem,” Shin said.
Although considerable efforts have been made to strengthen national dengue prevention and control programs since the endorsement of WHO’s
Dengue
Strategic Plan for the Asia Pacific Region (2008-2015), countries need to keep pace with the rapidly changing incidence and distribution of the disease, WHO said.
