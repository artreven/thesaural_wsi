This page is for the virus. For the disease, see
Hepatitis C .
Hepatitis C virus
( HCV ) is a small (55-65
nm
in size), enveloped,
positive sense
single strand
RNA
virus in the family
Flaviviridae . Although
Hepatitis A virus ,
Hepatitis B virus , and Hepatitis C virus have similar names (because they all cause
liver
inflammation), these are distinctly different viruses both genetically and clinically.

Structure
Simplified diagram of the structure of the Hepatitis C virus particle
The structure of the hepatitis C virus consists of a core of genetic material (RNA), surrounded by an
icosahedral
protective shell of
protein , and further encased in a lipid (fatty) envelope of cellular origin. Two viral envelope
glycoproteins , E1 and E2, are embedded in the lipid envelope. [ 1 ]

Genome
Genome organisation of Hepatitis C virus
Hepatitis C virus has a positive sense
RNA
genome
that consists of a single
open reading frame
of 9600
nucleoside
bases. [ 2 ]
At the 5' and 3' ends of the RNA are the UTR regions, that are not
translated into proteins but are important to translation and
replication of the viral RNA. The 5' UTR has a
ribosome
binding site [ 3 ]
(IRES - Internal Ribosomal Entry Site) that starts the translation of a
3000 amino acid containing protein that is later cut by cellular and
viral
proteases
into 10 active structural and non-structural smaller proteins. [ 4 ]
[ edit ]
Replication
A simplified diagram of the HCV replication cycle
Replication of HCV involves several steps. The viruses need a
certain environment to be able to replicate, and must therefore first
move to such areas.
HCV has a high rate of replication with approximately one trillion
particles produced each day in an infected individual. Due to lack of
proofreading by the HCV RNA polymerase, HCV also has an exceptionally
high mutation rate, a factor that may help it elude the host's immune
response.
HCV mainly replicates within
hepatocytes
in the liver, although there is controversial evidence for replication in
lymphocytes
or
monocytes . By mechanisms of
host tropism , the viruses reach these proper locations. Circulating HCV particles bind to
receptors
on the surfaces of hepatocytes and subsequently enter the cells. Two putative HCV receptors are
CD81
and human
scavenger receptor class B1
(SR-BI). However, these receptors are found throughout the body. The
identification of hepatocyte-specific cofactors that determine observed
HCV liver
tropism
are currently under investigation.
Once inside the hepatocyte, HCV initiates the
lytic cycle . It utilizes the intracellular machinery necessary to accomplish its own replication. [ 5 ]
The HCV genome is
translated
to produce a single protein of around 3011 amino acids. The polyprotein
is then proteolytically processed by viral and cellular
proteases
to produce three structural (virion-associated) and seven nonstructural
(NS) proteins. Alternatively, a frameshift may occur in the Core region
to produce an Alternate Reading Frame Protein (ARFP). HCV encodes two
proteases, the NS2 cysteine autoprotease and the NS3-4A serine
protease. The NS proteins then recruit the viral genome into an RNA
replication complex, which is associated with rearranged cytoplasmic
membranes. RNA replication takes places via the viral RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase
NS5B, which produces a negative-strand RNA intermediate. The negative
strand RNA then serves as a template for the production of new
positive-strand viral genomes. Nascent genomes can then be translated,
further replicated, or packaged within new virus particles. New virus
particles are thought to bud into the secretory pathway and are
released at the cell surface.
[ edit ]
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of HCV can occur via
DNA analysis
of the 5′-noncoding region (5′-NCR). However results vary according to the HCV genotype and
viral load .
Non-western HCV genotypes have not been studied as much. In 2009 it was
shown that the 3′-X-tail element of the HCV genome is highly conserved
across genotypes. It could be tested for $US8.70 within a couple of
hours and could also be a valuable tool for screening of
blood supplies . [5]
[ edit ]
Genotypes
Based on genetic differences between HCV isolates, the hepatitis C virus species is classified into six
genotypes
(1-6) with several subtypes within each genotype (represented by
letters). Subtypes are further broken down into quasispecies based on
their genetic diversity. The preponderance and distribution of HCV
genotypes varies globally. For example, in
North America , genotype 1a predominates followed by 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3a. In
Europe , genotype 1b is predominant followed by 2a, 2b, 2c, and 3a. Genotypes 4 and 5 are found almost exclusively in
Africa . Genotype is clinically important in determining potential response to
interferon -based therapy and the required duration of such therapy. Genotypes 1 and 4 are less responsive to
interferon -based treatment than are the other genotypes (2, 3, 5 and 6). [ 6 ]
Duration of standard interferon-based therapy for genotypes 1 and 4 is
48 weeks, whereas treatment for genotypes 2 and 3 is completed in 24
weeks.
Infection with one genotype does not confer immunity against others,
and concurrent infection with two strains is possible. In most of these
cases, one of the strains removes the other from the host in a short
time [ 7 ] . This finding opens the door to replace strains non-responsive to medication with others easier to treat.
[ edit ]
Vaccination
Unlike hepatitis A and B, there is currently no
vaccine
to prevent hepatitis C infection.
In a 2006 study, 60 patients received four different doses of an experimental hepatitis C vaccine. All the patients produced
antibodies
that the researchers believe could protect them from the virus. [ 8 ]
Nevertheless, as of 2008 vaccines are still being tested. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
[ edit ]
Current research
In 2007 the
World Community Grid
launched a project where, by computer modelling of the Hepatitis C
Virus (and related viruses), thousands of small molecules are screened
for their potential anti-viral properties in fighting the Hepatitis C
Virus. This is the first project to seek out medicines to attack the
virus directly once a person is infected. This is a distributed process
project similar to
SETI@Home
where the general public downloads the World Community Grid agent and
the program (along with thousands of other users) screens thousands of
molecules while their computer would be otherwise idle. If the user
needs to use the computer the program sleeps. There are several
different projects running, including a similar one screening for
anti-AIDS drugs. The project covering the Hepatitis C Virus is called
"Discovering Dengue Drugs – Together," because
Dengue
virus and HCV belong to the same family, together with
West Nile
and
Yellow fever
viruses.
[ 11 ]
The software and information about the project can be found at the World Community Grid web site. [ 12 ]
Current research is focused on viral
protease inhibitors , with drugs such as
Telaprevir , and
monoclonal antibodies
like
MBL-HCV1 [ 13 ] . Barriers to the study of HCV include the narrow host range of HCV, and the only animal model for HCV study is the
chimpanzee . The use of
replicons
has been successful but these have only been recently discovered. [ 14 ]
HCV, as with most all
RNA
viruses, exists as a
viral quasispecies , making it very difficult to isolate a single strain or receptor type for study. [ 15 ]
