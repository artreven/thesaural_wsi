These are the first 4 viruses that are part of the
Gift Horse
project for the upcoming
01SJ Biennial , built originally as 3D models and then translated into paper sculptures. We are making 12 in total and stuffing hundreds of them inside the
13-foot high Trojan Horse .
From left to right, we have
Tobacco Mosaic Virus
— the first virus ever discovered, then
Smallpox , historically significant since it was eradicated (save for two repositories in storage); then
Andromeda Strain
— an extra-terrestrial virus — from the 1971 movie. Finally there is  Dengue Fever , which has no known vaccine, is usually non-fatal, and is spread through mosquitos and is significant due to its
rampant increase from climate change , especially in non-western countries.
We based the physical models on these reference images, abstracting designs from them.
