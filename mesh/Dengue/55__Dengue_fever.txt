Life is what you make it...

Bring it on!
Did you ever have days when everything seemed to pale in comparison with what you were feeling inside? Perhaps you were having a terrible morning and somehow missed seeing how that little rosebud you have been watching for some time now has finally bloomed into a beautiful pink rose. Or how brilliantly dazzling blue the sky was and how the sun seemed to shine straight at you as if putting you in a stage with a spotlight. People were sending you smiles but you were sending it back with a huge frown of worry in your face. I have had those days myself. And at the end of each one, I realize that things were not so bad, I often regret how I wasted those precious moments being upset. I will be celebrating my birthday in a few days and I looked back and saw my life has changed a lot since my last birthday.
Aside from being another year older, I have realized that I am more courageous now to meet life head on. Before I thought life is just around the corner...waiting...for me. I was wrong. Life does not wait for no one. It's a choice you make everyday. So today I am changing my blog title. Hope you agree with me when I now say...LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT. Let me tell you a story of how someone's life changed because someone helped him see. A blind boy sat on the steps of a building with a hat by his feet. He held up a sign which said: "I am blind, please help." There were only a few coins in the hat. A man was walking by. He took a few coins from his pocket and dropped them into the hat. He then took the sign, turned it around, and wrote some words. He put the sign back so that everyone who walked by would see the new words. Soon the hat began to fill up. A lot more people were giving money to the blind boy. That afternoon the man who had changed the sign came to see how things were. The boy recognized his footsteps and asked, "Were you the one who changed my sign this morning? What did you write?" The man said, "I only wrote the truth. I said what you said but in a different way." What he had written was: "Today is a beautiful day and I cannot see it." Do you think the first sign and the second sign were saying the same thing? Of course both signs told people the boy was blind. But the first sign simply said the boy was blind. The second sign told people they were so lucky that they were not blind. Should we be surprised that the second sign was more effective? Moral of the Story: Be thankful for what you have. Be creative. Be innovative. Think differently and positively. Live life with no excuse and love with no regrets. When life gives you a 100 reasons to cry, show life that you have 1000 reasons to smile. Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear. Keep the faith and drop the fear. Sometimes the most beautiful thing is to see a person smiling! And even more beautiful is, knowing that you are the reason behind it! John Maxwell once said, "Your attitude determines your altitude." Obviously he was on to something.
Happy weekend to all of you.

And now she's 5!
I look at my little girl and I couldn't believe my eyes. She's all grown up and has a mind of her own.
She likes to dress up and put on accessories. She loves the color pink.
She is sweet if she sets her mind to it and very very playful. She is very meticulous and likes to draw pictures and makes stories.You can never fool her, she knows what you're up to. Well her nanny knows only too well. LOL!
Happy birthday sweetheart! Mommy and daddy loves you very much and Ate Pia too!

Isn't it Ironic?
This is not your typical slow Sunday. I got to think about a lot of things today. Some of them pretty heavy stuff. I couldn't help but think that life is full of ironies. Just wanted to share with you a message I received this week. Read them very carefully. Today we have bigger houses yet smaller families More convenience, but less time We Have More degrees, but less common sense More knowledge, but less judgement We have more experts, but more problems More medicine, but less good health We spend too recklessly Laugh too little Drive too fast Get too angry too quickly Stay up too late Read too little Watch TV too much And are less considerate We have multiplied our possessions, but have reduced our values We talk too much, love too little and lie too often We have learned how to make a living, but not a life We have added years to life, but not life to years We have taller buildings, but shorter tempers Wider roads, but narrower viewpoints We spend more, but have less We buy more, yet enjoy it less We have been all the way to the moon and back
But have trouble crossing the road to meet our neighbours. We’ve conquered our outer space,
But not our inner space We’ve split the atom But not our prejudice We write more, learn less, plan more, but accomplish less we have learned to rush, but not to wait, we have higher incomes , but lower morals We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies But have less personal communication We are long on quantity, But less in quality These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion Tall men and short character More leisure but less fun - more kinds of food - but less nutrition Two incomes - but more divorce nicer houses - but broken homes That is why I propose, that as of today, you do not keep anything for special occasions, because every day you live is a special occasion. Search for knowledge, read more.
Sit and admire the view without paying attention to your needs. Spend more time with your family and friends , eat your favorite food and visit the places you love. Life is moments of enjoyment and not just about surviving. Drink from the finest crystal glass.
Do not save your best perfume or aftershave but use it every day. Remove phrases like “one of these days“, “someday” and “not now” from your vocabulary write that letter you thought of writing “one of these days “ Let’s tell our families and friends how much we love them. Do not delay anything that adds laughter and joy to your life . Every day , every hour , and every minute is special. As you do not know if they will be your last. Ralph Waldo Emerson once said
"So much of our time is preparation, so much is routine, and so much retrospect, that the path of each man's genius contracts itself to a very few hours." Being a mom I am sometimes stuck in routine and most of the time in preparation, definitely in retrospection...Mr. Emerson is right it's time to change the way we see life.

Dear Life
My two precious daughters got sick this week. You would think that nine years of motherhood would have prepared me for this but sadly, no, I was not. It started with a simple fever on Monday evening. I was not worried then. I knew how to handle fever. Sponge baths, ice pack on the forehead, monitor the temperature, paracetamol every four hours. I have done it many times before. Tuesday morning, my little girl Zoe has a slight fever too. I wanted them both to stay home so the fever won't progress but my eldest daughter pleaded that she didn't want to miss anything in school. Sigh, I told the nanny to stay a little longer than usual in school to make sure that both are okay. I went to work but decided to take the afternoon off so that I could make sure that the kids are okay. When I arrived home I was surprised to see my mom and my sister in our room fuzzing over my eldest. As I entered the room I noticed how my mom looked. She was panicking. She looks like this when she's worried. "What's her temp?", I asked. "105.8 F", my mom whispered. I was shocked! I quickly changed clothes and took my daughter to the bathroom and gave her a cold bath. My heart was beating fast. I was the calm one...but all of a sudden I was thrown aback. The whole time her temperature only went down to 105 F. Worried was too light a word to describe how I was feeling. I called hubby and told him we might have to bring both the kids to the hospital. We stayed in the hospital overnight then. We were sent home when their temperatures got down to normal. Their blood tests were normal. However, the evening the next day my eldest had high fever again. My medical background told me I had to bring her back to make sure that it was not
Dengue Fever
. Waiting for the result was killing me. It was like waiting for my sentence to be served. I told hubby and my daughter that I wanted to go to the chapel. I prayed with all that I am worth. And told my daughter to do the same. She smiled at me, "I already prayed mom. He already heard us." It amazed me how certain she sounded when she said that. I banked on her faith. And I was not disappointed. She was negative for Dengue Fever. I felt as if the large knife that pierced through my heart was suddenly removed and I could breath again. I kissed and cuddled them both through the night and held their hands while they slept. If anything happened to them, I would die. I would give everything up in a split second, even my life, just so my children could live. I realized even more how precious each moment with them counts. If only I could keep them in my pocket and take them wherever I go each day, I would. Here's a nice quote from an unknown author that really touched my heart. Hope you like it and remember life is too precious to waste on hate, anger and pride. Love life and it will love you back. " This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever; in its place is something that you have left behind...let it be something good ."

La vie est juste autour du
coin...
"i love the sun for it warms my body, yet i love the rain for it
cleanses my spirit. i love the light for it shows me the way. yet i love
the darkness for it shows me the stars. i welcome happiness for it
enlarges my heart, yet i endure sadness for it opens my soul." THANK GOD
FOR EVERYTHING!
