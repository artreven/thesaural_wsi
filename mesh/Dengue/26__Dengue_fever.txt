Blocking mosquito pee to save lives
Aedes aegypti
mosquitoes are major carriers of disease.
They can transmit
Dengue
and
yellow
fevers, among other illnesses.
They do this by picking up the viral pathogens from an infected person during a blood meal, and transferring the viruses to the next person at a subsequent blood meal.
OK, I knew all that.
Here’s what I did not know:
apparently, the mosquitoes
have to urinate
as they feed in order to balance both their salt and fluid levels, and their flight ballast.
That just makes the thought of getting mosquito bites so much more pleasant.
There’s some good news though.
Researchers from Cornell University
have found a protein
in the skeeter’s renal tubes that is critical for urination.
When this protein is blocked, the insects’ ability to pee is adversely affected.
The scientists hope that this will also prevent the mosquitoes from leaving infected patients and transmitting diseases.

Stochastic Scientist?
What's up with that?
Why the Stochastic Scientist?
As I'm sure you all know, 'stochastic' is another word for 'random', which is what I intend for the focus of this blog.
Although my formal training is as a molecular biologist, there are many other fields of science that are also fascinating and beautiful.
It's my intention to blog about which ever scientific discovery or invention catches my, and hopefully your, fancy.
I also hope to inspire people to learn more about science.
By choosing among a huge variety of scientific endeavors, I'll undoubtably hit upon something that will pique my readers' interest.
I guess I could have called my blog 'The Joy of Science', but that wouldn't have been quite so random.
