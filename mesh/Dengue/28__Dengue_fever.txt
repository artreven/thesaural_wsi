Uninformed and Uneducated Opinions
"Others sat apart on a hill retired./
In thoughts more elevate and reasoned high/ Of providence, foreknowledge, will and fate,/Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute/ And found no end in wand'ring mazes lost./ Of good and evil they argued then./ Of happiness and final misery,/ Passion and apathy and glory and shame:/ Vain wisdom all and false philosophy!"

Voy A Regresar
It's time to go back to Nicaragua.  One week from today.
We did a trip to the Northern region
last March .  Now we're going to try out the South in between rainy seasons.  November is supposed to be nice down there.  And uncrowded.
The
forecast
doesn't look epic but Monday the 29th should be fun, 3.5 feet at 18 seconds.

Update on Four Loko: "That sh*t should be outlawed!"
UUO
recently performed the Four Loko experiment with the famous Colin Skipworth.  We acquired the beverage from the black market unaltered and including the original ingredients.  At the last minute, we were approached by an individual from the U.S. Department of Defense who had heard of our planned experimentation and wished to submit a fine, young military recruit to be tested under the effects Four Loko.
"Evaluate the affect of the concoction on the subject, we suspect that it could be utilized as a truth serum in the War on Terror."
We agreed to cooperate.
(Skipworth pictured alongside a
UUO
operative with the materials used in the experiment.  Skipworth's name has recently been mentioned in the same sentence as Timothy Leary's in parts of North Texas and Southern Oklahoma. Note that this picture was taken by the fine, young military recruit).
UUO
has never experimented with cocaine but we no longer need to.  Minutes after beginning the experiment the conversation morphed into rapid discourse between Skipworth, myself and the fine, young military recruit.  Steroid use in collegiate athletics was discussed as was cinematography in documentary films and martial law.  Then an argument ensued over defensive coverage schemes in American Football:
"There is no Cover 5!"
"Yes there is!"
"There's only Cover 0 through 4!  Cover 5 is Cover 0!  You're thinking of Cover 0, man!"
The next thing you know you're at the local high school football game screaming the f-word at the top of your lungs.  The caffeine surge ceases and you're dragged into a nasty state of extreme drunkenness and depression.  The fine, young military recruit became suicidal and threatened to do a swan dive from the 2nd level of the new Cowboys stadium.
Then you're on the outskirts of Dallas at a soup kitchen on a night when they're serving seafood gumbo.  You stuff yourself and begin debating with a homeless person, insisting that Oswald was the lone gunman.
It takes days to recover from a Four Loko binge.  The shakes, acid indigestion, etc.  Unfortunately, the fine, young military recruit has gone from being considered for officer candidacy to being classified as a Section 8 due to his reaction to the effects of Four Loko in the experiment.

UUO's Take on Internet Pornography
They say it's what happened to the Greeks and Romans.  The British Empire too.  Society got silly with sex and it was all over.
When Jenna Jameson went on Oprah,
UUO 's mother (an outsider when it comes to Internet pornography), was shocked by how attractive she is.  Our mother thought porn models looked like Beth, Dog's wife.
It is shocking.  There are
thousands
of hot girls who do Internet porn.  And we wonder where in the hell they come from.  Codename Pontifex Maximus lived in Los Angeles for five years and spent time near the San  Fernando Valley where almost all porn is filmed.  But there weren't hot girls walking around everywhere and never did he meet an attractive young woman who admitted to doing porn.  It's an anomaly.  Where do porn models come from and why don't we encounter girls as attractive as they are more often in our lives?
As a part of our research, we rented two documentaries:
Thinking XXX
and
The Secret Lives of Adult Stars .  Both sucked. But the most interesting comment made in one of them was that the worst thing that can happen to the porn industry is acceptance.  They theorized that if porn were to become accepted, more people would do it and less money would be made.
Each documentary was released in 2004 and six years later, we can say with confidence that porn is becoming accepted.  Porn is free.  Porn clips get millions of hits.  Sasha Grey is a genuine celebrity. And an argument can be made that the practice of masturbating to Internet porn has lost much of its stigma.
The people who made money in the porn industry in 2004 no longer have the market cornered.  They're having to innovate new ways to turn a profit. Newcomers to the industry have brought every sexual fantasy imaginable to the internet along with popular live chat sessions and adult dating sights.
What will become of this?  Will there be a moral movement in which people who are addicted to porn are diagnosed and offered treatment?  Or will sex become just a form of entertainment that while frowned upon by some, will be tolerated by most?
UUO
doesn't have the answers to these questions.
But like
Zorro
says, "When you fall in love with your hand, you're dead."

Warren Miller's Wintervention
UUO
attended the premier of Warren Miller's
Wintervention
last night in Denver.
Article here .  The  footage of skiers in locations such as Beaver Creek, Norway and Georgia is insane.  Skiers are transported by helicopter to the top of a mountainside with a downhill incline slightly greater than your bedroom wall.  It seems like they go 100 miles per hour and maneuver off of ledges two to three stories in height.  To do such a thing requires complete surrender, their is no stopping once you start and if you screw up, you're dead.
UUO
has come to regard this type of skiing as far more extreme and gutsy than big wave surfing.

Four Loko and the FDA
Have any of you ever heard of
Colin Skipworth ?  Also called by the aliases of "Skip", "Bubba", "Junior", "Sh*tworth" and "Skipworth You Idiot!", he gained celebrity status during the early 2000's as an intellectual, a dietitian, an accomplished nudist and an outspoken advocate for liberalized sexual relations in contemporary society.  Lately, he has worked to defend the drink Four Loko from governmental regulation.
An article in
The Wall Street Journal
explained that the FDA has decided to stop Phusion Products LLC from implementing caffeine into their product.  Four Loko has also been entirely banned from the states of Washington, Michigan and New York.  Oklahoma, Indiana, Pennsylvania and others will likely be added to that list soon.
In a
UUO
interview this afternoon, Skipworth commented, "It's like three cups of coffee and three beers in one drink.  Yikes."
Four Loko has been criticized for delaying the effects of alcohol and resulting in a higher level of drunkenness after the caffeine wears off.   UUO
will collaborate with Mr. Skipworth in order to obtain the beverage before it is forever changed.  We have to find out if it is as big of a deal as everyone is making it out to be.

UUO's Take on Guns
Due to the level of risk involved in our investigatory practices,
UUO
operatives are licensed to carry concealed handguns in the state of Texas until October 2013.
Obtaining your concealed handgun license isn't easy.  First, you can't have a criminal record.  Second, you have to sit in a room full of blood-thirsty psychopaths over the age of 60 for an entire day.  (Don't mess with old people, they're the ones packing).
The instructor was a retired cop, of course.  The protocol he taught us for firing our weapons at someone was as follows:
1. You find yourself in the default scenario - getting into your car in the parking lot at Wal-Mart.  All of the sudden, a methamphetamine-addict approaches you with a knife to slit your throat and steal your car.  Happens everyday.
2. You assess whether or not you can defuse the situation using words and reason (shooting someone
should be
a last resort).  This takes approximately two seconds.
3. You draw your weapon.
4. You make an attempt to elude your attacker.  This requires you to take one step back.  It's also time for you to issue your final warning, "Fella, I've got a gun, don't make me shoot you."
5. Fire.
Justifiable homicide should take a minimum of 5 to 7 seconds, depending on how quick you draw.  When asked exactly how to fire the weapon, the instructor clarified, "Instead of shooting from five yards away and risk missing and hitting some kid, walk right up to him, put the barrel to his chest and pull the trigger twice."

West Memphis Three
On November 4, 2010, the Arkansas Supreme Court ordered a lower court to consider whether newly-analyzed DNA evidence might exonerate Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley, Jr., who were convicted of the May 5, 1993, murder of three 8-year old Cub Scouts, Stevie Branch, Christopher Byers and Michael Moore.
AP Story here
The three men are known as the "West Memphis Three" and were originally accused as teenagers of a Satanic ritual rape and murder of the three boys in an area called Robin Hood Hills of West Memphis, Arkansas.  Two HBO documentaries including
Paradise Lost: The Childhood Murders at Robin Hood Hills
and
Paradise Lost 2: Revelations
made the case one of the most openly-discussed and notorious crimes in American history.
It looks like after over 17 years of incarceration, these guys are going to finally get off.  Overwhelming
evidence
supports their innocence.  While the case of the West Memphis Three represents an unacceptable miscarriage of justice, it also represents an infuriating failure on the part of the investigators who rushed to accuse three outcasts of an atrocious murder that is still unsolved.  It is possible that the true perpetrator is still alive and free in society.

Mexico: Where is this Going?
Follow up on
Reflections on Mexico and the Drug War
Headlines across the country read that at least 20 people were killed in drug-gang violence over the weekend.  Commerce is jammed: the cartels have all but declared war on Pemex, the state-owned oil and gas company that supplies 40% of the government's revenue;  they've driven workers from the countryside to secure and expand smuggling routes; they extort government employees and farmers - anyone receiving a paycheck from the government.
American businessmen and students are killed on a whim.
Doctors don't show up at health clinics, schools are closed early, general stores are barren.
The cartels will target anyone - man, woman or child.  And again I'll ask, what separates the kidnappings and be-headings and mass graves and political assassinations from the American Southwest?  El Paso and Juarez are separated by a river no wider than your living room.
For the U.S. government not to consider border security today's top priority is idiocy.  Or perhaps hopeless audacity.  And no matter what you think of the U.S. drug control policy, if you use cocaine, you should be ashamed of yourself.
I'd rather not deter readers from visiting this blog because of graphic images, so for those who've never looked,
here is the Google image result for "Mexican Drug War."

A Coaching Change
Norm Hitzges believes the person pictured in the previous post will be fired today.  (His name still shall not be written on this blog).
Let's put it this way: if you're infuriated by you 1-7 fantasy football team, just imagine if you were like Jerry Jones and had invested billions of dollars in a pro football team that was made to look like FOOLS on national television yesterday evening.
It's not too late for you to download your copy of
"The Coaching Change."   Critics widely agree that this piece strikes at the foundation of the fears and treacheries that have prompted every coaching change in the history of football.

Late Night Meditations on Competitive Sports and Blessed Assurances
NASCAR has a chance to save western civilization.  The race at the Texas Motor Speedway today was evidence enough of that.  BUT, the sport is not without flaw . . .
Before I can illustrate the above stance with examples, I must first set things in perspective for my readers.
This is the supposed figurehead of an organization in the National Football League.  His name is not worthy of being written at this point in time.  And I will spare the organization he is employed by from further embarrassment - I won't mention their name in this post either.  The organization, which traditionally has exemplified virtue in American sports, is now a shameful symbol of pathetic quitters.  Pro football has become a series of back-alley knife fights between dope fiends attempting to rob one another of their most recent score.  Teams are continually ambushing one another.  Vegas odds are useless.  And the organization to which I've made reference is the skinny white kid who ran away from the suburbs and shoots smack blindly into his arm without finding a good vein.  He stands no chance out there.  Never did.
All of this is headed toward a possible strike in 2011.  I plan to post on that issue separately but for now I'll say that if we lose Pro Football, or if Pro Football loses its integrity (which might already be happening), then we can expect a chain of future events that will culminate in the campaign and election of Joaquin Guzman for Governor of Texas.
But there's still NASCAR, thank goodness.  NASCAR is bad ass because NASCAR drivers want to
win .  All the time.  And this was proven today when Jeff Gordon ran down the track on foot to fight Jeff Burton after a  crash.
Check it out.   And what's even cooler is that as soon as Burton got his car in order, he was back on the track racing for his dignity.
There are certain back-channel conspiracies, however, which threaten NASCAR.
UUO's
sponsored car, the #18, was subject to some funny business that drove the driver to his edge.  After being nudged and spun off by Aric Almirola, Kyle Busch made every honest attempt to keep his car in the running.  But a NASCAR official sabotaged him with a questionable speeding penalty on pit row.  Busch's reaction to that led to further penalization including the rare unsportsmanlike penalty call.
See what you think.
But the competitive drive in NASCAR is still incomparable.  It's one thing we can pay to see without feeling cheated.  NASCAR drivers don't quit.  If they do they might end up in a car accident at 180 mph.
Nearly every driver embraces the risks of the sport and keeps on racing.  These days, NASCAR drivers are competitors worthy of our attention and pride.

The Chase Comes to Texas
Outright drunkenness, unapologetic ignorance and sickening depravity will take the Texas Motor Speedway this weekend.  And in the middle of all of that, barring a political riot, there will be a race: an ultimate test of motor ingenuity and the will of men.
Indeed,
UUO
experienced a similar spectacle at Talladega last weekend in person.  While Clint Bowyer (33) escaped with the win, the 2010 championship remains a three-way fight between current leader Jimmie Johnson (48), Denny Hamlin (11) and Kevin Harvick (29).
UUO , of course, supports and now sponsors the #18 car for the following reasons:
1. At his relatively young age, Kyle Busch fearlessly competes with the more experienced drivers.  He offers neither homage nor right-of-way to anyone on the track regardless of the circumstance.
And if you put him in a go-cart race,  he would try to win.  Such a competitive spirit is unmatched in the sports world and is a welcomed alternative to teams in the NFL such as the Dallas Cowboys who at 1-6, make you wonder if they even give a damn.
2. Kyle Busch acts like he's driving a car over 180 miles per hour.  If you listen in on his radio communication with his team, there is a constant sense of urgency, attention to detail and a generous dose of profanity.
3. Kyle Busch doesn't care.  He is hated by drivers and fans throughout NASCAR for his polarizing attitude.  He's cocky and a sore loser.  He doesn't stop to sign autographs for the kids.  He brushes off his supporters and urges them to cheer for another driver.  All signs indicate that if
UUO
were to meet Kyle Busch, we wouldn't like him.  But our admiration endures because Kyle Busch is in NASCAR to win races, not to make friends.
Last year, Kyle Busch nearly made history in Texas. After winning the truck race and the Nationwide race, he lost the Sprint Cup race to his brother Kurt only because he elected to charge forward rather than pit and ended up running out of gas.
The race schedule for this weekend will be as follows:
Truck Race, tonight at 5 p.m.
Nationwide Race, tomorrow at 11 a.m. (ESPN 2)
Sprint Cup Race, Sunday at 2 p.m. (ESPN)

To the Two Readers Who Are Left
There is no excuse for the fall-off in content for the month of October and for that, we apologize.
I was caught up in a frenzy of sports coverage where I did not have access to the world wide web: The World Series, Monday Night Football and Talladega.  All would have made interesting posts at the risk of making  UUO
a full-on sports blog.
Meanwhile, Codename Black Jack has been missing for about 2 weeks and Codename Captain Carpenter never even showed up in the first place.
But more importantly, the Creator has made attempts to withdraw from society for the express purpose of working on his
Magnum Opus .  It has been reported that his sanity is in decay and we are calling it a crisis of leadership.
Nonetheless, I will resuscitate this blog with a piece tomorrow on The Chase which comes to the Texas Motor Speedway this weekend.  As a matter of fact, in cooperation with Z-Line Designs and Joe Gibbs Racing,  UUO
is now a sponsor of the Nationwide Series #18 car.  Our letters ( UUO ) can be seen in red print on the left, rear quarter panel of Kyle Busch's Toyota at the O'Reilly Challenge on Saturday, November 6th.

Andy Irons 1978 - 2010
Andy Irons died of
Dengue Fever
yesterday at the Hyatt Hotel DFW Airport.  He leaves behind his wife Lyndie expecting their first child, his brother Bruce, his parents and countless friends and supporters.  He was 32 years old.
I met the 3 time world champion last May at the Houston Hobby Airport on my way back from a
trip to Costa Rica .  Just a handshake and a hello, I told him it was an honor to meet him.
