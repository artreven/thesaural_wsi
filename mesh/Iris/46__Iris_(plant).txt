Transplanting tree ferns
Topic: gardening
Link here
Today's the first day of spring, and the weather was relatively mild.
More weeding, and
also attended to the
Salvia
“Phyllis
fancy” that we bought at
Lambley Nursery
four months ago .
I had repotted it in a much
larger pot, but to my surprise it had already grown through the additional soil and formed a
big mat of roots on the outside of the pot.
Clearly high time for planting:
Also did a fair amount of weeding.
Things still don't look good, but I don't feel as
hopeless as I did last year.
And just as I was finishing,
Yvonne
decided it was time to transplant
the
Tree fern :
We bought the tree fern
almost exactly three
years ago , along with the
Gingko
biloba .
The latter has done well, but the planting conditions for the tree fern weren't
ideal.
First, it was in the
Cathedral ,
which no longer provides shade, and secondly the soil was very poor, mainly gravel, and in those days I
didn't pay much attention to that kind of problem.
So it's clear that we needed to do
something, but I was still pondering what.
It seems that our tree fern is almost certainly
a
Dicksonia antarctica
(interesting name).
Found a
Gardening
Austraya
article
on the subject, which in fact we saw on TV almost exactly a year ago.
The
most interesting thing about it was that they confirmed that now is the time to do it.
But
they wanted to saw through the trunk and replant just the trunk, 50 cm (not 45 cm!) into the
ground.
That would leave nothing of our tree above the ground.
So decided to dig up as
much of the roots as I could, which was quite an effort, and left the fronds on.
The
articles I read are not in agreement about whether they will die off or not, though with the
roots there's more hope that they will survive.
We'll see.
Certainly they look pretty
yellow now:

Doctor, yet again
Topic: general, gardening
Link here
Off to
Ballarat
yet again today, for
what proved to be just a blood pressure measurement that showed that the medication was
working and my blood pressure was normal.
It's certainly nice to have appointments, and I
was in and out of the clinic in 20 minutes.
But with the drive to Ballarat it's still a
fair chunk out of the morning, and stopped by at
Formosa Gardens
to see what caught my
eye.
They now have
Leucospermums
of
various kinds at prices I can afford, including a variety of
the
Leucospermum
conocarpodendron
“Mardi gras ribbons” that died last spring.
I wonder what the
connection with
Shrovetide
is:
Try as I might, I couldn't find a variety called
“ Ash Wednesday ”.
Removing the remainder of the Cathedral
Topic: gardening
Link here
We've been looking for people to remove trees for us all week.
We had called four of them,
of which only two called back and made appointments, and one of them, Graham was a no-show.
Today the other, Dan, came along and took a
look.
To my surprise, it would only cost $100 to remove the last remaining tree in the
Cathedral .
So we'll definitely go ahead
with that.
The cedars along the road are another matter.
The big one under which we park our cars
would cost $2,000 alone.
And there are several others, so we're probably looking at the
best part of $10,000.
That's way beyond our budget, so at least for the time being they'll
stay.

Windy weather
Topic: general, gardening
Link here
The
Bureau of Meteorology
predicted strong winds today, and for once they weren't wrong.
We recorded the
highest-ever wind gust, 42.5 km/h.
Looking at the values, it seems that all the strong
winds have occurred in the last 3 months:
mysql>
SELECT date, time, wind_speed, wind_gust
FROM observations
WHERE wind_gust > 30
AND date < "2011-6-1"
ORDER BY wind_gust DESC;
Empty set (0.89 sec)
It seems that the winds are getting stronger.
Or maybe it has something to do with the
location of the weather station.
I used to have it mounted like this:
The tower on the left is the temperature sensor, which I moved closer to the ground on
11 May 2011 .
The paddles behind are the wind speed sensor.
It's
not easy to see from this photo, but it was mounted well clear of the temperature sensor.
But possibly it interfered with the readings anyway.
As a result, didn't do much in the garden, just a bit of weeding.
Also planted some new
seeds:
Papaver nudicaule ,
Gaillardia pulchella
“Red
plume” and
Solenostemon
scutellarioides
(Coleus “rainbow mix”).
The Papaver (poppies) are supposed to be
planted in flowering position, because they don't like being transplanted.
In today's winds
that would be hopeless, and I'm hoping that the trick of planting in egg cartons will
nullify the transplant shock.
Certainly
the
Ipomoeas
are looking a lot happier
than any did that I planted directly into the bed.
I'm not sure whether the Papaver nudicaule have been described correctly.
According to
Wikipedia that's “Iceland Poppy”, and they don't come in red.
But the seed package contains
the supplementary information “Flanders red”, which suggests it should
be
Papaver rhoeas .
We'll see, if
any of the seeds bloom.
More modem flakiness
Topic: technology, photography
Link here
Because of the weather I took my weekend photos yesterday, and was able to get the
processing done by midday today.
And again they went up to the external site at a snail's
pace.
Once again the modem had fallen back
to
HSDPA
mode.
Again, looking at the network stats, it's easy to guess that it started earlier in the
morning (where the red peaks fall below the bar):

Overtaken by spring
Topic: gardening
Link here
It's
a year ago today
that I injured myself
taking my weekend photos, effectively putting myself out of much action for the entire
spring.
Today I'm in much better condition, but after the mild weather of the last few days
it's clear that spring is well on its way.
A couple of days ago
this
birch
had no leaves at all:
Decided that it was time to plant those seedlings that had germinated,
the
Petunias
and
Chrysanthemums
that I had
planted
in April
and the
black
Viola x wittrockniana
that I had
planted
a couple of months later :
I had transplanted them all into plastic pots, and the chrysanthemums in particular were
already quite large.
Getting the first one out of the pot was very difficult, and I ended
up leaving half the roots behind.
It seems that the roots had sunk into the plastic and
wouldn't let go:
Even after soaking in water and running a knife around the inside of the pot, things weren't
much better, though I did keep the root ball at the bottom:
So, clearly toilet rolls and egg cartons are the way to go.
I thought I had had four violas, but closer inspection showed that one of them was something
completely different.
Here the viola on the left:
What's the other?
It grew from seed, so maybe it's one of the others that didn't germinate,
either
Impatiens
or
Anchusa capensis .
From the Wikipedia
page it doesn't appear to be impatiens.
Is it anchusa?
The page doesn't help much.
I
suppose I'll have to wait for it to flower.
But that's only a small number of the seeds I have.
The poor yields don't help, but I have
many more seeds that hadn't even been planted yet.
Got another 6 egg cartons, and this time
wrote numbers on them: they get too soggy for a label to stick, and the writing has to be
large, so it's better to write large numbers on them.
Today planted:
Carton
Plant
1
Aquilegia
“McKanna giants”

Nemophila insignis
“Baby blue eyes”

Impatiens
“Safari”
4
Myosotis alpestris

Left:
Chile poblano
Right:

I'll leave them in the bathroom to germinate.
I suspect that the temperatures in the
greenhouse are too extreme, even when I have the heater on.

More garden work
Topic: gardening
Link here
Much of the garden work is pending the removal of the last tree in the
cathedral , but one item is a prerequisite: we need to
move at least one of the
Azaleas
planted
round the trunk.
Since it's now full sun, we ultimately need to remove all three of them,
which is a pity right now, since they're in bloom.
We've established a location to put
them, to the north-west of the house and in the shade of
the
cedars
that we're
planning to have removed.
Spent some time cleaning up the bed, which was completely
overgrown, and also did a bit of other weeding.

Seedlings and cutting down trees
Topic: gardening
Link here
Gradually spring is coming, and the climbing plants around the verandah are shooting.
Took
the opportunity to prune the Clematis “Perle d'azur” (or is that, as I've seen, “Pearl
d'azure”?).
In the process accidentally trimmed some new shoots, so cut them up and planted
them in toilet rolls.
The seed trays are still not looking very happy: of a total of 14 egg cartons, only three
are germinating.
It's relatively early, though—I planted 6 of them only
yesterday .
But the petunias in the hanging baskets have
greatly enjoyed the winter in the greenhouse, and they needed cutting back.
I've already
established that petunia cuttings strike relatively well, so trimmed some bright red ones
and made a total of 13 cuttings.
At least this way I know what colour I'm going to get, and
the trimmed flowers make a nice decoration:
Graham along today to look at removing
our
cedars , whatever they
might really be.
He's a lot cheaper than Dan, and could do the lot for $4,000.
Still a lot
of money, but his depiction of what happens to them in a bushfire is worth thinking about:
if they get lit, it's goodbye house.
Also a call from David, who works with Dan.
He'll be along here on Thursday to cut down the
last
Cathedral
tree.
Despite the weather,
finished preparing the bed for transplanting
the
Azaleas .
I'll do the transplantation
itself tomorrow after further research.

Mystery solved?
Topic: gardening
Link here
While in town, stopped at
Formosa
Gardens , bought some
gladioli ,
and walked around looking for inspiration.
Didn't find anything, but I did find this (the
best I could get this horrible
Nikon
“Coolpix” L1
autofocus to do):
According to the label, it's
a
Nepeta × faassenii
‘Dropmore'.
It looks pretty much like the mystery plant that we bought on
Australia Day :
Clearly it's not the same, but the leaves smell similar.
Investigating Nepeta more
carefully, it seems that this is also “catmint”, a plant that we already have and which
looks quite different, and that I've already seen plants like this.
But there's more and
more reason to think that it might be
a different species of Nepeta.
Australian spelling: becoming American
Topic: general, opinion, gardening
Link here
One of the things that grates every time I read
Gardening Australia 	magazine is that they write “sulfur” instead of “sulphur”, and “sulfate” instead of
“sulphate”.
That's so American!
I've been meaning to vent my irritation for some time, but
of course the only authoritative dictionary I have is
the
Oxford English Dictionary , which is really authoritative for
the UK, not Australia.
Australia, a country of a little over 20 million people, has its own
dictionary: the
Macquarie
dictionary .
The big one is about 5% of the size of the OED, but still costs more than
I'm prepared to spend, and neither of the local libraries has it online.
So today I dropped
into the Ballarat library to take
a look.
The volume they have is only 2 years old, and apart from a fold in the title page, looks as
if nobody has ever used it—quite in contrast to their Oxford English Dictionary, which
predates the building: it's the first edition, 1933.
Surely they could buy something more
up-to-date.
But looking in the dictionary, I found both spellings: “sulphur” is a kind of butterfly, but
“sulfur” is the preferred spelling for the element, because—they say—that's the universal
spelling.
Ugh.
For me it's still “sulphur”, but I suppose I can forget my rant to
Gardening Australia.
The claim in the dictionary is still wrong.
Just about everywhere in
Australian usage, it's “sulphur”.
I wonder if they have the
obfuscatory terms for vegetables
in there as
well.
Seed quality
Topic: gardening
Link here
Most of my seedlings are coming up very slowly, but some are doing very well.
These are
the
Ipomoea
and
Lathyrus odoratus
(sweet
peas) that I planted
a little over two weeks ago .
Well,
some are:
The four plants on the left are the ipomoeas, and the others are sweet peas.
The middle 4
are from commercial packaging, the 4 on the right from an
eBay
purchase.
The difference in vigour is clear.
That's not a condemnation of eBay; the ipomoeas also came from eBay.
Transplanting the Azaleas
Topic: gardening
Link here
David is coming by tomorrow to cut down the last
Cathedral
tree, so spent a considerable amount of time transplanting
the
azelea s, in the process also planting
some of the sweet peas and ipomoeas to climb up the back:
That accounts for two of the three azeleas.
I was going to plant the remaining one in front
of
Yvonne 's office window, but I discovered yet more gravel
only a few centimetres under the surface.
How many of the garden beds are like that!
Mañana.

No tree felling
Topic: gardening
Link here
David along this morning to cut down the last
Cathedral
tree.
During the discussion of how to do it, a misunderstanding became
clear.
Dan, the boss, is a climber: he climbs the trees and cuts down convenient sized
bits.
David doesn't climb: he fells the tree in one, and that would have severely damaged
the
Schinus molle
(pepper tree) to
the south.
So we postponed; presumably it will be Dan in the end.
Interestingly, David claimed that the pepper tree was an Australian native, coming from arid
regions.
I had always thought that it came from America, and the species I link to does,
indeed, come from there.
Is there another similar tree native to Australia?
There
are
Tasmannias
(note the double n), but
they don't seem related to this tree.
South bed and Völkerfrieden
Topic: gardening
Link here
Got around to digging the gravel out of the south bed, the part in front of
Yvonne 's office.
In general, I assume that making a relatively large
hole through to the soil is enough.
But
azeleas
have very shallow root
systems, something that became evident when I removed them from the
Cathedral .
So this isn't the ideal place for them.
After some discussion, planted a
Canna
there instead, along with
a
pelargonium
that we had planned for
the location (in fact, replacing a very similar pelargonium that Yvonne had removed some
time ago), and put the azelea on the east side of the house, where we had planted
a
Delphinium
“Völkerfrieden” last
year, which had completely disappeared.
It wasn't until I removed it that I discovered
something like roots and a subterranean part, possibly rhizome-like.
Was it trying to come
back?
In any case, replanted it a little way away.
We'll see how the following areas
develop:

Too warm in the greenhouse?
Topic: gardening, opinion
Link here
Since finishing the
greenhouse
in
April , I've come to use it more and more.
But that's like
the man with a hammer, for whom every problem seems to be a nail.
I've been doing my
propagation there too.
But things don't always work out.
I've had a number
of
salvias
strike, grow a little bit, and
then die.
Now it's happening with some rose cuttings:
I've been wondering for some time what's wrong.
There's enough moisture, but it gets cold
at night and quite hot in the daytime.
I'm gradually coming to the conclusion that the
problem is the heat (or sunlight) and not the cold: greenhouses aren't really intended for
propagation.
So it looks like I need a shade house.
Another plant that points in this direction is a plant which I know as “Easter cactus”, but
which looks very similar to the current image on the
Wikipedia
Holiday Cactus
page,
which describes it as “Thanksgiving Cactus”, though the image title is “Christmas Cactus”:
According to that page, it may be a
Hatiora
or
a
Schlumbergera , though the images
don't match.
Anyway, it's not looking happy.
The leaves are yellowish instead of dark
green:
Since it's an indoor plant, it's reasonable to assume that it's getting too much light.
Put
it in the shade area to the north of the verandah, in the process discovering that it's in
bloom—on the shade side:

Cutting down the cedars?
Topic: gardening, opinion, photography
Link here
I still don't know the biological name for the conifers growing to the west of the house, up
against the road.
People call them cedars, but there
are
hundreds of varieties ,
and they're clearly not the
Toona
ciliata
that is also known as “Australian Red Cedar”: that's deciduous.
Whatever they are, they're big and flammable.
We're seriously concerned that, if we have a
bushfire, they could make a difference between survival and loss of our house.
It'll be
difficult to bring up the $4,000 that Graham wants to cut them down, but I think we're going
to have to do it.
Spent some time looking at the area and deciding what to do, including
adding a couple of new photos to my weekly
exterior
photos .
The first is of the driveway under the cedars, and the second shows them
taken from the other side of the road:
It's difficult to imagine what things will look like when they're gone.
Things won't be
completely open: there are
other
melaleucas
and
acacias
planted underneath them.
They're struggling, but a bit of light and soil moisture might make all the difference.
But
we should look to replacing the trees with others, smaller and less flammable.

Spring, slowly
Topic: gardening

The flowers in the greenhouse are telling me that it's spring.
Last
year's
petunias
are blooming well, as are
the ones I grew from seed in April.
Time to them out to the verandah again.
Only moved
some of them: it's not clear when the correct time is.
For example,
the
salvia
“Phyllis fancy” that I planted
at the beginning of the month
is not looking
as happy as I expected:
Some of the tips of the leaves are shrivelling and browning.
I have no concern about it
surviving, but clearly the weather wasn't greatly to its liking.
It looks like we're in for
warmer weather in the next few days, so I'll probably slowly move things out of the
greenhouse.

Creating the shade area
Topic: gardening
Link here
Years ago I had a propagation area to the north-east of the house, between two sheds, once
the toy
ALDI
greenhouse self-destructed,
almost exactly
three years ago :
After I got the (real)
greenhouse
a year later , I pretty much abandoned it: it's certainly
not warm, and by now it was overgrown with knee-high grass.
But it could easily be
converted to a shade house: all I needed to do was to dig out the remaining flower pots from
the undergrowth, mow the lawn, and then put some shade cloth over the top.
The shade cloth
will have to wait, but at least it looks tidy now:

More garden work
Topic: gardening
Link here
The weather was relatively warm and windless today, so did some weed spraying—and
immediately it started to rain.
Not much, but possibly enough to nullify the effect.
That's frustrating: probably it didn't make any difference, but I can't find out whether it
made any difference for at least a week, so probably I'm going to have to repeat everything.
Also planted the
Ipomoeas
and
Lathyrus odoratus
from the
egg cartons into the bed in front of the fence in front of the garage.
Egg cartons look too
flimsy for seedlings that resent transplanting: they fall apart.
I think I'll use toilet
rolls if I can identify any further area which needs them.
More mystery plants
Topic: gardening
Link here
In the shade of the northern birch in the middle of the eastern garden, I've become aware of
this plant:
I don't know what it is, but the large buds suggest that it's not a weed.
I can't find any
indication of planting something there.
Maybe the flower will help identify it.
Also found
what I had thought were multiple
“Cathedral”
trees, but which prove to be only two:
One had sprung up in very little soil in
the
“bunker”
to the north-east of the
house, and I found the other one when tidying up the shade area.
I still don't know what
they are either, but I suppose we should plant them somewhere.

Gardening documentation
Topic: technology, gardening, opinion
Link here
Over the last few weeks I have bought a number of plants and also planted seeds and
propagated other plants.
With spring coming, it's time to decide where to plant them.
In the past this has meant going into the greenhouse, looking at what's there and deciding
where it might go.
The problem with this approach is that I don't have an overview: not all
plants are in the greenhouse, and I don't have information about the conditions they want or
how big they will get.
I have all this information in my diary, for example for the plants
we bought at the market at the
end of last month .
So I
could just print out the page, right?
Well, there's a problem there of my own making.
That's part of the month's diary, and
it's
long .
How long?
That depends, but at least 30 pages.
Clearly a candidate for
selective printing, something I should think about.
In the meantime, though, all web
browsers offer an option to print only specific pages of a document.
That's straightforward
enough for a PDF document, but what do you do if it's a web page?
What's the starting page
number of that entry?
Decided that it would probably be easier just to print the document to PDF and then print
from
xpdf .
Did that and came up
with the most
horrible
PDF I have ever seen:
How did
firefox
manage such a
mess?
It's clearly deliberate, because the marginal markings are OK.
I've seen this before
when printing things out, and blamed it on the printer drivers on
boskoop , my aging
Apple, to which the printer is connected.
Clearly that's not the problem.
And clearly the
output quality is unacceptable.
I should look at the causes, but on this occasion I just
wanted to print out the pages.
So: tried it on the Apple, with “Safari”.
If there's a way to print to a file there, I'm
clearly too stupid to see it.
But there's a “print preview”, so tried that.
And the text
seemed tiny, at least because Apple likes to present windows smaller than they are.
In this
case, though, the text was less than half the page width.
Increased the text size until it
looked like this:
That's clearly too large.
But the resultant printout was tiny!
It used fractionally over
half the width of the paper, though the text is slightly wider in proportion.
The text
itself was in about 7 pt.
OK, this is an old version of “Safari”, but not that old, and I wouldn't want to bet that
the latest version does it better.
Why should the text width on the screen have any effect
on the dimensions of a printout on paper?
And why do none of the browsers have typical
metrics like (real) font size?
The “page setup” just gives me the options of “Settings”
(not really an option, just “Page attributes”) and a scale factor, which in my case is
100%.
But what does that mean?
As usual, the “Help” is no help:
Type the percentage you want to reduce or enlarge the printout in the Scale text box.
Percentages are relationships.
What does this percentage relate to?
This has been an
ongoing problem for as long as I have used scalable printers on computers, about 25 years.
Is it really that difficult?

More Leucandenrons

Looked in at

more

“Cordifolium” :
This one shows the buds on a single plant in a big pot; I think the label at bottom left is
an image of what it should look like when it's in flower, but of course I messed up the
composition on this horrible toy camera.
The original shows bright red inflorescences.
I
prefer the appearance to that of the other Leucospermums I saw
two weeks ago :
The problem is the size: clearly this is a well-grown plant in a big pot, and they want $60
for it.
The smaller ones only cost $18.
And then I found a Leucospermum Cordifolium in the
same size small pot for only $13.
Why the difference in the latter two prices?
Except for the flower colour, they're pretty
much the same, and judging by the labels they appear to come from the same grower.
I can
think of two possibilities: either they just don't have enough of the strange coloured ones,
or they're more difficult to raise.
Either speaks in favour of the Cordifolium.
But
unfortunately the small ones are all yellow, and I want a red one.
Off to
Dahlsens , a place I normally don't visit, to see if
they had any.
Their plant department has gone very much downhill since I was last there,
and the only Leucospermum they had was the same as at Formosa, but looked stressed and cost
$2 more.
It'll be a while before I go there again.

Smart phones: just what I need
Topic: technology, opinion, gardening
Link here
Mail from Tom Maynard today, suggesting a solution to my
problems identifying plants in the greenhouse : use a smart phone
and a web browser to display my diary in the greenhouse.
At least it would get around the
breakage with web browser print output.
But why a smart phone?
Because I will have some mobile coverage in the greenhouse.
Theoretically I could use a laptop, but then I wouldn't be able to make phone calls with it.
In fact, I don't have mobile coverage in the greenhouse, thanks to cranks like the
“Dereel Anti-Tower Alliance” .
I do
have
802.11
coverage, and I did consider
using a laptop.
I didn't, mainly because of the light: it's difficult to recognize anything
on modern displays in bright sunshine.
But it would have been a solution.
The high-end
devices have a maximum display size of 640×900, compared to a display size of 1024×768 or
higher with a laptop.
And I've found that even a single 1920×1200 display is cramped.
So
it's not for me.
And assuming I did have mobile coverage?
We can still hope.
But it's more expensive, and a
smart phone with such “high” resolution will cost me about $800.
For that I can buy a
laptop and a phone and have money over for a night on the town.
The real advantage of the
smart phone is the size and the fact that it has multiple functionality.
So why did Tom suggest a smart phone?
It clearly fits his lifestyle.
It doesn't fit mine,
but I'm apparently in the vast minority.
What's the attraction?
My best bet is that people
can use them when commuting, at least in countries like Australia where there's reasonable
public transport.
In other cases, people seem to frequently be under way and need net
access.
For them, smart phones are almost certainly a good idea.
But looking at the sales figures, they're the biggest thing since sliced bread.
Why do they
sell so many?
Clearly lots of people are on the move, and this caters to it.
But that
begs the question: why are they on the move?
One of the advantages of the Internet era
should be that people don't need to go anywhere to meet up with other people, or to do their
job.
I personally stopped commuting over 20 years ago.
Somehow smart phones seem to be a
symptom of the failure to adapt to the Internet age.
Planting and irrigating
Topic: gardening
Link here
Finally got around to planting some of the plants we bought
last month :
They're barely recognizable at the moment, of course, but it's good to keep record of where
they went.
They're marked by bamboo poles, only visible in the enlargement.
From left to
right they're
Felicia
angustifolia, the
painfully syntactically incorrect
Coleonema
pulchrum
aureum , which I think I'm going to have to call Coleonema pulchra, and
the
Convolvulus sabatius :
Also attended to the drippers in that area; over 50% of them were clogged up.
No wonder
some of the seedlings were looking less than happy.
Put more hanging baskets on the verandah, and did some trimming.
Petunias seem to propagate
relatively well from cuttings, and since there are continual cuttings, it looks as if I will
have quite a few in the course of time.
Also tried propagating
a
Alyogyne huegelii
branch
which had been broken off in the wind.

Garden photos in variable weather
Topic: photography, opinion
Link here
Yesterday was very windy, so I postponed my
weekly
garden photos
(which, for no good reason, I've called “house photos” in the past)
until today.
Today was less windy, but to make up for that, the light kept changing from
overcast to full sun.
One such transition hit me while taking the critical verandah photos:
first, there are 72 individual images, and 24 of them are with full power flash.
Even with
fully charged batteries, the flash recycle time goes from 5 seconds to about 12 seconds by
the end of the session, or about 4½ minutes.
And by then the time I got round to the end,
the first image had changed:
How do you handle that?
The image is composed of two rows of 12 merged images, bottom row
first, so I repeated the bottom row (the second image above is the first of those images).
Then I made two different panoramas, first with the first 12 images, then with the last 12
images, in each case with the same top row (middle 12 images).
I was fully expecting the
first to be badly exposed, but in fact it didn't work out so badly:
More irrigation work
Topic: gardening

Finally got round to sorting out the irrigation in the ex- Cathedral .
Not that much work, but for some reason
surprisingly tiring.
At least now everything has a dripper, and I don't seem to have any
leaks any more.
Next step is to cover the bases of the trees with weed mat.

Ballarat Gardens in Spring
Topic: gardening, technology
Link here
So finally the ( PDF )
brochure
for
Ballarat Gardens in Spring
is complete, and it's
up on the web site.
And, apart from a brief mention on the
home page , that was all.
There's a general
feeling amongst friends the that PDF documents are enough, but it's clear to me that the web
is for web content, so set to writing a couple of pages.
That's not as simple as it sounds.
The current home page for the friends has a number of
validation errors, and as an HTML file it needs to contain all its invariant markup as well.
I started some time ago to convert the stuff to
PHP , but was by no means finished.
On the other hand, I didn't want to publish anything that
didn't validate, so spent a lot of time first completing the work I had done.
In the end,
it took a large part of the day to get the two pages up and iron out some of the
strangenesses in the
Google Map .
But hopefully
I now have a framework that will work for other pages too.
And for that I'll be going to
town tomorrow to show it to people.
Unusually warm weather

Spring seems to be coming earlier than usual this year.
The birch trees in the eastern
garden have as many leaves as they did at the beginning of October last year, and today the
temperature hit 28.1°, much higher than we had in all of September last year:

To the Friends again, with surprises
Topic: technology, gardening, animals
Link here
In preparation for going to the
Friends of the
Ballarat Botanical Gardens
this afternoon, spent the morning removing birch seedlings
( Betula pendulis ) from the
garden, in total about 30 of them.
Also took a seedling of the
Cathedral
tree and both a seedling and a branch of
another mystery plant:
On the way into town, nearly drove into the back of the car in front of me when he suddenly
stopped while leaving the
roundabout
in the
middle of
Sebastopol .
That
proved to be because three tiny dogs were running around on the street.
Got out and tried
to help others catch them.
Finally caught all three: two which might have been long-haired
Chihuahuas
and
another black-and-white one which looked something like a
tiny
Jack Russell Terrier .
The Chihuahuas had collars with identification on them, so one of the few people remaining
called the number on them, and they were able to give us the name of the dog, but neither
the name nor the address of the owner.
Finally they told us we could drop them at any vet,
so off to the
Ballarat Veterinary Practice ,
nominally in
Sturt St , and on my way to the
Botanical Gardens.
They're not really on Sturt St at all; they're in a side street, and in the past I've had
difficulty finding it.
But what's a GPS navigator for?
Yes, it had the information, and
took me straight to Alfred St. North,
5 streets and
650 metres away .
View
in a larger map
It took me more than 5 minutes to find the correct place, where they happily took the dogs.
It wasn't until we were done that I realised I had forgotten to take any photos.
At the friends, gave the birches to Yvonne, who identified the mystery flowers as “Locust”,
and effectively a weed.
It looks as if it could
be
Robinia pseudoacacia , but
the leaves are wrong.
She wasn't sure about the “Cathedral” tree.
The two people I really wanted at the meeting were Julie Bradbury and Jenny Burrell, but
they both weren't there.
Instead spoke to Liz Gilfillan, Helen Vincent, Mike Sorrell and
Raoul Dixon.
People are concerned about what we would call version control, and so they
wanted separation of responsibilities.
The result: I get the responsibility, and we'll ask
Jenny to do the layout things, at which she's better than I am.
On the other hand, Mike wanted to write web content (a term I had to explain) too, and I
wanted to show him.
We went to the computer (directly connected to the ADSL modem), and I
put in a switch that I had brought with me.
No connection to the modem.
Much further
investigation showed that the modem was not talking to the network.
It had LEDs
marked
Ethernet
and
USB , and both were on, even when nothing was plugged in.
Microsoft's confusingly spelt
ipconfig
told me simply “ Media State . . . Media
Disconnected” .
Called up
TransACT
support and got
connected pretty quickly to Mavrick.
Told him that we had no Ethernet connection and he
said “No worries, we'll sort that out.
Open a browser and go to
192.168.1.1 ”.
I
told him a couple of time that I had no carrier, but he insisted that I try it.
Surprise!
It didn't work.
Finally I told him about the LEDs, and he said “OK, the modem is fried.
You'll need to get a replacement”.
That proved to be simpler than I thought.
He told me I should get a free replacement, and
TransACT has a (relatively large) office in
Mitchell
Park , Ballarat.
Off there, one of the few times I have been to the place of business
of an ISP, where they told me—not surprisingly—that I would have to pay for the modem or
commit to another year's line rental, neither of which I wanted to do.
Told her that
Mavrick had told me I could get one for free, so she called him up
(in
Canberra ), and he confirmed he had
said it.
So I got the free modem after all.
Back to the Friends and installed the modem.
Total time since identifying the problem: 40
minutes.
But of course I needed to configure the modem, something I had been told I
wouldn't need to do, so called up the support line again.
After 1 minute I got the
information “your call will be answered by the next available consultant”.
And then, a few
minutes later, the first of many “Due to an unprecedented influx of calls we cannot answer
in a timely manner.
Press 1 to leave a message”.
That wasn't what I wanted to do, but
after a total of 20 minutes (on mobile), I finally tried it, only to get a further message
“You cannot leave a message now, mailbox full”.
A couple of bad points to TransACT.
I'll
have to try it some other time.
It's also interesting to note that I did not need to
provide any authentication at any time.
The only information they needed was the name of
the subscriber and the account number.
So: an unusual and not very satisfying day.
We'll have to configure the modem next week.
People are, perhaps correctly, confident that nobody will notice.

Again I didn't get much done today.
We still have lots of plants to plant, but apart from
some random weeding, I only planted

Back to school
Topic: technology, general, gardening
Link here
To the
University
today to attend my first
lecture in decades, and possibly the first ever about Computer Science.
Sasha Ivkovic is
doing a class on “ Open Source ”, and
Chris Yeardley suggested I came to listen.
First, though, to
Gays
to
buy some timber and shade cloth for the planned shade area in the garden.
Paid a total of
$75, which seems more than reasonable.
Getting from there to the University
proved
much slower than I had expected.
It's less than half an hour
from Dereel , and I was expecting about 5 to 10 minutes,
but in fact it took 25, and I was late (something I
hate ).
Doubtless Chris
will give me hell on Saturday.
I had intended to just lurk, but Sasha saw me and asked me a
number of questions on the topic.
He wants me to come back and do a presentation of the
matter from my point of view, which I might do if anybody is interested enough.
The students also have a practical to
do:
CVS .
I suppose
for people using Microsoft, it must be something completely different.
New Leucospermum
Topic: gardening
Link here
I've been looking for a small
red
Leucospermum
cordifolium
for some time now.
I had found them in big at
Formosa Gardens , and they also had small
yellow ones.
I later asked if they could get me a small red one, and yes, maybe they could.
But on the way into town I stopped by another nursery on Main Road.
I've
been there before , but for some reason they don't show up
in any lists, neither online nor in the phone book.
In this case,
Google Maps Street View
comes to the rescue:
So they're Pearson's Nursery, and the address appears to be
730 Geelong Road .
With that information, I was finally
able to find it on
Truelocal : the
address is
728 Main Road , though both Google
Maps and my GPS navigator want to call it Geelong Road.
In any case, they did have a red
Leucospermum cordifolium, and despite their sign saying “lowest prices in town” (partially
out of focus on the Google street view), they wanted $3 more for it than Formosa did.
Still, there's the “bird in the hand” consideration, and the example I found looked very
nice and will hopefully flower in the next month or so, so I took it.
Installing the Friends' ADSL modem
Topic: technology, gardening
Link here
Next off to the Botanical Gardens to set up the ADSL modem that I had picked up on
Tuesday .
There was really not much to set
up: this appears to be a really bare-bones modem.
Enter user name and (new) password as
given to me on the phone, press “Connect”.
Got a message saying “Connecting in 30 seconds”,
counting down until 0, then the message “You are ready to connect.
Press
Connect
to
connect”.
Same again.
And again.
Looking at the modem display, the
PPP
LED was out.
Was this the modem's way of
saying “PPP authentication failed”?
What a pain!
I didn't have a phone with me, and we
know how difficult it is to contact
TransACT
support.
I considered going to the Robert Clark Centre and calling from there, but first
I considered an alternative: it seems that the user name was also the mail user name.
What
if they hadn't changed the password after all?
Tried the old password (which, fortunately,
I had checked yesterday), and it worked!
What
a pain TransACT is!
And they didn't tell me that resetting that password would
also affect access to the email system, so in fact it's just as well they didn't.
So far
I've been saying about the ADSL connection “If it ain't broke, don't fix it”.
Gradually I'm
coming to the conclusion that it's broke.
Irrigation for the shade area
Topic: gardening
Link here
On the way home, stopped in at
Midland
Irrigation
and picked up some tap fittings for the shade area.
Just a couple of
connectors and the tap itself.
Total cost: $68, almost as much as the timber and shade
cloth.
Somehow that seems wrong.

New shade area
Topic: gardening
Link here
Started working on the new shade area today.
There are two things to do: supply water and
put up the shade cloth.
The water proved to be more of a problem than I thought, since the
pipe needs to go along a stable wall, and there's a water tank up against it.
The water
tank needs to go, but currently it has 1000 l of water in it, so I need to use up the water
before moving it.
Instead put the tap near the pump at the end of a short piece of pipe.
I'll move it later when the tank is empty.
Putting up the joists was even more frustrating.
Some of the timber to which I need to
attach the joist holders is so hard that I couldn't hammer in the nails.
Tried screws, with
similar problems.
Tried pre-drilling the screw holes, and the drill bit got stuck in the
wood, and I had to remove it with a mole wrench.
That was enough frustration for one day, and I gave up and planted
the
Leucospermum
cordifolium
in the far east garden:
That required much weeding; this is one of the most overgrown parts of the garden.
It was
relatively easy, though, easier than when I tried two years ago (last year I was
incapacitated by my
accident at the dam ): the
thick grass had taken over and made it impossible for anything else to grow.
So: why am I
removing it?
I've seen similar things where I did some weeding to the north of the main
garden area
a couple of months ago .
The area
that I easily weeded then is now completely overgrown again with many smaller weeds.
I
think I'll just pull it out and leave it there as a loose mulch to stop anything else coming
through.
Canon camera quality

Yvonne 's
new camera 	has given up the ghost, after only four months.
“Lens error”, apparently meaning a
mechanical problem with the lens extension.
It jammed with the lens extended, and nothing
can get it to come back in again.
Called up Canon technical support, once I fought my way
through their obstructive web site—the “support” page had no support, just a link to
“support”, which pointed back at itself—and was told to bring the thing to Canon service.
That's a particular problem because we bought it in Hong Kong, and we will have to send it
back.
Tried to contact the seller via
eBay ,
but their horrible web software didn't want to know about it: after all, it was four months
ago.
Sent off a “general query”, but by evening didn't get a reply.
Why do Yvonne's
cameras always have problems?
The last one was also only a year old when it died with
similar symptoms.

I need better rechargeable batteries
Topic: photography, opinion
Link here
Today was day for taking photos of the
exterior of
the house .
It's gradually becoming a routine, but that gives smaller things the
opportunity to irritate me.
Today it was the flash unit.
Apart from the fact that it takes
so long to recycle, a set of (NiMH) batteries barely survives the 24 shots I need for the
verandah
panorama .
Last week I recharged the batteries after the shots, but although I didn't
use them after charging, today the unit claimed “low battery” after only a couple of shots.
I've found that things are better if I charge the batteries the night before, and
potentially it's an indication of the quality of
ALDI 's “according to our stringent quality specifications” rechargeable batteries.
They work well enough in less demanding situations, so maybe they're not designed to deliver
the current that the flash unit wants.
I should probably buy some elsewhere.
But where?
How do I find good batteries?
What about Lithium?
As usual, went to
eBay
and looked there.
Yes, there are rechargeable
Lithium AA batteries on the market, with a nominal voltage of 3.7 V.
That's hardly likely
to be compatible with devices expecting 1.5 V AA.
If they were at least 3.0 V there would
be a possibility of replacing two normal batteries with one Lithium battery, but that
doesn't seem to be the way they do things.
But then I found something I've never heard
of:
Nickel-zinc batteries .
They seem to have an internal resistance of 5 mΩ, compared to 50 mΩ for NiMH batteries, and
they have a nominal voltage of 1.65 V.
Is that acceptable?
I've already established that
brand new non-rechargeable alkaline batteries have a voltage of 1.6 V or so, so probably the
1.65 V wouldn't be a problem.
But freshly charged the NiZn batteries have a voltage of 1.8
V, which is possibly a little high.
Everything I read says that they're suitable for the purpose, and I suppose that the exact
voltage is not as critical for battery-driven devices as it is for main-driven devices, but
it would be nice to have some confirmation before I destroy my flash unit.
In this
particular case, the option of trying them in a cheaper unit doesn't help: working in one
device is no guarantee that it would work in another.
Returning the defective Canon
Topic: photography, opinion
Link here
Got a reply from the seller of the
IXY 200F , regretting the problem and enclosing a form to fill out—in Microsoft
“Word”
format.
Under the circumstances, decided not
to complain about that, and moved it to
boskoop , my Apple, to process.
That their
application “TextEdit” can handle it, up to a point.
I found it extremely difficult to
avoid overwriting invisible markup.
I wonder if that's the case for the real Microsoft
“Word”.
In the end, attached it to the reply, but also put up a
web page
as well.
Hopefully they'll be able to
read my reply.

Garden flowers at end of September
Topic: gardening
Link here
Today's the last Sunday in September, time for a stock-taking of
flowers in the garden .
This year we have a whole lot of
new flowers that weren't there before, along with some plants that have bloomed for the
first time.
In particular, the
Echium
(first two photos), which we bought
last
October , is only just coming into bloom, but it's already very pretty.
Other plants
are more recent.
Here
the
Felicia
angustifolia, which
we bought
last month :
Another plant we bought at the same time is
the
Coleonema pulchra .
And
the
Polemonium
we bought in March is
now flowering happily:
In addition, the Japanese
Iris ,
which we've had for over 2 years, is finally flowering profusely, and
the
Corydalis
has weathered the winter
nicely.
It has been blooming almost since we got it, and it has also self-sown a number of
seedlings.
The
Azaleas
that we transplanted planted
only a couple of weeks ago
are also looking
much happier than I expected:
We planted them years ago, when the
Cathedral
was still looking healthy, but they never quite won the battle with the weeds.
This is
the best they have ever bloomed.
A number of
Grevilleas
are in bloom,
including one that we brought with us from
Wantadilla ,
which has been hanging around doing nothing for the last 4 years, and which has now been
overtaken by an
Acacia .
Then there's this
Grevillea longistyla 	× johnsonii “Elegance” thing which we bought in Bendigo
2½ years
ago , and some of the plants we planted in the south bed
a
year ago :
The
tulips
are also in full bloom.
I can't
recall seeing his many of them last year, though that may be because they're earlier this
year:
Then there's the question of annuals or perennials.
According to many sources, such as the
ProFlowers
Flower Guide , they're different kinds of plants.
But we have a number of annuals
which are several years old.
The
Alyssum
has straggled through the winter and is now coming back:
We also have a surprising number
of
Petunias , some of them in their third
spring:
The
Sparaxis
(or are
they
Freesias ?) are also still blooming
freely, and finally the mystery seedling is flowering:

Shade area, continued
Topic: gardening

More work on the shade area today.
Somehow everything is ten times as complicated as it
should be.
Still, now I have the brackets in place, and I need
Yvonne
to help me measure the joists.
Instead addressed another area where I wanted shade cloth, this time really as a wind break:
to the left of the north verandah of the house, next to the car parking area.
That showed
that these fancy plates I have for attaching cloth are not ideal, and I'm going to have to
get some other way to hold it in place.
It's holding, but it looks ugly:
Metz: We don't need customers
Topic: photography, opinion
Link here
I have two, maybe three
Mecablitz
electronic flash units, made by
Metz , one of the
oldest names in electronic flash.
My oldest one was a two-piece system with a charger hung
over the shoulder, made some time in the 1950s.
They've been around for ever, and their
name is almost synonymous with electronic flash.
Currently I want to know whether my latest one
supports
Nickel-zinc
batteries .
It's a Mecablitz 58 AF-1 O digital, already 2 years old, so obviously the
product description
has been removed.
I have a choice of the description of the
barely different
replacement
or a
download page
for new firmware.
Clearly I can't find any information about which
batteries it supports.
But I probably couldn't anyway: the description of the replacement
model doesn't say anything either.
Maybe Metz hasn't heard of NiZn batteries yet.
OK, that's what support lines are for, right?
Fought my way through their web site looking
for support.
Somehow German web sites seem to be particularly clever in the way they make
you click all over the place to find what should be obvious.
It's so difficult that I had
to start all over again looking for it to write this article, and it took me 5 minutes to
realise that I had to select “Kontakt” at the very bottom left, and none of the menus at the
top.
Then I

The phone number is accessible only from inside Germany (even excluding neighbouring

Further searching showed that they had a

This is all in German, of course, because they don't offer

Germany was once the world's leading producer of photographic equipment.
Where are they

I've had this kind of

How long does Metz have to go?

More USB disk problems
Topic: technology, photography
Link here
Yvonne
into my office this afternoon to say that the cursor
on her display wasn't moving.
After confirming that she had tried a bigger hammer, checked
and found that the system had frozen.
After reboot,
/var/log/messages
showed lots
of:
Sep 27 13:47:11 lagoon kernel: (da0:umass-sim0:0:0:0): AutoSense failed
Sep 27 13:47:11 lagoon kernel: g_vfs_done():da0p1[WRITE(offset=1318222561280, length=131072)]error = 5
Sep 27 13:47:11 lagoon kernel: g_vfs_done():da0p1[WRITE(offset=1318222692352, length=114688)]error = 5
That's from my USB-connected photo backup disk.
I thought the USB problems were over and
done.
High time to debug the hot plug issues with
the
eSATA
adapter that I bought
months ago, but in the meantime needed to do a backup.
So ran
fsck
and discovered
that I had a big
lost+found
directory.
Since I do my backups with
rsync , I didn't need to worry about that: just
blow it away and run
rsync
again.
And the system froze again.
This time no console messages.
Is this the
dreaded
soft updates
memory issue?
Possibly, and there's no reason for soft updates on this drive anyway, so tried to turn them
off:
=== root@lagoon (/dev/pts/2)
/dereel/home/grog
1
->
tunefs -n disable /photobackup/
tunefs: soft updates cleared
tunefs: /dev/ad4s1a: failed to write superblock
Huh?
That's not the device:
=== root@lagoon (/dev/pts/2)
/dereel/home/grog
2
->
grep photo /etc/fstab
/dev/da0p1             /photobackup     ufs     rw,noauto      0        0
With the correct drive, it worked:
=== root@lagoon (/dev/pts/2)
/dereel/home/grog
3
->
tunefs -n disable /dev/da0p1
tunefs: soft updates cleared
At first, I thought
message “failed to write superblock” was an incorrect error message,
but looking at the device name, that's the root file system:
=== root@lagoon (/dev/pts/2)
/dereel/home/grog
4
->
df /
Filesystem  1048576-blocks Used Avail Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/ad4s1a           9916 7930  1192    87%    /
So clearly
tunefs
reacts differently from, say,
fsck
when given a mount
point.
fsck
looks up the device in
/etc/fstab ;
tunefs
appears to get
the device name from the specified directory name.
You can't reset soft updates when the
device is mounted (that's why the superblock update failed), so what it finds is the
underlying file system, in this case the root file system.
I'm still not convinced that all is well with the backup disk.
One of the problems is
that
rsync
normally considers files to be the same if the file size and modification
timestamp are the same.
After a crash, that's not necessarily sufficient.
Running
rsync
with the
--checksum
option would probably take longer than
just starting from scratch, so I suppose I should rebuild the file system.
But I'll wait
until I have something faster than USB before I do that: even at a sustained 50 MB/s,
writing 1 TB of data takes nearly 6 hours.
Shade area: progress
Topic: gardening
Link here
Continued work on the shade area today, and got pretty much finished.
The first image is
from two weeks ago:
The shade cloth I bought was considerably longer than needed; I had intended to use the rest
for the west end of the north verandah.
But now I think I might cut it to size as an
entrance, so that we can cover it completely on hot days.
Once again I had problems with the tack strips.
They're 1.25×5 cm, with 8 barbs to go
through the shade cloth into the wood, and come in packs of 5:
The problem is that they're considerably wider than a hammer, and hammering them in tends to
knock in only one side.
Unless the wood is very soft, you end up with something like this,
on the west side of the north verandah:
And if things go wrong, they become worse than useless:
Tried it again today with similar results, and decided that I should use wood strips and
screws instead:
That worked quite well, except that the cloth was wider than the advertised “metric” 1.8
metres (the resemblance to 6 feet is purely coincidental), so we had to bunch it a bit on
the right.
I'll replace the strips on the verandah with something similar in full length.
Metz speaks
Topic: photography, technology, opinion

Nobody on the lists seems to know anything
about
Nickel-zinc batteries ,
but everything I've seen suggests that they're worth trying.
Bought 8 batteries and a
charger on
eBay .
I'll try them out on my
power-hungry
Nikon
“Coolpix” L1 , which wouldn't pose such a problem if it were to die.
Also finally got round to sending an enquiry via their
web form , which displayed about a quarter of the short text:
Peter Jeremy has pointed me to the triangle at bottom left of the input field.
Pull on it
and it expands the field.
But that's not the point: like so many mainstream “applications”,
which frequently open windows that are far smaller than the content, the default size seems
to say something about the intentions of the programmer.
This was written during the German night.
To my surprise, and to their credit, I got a
reply written at 9:40 the same morning.
They can't recommend NiZn batteries, but they're
currently testing them in their laboratories, and I should ask again in November.
That says a number of things: firstly, they know what I'm talking about, since they're
testing them.
The “can't recommend” means exactly that: they haven't gained enough
experience with them yet.
And having to ask again in November suggests that they don't
maintain context after answering a query; it would be better if they would say “we will
reply again when we have finished our testing”.
Still, it addresses my main concern: is the
voltage too high?
It seems reasonable to assume that this reply says “no”.

Shade area infrastructure
Topic: gardening

The weather was pretty terrible today, and I spent most of the day inside, but did manage to
get some shelves put in the shade area.
A couple of years ago, David Yeardley bought the
same kind of toy greenhouse from
ALDI
that we
bought
three years ago , and which catastrophically
self-destructed
three months later :
David had had the good sense not to try to erect it, but the shelving is usable, and he gave
it to me a couple of months ago.
I'm still using the old shelves, but they're pretty
overloaded, so put the shelves together and effectively in the same place as the ones I put
in three years ago (first photo):

Populating the shade area
Topic: gardening
Link here
Moved most of the seedlings and cuttings from the greenhouse to the shade area.
It's
amazing how dry some of them were, although I water them profusely every day.
And today it
was grey, overcast and moist.
Hopefully they'll feel better in their new position.
One plant that gives me cause for concern is our dwarf Meyer lemon tree.
We've had trouble
with it in the past, but it really came back to life last autumn when I put it in the
greenhouse (first photo, taken on
20 April 2011 ).
But
then we saw yellowing leaves, and now I see (pot on the left in the middle photo):
There are lots of flowers, but it's losing all its leaves.
Why?
Did some ambient light measurements in the shade area.
Today was particularly cloudy and
dark, and I got the following results.
The values are in lux, taken with my incident light
meter:
vertical
horizontal
Garden 1
20,000
5,000
Garden 2
18,000
6,000
Greenhouse
10,000
3,000
Shade area
1,300
800 - 1200
It's really difficult to get accurate measurements; even the slightest movement of the
sensor changes the values significantly.
But what I see here is that the greenhouse is
about half as bright as outside
(1
EV , which surprises me), and
the shade area about 12% to 25% as bright as in the greenhouse (3 or 2 EV).
That's in line
with the 70% reduction that they claim for the shade cloth.
I'll keep observing things.

Late flowers
Topic: gardening

I took my monthly
garden photos
a few days ago , but since then I've
found a couple I have forgotten, and a few others have popped up.
The
Paulownia kawakamii
isn't
quite in flower yet, but it's trying, as is the
red
Mandevilla :
The
Bougainvilleas
have really come
into their own:
The
Pelargoniums
are also making
progress:
And to my particular joy, both
the
Delphinium
“Völkerfrieden” and
the
Clematis recta
are growing.
Only a couple of weeks ago I had thought that both were dead, but the Clematis in particular
is growing very rapidly:
Dryness and wetness
Topic: gardening, photography
Link here
They're predicting lots of rain tomorrow, so took my weekly photos today.
The rain is
welcome: after “the drought broke” (and caused severe flooding) in the summer, things are
drying out again, as indicated by the dam.
When we moved in there was hardly any water, and
regularly every summer it dried out completely.
But at the end of August last year the two
halves joined up, and shortly after that it overflowed into the lagoon.
It stayed that way
into the new year, but since then it has gradually been drying out again.
Today we have a
clear division into two halves again.
