Personal Quotes
"I liked being a minor because you can't get into trouble. Now I just have to try and behave myself."
"I might look like a tough chick - and I am - but I'm also a hopeless romantic inside."
"Why should I care what other people think of me? I am who I am. And who I wanna be."
"I'd like to be a little more hard-rocking on my next album. But I hate the whole label thing."
People ask me if I regret wasting my last teen years on becoming a singer. You know something? I don't. Because singing is my life. When and if you want something so badly you'll see. I mean, I'm just so blessed to be doing what I love to do and to have been given this opportunity. I thank God because there are so many more talented people out there that will never even come close to getting a record deal.
"To understand me, you have to meet me and be around me. And then only if I'm in a good mood - don't meet me in a bad mood."
"My mom wouldn't let me sing 'Strawberry Wine' because it had 'wine' in it."
"When I was 2 my mom said she knew I was going to be a singer. I've been performing ever since I was a young kid. So I've known I wanted to do this for awhile. I always knew in my heart that I'd be singing."
"I'm just coming out and I'm going to clearly be myself - I write what I feel, I never worry what others think."
I can write a song a day.
"My dream was always to hop up on stage in front of my fans every night and perform."
"Actually, I know for a fact there are some young female artists who don't even sing on their own records and who don't sing live. And that is pathetic." (about lipsynching)

Avril Lavigne's Bio
Όταν η τραγουδίστρια, συνθέτρια και μουσικός Avril Lavigne πρωτοεμφανίστηκε στη μουσική σκηνή σε ηλικία 17 ετών, ήταν γνωστή ως ένα pop-punk αγοροκόριτσο που προτιμούσε να δελεάσει το αγοραστικό κοινό με την δυναμική φωνή της, τις υπέροχες μελωδίες της και τους πολύ «χύμα» στίχους. Παραμένοντας ειλικρινής προς τον εαυτό της και βάζοντας τη μουσική πάνω από την εικόνα πέτυχε τόσο όσον αφορά τις κριτικές αλλά και όσον αφορά το εμπορικό κομμάτι. Το 2002, η Avril σημείωσε τεράστια επιτυχία με τον 6 φορές πλατινένιο δίσκο «Let Go» και συνέχισε το 2004 με τον 3 φορές πλατινένιο «Under My Skin» και το 2007 με τον πλατινένιο δίσκο «The Best Damn Thing». Κέρδισε οκτώ υποψηφιότητες βραβείων Grammy, επτά καναδικά Βραβεία Juno και πούλησε περισσότερα από 30 εκατομμύρια άλμπουμ και σχεδόν 20 εκατομμύρια κομμάτια σε όλο τον κόσμο τα τελευταία οκτώ χρόνια.
Η Lavigne ξεκίνησε επίσης μια δεύτερη καριέρα ως επιχειρηματίας με τη δημιουργία μιας lifestyle αλυσίδας σχετικής με τη μόδα, AbbeyDawn, δύο αρωμάτων (Black Star και Forbidden Rose), ενώ επεκτάθηκε επίσης στον χώρο του κινηματογράφου (Over the Hedge, Fast FoodNation). Επιπλέον, έχει αφοσιωθεί σε φιλανθρωπικές ενέργειες δημιουργώντας το ίδρυμα Avril Lavigne, το οποίο λειτουργεί σε συνεργασία με κορυφαίες φιλανθρωπικές οργανώσεις με σκοπό να σχεδιάσουν και να εφαρμόζουν προγράμματα, να ευαισθητοποιούν και να κινητοποιούν κόσμο, για την υποστήριξη των παιδιών και των νέων που ζουν με σοβαρές ασθένειες ή αναπηρίες.
Με τις πολλαπλές δημιουργικές προσπάθειές και την εντυπωσιακή μουσική επιτυχία της, αξίζει να σημειωθεί ότι η Avril Lavigne είναι μόνο 26. Μπορεί να είναι νέα, αλλά έχει εξελιχθεί ως άτομο και ως καλλιτέχνης μετά την κυκλοφορία του «The Best Damn Thing». Η Lavigne δείχνει την ωριμότητα και διορατικότητα που έχει αποκτήσει από τις εμπειρίες της στην επόμενη αγάπη-δουλειά της, το τέταρτο album της, «Goodbye Lullaby», το οποίο κυκλοφορεί από το Μάρτιο του 2011. «Εγώ η ίδια πίεσα τον εαυτό μου και δεν δίστασα καθόλου», λέει η Lavigne για το «Goodbye Lullaby» στο οποίο έγραψε ή συνέγραψε τους στίχους κάθε κομματιού και ήταν παραγωγός των δύο από αυτά («4 Real» and «Goodbye»). «Επέτρεψα στον εαυτό μου να είμαι ευάλωτη. Νομίζω ότι κατά τη διάρκεια των πραγματικών στιγμών οι άνθρωποι μπορούν να συνδεθούν περισσότερο. Όσοι έχουν ακούσει το άλμπουμ είχαν πολύ έντονες συναισθηματικές αντιδράσεις στα κομμάτια, οπότε και συνειδητοποίησα ότι όταν κάτι είναι τόσο αληθινό το πιο πιθανό είναι ότι θα αγγίξει κάποιους ανθρώπους. Η ομορφιά της μουσικής είναι ότι είναι ανοιχτή σε ερμηνείες".
Γραμμένο σε διάφορες στιγμές των περασμένων ετών, το «Goodbye Lullaby» είναι γεμάτο με όμορφα, αφηγηματικά, θερμά τραγούδια που μεταδίδουν μία ποικιλία συναισθημάτων και αντανακλούν μια γλυκόπικρη διάθεση που γενικά δεν συνδέεται με τα πιο γνωστά κομμάτια της Lavigne. Εκτός από τα «What The Hell» και «Smile», που δημιουργούν ένα τέλειο πέρασμα από την προηγούμενη δουλειά της, το υπόλοιπο του «Goodbye Lullaby» βρίσκει την Avril να εξερευνά τι σημαίνει να ξεπερνάς τις δύσκολες στιγμές και να βγαίνεις πιο δυνατός από αυτές - ένα θέμα εμφανές σε τραγούδια όπως τα "Everybody Hurts", "Push", "Remember When" και "Wish You Were Here".
«Συνολικά, το άλμπουμ είναι για το πώς ο κόσμος περνάει δύσκολες εμπειρίες, είτε είναι το τέλος μιας σχέσης, ή χάνοντας μια θέση εργασίας, ή απλά όταν κάποιος είναι απών», λέει η Lavigne. «Έχουμε περάσει από αυτό και μεγαλώνουμε.» Πουθενά δεν έχει εκφραστεί καλύτερα αυτό το συναίσθημα πέρα από το "Goodbye", μια ευαίσθητη piano-and-string μπαλάντα, που κλείνει το άλμπουμ. Το "Goodbye" είναι το πιο ακατέργαστο και ευάλωτο κομμάτι που γράφτηκε και ηχογραφήθηκε στην καριέρα μου», λέει η Lavigne. «Είναι ένα πολύ ιδιαίτερο τραγούδι, γιατί το έγραψα και παρήγαγα η ίδια. Είναι τόσο πραγματικό και αληθινό. Δεν είναι προσποιητό ».
Η ένταση του Goodbye Lullaby είναι ισορροπημένη από την ενορχήστρωσή του: φωτεινή, πλούσια ακουστική κιθάρα, πιάνο, καθώς και μία ορχήστρα στο "Darlin", "Remember When" και "Goodbye" . Σε όλα, από το αισιόδοξο ποπ τραγούδι μέχρι τις μπαλάντες, η φωνή της Lavigne είναι μπροστά και κέντρο, ενώ «εκτινάσσεται» αναλόγως μέσα από την συγκίνηση που απαιτούν οι στίχοι της.
«Αυτό το άλμπουμ είναι ότι είμαι εγώ.. τραγουδίστρια, συνθέτρια και μουσικός», λέει η Lavigne. «Συνήθως, ο κύριος τραγουδιστής θάβεται στο κομμάτι και δεν μπορείτε να αντιληφθείτε πάντοτε την ποιότητα, τον χαρακτήρα, ή τη συγκίνηση μετά από ένα ορισμένο σημείο. Ήθελα η φωνή μου να είναι το βασικό μέσο. Αυτό με ανάγκασε να ρίξω τον εαυτό μου πραγματικά εκεί έξω. Αγαπώ ακόμα τη ροκ, αλλά θα ήθελα να δείτε μια διαφορετική πλευρά μου. Γι 'αυτό παρήγαγα μερικά τραγούδια, κάτι που ποτέ δεν φανταζόμουν ότι θα κάνω ... »
Για τα υπόλοιπα κομμάτια του άλμπουμ, η Lavigne στράφηκε στους πολύχρονους φίλους της και συνεργάτες Evan Taubenfeld και Butch Walker, καθώς και Max Martin. Μια άλλη σημαντική επιρροή ήταν ο τραγουδιστής των Sum 41, Deryck Whibley, που δανείζει τις δεξιότητες του στην παραγωγή, σε διάφορα τραγούδια, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των "Darlin", ένα τραγούδι που η Lavigne έγραψε στην ηλικία των14. « Όποτε ακούω το Darlin' σκέφτομαι το οικογενειακό δωμάτιο όπου το έγραψα και το έπαιζα για τη μαμά μου», λέει. «Έτσι είναι πραγματικά ξεχωριστό για μένα να το έχω στο album.»
Ένα μικρό κορίτσι από το Napanee του Ontario, είχε ήδη γράψει, τραγουδήσει και εκτελέσει για κάποια χρόνια πριν από την κυκλοφορία του album, Let Go, όπου ξεχώρισαν τα "Complicated" και "Sk8r Boi" και πούλησε πάνω από 16 εκατομμύρια μονάδες παγκοσμίως. Το δεύτερο album της "Under My Skin", το 2004 , έκανε το ντεμπούτο του στο νούμερο 1 στο Billboard Top 200, και πούλησε περισσότερα από οκτώ εκατομμύρια αντίτυπα σε όλο τον κόσμο και περιέχει τα hit singles "Don't Tell Me" και "My Happy Ending". Τέσσερα χρόνια αργότερα ήρθε το "The Best Damn Thing", το οποίο χαρακτηρίστηκε από το νούμερο 1 single "Girlfriend" όπου ήταν το μεγαλύτερο ρεκόρ της Lavigne μέχρι σήμερα. Το "Girlfriend" ήταν η κορυφαία ψηφιακή τροχιά από το 2007, κάνοντας περισσότερα από 7,3 εκατομμύρια downloads σε οκτώ γλώσσες. Το The Best Damn Thing περιλαμβάνει την επική μπαλάντα "Keep Holding On," την οποία η Lavigne έγραψε μετά από αίτηση της 20th Century Fox για την ταινία Eragon. Τραγούδια της Lavigne έχουν συμπεριληφθεί επίσης σε soundtracks ταινιών μεγάλου μήκους, όπως το Sweet Home Alabama, Bruce Almighty, Legally Blonde 2, The Princess Diaries 2 και The House Bunny.
Το 2010, η Lavigne έγραψε το "Alice" για την ταινία φαντασίας του Τιμ Μπάρτον «Αλίκη στη Χώρα των Θαυμάτων», η οποία είχε συμπεριληφθεί στο album συλλογή «Almost Alice», που κυκλοφόρησε το Μάρτιο. Το βίντεο για το Alice, σε σκηνοθεσία David Meyers, απεικονίζει την περιπέτεια της Lavigne στην τρύπα του κουνελιού. Έφερε, επίσης, το εμπορικό σήμα της στο μίγμα, σχεδιάζοντας κομμάτια "Alice in Wonderland" για την Abbey Dawn που πωλήθηκαν σε καταστήματα σε συνδυασμό με την κυκλοφορία της ταινίας.
Ήταν ένα ταξίδι ανεμοστρόβιλος για την Avril, η οποία δηλώνει ότι το πιο σημαντικό πράγμα που περιμένει με την κυκλοφορία του Goodbye Lullaby είναι να έχει την ευκαιρία να βγει στον δρόμο και να τραγουδήσει για τους θαυμαστές της σε όλον τον κόσμο. «Οι θαυμαστές μου είναι φανατικοί», λέει η Lavigne. «Είναι πολύ αφοσιωμένοι και πραγματικά πολύ υποστηρικτικοί - είναι από αυτούς που μένουν μαζί σου. Είναι απίστευτη εμπειρία να τους γνωρίζω μετά τα show και να διαβάζω τα γράμματα τους, γιατί τα πράγματα που θα μου πουν είναι πολύ ξεχωριστά και σημαντικά για μένα. Είναι ότι χρειάζομαι να ακούσω. Αν μπορώ να δώσω έστω σε ένα άτομο δύναμη μέσα από τη μουσική μου είναι τέλειο!!»

Early life
Avril Ramona Lavigne was born in
Belleville , Ontario. Her father, Jean-Claude Lavigne, named her "Avril" after the French word for the month of April. At the age of two, she began singing church songs with her mother, [ 1 ]
Judith-Rosanne "Judy" (nιe Loshaw). Judy recognized her two-year-old daughter's talents after hearing her sing " Jesus Loves Me " in church. [ 2 ]
Lavigne has an older brother, Matthew, and a younger sister, Michelle, [ 3 ]
both of whom teased her when she sang. "My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying." [ 2 ]
When Lavigne was five years old, the family moved to
Napanee , Ontario, [ 1 ]
a town with an approximate population of 5,000. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
Although she struggled with paying attention in school, sometimes being kicked out of class for misbehaving, her parents supported her singing. Her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, several guitars, and converted their basement into a studio. When Lavigne was 14, her parents would take her to karaoke sessions. [ 7 ]
Lavigne also performed at country fairs, singing songs by
Garth Brooks ,
The Dixie Chicks , and Shania Twain. She also began writing her own songs. Her first song was called "Can't Stop Thinking About You", about a teenage crush, which she described as "cheesy cute". [ 8 ]
"
I've known all my life that this is what I was supposed to do.... Visualizing like what it would be like to be famous with my music. And always just dreaming, always daydreaming.
"
Avril Lavigne, NBC News [ 7 ]
In 1999, [ 9 ]
Lavigne won a radio contest to perform with fellow Canadian singer Shania Twain at the Corel Centre (now
Scotiabank Place ) in Ottawa, before an audience of 20,000 people. [ 1 ] [ 4 ]
Twain and Lavigne sang " What Made You Say That ", [ 1 ]
and Lavigne told Twain she was going to be "a famous singer". [ 4 ]
During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, "Touch the Sky", for his 1999 album,
Quinte Spirit . She later sang on "Temple of Life" and "Two Rivers" for his follow-up album,
My Window to You , in 2000. In December 1999, Lavigne was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing
country
covers at a
Chapters
bookstore in
Kingston , Ontario. [ 1 ] [ 4 ]
Fabri sent out VHS tapes of Lavigne's home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was visited by several executives. [ 10 ]
Mark Jowett, co-founder of the Canadian management firm
Nettwerk , received a copy of Lavigne's karaoke performances recorded in her parents' basement. [ 11 ]
Jowett arranged for Lavigne to work with
Peter Zizzo
during the summer of 2000 in New York, where she wrote the song "Why?". Lavigne was noticed by
Arista Records
on a subsequent trip to New York. [ 10 ]
Lavigne would go on to sell more than 30 million copies of her albums worldwide, [ 12 ]
becoming one of the top-selling artists releasing albums in the U.S., with over 10.25 million copies certified by the RIAA. [ 13 ]
In 2009,
Billboard
named Lavigne the No. 10 pop artist in the "Best of the 2000s" chart. [ 14 ]
She was listed as the 28th overall best act of the decade based on album and single chart performance in the U.S. [ 15 ]

Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)
In November 2000, [ 5 ]
Ken Krongard, an
A&R
representative, invited Antonio "L.A." Reid, then head of Arista Records, to producer Peter Zizzo's Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne sing. Her 15-minute audition "so impressed" Reid, he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth $1.25 million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing advance. [ 6 ] [ 1 ]
By this time, Lavigne had found that she fit in naturally with her hometown high school's skater clique, an image that carried through to her first album, but although she enjoyed
skateboarding , school left her feeling insecure. Armed with a record deal, she dropped out to focus on her music career, [ 5 ]
but she still had to inform her parents of her decision. "I wasn't going to turn [the record deal] down. It's been my dream all my life. They knew how much I wanted this and how much I've put into it." [ 16 ] [ 8 ]
Reid gave A&R Joshua Sarubin the responsibility for overseeing Lavigne's development and the recording of her debut album. [ 17 ]
They spent several months in New York working with different co-writers trying to forge an individual sound for her. Sarubin told
HitQuarters
that for while they struggled finding her sound and although early collaborations with songwriter-producers including Sabelle Breer, Curt Frasca and Peter Zizzo, resulted in some good songs, they didn't match her and her voice. [ 17 ]
It was only when Lavigne then went to Los Angeles in May 2001 and created two songs with
The Matrix
production team - including "Complicated" - that the record company felt she had made a major breakthrough. [ 17 ]
Lavigne then worked further with The Matrix and also with singer-songwriter Cliff Magness. Recording finished in January 2002. [ 17 ]
Lavigne released her debut album,
Let Go , on 4 June 2002 in the U.S., where it reached No. 2 on the
Billboard
200. It peaked at No. 1 on the Australian, Canadian, and UK charts. This made Lavigne, at 17 years old, the youngest female soloist to have a No. 1 album in the UK until that time. [ 18 ]
By the end of 2002, the album was certified four-times platinum by the RIAA, making her the bestselling female artist of 2002 and
Let Go
the top-selling debut of the year. [ 19 ]
By May 2003,
Let Go
had accumulated over 1,000,000 sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification from the
Canadian Recording Industry Association . [ 20 ]
As of 2009, the album has sold over 16 million units worldwide, [ 21 ]
and the RIAA has certified the album six-times platinum, denoting shipments of over six million units in the U.S. [ 22 ]
"
I don't get overwhelmed, just because I feel like I've kind of prepared myself for it. All my life this is what I've wanted, what I've dreamed about, and I knew this would happen. I've been singing ever since I was really young and I've wanted this so bad, and I told myself I would do it.
"
Avril Lavigne on her success, MTV [ 5 ]
Lavigne's debut single and the album's

Dawson's Creek . "Complicated" later ranked on the
Hot 100 Singles of the Decade
list at No. 83. [ 23 ]
Subsequent singles, "Sk8er Boi" and "I'm With You" reached the top ten in the U.S. [ 24 ]
Thanks to the success of her first three singles, Lavigne was the second artist in history to have three No. 1 songs from a debut album on the

Vancouver, Canada
during the Live and By Surprise mall tour
Lavigne co-wrote " Breakaway " with Matthew Gerard, which was recorded by
Kelly Clarkson
for the soundtrack to the 2004 film
The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement . [ 35 ]
"Breakaway" would later be included on Clarkson's
second album
and released as the album's lead single. Lavigne covered the Goo Goo Dolls song "Iris", performed with the band's lead singer
John Rzeznik
at
Fashion Rocks , [ 36 ]
and she posed for the cover of
Maxim
in October 2004. [ 37 ]
She also recorded the theme song for
The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie . "I made the song a little more edgy", Lavigne said. "There are a lot of loud guitars, and we picked the tempo up a little and sang it with a little more attitude." Lavigne rearranged the song with the help of producer Butch Walker. [ 38 ]
Lavigne's second studio album,
Under My Skin , was released on 25 May 2004, debuting at No. 1 in several countries, including Australia, Mexico, Canada, Japan, the UK, and the U.S. [ 39 ]
The album has sold more than 10 million copies. Lavigne wrote most of the album's tracks with Canadian singer-songwriter
Chantal Kreviazuk . Kreviazuk's husband,
Our Lady Peace
front man
Raine Maida , co-produced the album, along with
Butch Walker
and Don Gilmore. Lavigne went on the Live and By Surprise twenty-one city mall tour in the U.S. and Canada to promote the album, accompanied by her guitarist,
Evan Taubenfeld . Each performance consisted of a short live acoustic set of songs from the new album. At the end of 2004, Lavigne embarked on her first world tour, the
Bonez Tour , which had stopovers in almost every continent and lasted for the entire 2005 year.
"
This record definitely proves that I'm a writer and people can't knock that, because each song comes from a personal experience of mine, and there are so much emotions in those songs.
"
Avril Lavigne,
The Ledger [ 40 ]
" Don't Tell Me ", the lead single of the album, went to No. 1 in Argentina and Mexico and reached the top five in the UK and Canada and the top ten in Australia and Brazil. "My Happy Ending", the album's second single, went to No. 1 in Mexico and the top five in the UK and Australia. In the U.S., it reached the top ten of the
Billboard
Hot 100 and went to No. 1 in the Mainstream Top 40, making it her fourth-biggest hit there. The third single, " Nobody's Home ", did not make the top 40 in the U.S., reaching No. 1 only in Mexico and Argentina. The fourth single from the album, " He Wasn't ", reached top 40 positions in the UK and Australia and was not released in the U.S. [ 41 ]

The Best Damn Thing
On 26 February 2006, Lavigne represented Canada at the
closing ceremony of the Torino Olympics , performing her song "Who Knows" during the eight minute
Vancouver 2010
portion. [ 43 ]
While Lavigne was in the studio for her third studio album,
Fox Entertainment Group
approached her to write a song for the soundtrack to the 2006 fantasy-adventure film
Eragon . She wrote and recorded two "ballad-type" songs, but only one, " Keep Holding On ", was used for the film. [ 44 ]
Lavigne admitted that writing the song was challenging, making sure it flowed with the film. She emphasized that "Keep Holding On", which later appeared on the album, was not indicative of what the next album would be like. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]
Lavigne in 2007 at a press conference in Hong Kong, promoting
The Best Damn Thing
Lavigne's third album,
The Best Damn Thing , was released on 17 April 2007, which Lavigne immediately promoted with a small tour. Its lead single, " Girlfriend ", topped the
Billboard
Hot 100 the same week
The Best Damn Thing
debuted at No. 1 on the
Billboard
200 chart. "Girlfriend" was Lavigne's first single to reach this No. 1 position. [ 47 ]
The single was a worldwide hit; it also peaked at No. 1 in Australia, Canada, Japan, and Italy and reached No. 2 in the UK and France. "Girlfriend" was recorded in Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Japanese, and Mandarin. The
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry
ranked "Girlfriend" as the most-downloaded track worldwide in 2007, selling 7.3 million copies, including the versions recorded in eight different languages. [ 48 ] [ 12 ]
"Girlfriend" ranked on the
Hot 100 Singles of the Decade
list at No. 94. [ 49 ]
" When You're Gone ", the second single, went to No. 3 in the UK, the top five in Australia and Italy, the top ten in Canada, and was close to reaching the top twenty in the U.S. In December 2007, Lavigne, with annual earnings of $12 million, was ranked number eight in the
Forbes
"Top 20 Earners Under 25". [ 50 ]
" Hot " was the third single and has been Lavigne's least successful single in the U.S., charting only at No. 95. In Canada, "Hot" made the top ten, and in Australia, the top 20.
The Best Damn Thing
has sold over 6 million copies worldwide.
During this era, Lavigne won nearly every award she was nominated for, including two
World Music Awards
for "World's Bestselling Canadian Artist" and "World's Best Pop/Rock Female Artist". She took her first two
MTV Europe Music Awards , received one
Teen Choice Awards
for "Summer Single", and was nominated for five Juno awards.
In mid-2007, Lavigne was featured in a two-volume
graphic novel ,
Avril Lavigne's Make 5 Wishes . She collaborated with artist
Camilla D'Errico
and writer
Joshua Dysart
on the
manga , which was about a shy girl named Hana who, upon meeting her hero Avril Lavigne, learned to overcome her fears. Lavigne said, "I know that many of my fans read manga, and I'm really excited to be involved in creating stories that I know they will enjoy." The volumes were released on 10 April (one week prior to the release of
The Best Damn Thing ) and in July, respectively. The publication
Young Adult Library Services
nominated the series for "Great Graphic Novels for Teens". [ 51 ]
In March 2008, Lavigne undertook a world tour named The Best Damn Tour to support the album. In that same month, she also appeared on the cover of
Maxim
for the second time of her career. [ 52 ]
In mid-August, Malaysia's Islamic opposition party, the
Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party , attempted to ban Lavigne's show in
Kuala Lumpur , judging her stage moves "too sexy". Her concert on 29 August was considered as promoting wrong values ahead of Malaysia's independence day on 31 August. [ 53 ]
On 21 August 2008, MTV reported that the concert had been approved by the Malaysian government. [ 54 ]

Lavigne singing in Florida during her
Black Star Tour , May 2011.
Only a month after completing The Best Damn Tour, Lavigne began recording in her home studio in November 2008 with the song "Black Star", [ 55 ]
written to help promote her first fragrance of the same name. [ 56 ]
By July 2009, nine tracks had been recorded for the new album, [ 55 ]
including the songs "Fine", "Everybody Hurts" and "Darlin". Several of the tracks were written in Lavigne's youth. "Darlin" was the second song Lavigne wrote as a 15-year-old while living in Napanee, Ontario. Lavigne described the album as being about "life". She stated, "It's so easy for me to do a boy-bashing pop song, but to sit down and write honestly about something that's really close to me, something I've been through, it's a totally different thing." [ 56 ]
The album is expected to be a return to Lavigne's older musical style and may be largely
acoustic . [ 57 ]
With the exception of the album's lead single, " What the Hell ", Lavigne described the songs on the album as different from her earlier material: "I'm older now, so I think that comes across in my music, it's not as
pop-rock ". [ 58 ]
In January 2010, while simultaneously writing and recording for her new album, Lavigne worked with
Disney
clothing designs inspired by
Tim Burton 's feature film,
Alice in Wonderland . She asked the executives if she could write a song for the film. The result was the song " Alice ", [ 59 ]
which was played over the end credits [ 60 ]
and included on the soundtrack,
Almost Alice . [ 61 ]
On 28 February, Lavigne gave a performance at the concert portion of the Vancouver
2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony , performing "My Happy Ending" and "Girlfriend". [ 62 ]
Lavigne was honoured to perform at the ceremonies, but she regretted not being able to attend the U.S. vs. Canada hockey match. "They had us on lockdown. We weren't allowed to leave our trailers, for security purposes." [ 63 ]
In September 2010, Lavigne's third single from her debut album, "I'm With You", was sampled by
Rihanna
on the track " Cheers (Drink to That) ", which is featured on Rihanna's fifth studio album,
Loud . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]
In August 2011, she was featured in the music video for Cheers (Drink To That). "It's exciting to me because that was always one of my favorite songs, and for it to come out 10 years ago and so now to have it sampled and back out on the radio is pretty dope". [ 66 ]
In December 2010, American singer
Miranda Cosgrove
released " Dancing Crazy ", a song written by Lavigne,
Max Martin
and
Shellback . It was also produced by Martin. [ 67 ]
On 23 September 2011, Lavigne appeared in the
Hub network
show
Majors & Minors
as a guest mentor, alongside other singers including
Adam Lambert
and
Leona Lewis . About the show Lavigne stated "I sang for them, and they performed for me. I was just blown away. I got to talk to them about music and the music industry, and they were all just so excited". [ 66 ]
The release dates for
Goodbye Lullaby
and its lead single were pushed back several times. In response to these delays, Lavigne said, "I write my own music and, therefore, it takes me longer to put out records 'cause I have to live my life to get inspiration", [ 68 ]
and that she had enough material for two records. [ 68 ]
In November, Lavigne was featured in
Maxim , where she revealed that
Goodbye Lullaby
took two and a half years to complete, [ 69 ]
but she cited her record company as the reason for the album's delays, stating that the album had been completed for a year. [ 70 ]
Goodbye Lullaby
was released on 8 March. [ 71 ] [ 58 ]
The lead single, "What the Hell", premiered on
Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve
on 31 December. [ 71 ]
2011-present: fifth studio album
Three months after the release of
Goodbye Lullaby , Lavigne announced that work on her fifth studio album had already begun, with eight songs written so far. The new album will musically be the opposite of
Goodbye Lullaby . Lavigne explained, "[ Goodbye Lullaby ] was more mellow, [but] the next one will be pop and more fun again. I already have a song that I know is going to be a single, I just need to re-record it!" [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ]
Later, in July 2011, Lavigne revealed the title of two of the songs from her fifth album as "Fine" and "Gone". The tracks were originally recorded for
Goodbye Lullaby
but never made the final cut.
Lavigne's fifth album is rumoured to be released in 2012, "far earlier than imagined". However, nothing has been confirmed by Lavigne or her record label as to when the album will be released. [ 75 ]
In September 2011 Lavigne stated that she had a "few" tracks ready for the record, before stating a month later in an interview with
Virgin Radio 96
that she would begin production on it by January 2012. [ 66 ]
In a recent interview, Lavigne confirmed that she has moved to
Epic Records
which is now headed by
L.A. Reid .

Musical style and songwriting
"
I know my fans look up to me and that's why I make my songs so personal; it's all about things I've experienced and things I like or hate. I write for myself and hope that my fans like what I have to say.
"
Avril Lavigne, Girl.com.au [ 78 ]
Themes in Lavigne's music include messages of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view. [ 79 ]
Lavigne believes her "songs are about being yourself no matter what and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true." [ 78 ]
On her debut album,
Let Go , Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as " Losing Grip ", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as " Complicated ", saying that "the songs I did with
the Matrix ... were good for my first record, but I don't want to be that pop anymore." [ 80 ]
Lavigne's second album,
Under My Skin , had deeper personal themes underlying each song. Lavigne explained, "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about.... Like boys, like dating or relationships". [ 81 ]
In contrast, her third album,
The Best Damn Thing , was not personal to her. "Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through." [ 82 ]
Her objective in writing the album was simply to "make it fun". [ 83 ]
Goodbye Lullaby , Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records, [ 55 ]
with Lavigne describing the album as "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional". [ 84 ]
Growing up, Lavigne listened to
Blink-182 ,
Goo Goo Dolls ,
Matchbox Twenty
and
Shania Twain , [ 80 ]
and her influences include
Courtney Love
and
Janis Joplin . [ 81 ]
Because of these influences, musical genres, and her personal style, the media often defined her as
punk , something she denied being. Lavigne's close friend and guitarist,
Evan Taubenfeld , said, "It's a very touchy subject to a lot of people, but the point is that Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest". [ 85 ]
Lavigne also commented on the matter: "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [a] rebel... punk, and I am
so
not any of them." [ 40 ]
Most of critics identify Lavigne as some form between teen pop and pop-punk: Publications such as
The New York Times ,
Rolling Stone ,
NME ,
MusicMight ,
IGN
and
Popmatters
have identified Avril Lavigne as a mix of
rock ,
teen pop
and
pop-punk . [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ]
While Lavigne denied being angry, her interviews were still passionate about the media's lack of respect for her songwriting. "I am a writer, and I won't accept people trying to take that away from me", adding that she had been writing "full-structured songs" since she was 14. [ 40 ]
Despite this, Lavigne's songwriting has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio, the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, claimed that they were the main songwriters of Lavigne's singles, "Complicated", " Sk8er Boi " and " I'm with You ". Lavigne denied this, asserting that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album. "[N]one of those songs aren't from me". [ 80 ]
In 2007,
Chantal Kreviazuk , who wrote with Lavigne on her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism [ 92 ]
and criticized her songwriting. "Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything". [ 93 ]
Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for "clear defamation" against her character. [ 93 ]
Kreviazuk later apologized: "Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her". [ 92 ]
Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the 1970s band, the
Rubinoos , sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and
Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald
for allegedly stealing parts of "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" for her song "Girlfriend". [ 94 ]
Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, "me and Avril wrote the song together ...;. It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you'd find in a
Sum 41
song. It's the
Sex Pistols , not the Rubinoos." [ 93 ]
In January 2008, the lawsuit was closed after a confidential settlement had been reached. [ 95 ]
Other work
Film career
Lavigne became interested in appearing on television and in feature films. The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos would be to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video "Nobody's Home" involved the most "acting". [ 78 ]
Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of
Sabrina, the Teenage Witch , [ 96 ]
performing "Sk8er Boi" [ 97 ]
with her band in a nightclub. [ 98 ]
She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film
Going the Distance . The main characters bump into her backstage at the
MuchMusic Video Awards [ 99 ]
after her performance of "Losing Grip". [ 100 ]
Lavigne at the Los Angeles premiere of
Over the Hedge
on 30 April 2006.
She moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to
New Mexico [ 101 ]
to film a single scene in the 2007 film,
The Flock . [ 102 ]
She starred as Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside
Claire Danes
and
Richard Gere . Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes. [ 102 ]
On her role in
The Flock , Lavigne said, "I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into too fast". [ 78 ]
The Flock
would not be released in American theatres, and because it would not be released in foreign markets until late 2007, it would not be considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7 million in the foreign box office. [ 103 ]
Lavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film
Over the Hedge , based on the
comic strip of the same name . She voiced the character Heather, a
Virginia Opossum . Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, "All the actors went in individually, and [director]
Tim
and [screenwriter
Karey ] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of." [ 104 ]
Lavigne found the recording process to be "easy" and "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. " thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". [ 78 ]
The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38 million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336 million worldwide. [ 105 ]
In December 2005, Lavigne signed on to appear in
Fast Food Nation , based on the book
Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal . [ 106 ]
The fictionalized adaptation, directed by
Richard Linklater , traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses. [ 107 ]
Lavigne starred in her on-screen acting debut [ 108 ]
as a high school student intent on freeing the cows. [ 109 ]
The film opened on 17 November 2006 and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2 million worldwide. [ 110 ]
Both
Over the Hedge
and
Fast Food Nation
opened at the 2006
Cannes Film Festival , which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the "right parts and the right movies." Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. "I wanted to start off small and to learn [that] I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part." [ 78 ]
In August 2006,
Canadian Business
magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits. [ 111 ]
Entrepreneurship
In July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line
Abbey Dawn , featuring a back-to-school collection. [ 12 ]
It is produced by
Kohl's , which is the brand's exclusive U.S. retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself. [ 112 ] [ 113 ]
Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a "juniors lifestyle brand", [ 12 ]
which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and "hot pinks and blacks". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. "I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all." [ 114 ]
The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, "after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career". [ 66 ]
"
I just love clothes and colors and patterns. I'm very visual and very hands-on.
"
Avril Lavigne,
Billboard [ 115 ]
The designs were also featured on the Internet game
Stardoll , where figures can be dressed up as Avril Lavigne. [ 116 ]
On 14 September 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the
New York Fashion Week . [ 117 ]
Lavigne returned to the New York Fashion Week once again in 2011 with
Kylie Jenner ,
half sister
to Lavigne's boyfriend Brody Jenner, making her runway debut modelling Abbey Dawn. [ 66 ]
In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official website. [ 118 ] [ 84 ]
"It's fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I'd like for myself. I design things I [can't] find." [ 63 ]
At the end of 2008, Lavigne signed a contract with
Canon
Canada to appear in advertising campaigns and commercials to promote the latest line of cameras and a full range of other accessories. [ 119 ]
Lavigne released her first fragrance,
Black Star , created by
Procter & Gamble
Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on 7 March 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, was released in summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the U.S. and Canada. [ 120 ]
When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, "I wanted to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are." [ 121 ]
Black Star won the 2010 Best "Women's Scent Mass" by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW). [ 122 ]
Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, [ 123 ]
Forbidden Rose , which took two years to develop. [ 124 ]
It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla. [ 123 ]
Its message is an extension of Black Star's "follow your dreams", [ 125 ]
though the tagline for the new perfume is "Dare to Discover". [ 126 ]
The commercial takes place in a
gothic
garden setting, [ 125 ]
where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose. [ 126 ]
Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010. [ 84 ]
The tagline for the fragrance is "Dare to discover more". [ 127 ]
It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and crθme brϋlιe. [ 128 ]
In January 2010, Lavigne began working with Disney to incorporate
Alice in Wonderland -inspired designs into her Abbey Dawn line of clothing. [ 59 ]
Her designs were exhibited at the
Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising
in California beginning in May through September, alongside
Colleen Atwood 's costumes from the 2010 film. [ 129 ]
Philanthropy
Lavigne has been involved with many charities, including
Make Some Noise, Amnesty International , Erase MS, AmericanCPR.org, Camp Will-a-Way, Music Clearing Minefields,
U.S. Campaign for Burma ,
Make-a-Wish Foundation
and
War Child . She has also appeared in
ALDO
ads with YouthAIDS to raise money to educate people worldwide about HIV/AIDS. Lavigne took part in the Unite Against AIDS concert presented by ALDO in support of Unicef on 28 November 2007 at the
Bell Centre
in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. [ 130 ]
In November 2010, Lavigne attended the
Clinton Global Initiative . [ 131 ]
Lavigne worked with
Reverb , a non-profit environmental organization, for her 2005 east coast tour. [ 132 ]
She covered " Knockin' on Heaven's Door " for War Child's
Peace Songs
compilation, and she recorded a cover of the
John Lennon
song " Imagine " as her contribution to the compilation album
Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur . Released on 12 June 2007, the album was produced to benefit
Amnesty International 's campaign to alleviate the
crisis in Darfur . [ 133 ]
On 5 December 2009, Lavigne returned to the stage in
Mexico City
during the biggest charity event in Latin America, " Teleton ". She performed acoustic versions of her hits "Complicated" and "Girlfriend" with Evan Taubenfeld and band member,
Jim McGorman . [ 134 ]
In 2010, Lavigne was one of
several artists
who contributed their voices to a cover of
K'naan 's "Wavin' Flag" as a benefit single to help raise money for several charity organizations related to the 2010 Haiti earthquake. [ 135 ]
On 14 September 2010, Lavigne introduced her charity, "The Avril Lavigne Foundation". The next day, the foundation's official website was launched. The foundation aims to help young people with serious illnesses and disabilities [ 131 ] [ 136 ]
and works with leading charitable organizations; [ 118 ]
The foundation partners with the
Easter Seals , Make-A-Wish foundation and Erase MS, [ 137 ]
the latter two being charities Lavigne has previously worked with. Her work with the Make-A-Wish foundation was the inspiration behind her own charity, with Lavigne stating, "I just really wanted to do more". [ 136 ]
Lavigne said on the foundation's website, "I have always looked for ways to give back because I think it's a responsibility we all share". [ 138 ]
Philanthropist Trevor Neilson's 12-person firm, " Global Philanthropy Group ", advises Lavigne with her foundation as well as several other celebrities, including musician
John Legend . [ 131 ]
Personal life
Public image
"
I have to fight to keep my image really
me .... I rejected some gorgeous publicity shots because they just didn't look like me. I won't wear skanky clothes that show my booty, my belly or my boobs. I have a great body.
"
Avril Lavigne, MTV [ 5 ]
When Lavigne first gained publicity, she was known for her
tomboyish
style, [ 139 ]
in particular her necktie-and-tank-top combinations. [ 140 ] [ 141 ]
She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or
Converses , [ 63 ]
wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers. [ 7 ]
During photo shoots, instead of wearing "glittery get-ups", she preferred wearing "old, crumpled T's". [ 5 ]
In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media would call her the " pop punk princess ". [ 142 ] [ 143 ]
Press and fans regarded her as the
"anti-Britney" , in part because of her less-commercial and "real" image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. "I'm not made up and I'm not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I'm not." [ 7 ]
By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was "wearing a costume". [ 6 ]
Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career. "I'm just saying, I don't want to sell sex. I feel that's sort of lame and low. I've got so much more to say." [ 144 ]
Lavigne eventually took on a more
gothic
style as she began her second album,
Under My Skin , trading her skating outfits for black
tutus [ 143 ]
and earning an image marked by
angst . [ 145 ]
During
The Best Damn Thing
years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits, [ 146 ]
including "tight jeans and heels", [ 63 ]
and modelled for magazines such as
Harper's Bazaar . [ 139 ]
Lavigne defended her new style: "I don't really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wifebeaters and all... It had its time and place. And now I'm all grown up, and I've moved on". [ 146 ]
She now tries to eat healthy foods and practises yoga, soccer, surfing, rollerblading, and street hockey. [ 63 ]
Tattoos
Lavigne's XXV and star tattoos on her right forearm, and 30, lightning bolt, and star tattoos on her left wrist.
Only a few of Lavigne's tattoos are unique to her: the rest are matched with friends'. [ 63 ]
Lavigne had a star tattooed on the inside of her left wrist that matched the style of the one used for her first album artwork. It was created at the same time as friend and musical associate
Ben Moody 's identical tattoo. [ 147 ]
In late 2004, she had a small pink heart around the letter "D" applied to her right wrist, which represented her then-boyfriend, Deryck Whibley. [ 63 ] [ 148 ]
Lavigne and then-husband Whibley got matching tattoos in March 2010, in celebration of his 30th birthday. [ 63 ]
In April, Lavigne added another tattoo on her wrist: that of a lightning bolt and the number 30. Her boyfriend,
Brody Jenner , had a matching lightning bolt tattooed under his ear. [ 149 ]
"
Everything is always spur-of-the-moment. All of my tattoos, I decide that second and do it.
"
Avril Lavigne,
Inked [ 63 ]
Her love of tattoos, however, gained media attention in May 2010, after Lavigne and Jenner each got matching tattoos of the word "fuck" on their ribs. [ 150 ] [ 151 ]
Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for
Inked
magazine , where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an "Abbey Dawn" on her left forearm and an "XXV" and star on her right. Although she confirmed
the "fuck" tattoo
verbally in the article (calling it her "favorite word" [ 63 ] ) she had it applied
after
the magazine's photo shoot. [ 152 ]
She added that she eventually wanted to get a "big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name.... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that special someone to come back into my life." [ 63 ]
In July 2010, Lavigne had the name "Brody" tattooed beneath her right breast. [ 153 ]
Marriage to Deryck Whibley
Lavigne's ex-husband, Deryck Whibley
Lavigne and
Deryck Whibley , lead singer and guitarist for the band
Sum 41 , began dating when she was 19 years old, after being friends since she was 17. [ 154 ]
Only a few weeks before they met, Lavigne admitted that she was not meeting boys because her bodyguards were frightening them away. In June 2005, Whibley surprised Lavigne with a trip to
Venice , including a
gondola
ride and a romantic picnic, and on 27 June, he proposed to her. [ 155 ]
She at first wanted to have a "rock n' roll, goth wedding", but she admitted to having doubts about going against tradition. "I've been dreaming about my wedding day since I was a little girl. I have to wear the white dress.... People thought that I would black wedding dress, and I would have. But at the same time, I was thinking about the wedding pictures, and I wanted to be in style. I didn't want to be thinking, 20 years later, 'Oh, why did I wear my hair like that? ' " [ 156 ]
The wedding was held on 15 July 2006. About 110 guests attended the wedding, which was held at a private estate in
Montecito, California . [ 157 ]
Lavigne, wearing a gown designed by
Vera Wang
walked down the aisle with her father, Jean-Claude, to
Mendelssohn 's " Wedding March ". Lavigne chose a colour theme of red and white, including red rose petals and centrepieces of distinctly coloured flowers. The wedding included cocktails for an hour before the reception and a sit-down dinner. The song " Iris ", by the
Goo Goo Dolls , was played during Lavigne and Whibley's first dance. [ 158 ]
Seven months into their marriage, Lavigne stated that she was "the best thing that's ever happened to him", and suggested that she helped Whibley stay off drugs since they had begun dating. "He doesn't do drugs. Clearly, he used to, because he talked about it, but I wouldn't be with someone who did, and I made that very clear to him when we first started dating. I've never done cocaine in my life, and I'm proud of that. I am 100 percent against drugs." [ 156 ]
The marriage lasted a little more than three years. It was announced on 17 September 2009 that Lavigne and Whibley had split up and that divorce papers would soon follow. [ 159 ]
On 9 October 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce, releasing the statement, "I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship." [ 154 ]
The divorce was finalized on 16 November 2010, officially ending the marriage. [ 160 ]
