Who is Kate Elizabeth Winslet
Who is Kate Elizabeth Winslet? She is an
English
actress
and
singer . She is noted for having played a wide range of diverse characters over her career, but is probably best-known for her critically acclaimed performances as
Juliet Hulme
in
Heavenly Creatures
(1994), Marianne Dashwood in
Sense and Sensibility
(1995),
Rose DeWitt Bukater
in
Titanic
(1997),
Iris Murdoch
in
Iris
(2001), Clementine Kruczynski in
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
(2004) and Sarah Pierce in
Little Children
(2006). She has received the
Screen Actors Guild Award , two
BAFTA Awards , the
Grammy Award
and has been nominated for five
Academy Awards , seven
Golden Globes
and an
Emmy . At the age of 22, she broke the record for the youngest person to receive two Oscar nominations, [1]
and each of her subsequent nominations has broken a further record: the youngest person to receive three, four, and five nominations. David Edelstein of
New York Magazine
hails Winslet as "the best English-speaking film actress of her generation". [2] Kate Winslet was born 5 October 1975 in
Reading ,
England , the daughter of Sally Ann (née Bridges), a barmaid, and Roger John Winslet, a swimming-pool contractor. [3]
Both of her parents were also actors. Her maternal grandparents, Linda (Plumb) and Archibald Oliver Bridges, founded and operated the Reading Repertory, and her uncle, Robert Bridges, appeared in the original
West End
production of
Oliver!
Her sisters,
Beth Winslet
and
Anna Winslet , are also
actresses . Winslet, raised as an
Anglican , began studying drama at the age of eleven at the
Redroofs Theatre School , [4]
a co-educational
independent school
in
Maidenhead ,
Berkshire , where she was
head girl
and appeared in a television commercial for
Sugar Puffs
cereal, directed by
Tim Pope . Throughout her adolescence, she was severely bullied for being overweight and having large feet (which she inherited from her mother). [5] [6] Winslet's career began on television, with a co-starring role in the
BBC
children's
science fiction
serial
Dark Season
in 1991. This was followed by appearances in the made-for-TV movie
Anglo-Saxon Attitudes
in 1992 and an episode of medical drama
Casualty
in 1993, also for the BBC. Her film career took off with praise and recognition in 1994 when she starred in a joint leading role, as
Juliet Hulme
in director
Peter Jackson 's critically acclaimed
Heavenly Creatures , playing a vivacious and imaginative teen who helps her best friend (played by
Melanie Lynskey ) murder her mother, when they are not allowed to be together. This role was followed by the successful film
Sense and Sensibility
(co-starring
Emma Thompson ), which made her well-known, especially in the UK. Winslet became famous worldwide after the 1997 release of
Titanic , a massive hit which holds the record as highest-grossing film in history at more than
US$ 1.8 billion in box-office worldwide. It went on to win 11 Academy Awards. [1] She was also originally cast as Nola Rice in Woody Allen's movie, Match Point, but declined. She stated she had just finished two movies and wanted to spend time with her kids. The part went to Scarlett Johansson. Winslet has been regarded as something of a critics' darling, generally receiving positive reviews for every one of her films. Despite Titanic's success, she has continued making lower-budget, independent films, including
Hideous Kinky
and
Holy Smoke! ; her roles in these smaller, more artistic films appear to be one of choice—she turned down the lead in
Shakespeare in Love
to make Hideous Kinky; ironically, she appeared as
Ophelia
in
Kenneth Branagh 's
Hamlet . She was even considered for the role of Satine in "Moulin Rouge!". Throughout her career, she often turned down roles in high profile films, such as
Anna and the King
and Éowyn in
The Lord of the Rings film trilogy . She has also taken several roles in studio " period dramas " like
Quills ,
Titanic
and
Finding Neverland . For a time, she was given the nickname "Corset Kate". In 2005, Winslet appeared in a
television commercial
for
American Express . As part of the "My Life, My Card" campaign, the ad shows Winslet strolling around
Camden Lock , in
London , as she makes references to all the events that have happened to her film characters: going to prison for murder (Heavenly Creatures), being penniless and heartbroken (Sense and Sensibility), almost drowning (Titanic), losing her mind (Hamlet), having her memory erased (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), and being in Neverland (Finding Neverland). During the ad, she is shown holding items relating to her films; during the reference to Sense and Sensibility she thumbs through a copy of the book, and when she references Finding Neverland, she's holding a hook. When Winslet talks about nearly drowning at age 20 in Titanic, she is walking over a bridge with water underneath it, in reference to the iceberg and water seen in the film.
Winslet also appeared in an episode of BBC's comedy series
Extras
in August 2005, as a satirical version of 'herself'. She memorably told Andy and Maggie, the two characters who star in the series, that she was doing a film about the
Holocaust
because she was tired of losing out on Oscars, as at the time she had been nominated four times, and that everyone who does a film about the Holocaust wins an Oscar. She also (while dressed as a nun) was shown giving
phone sex
tips to the romantically challenged Maggie.
Ricky Gervais
(who is a native of the same town as Winslet,
Reading , as is her husband Sam Mendes) later said on
NPR
that she was his favorite guest star. [7]
Her performance in the episode did lead to her being nominated for an
Emmy Award
for Outstanding Guest Performance in a Comedy Series, but she did not win. As of March 2007,
Leonardo DiCaprio
signed to co-star in
Revolutionary Road
with Winslet as Frank and April Wheeler, a 1950s couple who appear content on the surface but are withering internally. The film will be the first to reunite the notable duo, who have remained close since their first pairing in
Titanic .
There are also talks that Winslet's husband,
Sam Mendes
and his production company, Neal Street Productions, purchased the film rights to the long-delayed biography of circus tiger tamer
Mabel Stark . Winslet has stated that she has been eager to portray this complex woman for three years now and is looking forward to working with her husband on bringing this to the screen. (See Mabel Stark's page for more information on the project.) Winslet has also enjoyed a brief taste of success as a singer, with her single
What If
from the soundtrack of
Christmas Carol: The Movie , which reached
#1 in Ireland
and
#6 in the UK
(she also filmed a
music video
for the song). She has also participated in a duet with
"Weird Al" Yankovic
on the
Sandra Boynton
CD Dog Train, and sang in the
2006
film
Romance and Cigarettes . She also sang an
aria
from
La Boheme , called "Sono andati", in her film
Heavenly Creatures , which is featured on the film's soundtrack. She was considered for the lead in
Moulin Rouge!
(which eventually went to
Nicole Kidman ); had she taken the part, she would have sung the full soundtrack. While on the set of
Dark Season , Winslet started a five-year romance with actor and writer Stephen Tredre. They moved to London during their relationship. A fter their romance, she began a relationship with
Rufus Sewell . After filming Titanic, Tredre died of bone cancer. Winslet was not at the premiere of Titanic because she was attending his funeral in London. She is good friends with Titanic co-star
Leonardo DiCaprio . [8]
On 22 November 1998, Winslet married director
Jim Threapleton . The two have a daughter, Mia Honey, who was born on 12 October 2000. After a divorce in 2001, Winslet began a relationship with
Sam Mendes , whom she married on 24 May 2003 on the island of
Anguilla
in the
Caribbean . Their son, Joe Alfie Mendes, was born on 22 December 2003. On the Tonight Show on 15 December 2008 Kate said that Joe Alfie currently prefers to be called Travier. The media, particularly in England, have enthusiastically documented her weight fluctuations over the years. Winslet has been outspoken about her refusal to lose weight in order to conform to the
Hollywood
ideal. In February 2003, the British edition of Gentlemen's Quarterly magazine published photographs of Winslet which had been digitally enhanced to make her look dramatically thinner than she really was; Winslet issued a statement saying that the alterations were made without her consent. GQ issued an apology in the subsequent issue.
Winslet and her husband Mendes currently reside in
New York City . They also own a manor house in the tiny village of Church Westcote in
Gloucestershire ,
England . Winslet and Mendes spent £3 million on the secluded Westcote Manor, a rambling Grade II- listed
house with eight bedrooms, set in 22 acres. They have reportedly spent more than £1 million on interior renovations, as well as restoring the original water garden, mulberry garden and orchard, all of which fell into disrepair when the former owner, equestrian artist
Raoul Millais , died in 1999.
