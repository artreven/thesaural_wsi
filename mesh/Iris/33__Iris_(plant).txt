Autumn with a vengeance
Topic: gardening
Link here
The mild autumn weather stopped abruptly with the change of month:
That was coupled with rain, so did almost nothing in the garden.
Hopefully I'll find time
to regain the momentum of the last few days.

More garden progress
Topic: gardening
Link here
The weather's better again, and both of us out into the garden.
One good thing about lots
of weeds is that when you take pull them out, you have something to show for it.
I started
the middle bay of the compost heap only a couple of days ago:
The north bed looks so different that we're reconsidering what to plant in it.
No decisions
made yet.

Under the weather
Topic: general, gardening
Link here
The weather is cool and moist again, and for some reason I didn't feel very well.
Had
planned to go into town today, but cancelled that and stayed at home watching TV instead.
The moisture was enough that I didn't do more than a little token pottering in the garden.

It's cool again, and I didn't feel like doing much, but
Yvonne
wanted to get rid of the dead hops, so out to lend her moral support.
When we installed
the original wooden beds in the eastern garden about 3 years ago, we planted some
spring-flowering
bulbs— Narcissus , I
think—in one of them.
After removing all the weeds, I found them still there, and
having multiplied nicely:
After separating them (far too late in the season, but what can you do?) I ended up with 32
bulbs, a couple damaged enough that they might not survive:
Planted half of them, along with another 3 that I had found elsewhere.
The rest will have
to wait until tomorrow.

The remaining daffodils

Again the weather was cool, so didn't do much outside.
Planted the remaining daffodils;
hopefully they'll come good.

A rose arch
Topic: gardening
Link here
On the way home, stopped off
in
Napoleons
to take a look at an arch
for training roses that
Yvonne
had seen at the roadside plant
sales yesterday.
We've been thinking about that for some time, and the price ($30) was
right, so I took it.
But how?
It was too wide to fit in the boot of the car, and I couldn't dismantle it.
It
originally came in 3 pieces which were screwed together, but of course the screws had seized
up.
In the end, stuck it sideways in the back window and drove home, very slowly:

First frost of winter
Topic: general, gardening
Link here
It's been
really
cool lately:
The lowest temperature measured by the weather station was 0.7°, and the highest was 13.6°,
but it lies.
We had a frost, and even inside the greenhouse, the temperature at the top
dropped to -0.1°.
That caught me by surprise: I had wanted to put
the
Mandevilla
in the greenhouse
before any frost, but fortunately it seems the frost wasn't heavy enough to affect most of
the garden, just some of
the
Tropaeolums .
I had thought that
that would have been the earliest in the year we've ever had a frost, but I see that two
years ago we had not one but two
in April , and
the lowest temperature I ever recorded with the weather station was on
22 May 2010 .
So why didn't the weather station report a lower temperature?
Presumably because it's an
inversion, and the temperature sensor was mounted too high.
I need to move it further down.
The cables are long enough, and it would make changing batteries a lot easier.
The only
problem is that the unit is designed to be mounted on the rod with the others, but there
should be a way round that.

Officially winter
Topic: gardening
Link here
The weather isn't as chilly as it has been, but there are warnings of more frosts.
Finally
got round to moving the
Mandevilla
into the greenhouse for winter.
I'll consider that a sign that winter is here.
It's still flowering happily.
It'll be interesting to see how it survives the winter.
In
previous years it only just survived.

Slowly in the garden
Topic: gardening
Link here
The weather hasn't been conducive to garden work lately, but there's plenty to be done.
Removed another hop rhizome, taking about an hour to do so.
It's tiring work, and there are
still another two to be done.
Put them off to some other time and attended to the overgrown bed that I last worked on
two weeks ago .
Spent yet more time trying to
remove the stump of the River Red Gum that we tried to remove
18 months ago .
Got through the lateral roots, but it's still firm as a
rock.
Looks like I'll have to cut down under it.
Also found yet more bulbs:
I had difficulty finding space for the ones I found two weeks ago, and I still don't know
what to do with these ones.
It's amusing to think that at the time I bought them, I was
concerned how few there were.

Slow progress in the garden
Topic: gardening
Link here
Somehow I'm not making much progress in the garden.
It's been windy lately, and I've had to
tie down the
Alyogyne huegelii ,
which has nearly been uprooted.
Did a bit of weeding—I really should be planting
things.

More garden progress
Topic: gardening
Link here
The weather's nicer again, and so more work in the garden.
Finally got all the bulbs
planted, both the ones I dug out the other day and the ones we bought at
Lambley Nursery
nearly a
month ago .
Most of them are in the garden area east of the verandah.
Also more
attention to the weeds in the north bed; there's some satisfaction in removing large
quantities of weeds, though there's no point unless I get out all the roots too.

Removing the Verbena
Topic: gardening
Link here
We've had our eye on removing
the
Aloysia citrodora
(Lemon
Verbena) for some time, but it's really more like moving: we don't want to get rid of the
plant altogether.
Last month
I took some
cuttings, and finally a couple are showing signs of taking, so today was the big day:
You can almost hear the
Camellia
behind
breath a sigh of relief.
The strike rate on the cuttings wasn't very high, so planted a few
more as well.

Garden flowers in late autumn
Topic: gardening
Link here
Took my monthly
garden flower photos
today.
It's clear that summer is over—in fact, autumn is nearly over—and
there aren't nearly as many flowers as last month.
Of those that are still looking happy,
the
Alstroemerias
and
the
Begonias
are particularly obvious:
Those are the volunteer Begonias; the expensive tuberous one still has a couple of flowers
on, but it's nothing to look at.
Flowers that seem to be really coming into their own now seem to be
the
Alyogyne ,
the
Dahlia imperialis
and the
unknown ginger sort that had been looking relatively unhappy
last month :
Some of the
Grevilleas
are still
flowering, and the
Hardenbergia
violacea
is just starting:
Some
Hebe
or another seems to flower most of
the time, though they're gradually dying back:
Some of the
Salvias
are also doing well,
the
Salvia microphylla
that we
have had here since the beginning, and
the
Salvia leucantha
that we
bought only
a couple of months ago :
Other things that are looking relatively happy are some of
the
Pelargoniums ,
the
Tradescantia
and the
Vinca minor :
In the greenhouse, this season's tomatoes are gradually dying back, though we still have
flowers, and some of the new ones are also flowering.
So is the lemon, and the creeper
cuttings that
Yvonne
brought back
from
Albury
seem not to
have noticed that they have been cut and replanted.
And
the
Mandevilla
is still flowering
happily:

Sourdough in Dereel
Topic: general, cooking, brewing, gardening
Link here
I started my next batch of
sourdough bread 	yesterday, and by chance somebody on
Freecycle
asked for a starter today.
Even more unusually, the person was
in
Dereel .
Sent a reply offering to show
them how I made the bread, but they didn't call back until I had started: it seems that
Freecycle has significant delays in sending messages.
The person in question turned out to be Peter Dilley, with whom I had spoken about brewing
last month .
He came by with his wife Victoria
and picked up the starter, lending me a couple of books while he was at it.
He also left
with one of the Pride of Ringwood hop rhizomes and a number of garden cuttings.
Had an
interesting discussion.
We're planning to do some cooperative brewing sessions.

Preparing for winter
Topic: gardening
Link here
Gradually the combination of cool weather and the winds of the past week have transformed
the garden, and it's looking quite wintery.
While looking around, discovered a plant that I
had thought was an
Iris .
It's
blooming for the first time, and it looks nothing like an Iris:
I thought it was one of the plants I bought at the
Melbourne
International Flower and Garden Show
two years ago, and indeed I have a photo of
something like that in my diary entry for the day:
Unfortunately, the description isn't in sequence with the photos: according to the
description the plant in question (second from right) would be
a
Sedum
“gold mound”, which it
most certainly isn't (the Sedum is in the middle).
I also know the
Liriope muscari
and
the
Sedum
“gold mound”, so that
only leaves the
Carex
morrowii
varieagata
and
the
Iris
japonica
variegata .
Clearly the suffix
variegata
fits.
On the face of it, it has to be the Iris, and
that would mean that I had just transposed the Iris and the Sedum, but it just doesn't look
right.
In any case, the plant was hidden under one of
the
Buddleja globosas .
The Buddlejas
later
proved to
be
Buddleja × weyeriana ,
not globosa.
I had intended to trim the whole hedge back in a month or so when it had finished flowering,
but clearly I couldn't wait that long.
Trimmed the end back, in the process discovering a
number of
Helleborus , which had also
been smothered by grass, and also another bulb of some description.
I'm going to have to be
stricter about how far I allow the Buddleja to grow.
Also a lot of weeding in front of the dining room (south-east of the verandah).
Found some
clump of roots which I vaguely recall planting, but which I think I thought had died, maybe
some kind of
Salix .
It doesn't look too
unhappy, though of course at this time of year it has no leaves.
One thing I notice, though: a lot of these plants aren't flowering.
The Japanese Iris (if
that's what it is) has produced dozens of offspring in the last 2 years, but this is the
first flower I've seen.
None of the other plants aren't flowering, and neither is
the
Canna -like plant near the birdbath.
As
far as I can tell, it has never flowered.
Am I being too miserly with fertilizer?
To be on
the safe side, spread some now, though clearly it's not much use to the Canna, which won't
flower before summer.
