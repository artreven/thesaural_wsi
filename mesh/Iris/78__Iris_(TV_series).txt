In April, Yoon Eun Hye was awarded the “Best Actress Award” under the “TV Drama Category” for the role as  Go Eun Chan  in  The 1st Shop of Coffee Prince  during the 44th  PaekSang Arts Awards . Yoon out beat veteran actresses  Kim Hee Ae  and Park Jin Hee, making her the youngest actress ever to win "Best Actress Award" at  PaekSang Arts Awards . Prior to this, Yoon also set the record as being the youngest actress ever to win “Best Actress Award” at  2006 Grime Awards  and “Top Excellence Actress Award” in  2007 MBC Drama Award .
After three years of absence from the  K-pop  scene, Yoon Eun Hye returned to her music roots in February, lending her vocals to the new  hip hop  group, Mighty Mouth. Yoon’s collaboration, titled "Saranghae" ( "사랑해" ,  I Love You ), received a lot of attention in the press and from netizens, and it topped various charts in South Korea.
In April 2008,  Premiere Elle  published a list of the "Top 100 Most Powerful and Influential People in The Korean Entertainment Industry", where Yoon Eun Hye was ranked 44th. Yoon was one of the only five actors (following behind  Bae Yong Joon ,  Rain ,  Jeon Do Yeon  and  Song Kang Ho ) ranked among the top 50, which was composed mainly of film directors and writers, CEOs or presidents of media stations and entertainment companies.
In October, Yoon Eun Hye was invited to the  Chanel  Contemporary Art Project — Mobile Art  in  New York , where she stood shoulder-to-shoulder with many of the world’s  supermodels  and  Hollywood stars. Yoon was the only representative from  Asia  invited to the event.
In September 2008, Yoon Eun Hye set up her own independent management company,  The House Company  after her contract with Kraze Entertainment expired. She led the founding of the company on her own, taking care of all the details from planning the company, designing of company logo to the interior of the company. Even though this is a “1-person Corporation”, Yoon has plans to groom new talents.

Lee Da-hae and her family moved to  Sydney, Australia , for five years, and she graduated from  Burwood Girls High School  before debuting as an actress in Korea. She now lives with her mother in  Seoul  while her father and brother still reside in Sydney, Australia. Besides acting, Lee Da Hae's other passion is traditional Korean dance. She has performed many times in front of small audiences in Australia.
In 2008, following  Yoon Eun Hye ’s signing event for Zipel refrigerator, Samsung continues to hold another signing event for those who buy Kimchi Hauzen freezer. She was also later cast in the 2008 hit action drama  East of Eden  along side  Yun Jung Hoon  and  Song Seung Hun . Not much later Lee went to the emergency room. She had collapsed because her busy schedule along with her excessive workouts at the gym resulted in severe fatigue.But Lee Da Hae had shockingly announced her departure from the drama due to health reasons and decided to leave in Episode 40, which was aired January 14. Lee's character, Min Hye Rin, will embark for overseas studies in America, effectively marking the exit of Lee Da Hae in a natural manner and was eventually replaced by  Hwang Jung Eum .
In 2009, Lee Da Hae accomplished a number of things. She went on vacation with her mother in January, moved to  J. Tune Entertainment  where she worked under the same roof with  Rain  and modelled for Swarovski Spring/Summer Collection. She also filmed the scandalous love-themed music video "Dance For Two" with Taiwanese singer, rapper, actor,  Wilber Pan .
Lee Da Hae is set to make her film debut in a 3D Korean movie titled 'Song of Spring', she will star alongside Lee Sung Jae and Ahn Sung Ki. She plays the role of the female lead named Ara, a dancer.

So Ye Jin ♥

Son Ye-jin has taken on a variety of roles in her career to date, propelling her to fame both in Korea and in other Asian countries. She first appeared in a supporting role in Park Ki-hyung's film  Secret Tears  in 2000, and then went on to take the lead in TV dramas such as  Delicious Proposal ,  Sun-hee and Jin-hee , and  Daemang: Great Ambition . Her first high-profile role in cinema was in  Im Kwon-taek 's  Chi-hwa-seon , which screened at  Cannes  and took home a Best Director  award in 2002.
The biggest success of her early career was in the subsequent films  Lovers' Concerto  and  The Classic . Both were solid mid-level hits in Korea, and  The Classic  in particular—being a work of  My Sassy Girl  director  Kwak Jae-yong  -- received wide exposure in countries such as Hong Kong and China.
Son further solidified her status as a "hallyu" ( Korean wave ) star in 2003 by taking the lead in TV drama  Summer Scent , a part of the hugely successful series of TV dramas including  Autumn Love Story  and  Winter Sonata  (though this drama would not attract the attention of the previous two). Her next two films also proved to be huge hits in Asia:  A Moment to Remember , based on a famous Japanese TV series, set box office records in Japan and sold over two million tickets in Korea, while  April Snow  in which she co-starred with superstar  Bae Yong-joon  was also a smash hit in Japan and China (though not, incidentally, in Korea).
Son's most recent work sees her cast off her nice girl image. She took on the roles of a  con artist  in  The Art of Seduction , an ambitious reporter in  Spotlight , a  femme fatale  in  Open City , and a divorcée in the critically acclaimed 2006 TV drama  Alone in Love  opposite  Gam Woo-sung . In 2008, her portrayal of a  polyandrous  woman in  My Wife Got Married  bagged her Best Actress honors from the prestigious  Blue Dragon Film Awards  and other local award-giving bodies.
After filming the dark mystery  White Night , Son wanted to do a more fun project, so she chose the romantic comedy  Personal Taste , followed by the supernatural love story  Spellbound  (Korean title: Chilling Romance ). She next stars in her first blockbuster action flick,  Tower , a remake of the 1974 Hollywood film  The Towering Inferno .

Lee Young Ae ♥

Lee made her debut as a TV model in 1991. After appearing in TV commercials, she started playing in TV dramas and movies.
Her popularity has grown in an exponential manner due to her performance in the popular Korean drama  Dae Jang Geum . After the successful broadcast in Korea, it was then shown oversea the first time in 2004 and won many hearts of audience in Taiwan. In 2005, nearly half of the Hong Kong population watched the final episode of the drama. In China, hundreds of million viewers watched the drama though it was shown late at night.
She was awarded Best Actress awards in the  Blue Dragon Film Awards  in 2005 and Baeksang Art Awards in 2006 for the film  Sympathy For Lady Vengeance .
Because of the success, Lee Young-Ae has been invited to visit Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, China and Japan. The first time in 12 years,  NHK  had to use NHK Hall to host the  NHK show (2006) . She was invited to the 2007  Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival  in China as an Image Ambassador. [4]
Beside her acting career, she has also been involved in several charity events. In 1997 she went to Ethiopia as a  NGO  Goodwill Ambassador. She went to Thar Desert in 1999 doing a  TV show  of the  lowest caste  people in India. Later in 2001, she published these experiences in her autobiography “A Most Special Love” and donated all the income from the sale of the book to charity.
She was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador in 2004 by  UNICEF  and held several charity functions from that time on. She made many donations to schools and hospitals, which include an elementary school in China such that the school was renamed Lee Young-Ae Elementary School , and the Chosun First Middle School in Harbin.
From her 2006 autobiography “Young-Ae’s Vow”, she talked about how she became an actress. She recalled what made her go into show business was working with  Andy Lau  in a 1991 chocolate advertisement. In 1995, she made a decision to go to graduate school to learn theory of acting. Since then, she has not changed to challenge various kinds of acting roles, like that in  Dae Jang Geum  and later a very different role in  Sympathy For Lady Vengeance .
In 2007, she received Medal of Culture Merit for her contribution to Korean Wave from the South Korean government.
Her major contract in 2006 and 2007 is with  LG Corp. , a large South Korean conglomerate. She became the spokesmodel (Pan-Asia) for all  LG Electronics ' products.

10:59 PM
Kim began her career in entertainment as a model and in television commercials. She rose to stardom via her portrayal of Han Yoori, the evil stepsister in the popular  SBS  TV series  Stairway to Heaven . [6] [7]  Her other TV projects include the supernatural  KBS  series  Forbidden Love  and the SBS campus romance  Love Story in Harvard . Both series were successful. For her performance in  Forbidden Love , she was honored with the Best Female Newcomer award.
Kim then turned to film, starring in  The Restless  with  Jung Woo-sung  and the romantic comedy  Venus and Mars  with  Sol Kyung-gu .
In 2009, she returned to drama in the espionage action thriller  Iris  with  Lee Byung-hun . It was one of the most expensive dramas ever produced and was a critical and commercial success with an average rating of 30%. [8] [9]  It was the top rated program every week after its debut. She also starred in the film Grand Prix  opposite  Yang Dong-geun  where she portrays a horse jockey who dreams of winning the Grand Prix championship.
After the success of  Iris , she played the lead in the MBC romantic comedy  My Princess  alongside  Song Seung-heon .  My Princess  began airing on January 5, 2011. Her character was Lee Seol, an ordinary college student who discovers that she is a princess.
She will also star in her first Japanese drama  Boku to Star no 99 Nichi  with Japanese actor  Nishijima Hidetoshi . It will be a light romantic comedy, with Kim Tae Hee playing the role of ‘Han Yuna‘, a big South Korean star. One day she happens to run into an ordinary, and pretty boring, 40-year-old man called ‘Namiki Kouhei‘ (Nishijima), who somehow makes her fall head over heels in love with him. [10]

She majored in performing arts at  Dongguk University .
Critics have praised her work in the television drama,  Delightful Girl Choon-Hyang , which is a present-day version of the historical story,  Chunhyang .

She also appeared in commercials and advertisements, notably for Korean cosmetics company Cathy Cat. In addition, she released two solo albums.  My True Style , her first album, has sold nearly 65,000 records and had one hit ballad, "The Best". Her second album  810303  sold a disappointing 19,000 copies. Although sales were low, Eugene still had a very successful single with "Windy", mostly due to her new "sexy" image (compared to her previous  girl next door  image). This song was performed on all the music video programs in Korea for many months, in addition to her second single. Promotions were stopped near the end of the year.
Eugene made her theater debut in the musical adaptation of the film  Innocent Steps   and her film debut in  Unstoppable Marriage .
After taking on the lead roles in the dramas  One Mom and Three Dads  and  Creating Destiny , Eugene starred in the massive hit  King of Baking, Kim Tak Goo .
In 2007 Eugene took over from  Lee Hyori  as one of the co-hosts of the  KBS  variety show  Happy Together Friends , until the show was overhauled for a third season. After the success of her previous program  Eugene’s Makeup Diary , cable style network O'live again chose her as the host of new show  Get It Beauty  which began airing in July 2010.
Eugene has authored two books:  Eugene's Beauty Secrets [6]  and  Eugene's Get It Beauty .
She is co-president of the clothing brand byMOMO.

Ku entered the entertainment industry after gaining popularity on the internet as an  ulzzang . She soon rose to fame in the drama  Pure in Heart  and surprised critics with her performance in the historical drama  The King and I . Ku is most well known for portraying Geum Jan-di in the hit  KBS  drama  Boys Over Flowers . After a year in limbo with no broadcasting slot, her pre-produced drama  The Musical  finally aired in September 2011.Ku will next star in the  Taiwanese drama adaptation  of the  manga   Absolute Boyfriend  and is currently filming for the upcoming  SBS  series  Take Care of Us, Captain .
Originally set to debut as a singer (supposedly in a 3-member girl group with  2NE1 's  Park Bom  and  Sandara Park ),  YG Entertainment  CEO  Yang Hyun-seok  advised Ku to pursue acting rather than music. In recent years, she has displayed her vocal talents through  Saranga  (which became the title song of Pure in Heart ), a cover of Shim Soo-bong's  I Don't Know Anything But Love  (which played during a crucial scene in  Boys Over Flowers ), and a duet of  Kim Gun Mo 's song  Rain Falls on a Sleepless Night  with  Big Bang  member  Seungri  on the music  talk show   Lee Hana 's Peppermint . Ku has also composed an album of  New Age music  titled  Breath .
Ku wrote  Tango , a semi-autobiographical novel about a twenty-something woman's experience with love and relationships. The book was a bestseller, selling 30,000 copies within a week. Its release coincided with her first solo art exhibition, also titled  Tango , in July 2009 at La Mer Gallery, which attracted 10,000 visitors. The exhibition featured around 40 of Ku's illustrations, some from her novel. She has also done artwork for  Gummy 's fourth album Comfort .
Ku made her official debut as a director through her  short film   The Madonna  (Korean title translates to  The Cheerful Caretaker ) at the 2009  Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival . She has since written and directed her first feature-length film  Magic , and her second film  The Peach Tree premiered at the 2011  Busan International Film Festival .
In 2011 Ku established her own company, Ku Hye-sun Film, and she will produce and film her projects under its name, which will offer her a measure of legal/business protection.
