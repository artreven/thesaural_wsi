When former Transmuto websites Transbuddha and
RazorFine Review
went silent in the Spring of 2010 the Internet found a new home for awesome. You can now find more regular crazed awesomeness at
dadsbigplan , and more current and past reviews at
RazorFine
(which is slowly being rebuilt). Or, if you're in the mood, you can find a little extra random Xplosion of Awesome from the mind of a rabbit super-hero here on a semi-irregular basis.

The Flash #9
Writer and artist
Francis Manapul
(along with co-writer
Brian Buccellato ) gives us
the Flash
vs.
Gorilla Grodd , Round One. Honestly, given the early teases we'd seen of the
New 52
versions of Grodd and
Gorilla City
this was better than I expected. I'm not sure I like the change from Gorilla City from an advanced scientific race of apes into a more magical religious group but this certainly wasn't the total disaster which I feared. The Flash shows up in Gorilla City at a loss as to how he arrived there and who he is and learns from a group of elder Gorillas that the secret tribe worship the Lightning (the
Speed Force ) and the prophesied appearance of
the Runner
(the Flash). Although awkward in places, the comic picks up after the Flash regains his memory and puts down Grodd's rule and plans of world conquest. The issue has several important small plotlines including
Iris
still stuck in limbo, the
Pied Piper
deciding to come out of retirement when Central City is left without a hero,
Dr. Elias
mounting a protest against the scarlet speedster, and a teaser for the introduction of another of
the Flash's Rogues
next month - the
Weather Wizard . Worth a look. [DC, $2.99]
