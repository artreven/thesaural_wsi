Autumn with a vengeance
Topic: gardening
Link here
The mild autumn weather stopped abruptly with the change of month:
That was coupled with rain, so did almost nothing in the garden.
Hopefully I'll find time
to regain the momentum of the last few days.
Refining panorama processing
Topic: photography, technology, opinion
Link here
Yesterday's panorama photo of the verandah wasn't quite as good as usual; I suspect that
hugin
chose some inappropriate
control points.
It's surprising how different the automatic control points are from the
ones I would have chosen.
Normally I would have refined it, but I had other experiments in
store.
In particular, lens distortion must be an issue in the matter, and I can compensate for that
with
DxO Optics
"Pro" .
In addition, there are possibilities to do
the
HDR
processing
directly with
hugin , and I could do all the processing in 16 bit mode.
Started by creating some
JPEGs
of the
images:
DxO `grep verandah-centre makejpeg | sed 's: .*::; s:JPG:ORF:'`
makejpeg
is the file that I create with a mapping between camera image name
(first the camera name, then my own).
DxO
is a script that then links them
to a new, empty directory and allows me to start the DxO application against it.
That wasn't enough, though: DxO insists on remembering the previous things I have done.
They're
done , dammit!
But after I processed the JPEGs, I was confronted with
(partial window):
Image title: DxO 1

Now I would have had to choose every second image, 72 times.
What a pain!
Moving the JPEG
images out of the directory didn't help; DxO knows better.
Still, I was able to change to a different directory ( click ) and back again
( click ), and the images were no longer there.
But
I still wasn't out of the woods.
DxO claimed that the images had already been processed,
and refused to do it again:

Finally I deleted all “projects”, in the process also deleting any other
settings.
It seems that there's an easier way: select “New Project”, not from
the “Project” tab (that would be too easy) but from the “File” tab.
But that probably means that it will accumulate lots of useless cruft in some unexpected
place.
Then moved on to
hugin .
The panorama consists of two rows of 12 views each
(spaced at 30°), and each view consists of 3 images bracketed
1
EV
apart, a total of 72 images.
My current technique is to merge the images for each view
using
align_image_stack
and
enfuse ,
but
hugin
has its own HDR functionality, so tried it directly, rather
stupidly with the
TIFFs
(total size a little
over 5 GB).
That sort of worked, though the preview image looked funny:

Went off to do something else.
Came back and found:
May  1 17:18:54 dereel kernel: pid 51513 (hugin), uid 1001: exited on signal 6 (core dumped)
The last thing I want to do is analyze that, so tried again with JPEG.
This time it started
stitching, but there was still no joy:
Loading next image: 00-710017.tif
Creating blend mask: 1/6 2/6 3/6 4/6 5/6 6/6
Optimizing 0 distinct seams.
Strategy 2:
enblend: an exception occured
Mask is entirely black, but white image was not identified as redundant.
gmake: *** [00-71.tif] Error 1
Looking at that output, it was at image 17 of 72.
I've seen this kind of message before,
and I suspect that it relates to the dynamic range in some strange manner.
But for the
moment, this approach seems to be a dead end.

Panoramas with images processed by DxO
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
My previous attempts at
making
HDR
panoramas
were less than successful, but they didn't really have anything to do with
DxO Optics "Pro" .
Today
tried the old method, up to a point: my way of creating HDR images wasn't very portable, so
first updated the
HDR
script to optionally group the images
into a specific number of images of the same view, allowing me to create multiple HDR mapped
images from a list of arbitrary names.
Did that, and got worthwhile results.
Here the verandah panorama from the weekend, and then
the one done today.
They look pretty much the same until you look at the details.
The new
one is still not perfect, but the discontinuities are considerably less.
The dynamics are
also better in the second (DxO) image, as the mouseover comparison of the first image shows:

There's still more to do, notably playing around with 16 bit intermediate images.
But it's
slow, and it uses amazing amounts of memory.
More garden progress

The weather's better again, and both of us out into the garden.
One good thing about lots
of weeds is that when you take pull them out, you have something to show for it.

Under the weather
Topic: general, gardening

The weather is cool and moist again, and for some reason I didn't feel very well.
Had
planned to go into town today, but cancelled that and stayed at home watching TV instead.
The moisture was enough that I didn't do more than a little token pottering in the garden.
Panoramas made with TIFF images
Topic: photography, technology

More work on panoramas today.
As planned, tried making the verandah panorama
from
TIFFs
images instead of
from
JPEGs .
The results were surprising:

Moving the cursor over the image switches from the JPEG-based panorama (cursor off) to
TIFF-based one (cursor on).
I can't see any difference apart from a slight difference in
framing.
hugin
reports two
values for control point alignment, the mean error and the maximum, both in pixels.
They
were:

max
error

Out-of-camera
2.3
84.6
DxO JPEG
2.1
7.0
DxO TIFF
2.7
14.3
That's surprising, to be investigated yet further.
I'm assuming that the maximum error with
the out-of-camera images was due to distortion, but why should the results with TIFF be
worse than the results with JPEG?
I'd assume that the image geometry is the same.
Maybe it
has something to do with the strange way
hugin
chooses control points.

Time for new hardware
Topic: technology
Link here
Recently, while processing some photos, discovered some processes were crashing.
Looking
at
top
showed me:
Mem: 2280M Active, 203M Inact, 370M Wired, 85M Cache, 112M Buf, 49M Free
Swap: 3072M Total, 3063M Used, 9412K Free, 99% Inuse, 2372K In, 1012K Out
That's telling me that, in addition to 3 GB of main memory (the maximum my i386 machine can
address), I'm using another 3 GB of swap and running out, and I'm also paging heavily.
I
clearly need more memory, but the only way I can use it is to migrate to amd64.
That's as
simple as installing a 64 bit version of
FreeBSD , so I'll probably do it.
Did some investigation and discovered, to my surprise, that my current machine is 2½ years
old, and since then people have moved
from
DDR2
to
DDR3
memory, which of course is cheaper.
Considered the alternative of replacing the machine, but it's more money than I want to
spend right now, so it looks like I'll buy another 2 2 GB DIMMs and replace one of the 1 GB
DIMMs, giving me a total of 6 GB—still not as much as I would like.
But what memory speed?
When I bought the
hardware , I went through a lot of trouble investigating, but unfortunately I didn't
write everything down.
So went to the
AMD
web
site to see what they recommended—and found nothing!
The only references were very
superficial specifications.
There used to be much more, and it's probably still there, but
there are no links, and nothing I can find on
Google
helped.
Finally Daniel O'Connor found a
document 	on
Gigabyte 's Russian mirror, but that just
gave a list of memory chips that had been tested with my motherboard.
About the only
indication is that the motherboard only handles one DDR2 1067 DIMM per channel, and mine are
all the same.
In the end gave up and relied on memory: I think it's DDR2 800.
Why are
these things so difficult to find?
DxO improves your image
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
While working on some old photos, found the collection for my
60th birthday party
(coincidentally about the
same time I built the “new” machine).
They didn't look too good, and on
investigation it seems that I had taken them only in raw format and converted
to
JPEG
with
ufraw .
At the time I had had some problems
with those conversions, and so it seemed a perfect example to use
DxO Optics "Pro"
on.
Ran through that, taking over an hour again, and somehow ending up
with
TIFF
output—one of the settings I
gave stuck, and I forget how to reset it.
I wish these packages would only save settings
when you ask them to.
Spent some time running cursors over illegible icons, only to
discover that the description popped up under the cursor arrow (something that I can't
capture from the screen).
Finally got the images, and... I couldn't see much difference
between the images.
On the other hand, I've already seen how difficult it is to compare different renditions of
the same image, even when they're side by side.
That's why I developed the mouseover
compare technique, where you can swap the images in place.
Cursor over the following image
shows the old one ( ufraw ), cursor off shows the new one (DxO):

Now it's clear that DxO shows a great improvement.
It looks as if it's worthwhile after
all.
If only it wasn't so emetic to use.

It's cool again, and I didn't feel like doing much, but
Yvonne
wanted to get rid of the dead hops, so out to lend her moral support.
When we installed
the original wooden beds in the eastern garden about 3 years ago, we planted some
spring-flowering
bulbs— Narcissus , I
think—in one of them.
After removing all the weeds, I found them still there, and

Panoramas with DxO
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
Photo day again today.
The first Saturday of the month is special, since I take a few more
photos than normal, and managed to just about completely fill up an 8 GB memory card.
Decided to process the raw images with
DxO Optics "Pro" , and
after fighting my way through the windows, was presented with the information that the
conversion (415 images) would take 6 hours, 20 minutes.
Let that run and tried stitching them together from
the
JPEGs , intending to catch up with the
real images later.
That proved to be more work than I wanted, since many of them required
masking.
I need to look at the bleeding edge version of
hugin
to see whether they've fixed the mask
handling.
Currently it's painful.
Wouldn't it be nice to have a mask that you could invert
and apply to another image, so that you could put an image together exactly out of two
partial images taken from the same position.
As it is, I found it a little easier to take a
screen shot of the mask on the first image of a pair
with
xv , and use that to set
the second mask.
Still not what you'd call computer-assisted.
That got to be enough work that I gave it up and waited for the DxO run to finish.
I think
I'm going to have to do this in batches, one photo at a time, so DxO can do its thing in the
background while I process the ones it has finished.
Started doing that and found that the
treatment of
EXIF
data is very irritating:
it doesn't keep them, and when I
use
exiftool
it doesn't seem to
copy the
Maker Notes ,
so I don't get the crop factor in the data, and I have to enter it manually.
I think I'll
fake something when copying the data.
That wasn't the only problem: I ran out of swap, and X crashed Yet Again.
In the end had to
give up with only a couple of panoramas completed.
Next week should be less of a stress.

Bleeding edge Hugin
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
Continued with my panorama processing today, and it took me until midday to complete—a
day later than normal.
This mask processing adds a lot to the time, as of course does
DxO Optics "Pro" .
Clearly time to investigate the development version of
hugin .
That's in a
Mercurial
repository, and it was relatively
straightforward to get a clone.
Building was another matter.
It uses
cmake , a program with which I haven't been able to
make friends, and according to the somewhat confusingly named instruction
file
INSTALL_cmake , building is as simple as
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local .
make
make install
That didn't even get started: it couldn't find
wxWidgets :
CMake Error at /usr/local/share/cmake/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:91 (MESSAGE):
Could NOT find wxWidgets (missing: wxWidgets_FOUND)
Call Stack (most recent call first):
/usr/local/share/cmake/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:252 (_FPHSA_FAILURE_MESSAGE)
/usr/local/share/cmake/Modules/FindwxWidgets.cmake:831 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
CMakeLists.txt:154 (FIND_PACKAGE)
Neither could I.
You'd think that you'd have a port called
wxWidgets
or some such,
but the closest I came was
/usr/ports/x11-toolkits/p5-Alien-wxWidgets .
But
then I found, in
/usr/ports/graphics/hugin/Makefile
(the real
hugin
port):
CMAKE_ARGS=	-DwxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=${WX_CONFIG}
Clearly there's some magic there.
Added a target to the
Makefile
to print
out
CMAKE_ARGS , and was surprised to find:
cmake -DwxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/wxgtk2u-2.8-config -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:STRING=cc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:STRING=c++ -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING=-O2 -pipe  -fno-strict-aliasing -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-O2 -pipe -fno-strict-aliasing  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DTHREADS_HAVE_PTHREAD_ARG:BOOL=YES -DCMAKE_THREAD_LIBS:STRING=-pthread -DCMAKE_USE_PTHREADS:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING=-pthread -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON .
That failed too, for more normal reasons: it wanted a newer version
of
libpano13
than I had installed.
Mañana.

Backup strategies for photos
Topic: photography, technology, opinion
Link here
Mail from Michael Hughes today, asking how I back up photos.
That's certainly an
interesting topic.
Digital technology has made many things easier than before, but it's
also easier to completely lose images.
Paradoxically, it's also easier to keep multiple
backups, and that's what both Michael and I do.
I've been backing up my computer for ever, of course.
In the days
of
CP/M
and
MS-DOS
I used floppies. They were
slow, expensive and unreliable.
Later I used tape,
both
QIC
and some strange format that I now
forget.
It was slow, expensive and unreliable.
About 18 years ago I moved
to
DDS
storage, which proved
to be a little faster, have a little more capacity, but it was still expensive and
unreliable.
I also briefly used
a
DLT
tape drive, but it was
an older model, and tapes were so expensive that I never tested the reliability.
In the end, I gave up on tape altogether, and for nearly 9 years now I have been backing up
to disk.
The difference is surprising:
from the
outset
I noticed an increase in speed, and it was clear that they were cheaper: at the
time an 80 GB disk drive cost about as much as a 40 GB tape cartridge.
They've also proven
to be
much
more reliable—I can't recall a single loss of backup disk, though
clearly that's possible.
In that time, though, disk capacity has increased markedly.
My total disk capacity at the
time was about 80 GB.
Now I have:
Filesystem  1048576-blocks    Used  Avail Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/ad4s1d           9916    7796   1326    85%    /
/dev/ad4s1a           9916    7647   1475    84%    /destdir
/dev/ad4s1e         439117  129710 274277    32%    /home
/dev/ad6s1a         923856  735787 114160    87%    /Photos
/dev/ad8s1d         923856  313848 536099    37%    /src
/dev/ad1s1d         236579  232739   1473    99%    /dump
total              2543241 1427530 928812    61%
Those values are in MB, so I have a total of 2.5 TB of disk space, of which about 1.4 TB are
in use.
But looking more carefully, 230 GB are on
/dump , clearly a backup
disk (for other systems on the network), and 735 GB are on
/Photos , not
surprisingly my photo disk.
/destdir
is a second root file system, which I
only use when I'm upgrading, so it doesn't need backup either.
I'm left with a much more
manageable:
Filesystem  1048576-blocks   Used  Avail Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/ad4s1d           9916   7796   1326    85%    /
/dev/ad4s1e         439117 129710 274277    32%    /home
/dev/ad8s1d         923856 313848 536099    37%    /src
total              1372889 451355 811703    36%
I used to back these file systems up to other systems on the net, but lately I've been using
a USB drive directly connected to the system.
I'm not sure I'm completely happy with that,
but for the time being it seems to work.
I dump the the root file system and
make
tar
backups of
individual file systems on
/home
and
/src .
The reason for
the difference is due to the size of the file systems: a complete dump
of
/src
would be about 200 GB in size after compression, and restoring files
from an archive of that size takes forever.
On the first day of each month I do a complete backup, on Saturdays I do a level 1 dump and
tar backups since the beginning of the month, and on other days I do level 2 dumps and
backups since the previous level 1 or level 0 dump.
I keep two level 0 dumps (beginning of
this month and beginning of last month) That works well, and I get by with about a total of
500 GB.
Photos are a different matter.
They're as good as not compressible (though some of the
smaller accompanying files are), so there's no point wasting time with a compressed dump.
But that leaves me with (currently) nearly 1 TB of backup.
That's different enough to take
a different approach.
Since compression doesn't have much effect, I keep duplicate file
systems and use
rsync
to keep
them synchronized with the online file system.
I have two disks, one of which is always at
Chris Yeardley's place.
On Sundays or Mondays I swap the disks, so that the one at Chris'
place is up to a week out of date, but since I take most of my photos at the weekend, that's
not a big issue.
That way I have a total of four copies of most photos: the one on my disk,
the one on the external web site, and the two backup copies.
Once I have at least one
backup copy of the images, I erase the flash cards in my cameras.
Michael does a number of things differently.
He backs up DLT, and he keeps no less than 5
backup copies.
That would become very expensive with my amount of data.
I haven't looked
at tapes for nearly 10 years now, but it seems that the highest capacity DLT tape is DLT-S4,
with 800 GB.
They call it “800 GB/1.6 TB”, but the latter value is an estimate
after compression, and that won't work for compressed images
like
JPEG
and raw images.
These tape
cartridges are available on
eBay
for $140
each.
By comparison, you can get 2 TB external disk drives from about $110.
He also keeps CRC signatures for each file on disk and regularly checks them for any
corruption.
That's certainly worth thinking about, though it's a lot of work for any
reasonable data volume.
A rose arch
Topic: gardening
Link here
On the way home, stopped off
in
Napoleons
to take a look at an arch
for training roses that
Yvonne
had seen at the roadside plant
sales yesterday.
We've been thinking about that for some time, and the price ($30) was
right, so I took it.
But how?
It was too wide to fit in the boot of the car, and I couldn't dismantle it.
It
originally came in 3 pieces which were screwed together, but of course the screws had seized
up.
In the end, stuck it sideways in the back window and drove home, very slowly:

First frost of winter
Topic: general, gardening
Link here
It's been
really
cool lately:
The lowest temperature measured by the weather station was 0.7°, and the highest was 13.6°,
but it lies.
We had a frost, and even inside the greenhouse, the temperature at the top
dropped to -0.1°.
That caught me by surprise: I had wanted to put
the
Mandevilla
in the greenhouse
before any frost, but fortunately it seems the frost wasn't heavy enough to affect most of
the garden, just some of
the
Tropaeolums .
I had thought that
that would have been the earliest in the year we've ever had a frost, but I see that two
years ago we had not one but two
in April , and
the lowest temperature I ever recorded with the weather station was on
22 May 2010 .
So why didn't the weather station report a lower temperature?
Presumably because it's an
inversion, and the temperature sensor was mounted too high.
I need to move it further down.
The cables are long enough, and it would make changing batteries a lot easier.
The only
problem is that the unit is designed to be mounted on the rod with the others, but there
should be a way round that.
DxO and Olympus "Viewer 2"
Topic: photography, technology, opinion
Link here
Coincidentally to my investigation of
DxO Optics "Pro" , I found
an article about raw converters in the
c't
special
Digitale Fotografie 02/2011 .
This is a different article from
the one
I mentioned
last month , and it pays more attention to the kind of operations you'd
expect from a raw converter, notably correction for lens aberrations.
It seems that there
aren't many converters that do this kind of correction, but the article mentions that the
Olympus converter (not tested) is one of them.
I've used it before and have been
impressed—negatively—but it's becoming clear that all photo processing software
has significant issues.
Went looking and after considerable searching on the
Olympus web site
found a reference to
Olympus Master 2
as an “accessory” for the E series cameras.
Was that
the free one or the one they wanted money for?
The other one was called
“Studio”, and the names are so meaningless that I can't recall which is which.
All I could find was that it was no longer available for download, and that I should
download
Olympus
Viewer 2
instead.
There's a name that means something, and it's clear that it's not
what I want: I want to convert, not view.
But that's what it does!
It seems to be a replacement for both “Master” and
“Studio”, and it's free (as it should be), though I had to enter the serial
number of my camera to download it.
That's easy: it's in
the
EXIF
data of every photo.
But why?
Who
would download the software if they didn't have Olympus images to convert?
On the positive side, they seem to have improved things a lot.
Last time
it drove me mad.
Now it just irritates me.
They've made
it look more like all other commercially available software, white on anthracite text and
all, with a directory tree on the left to make you search instead of allowing you to just
enter the directory name:

This one had an additional trick up its sleeve, though: I couldn't slide the tiny scroll bar
down to the directory I wanted.
I tried 3 times, and in each case, shortly before I got to
the bottom, the display popped up to the top again.
I don't know whether I accidentally got
off the scroll bar, or whether the software didn't expect that many directories—I
suspect the later.
Got round that problem by creating a
directory
00-is-what-Oly-Viewer-is-worth
(highlighted), into which I was
able to link the images I wanted, in much the same way as I have worked around the
“features” of
hugin 	and DxO.
I had an immediate test case.
In one of the photos I took of the panorama bracket, the
left-hand flash unit didn't fire.
That's a known problem: it's a slave unit, and the
modelling light interferes with the receptor.
Normally I turn the modelling light out, but
this time I forgot.
So clearly a case for raw conversion.
Tried first with DxO, which was glacially slow.
Finally got a result that looked relatively
good, but it was also brighter than the others I had taken.
Here the uncorrected image, the
corrected image, and the one it's supposed to resemble:

It was so painful adjusting with DxO that I gave up at this point.
Started playing around
with “Viewer 2”, but there are lots of things I needed to understand better.
At
least it's fast enough to be usable, and yes, it applies lens-specific corrections,
presumably only for Olympus lenses, but with the exception of the old Macro-Takumar, that's
all I use.
More experimentation needed, but I suspect that when the free trial runs out, I
won't buy DxO.

eBay: Make it even more painful
Topic: technology, opinion
Link here
As a result of the camera purchases, I was involved in
eBay 's horrible messaging system much more than I would
have liked.
I got mail messages (in eBay's barely legible format) from two of the vendors
and sent them replies.
eBay refused one of them:
Oops. We weren't able to send your message to some-vendor, because the email address you used to send this message, gurgle@lmeis.com, isn't linked to your eBay account.
To keep eBay safe, we need you to send messages from a registered eBay email address. This will prevent your messages from being blocked in the future. This is easy enough to fix, just do one of the following:
Set up gurgle@lmeis.com as an additional email address for sending messages. To do this:
In My eBay, click the "Account" tab and then click "Communication Preferences" in the drop-down menu.
In the section titled "Delivery Options", click the "Show" link next to "Notification Delivery Format".
Enter the same email address to send member-to-member messages.
Click Save.
Change your registered eBay email address to gurgle@lmeis.com. Go to
http://pages.ebay.com/help/account/updating-registration-information.html
to learn how.
Send your messages from groggedup@lmeis.com. This is the email address you already have registered with eBay.
For assistance, you can contact eBay Customer Support at:
http://pages.ebay.com/help/contact_us/_base/index_selection.htm
OK, the intention is good, but which message?
No
Message-Id: , no content.
I had
to go back and check, and discovered that the address in question had
been
sa-member@ebay.com.au
(not the name above), while the other one had been to a
gmail
address.
So off to follow the
instructions.
They were wrong.
You can't add additional email addresses, only change
them.
To be sure, I followed some kind of help link on the left and was redirected to an
error page.
Unfortunately, I don't know which; later the link was no longer there.
I
sometimes get the feeling that eBay tests their software on their customers.
You'd think
that they would have their act together by now.

More raw conversion comparisons
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
I still haven't got my head (or my stomach) around
Olympus
Viewer 2 , but I do need to do some more comparisons before my test license for
DxO Optics "Pro"
runs out.
In particular, I haven't done any comparison of lens distortion yet.
I know
from past experience that my
Zuiko Digital ED
12-60mm F2.8-4.0 SWD , otherwise an excellent lens, has severe barrel distortion at
full wide-angle and close up.
Here's an example, taken about 20 cm from an A4-sized test

Running the cursor over the image shows what DxO makes of it:
much
better.
It's also
better at longer focal lengths (also meaning further away, of course).
Here it is at 60 mm
focal length (left), still not as good as the
Zuiko Digital ED 50mm F2.0
Macro
(right).
It's clear that I'm right to use the macro lens for any close-up work.

But the images themselves, taken with on-camera flash, are terrible.
I need to take better
images and then compare them with Olympus.
In the process, had to load a number of DxO “modules”.
It proves to be very
simplistic about that; it can't download the modules directly when it finds they're needed.
At the very least you need to abort the processing, and then there was some way to get it to
load the ones it wants, but it didn't show today.
So I tried loading all 8 combinations: 4
lenses for two cameras.
I already had 3 of them, but that didn't stop it loading all 8
anyway.
They're quite big—I think I loaded about 120 MB in total.

Olympus Viewer 2
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
As planned, did some playing around with
Olympus
Viewer 2
today.
It's amazing how much reading I need to do for any of this stuff.
Somehow the whole approach is different.
I won't complain about the file name selection any more; all commercial software has that
problem.
But according to the help (which only showed up when I downloaded a 12 month old
update—why didn't I get that version from the web site?), I need to process every
image individually.
Maybe that's what they mean by this silly word
“develop”—they're still thinking in terms of darkrooms and chemicals.
It's possible that I'll find a way to apply the corrections to a set of images, but it's not
the way they present it, and I haven't found one yet.
The conversions themselves?
I didn't do many, and I haven't got round to doing the
presentation yet.
But it certainly does a good job with automatic correction of lens
distortion, notably the close-up with the
Zuiko Digital ED
12-60mm F2.8-4.0 SWD
at full wide-angle.
Strangely, though, it didn't do an automatic
correction of the chromatic aberration.
If I really have to do that manually every time, I
don't think I'll bother.
But I'm not done yet.
This takes an amazing amount of time to investigate.
Web browser crashes: state of the art?

Over the last couple of days I've noticed a surprising number of segmentation violations on

USB reliability
Topic: technology
Link here
Received a 5 m USB extension cable in the post today.
That's just what I need to connect my
3G modem to
dereel , my main machine: the antenna cable is too short, and an extension
would weaken the signal still further, so it made sense to use a digital connection.
Things worked out of the box: disconnect the modem on the
cojones , the other machine,
connect to
dereel
via extension cable, and start PPP again.
It worked so well that
my TCP connections didn't even drop!
Well, for a while.
Then I discovered:
May 17 13:03:10 dereel kernel: ugen5.2: <HUAWEI Technology> at usbus5 (disconnected)
May 17 13:03:10 dereel kernel: u3g0: at uhub5, port 4, addr 2 (disconnected)

May 17 13:03:20 dereel kernel: u3g0: <HUAWEI Technology HUAWEI Mobile, class 0/0, rev 2.00/0.00, addr 2> on usbus5
There were many more.
The device had gone away and come back.
The PPP connection survived,
at least this time.
But it happened again and again in the course of the afternoon, and my
network link statistics page
shows 4 dropouts, one of
which lasted nearly an hour: on that occasion the device didn't come back, and I had to
manually remove and replace the device.
What's causing it?
I've had USB issues on
dereel
before, and when I connected my USB
backup disk, some strange things happened:
May 17 15:09:14 dereel kernel: ugen5.3: <Sunplus Technology Co.,Ltd.> at usbus5
May 17 15:09:14 dereel kernel: umass2: <Bulk Only Interface> on usbus5

The messages are normal enough.
But it took the system 25 seconds to recognize the device,
which isn't normal.
Then it had write errors, and the modem disconnected again:
May 17 15:17:02 dereel kernel: (da1:umass-sim2:2:0:0): AutoSense failed
May 17 15:17:02 dereel kernel: g_vfs_done():da1s1d[WRITE(offset=369902485504, length=131072)]error = 5
...
May 17 15:17:02 dereel kernel: g_vfs_done():da1s1d[WRITE(offset=369902354432, length=131072)]error = 5
May 17 15:18:07 dereel kernel: ugen5.2: <HUAWEI Technology> at usbus5 (disconnected)
Finally gave up and connected the modem back to
cojones , still with the extension
cable.
And again I had the same problems.
Removed the extension cable and all was stable
again.
So I have identified the “cause”.
Or at least, I've identified a workaround.
I've seen sporadic disconnects like this before, even without a cable, and there's no
reason—yet—to believe that there's anything wrong with the cable.
But clearly
I'm going to have to rethink my connection strategies.
Upgrading to 64 bit
Topic: technology
Link here
Finally found some cheap RAM for
dereel , 4 GB for $40.
Now I can increase memory
from 3 GB to 6 GB, which means upgrading to 64 bits.
Downloaded a boot-only
amd64
ISO version of
FreeBSD
(in the record time of
5 minutes, 56 seconds), and planned to boot it on
cojones .
The boot failed with the
message “kernel doesn't support long mode”.
Further investigation showed that
this was a masterpiece of obfuscation: it means “Hardware doesn't have a 64 bit
mode”.
Why kernel?
Looks like a bug to me.
Tried another machine, which I also thought did 64 bits, but no luck.
It's funny: when I
only wanted 32 bits, all my hardware supported 64 bits.
Now it's (almost) the other way
round: I do have 4 machines that support 64 bits, but they're all in use.
I'll wait until
Yvonne
leaves for a long dog weekend and install it on her
machine first.

Localizing USB flakiness
Topic: technology
Link here
Yesterday I established beyond reasonable doubt that my Huawei E1762 USB modem doesn't work
reliably with the new 5 m USB cable.
But who is to blame?
According to the
standard , the combination
should work.
We've established that it's not the motherboard, since it happens with two
different ones, including the one where it has been running relatively reliably for months.
The new component is the cable.
So, let's connect some other device with it.
First I tried
a disk drive.
Complete failure:
May 18 13:22:44 dereel kernel: usb_alloc_device: set address 2 failed (USB_ERR_STALLED, ignored)
May 18 13:22:46 dereel kernel: usbd_req_re_enumerate: addr=2, set address failed! (USB_ERR_STALLED, ignored)
May 18 13:22:48 dereel kernel: usbd_req_re_enumerate: addr=2, set address failed! (USB_ERR_STALLED, ignored)
May 18 13:22:49 dereel kernel: ugen5.2: <Unknown> at usbus5 (disconnected)
May 18 13:22:49 dereel kernel: uhub_reattach_port: could not allocate new device
But, bad as that seems, it's a feature, not a bug.
This is a 5 m
extension
cable,
which means I also needed a short pigtail cable, bringing the total length to over 5 m.
So
the only things I can use with this cable are direct plug devices like USB modems, USB
memory sticks and card readers.
Tried an SD with the card reader.
As Daniel O'Connor pointed out, you shouldn't really need
to perform any I/O if the device just goes away.
But it didn't: it connected just fine and
stayed that way for well over an hour, longer than the Huawei modem ever managed.
So I
tried copying data from the card with
dd .
And there I ran into problems:

But is that the cable or the SD card?
The SD card is
over 6
years old , and potentially it's flaky.
In addition, it's a different kind of problem.
The device doesn't go away.
Tried again without the cable, and again ran into trouble,
though possibly a little less.
So it seems that USB is just flaky, at least in my
experience.
How I'd like to see something more reliable.
It's also interesting to note the transfer speeds.
They're not spectacular, but that can be
due to the old card.
But with the cable the successful transfers had speeds between 922956
and 934461 b/s, while without the cable they were in the range 880813 to 884423 b/s.
That's
a significant difference; what causes it?
Can it have a bearing on the problem?
Slowly in the garden
Topic: gardening

The weather hasn't been conducive to garden work lately, but there's plenty to be done.
Removed another hop rhizome, taking about an hour to do so.
It's tiring work, and there are
still another two to be done.
Put them off to some other time and attended to the overgrown bed that I last worked on
two weeks ago .
Spent yet more time trying to
remove the stump of the River Red Gum that we tried to remove
18 months ago .
Got through the lateral roots, but it's still firm as a
rock.
Looks like I'll have to cut down under it.
Also found yet more bulbs:

Preparing for 64 bit upgrade
Topic: technology
Link here
Yvonne
is off to the High Country on Friday for a weekend
playing with dogs, and in that time I hope to be able to upgrade at least her machine to
AMD64.
Last time I did an upgrade I ended up downloading lots of tarballs, and by chance my
monthly traffic quota runs out tomorrow, so it made sense to upgrade
defake , my
background installation VM, to the latest and greatest kernel and ports.
That worked fine,
but I was still amazed to note that I managed to download 1 GB of tarballs, including
another version of this amazingly large Qt Everywhere, for which the canonical site is
apparently
still under construction :
-rw-r--r--  1 root  lemis  211768512 Nov  9  2010 /src/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/KDE/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.7.1.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  213659173 May  4 18:10 /src/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/KDE/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.7.3.tar.gz
Next I need a disk.
I think I'll put the new system on an external USB disk so that I can
easily test it on different machines.

More 64 bit upgrade preparations
Topic: technology
Link here
I can't actually start installing my amd64 version of
FreeBSD
until tomorrow, because I need
Yvonne 's
computer to do the bootstrap, and she's not leaving until tomorrow.
But I still had some
time to prepare the disk I was going to use.
I have a surprising number of external USB disks: three 1 TB and one 500 GB.
I use two of
the big ones for photo backups and currently the little one for other backups, but both that
disk and the third 1 TB disk contain older copies of my
/src
file system and various
other junk.
My intention was to move the backups to the third 1 TB disk and use the 500 GB
disk as a bootstrap disk for amd64.
That's simple: copy the backups across, wipe the file system, and we're done.
But what if
there's other stuff on there that I had forgotten about?
Years ago I wrote a program,
mklinks , that does various comparisons and
editing of similar source trees.
In this case, it made sense to remove all files from the
USB disks that existed in the same form on
/src , so started doing that.
It's not a
fast job at the best of times, and I further slowed things down by monitoring the progress.
Then I saw a message fly past on the log window, something about fatal swap_pager errors.
The
top
window showed that I had plenty of free swap space, but the system froze
solid—not the first time I've seen that.
Swap management seems to be a weak point in
FreeBSD.
Theoretically it could be I/O problems, but I've seen too many occurrences of this
syndrome (and very little elsewhere) to believe that.
Unfortunately the way the machine
crashed means that the log messages got lost.
I half expected that, and should have taken a
photo.
Continued with the
mklinks , and after a couple of hours the second disk was finished.
But the one that started first was only half way through.
Checked and found that the second
was running
soft updates ,
so
umount ed the first, set soft updates, and started again.
Went out to help Yvonne, who has been rebuilding the car to ensure that
Nemo
doesn't wander round to the front seat.
When I got back,
the machine had frozen.
No error messages, just dead.
I've
seen this before , but I had thought it was fixed.
And once
again an overflowing
lost+found
directory.
In the end, decided it wasn't worth the
trouble.
Confirmed that, apart from the
/src
copy, there was nothing of interest on
the disk, so ran
newfs
on it.
But what a day!
Two unrelated crashes!
It helps
confirm my prejudices against USB.
Maybe I should
check
eSATA —one of the
disks has a connector.
Slow progress in the garden

Installing AMD64
Topic: technology
Link here
Yvonne
off with
Nemo 	this morning to visit Jenny Judson
near
Myrtleford , leaving her
computer behind for me to play around with.
The plan was to boot with my new 8.2-RELEASE
bootonly disk and then build a
STABLE
kernel from sources.
It didn't quite work
out that way.
It seems that this “bootonly” disk contains, well, only
/boot : the kernel
and a couple of helper files for the bootstrap.
And it's 50 MB in size.
Well, what's on
the CD is.
It's a lot more once it's properly installed.
The bloat of ages looks like
this:
#
du -sk /boot /src/UNIX/Sixth-Edition/rkunix
326962  /boot
28      /src/UNIX/Sixth-Edition/rkunix
A modern kernel with helpers is over 10,000 times the size of the kernel of the Sixth
Edition of
Unix !
From my point, however,
the problem was different: I didn't have enough to get the machine up and running.
What's
the purpose of this disk?
It has all the scripts to install a complete system, but the
userland isn't there.
Checked on the download sites: the next smallest CD image is about
750 MB, and I only had 550 MB quota left for the rest of the “month” (midnight
today).
That's a hard limit: when I hit it, I lose connectivity.
So I would have had to
wait until tomorrow, and even then use over 8% of my month's traffic quota to download it.
Went looking and found a collection of
7.0-RELEASE
AMD64 CDs, probably sent from
Peter Jeremy some time ago.
The obvious thing to do would be to install from them and then
build from source as before.
Problem: the bootstrap died on me.
It seems that there has
been some change in hardware in the intervening 3 years, and the boot doesn't know how to
handle it.
Tried a number of different approaches (it's nice to have a functional system on
the other disk):
Run the install script on the
7.0-RELEASE
CD (it's effectively unchanged since
the days of floppies and the first release of
“The Complete FreeBSD” ).
That worked, but the boot loader still
died.
Replace the
/boot
hierarchy on disk with the 8.2 version.
Still no go; it seems
that the part of the boot was in the boot blocks.
From the 8.2 CD, rewrite the boot blocks with the newer ones.
That worked.
FreeBSD isn't really designed so that userland and kernel from different releases should
work together.
But it did, and I was able to build a new system without any further
problems.
Started building ports, again with relatively few problems, though one looked
ominous:
===>  Cleaning for cvsup-16.1h_4
===>  cvsup-16.1h_4 does not support GUI on amd64, please disable X11 option or use net/cvsup-without-gui instead.
I don't need
cvsup 's GUI, of course, but it's been concerns with incompatibilities
between
i386
and
amd64
that have kept me from upgrading for so long.
Didn't even try to configure the machine—yet.
I had other things to do.
More garden progress
Topic: gardening
Link here
The weather's nicer again, and so more work in the garden.
Finally got all the bulbs
planted, both the ones I dug out the other day and the ones we bought at
Lambley Nursery
nearly a
month ago .
Most of them are in the garden area east of the verandah.
Also more
attention to the weeds in the north bed; there's some satisfaction in removing large
quantities of weeds, though there's no point unless I get out all the roots too.

New system build, continued
Topic: technology
Link here
Carried on running the ports build of the
amd64
system in the background all day
long, in the process modifying my
method 	somewhat.
Many years ago I
changed the layout of my
file systems .
Traditionally the systems are
/ ,
/usr ,
/var
and
maybe
/home .
I have incorporated
/usr
with
/
and split
/var
between
/
(system-related directories such as
/var/db
and
/var/run )
and
/home
(user-related directories such as
/var/mail ,
/var/spool
and
/var/tmp ).
Over the years I've increased the size of the root partition.
In the
last edition of
“The Complete FreeBSD”
I recommended 4 to 6 GB.
My current machine has 10 GB, and for the new machine I chose
20 GB.
Nevertheless the file system filled up during the build: the
Ports Collection
is in
/usr/ports , and in
the course of building it accumulated about 12 GB of files before overflowing the file
system.
Clearly I need to move the ports to
/home
as well, though it doesn't really
fit that well.
Other things irritate, of course, particularly this emetic Java stuff, where you
must
download the tarball via a web browser (tough luck if you haven't built one), and accept a
positively stupid license agreement:

A licensee of
FreeBSD ?
What's that?
Since
this particular tarball is only of use for FreeBSD, this is almost completely meaningless.
And yet it's on the
FreeBSD foundation
web site.
Clearly this is some requirement
by
Sun Oracle 's ivory tower lawyers.
It wasn't helped by
firefox ,
which now gives no indication that it has actually started a download.
After clicking on
“Submit” a few times, went to look if anything was coming in.
Yes:
-rw-------  1 grog  lemis  28508160 May 21 15:15 diablo-caffe-freebsd7-amd64-1.6.0_07-b02(1).tar.bz2.part

Not only had it started a download, it had started four of them.
And the key
binding
c-y
no longer brings up the download window, so I couldn't stop it.
Finally
I found that they have changed the binding to
c-s-y .
Somehow this browser is getting
more and more irritating
Configuration is proving to be more of a problem than I expected.
I've
already complained
that the FreeBSD port of
GIMP
doesn't install the documentation.
Now there's a
configuration option to install it (but it still defaults to
off ).
Checked that and
discovered that by default (there's another configuration screen that you don't get
presented) it installs the documentation in 13 different languages!
And each documentation
pack is about 30 MB.
Stopped the damned thing after it had loaded 150 MB of largely
irrelevant data.
Why should anybody want more than one of these things?
Too windy for photos
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
Today should have been garden photo day, like every Saturday, but it was too windy.
I
should have done them yesterday: the weather forecast was correct, and they're forecasting
more wind tomorrow and rain on Monday.
Still, did some photo processing, notably the egg photos.
And for some reason the
Ashampoo
photo optimizer didn't want to run.
It just hung there, and when I aborted with
^C , I got the message:
err:module:attach_process_dlls "winspool.drv" failed to initialize, aborting
What caused that?
I really have no idea.
Tried a new version of
wine , but got the same problem I noted on
18 March 2011 :
ELF interpreter /libexec/ld-elf.so.1 not found
Abort trap: 6
This appears to be related to the value of
kern.maxdsiz , which I have set to
2048000000 bytes.
Jürgen Lock tells me that that's no longer needed, but it's not something
I feel like testing right now.
We'll see what problems I run into with the new system.
Reinstalled the old version of
wine
and discovered that it wasn't a complete hang: it
took several minutes to start up, and then it ran.
No idea why.
I'll see if I run into the
same problems with the new system.

Ports build complete
Topic: technology
Link here
Managed to complete the ports build today, modulo some problems:
wget
failed with
a configuration problem:
===>  wget-1.12_3 GNUTLS and OPENSSL are mutually exclusive, enable at most one of them.
All well and good, but why didn't the configuration dialogue notice that?
gimp
tried to install twice.
That's
because it's too leet to install a binary called
gimp ; instead it installs one
called
gimp-2.6
(and not the more correct
gimp-2.6.11.2 ).
How I hate
silly programs that carry their revision history in their name.
wine
was a non-starter:
===>  wine-1.3.20,1 is only for i386, while you are running amd64.
Apart from the grammar of the message, it's one of the things I had been afraid of.
Fortunately it's one of only two that have
reported
this problem.
I suppose I'll
have to run it in a VM if I need it at all.
The
ss
port seems to have died, but there is still an empty directory there, so
when I went to it I got:
cd /usr/ports/math/ss && make -i clean; make install
make: don't know how to make clean. Stop

Possibly this is an issue with

Maybe some other time
And that's all I did.
Other things, including distaste, kept me from updating the
configuration.

More eBay pain
Topic: technology, general, opinion
Link here
Two weeks ago I accidentally bought the wrong camera for
Yvonne
on
eBay .
Discussed with the seller, who
wanted a $15 restocking charge, which I paid, so I though that the matter was over.
Not so.
On Friday I received a mail message from eBay in typical obfuscated form.
Hidden
in the mess was:
eBay opened an unpaid item case for Canon PSA3100IS Digital Compact Camera
A3100 IS SILVER , because jrandomseller either hasn't recorded your payment
or didn't receive it yet.
Clearly a misunderstanding, and I sent a message to the seller, who didn't respond.
Why
not?
One indication was another message that I sent to him
a
week ago .
The courtesy copy arrived only today, 6 days later and completely broken.
The text part was (probably broken) HTML:
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=ISO-8859-1
To : jrandomseller
>From : groggyhimself
Subject: Other: groggyhimself sent a message about Canon PSA3100IS Digital

(etc)
I like the ID
HeaderTextDilimiter1 .
But somehow eBay's site is completely broken,
and new breakage continually occurs.
Normally these messages are formatted well enough
modulo the mess around them.
And it seems impossible to send messages via their
“email” system, so tried to find the phone number of the seller.
Found
a
page
which linked to
http://help.ebay.com.au/Help/Getting_Started/eBay_community/Contacting_members#contact
and promised to give the information.
But it's 404.
After much more frustrating
searching, finally found another page, since lost again, which did finally get me the phone
number.
Called up, spoke to the vendor, and he promised to do something about it today; and
he did.
But it cost me 1½ hours of messing around, and I still don't know what to do next
time.
What a pain!

That required significant dismantling, and it took its time.
From
the
Wikipedia page , this CPU appears to be
the JAWS-11.
This is the first time I've seen it.
If we identified and counted the memory
chips correctly, the machine has 4 MB main memory.
It proved that the storage conditions had been less than idea, and Alastair had to evict one
rat from its home, much to the interest of
Piccola .
Clearly the others got out earlier.
Here some of the remains, along with the Tandem LXN and
a
MicroVAX II
which were also there, and
which proved to be more difficult for rats to build their nests:

Even after loading everything, we weren't done.
Alastair had been rather generous with the
size of the tarpaulin that he wanted to tie over the trailer.
The first photo shows it
folded fourfold.
It took quite a while to shrink it to the size of the trailer and tie it
down firmly:

More USB problems?

Backing up photos today was less than reassuring.
Lots of messages like:
rsync: recv_generator: failed to stat "/photobackup/Photos/grog/20090321/housephoto-notes": Device not configured (6)
rsync: recv_generator: failed to stat "/photobackup/Photos/grog/20090321/makejpeg": Device not configured (6)

rsync: recv_generator: failed to stat "/photobackup/Photos/grog/20090321/verandah-e-verandah-se.pto": Device not configured (6)
It wasn't repeatable: after aborting the backup, disconnecting and reconnecting the USB
cable, all was well.
There were also no console messages, but I wonder if I shouldn't
migrate to some more reliable method of backup,
maybe
eSATA .
Time to check all
the files, anyway.

Garden flowers in late autumn
Topic: gardening
Link here
Took my monthly
garden flower photos
today.
It's clear that summer is over—in fact, autumn is nearly over—and
there aren't nearly as many flowers as last month.
Of those that are still looking happy,
the
Alstroemerias
and
the
Begonias
are particularly obvious:

Those are the volunteer Begonias; the expensive tuberous one still has a couple of flowers
on, but it's nothing to look at.
Flowers that seem to be really coming into their own now seem to be
the
Alyogyne ,
the
Dahlia imperialis
and the
unknown ginger sort that had been looking relatively unhappy
last month :

flowers, and some of the new ones are also flowering.
So is the lemon, and the creeper
cuttings that

have noticed that they have been cut and replanted.

Sourdough in Dereel
Topic: general, cooking, brewing, gardening
Link here
I started my next batch of
sourdough bread 	yesterday, and by chance somebody on
Freecycle
asked for a starter today.
Even more unusually, the person was
in
Dereel .
Sent a reply offering to show
them how I made the bread, but they didn't call back until I had started: it seems that
Freecycle has significant delays in sending messages.
The person in question turned out to be Peter Dilley, with whom I had spoken about brewing
last month .
He came by with his wife Victoria
and picked up the starter, lending me a couple of books while he was at it.
He also left
with one of the Pride of Ringwood hop rhizomes and a number of garden cuttings.
Had an
interesting discussion.
We're planning to do some cooperative brewing sessions.
64 bit upgrade, one small step
Topic: technology
Link here
Yvonne
off to dog training this morning, so continued with
the upgrade to 64 bits that had got interrupted last week.
Things didn't work too much
better today: got as far as checking out some configuration files when I got interrupted by
Real Life.
This is taking for ever, even though I'm nearly finished.
I dread getting
X
up and stumbling.

Another USB crash
Topic: technology
Link here
Somehow these USB disks aren't really reliable enough.
I don't seem to lose any data, but
there are continual strange messages that suggest things aren't all going well.
Today the
message was very clear:
once again
I
froze the entire system.
That's enough.
From now on I revert to doing my backups over the
LAN to some other machine that doesn't need to be up all the time.
While the system was down, put in the 4 GB of memory that I recently received.
Now I have 6
GB, of which I can only use 3 until I finally get the machine running in 64 bit mode.
But
the extra memory had an unpleasant side effect: although it's all DDR-2 800 memory, and all
from the same manufacturer (Kingston), the machine came back up running at 667 MT/s.
Why?
I didn't have time to play around, but clearly I need to check the BIOS settings.

Strange camera problems
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
Yvonne
asked me to take some photos of her riding Carlotta,
so out onto the road.
Carlotta is gaited, so it made sense to take some high-speed
sequences.
In all photos I used manual focus, because I can't count on the autofocus to do
the right thing so quickly.
I have a “focus once” function button on the
camera, which performs an autofocus when in manual mode.
Pressed that and took some photos.
First took a single photo, then switched to high speed sequence.
Here the first (normal
mode) and the first of the sequence:

Not only was the complete sequence out of focus, but it was overexposed by 2 stops.
What
went wrong?
Took at look at the
EXIF
data,
but there wasn't anything obvious to note.
Here extracts of a
diff :

But why can the focus suddenly be “Not ready”?
Did I maybe change the focus
when I set the multiple exposure mode?
Or is this what it says when I didn't manually
autofocus before taking the image?
Comparing with other images taken in sequence in manual
mode, it seems not to be the case.
Only later did I discover that one of the sequence was recorded as having been rotated by
270°.
Here a comparison with the following image, taken in sequence.

These are sequential images, as the

the same second.
Not only does it claim rotation, but also that the focal length and focus
distance (in manual? how does that work?) had changed:

Fortunately I noticed the overexposure at the time and did a bit of checking.
First the
thing told me I had no card in the slot.
Powered off, popped and reseated the card, and
after that (and powering on, of course) it worked again, and I got some reasonable photos:

That worries me, though.
Why did it happen?
Will it happen again?
How will I know in
time?
Reboot solves Microsoft problems
Topic: technology

Another strange thing happened during processing the images.
A while back
my
wine
emulation of
Ashampoo
photo optimizer
started to hang.
I found a workaround, but never the cause.
Now, since yesterday's reboot,
things are back to normal.
I wish I knew why.
It seems to be the Microsoft Way to solve
problems by rebooting, even prophylactically, but this is almost certainly a
FreeBSD
issue, and it shouldn't happen there.
Preparing for winter
Topic: gardening
Link here
Gradually the combination of cool weather and the winds of the past week have transformed
the garden, and it's looking quite wintery.
While looking around, discovered a plant that I
had thought was an
Iris .
It's
blooming for the first time, and it looks nothing like an Iris:

I thought it was one of the plants I bought at the
Melbourne
International Flower and Garden Show
two years ago, and indeed I have a photo of
something like that in my diary entry for the day:

Unfortunately, the description isn't in sequence with the photos: according to the
description the plant in question (second from right) would be
a
Sedum
“gold mound”, which it
most certainly isn't (the Sedum is in the middle).
I also know the
Liriope muscari
and
the
Sedum
“gold mound”, so that
only leaves the
Carex
morrowii
varieagata
and
the
Iris
japonica
variegata .
Clearly the suffix
variegata
fits.
On the face of it, it has to be the Iris, and
that would mean that I had just transposed the Iris and the Sedum, but it just doesn't look
right.
In any case, the plant was hidden under one of
the
Buddleja globosas .
The Buddlejas
later
proved to
be
Buddleja × weyeriana ,
not globosa.
I had intended to trim the whole hedge back in a month or so when it had finished flowering,
but clearly I couldn't wait that long.
Trimmed the end back, in the process discovering a
number of
Helleborus , which had also
been smothered by grass, and also another bulb of some description.
I'm going to have to be
stricter about how far I allow the Buddleja to grow.
Also a lot of weeding in front of the dining room (south-east of the verandah).
Found some
clump of roots which I vaguely recall planting, but which I think I thought had died, maybe
some kind of
Salix .
It doesn't look too
unhappy, though of course at this time of year it has no leaves.
One thing I notice, though: a lot of these plants aren't flowering.
The Japanese Iris (if
that's what it is) has produced dozens of offspring in the last 2 years, but this is the
first flower I've seen.
None of the other plants aren't flowering, and neither is
the
Canna -like plant near the birdbath.
As
far as I can tell, it has never flowered.
Am I being too miserly with fertilizer?
To be on
the safe side, spread some now, though clearly it's not much use to the Canna, which won't
flower before summer.
