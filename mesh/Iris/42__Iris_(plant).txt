Summer Solstice
The Summer  Solstice
- the longest day of the year for North America - arrived Monday, June 21st.  What a glorious morning.
My gardening is in full swing. And so is my
hammock
for absolute lazy moments of the day.
The vegetables in their hard scrabble beds await the
summer monsoon  rain showers.
The   Sages ,  Perky Sues ,   Iris , and
Butterfly Bushes
are back.

Sages and Butterfly Bush in my
Xeriscape Garden
Quanyin
provides quiet compassion in this mountain  garden.
Red Yuccas
are abloom.
Lavender ,
Japanese Honeysuckle , and
Roses
bring both color and aroma to my garden.
New
Pinon Pine
seedlings are growing.

My Rocky Mountain Butterfly mixture of wildflowers are blooming.
Red Columbine
Wildflowers are everywhere:
Bladderpod
﻿
Verbena
﻿
Prickly things are blooming, too  - Local natives like
Hedgehog Cactus  and  Claret Cup cactus   have beautiful red flowers.
Hedgehog Cactus
Claret Cup Cactus
Yarrow
and
Columbine
grace my garden.
Along with a field of
Cornflowers
Indian Blanket Flower
and brightly colored
Blanket Flowers .
Day Lilies
nod in the warming sun.
My 3 year old
Cottonwood
is
huge
and is sure to devour my house in a few more years.
The bird house remains empty -
sigh
- apparently a sign of the times with too much inventory, not enough buyers.
What a beautiful sunset to finish off the day!

The Universe Smiles
Vicki
Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States
This Blog tries to capture the essence of my life in New Mexico where I now live. It has some journals of my daily life, my family, my travels, some photos, art and poetry I've created, and finally, an occasional comment on the times we are living in.
I was born in California and lived in coastal Southern California most of my life. I have also lived in Honolulu, Hawaii and Tucson, Arizona. For many reasons, including losing my job of 27 years, I decided to leave San Diego for New Mexico in 2005. I was looking for a peaceful natural environment without crowds, noise, and a high cost of living. I found that in central New Mexico, enjoying the bluest skies nearly everyday. I work part-time from home scoring online TOEFL tests.
I enjoy art, photography, gardening and volunteering in my free time. I volunteer with the Forest Service leading summer wildflower walks. I also am a volunteer ESL tutor for CNM.
I love to travel and have been to most states in the USA.
I also have visited Canada, Mexico, Ireland, Greece, Croatia, Montenegro, Italy, Monaco, France,
Spain, Japan, China, Bahamas, Virgin Islands (US), Turks and Caicos, and the island of St. Martin/St. Marteen.
