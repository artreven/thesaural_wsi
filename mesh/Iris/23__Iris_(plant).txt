Autumn with a vengeance
Topic: gardening
Link here
The mild autumn weather stopped abruptly with the change of month:
That was coupled with rain, so did almost nothing in the garden.
Hopefully I'll find time
to regain the momentum of the last few days.
Refining panorama processing
Topic: photography, technology, opinion
Link here
Yesterday's panorama photo of the verandah wasn't quite as good as usual; I suspect that
hugin
chose some inappropriate
control points.
It's surprising how different the automatic control points are from the
ones I would have chosen.
Normally I would have refined it, but I had other experiments in
store.
In particular, lens distortion must be an issue in the matter, and I can compensate for that
with
DxO Optics
"Pro" .
In addition, there are possibilities to do
the
HDR
processing
directly with
hugin , and I could do all the processing in 16 bit mode.
Started by creating some
JPEGs
of the
images:
DxO `grep verandah-centre makejpeg | sed 's: .*::; s:JPG:ORF:'`
makejpeg
is the file that I create with a mapping between camera image name
(first the camera name, then my own).
DxO
is a script that then links them
to a new, empty directory and allows me to start the DxO application against it.
That wasn't enough, though: DxO insists on remembering the previous things I have done.
They're
done , dammit!
But after I processed the JPEGs, I was confronted with
(partial window):
Now I would have had to choose every second image, 72 times.
What a pain!
Moving the JPEG
images out of the directory didn't help; DxO knows better.
Still, I was able to change to a different directory ( click ) and back again
( click ), and the images were no longer there.
But
I still wasn't out of the woods.
DxO claimed that the images had already been processed,
and refused to do it again:
Finally I deleted all “projects”, in the process also deleting any other
settings.
It seems that there's an easier way: select “New Project”, not from
the “Project” tab (that would be too easy) but from the “File” tab.
But that probably means that it will accumulate lots of useless cruft in some unexpected
place.
Then moved on to
hugin .
The panorama consists of two rows of 12 views each
(spaced at 30°), and each view consists of 3 images bracketed
1
EV
apart, a total of 72 images.
My current technique is to merge the images for each view
using
align_image_stack
and
enfuse ,
but
hugin
has its own HDR functionality, so tried it directly, rather
stupidly with the
TIFFs
(total size a little
over 5 GB).
That sort of worked, though the preview image looked funny:
Selected HDR, which greatly improved the preview image:
Went off to do something else.
Came back and found:
May  1 17:18:54 dereel kernel: pid 51513 (hugin), uid 1001: exited on signal 6 (core dumped)
The last thing I want to do is analyze that, so tried again with JPEG.
This time it started
stitching, but there was still no joy:
Loading next image: 00-710017.tif
Creating blend mask: 1/6 2/6 3/6 4/6 5/6 6/6
Optimizing 0 distinct seams.
Strategy 2:
enblend: an exception occured
Mask is entirely black, but white image was not identified as redundant.
gmake: *** [00-71.tif] Error 1
Looking at that output, it was at image 17 of 72.
I've seen this kind of message before,
and I suspect that it relates to the dynamic range in some strange manner.
But for the
moment, this approach seems to be a dead end.

Panoramas with images processed by DxO
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
My previous attempts at
making
HDR
panoramas
were less than successful, but they didn't really have anything to do with
DxO Optics "Pro" .
Today
tried the old method, up to a point: my way of creating HDR images wasn't very portable, so
first updated the
HDR
script to optionally group the images
into a specific number of images of the same view, allowing me to create multiple HDR mapped
images from a list of arbitrary names.
Did that, and got worthwhile results.
Here the verandah panorama from the weekend, and then
the one done today.
They look pretty much the same until you look at the details.
The new
one is still not perfect, but the discontinuities are considerably less.
The dynamics are
also better in the second (DxO) image, as the mouseover comparison of the first image shows:
There's still more to do, notably playing around with 16 bit intermediate images.
But it's
slow, and it uses amazing amounts of memory.
More garden progress
Topic: gardening
Link here
The weather's better again, and both of us out into the garden.
One good thing about lots
of weeds is that when you take pull them out, you have something to show for it.
I started
the middle bay of the compost heap only a couple of days ago:
The north bed looks so different that we're reconsidering what to plant in it.
No decisions
made yet.

Under the weather
Topic: general, gardening
Link here
The weather is cool and moist again, and for some reason I didn't feel very well.
Had
planned to go into town today, but cancelled that and stayed at home watching TV instead.
The moisture was enough that I didn't do more than a little token pottering in the garden.
Panoramas made with TIFF images
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
More work on panoramas today.
As planned, tried making the verandah panorama
from
TIFFs
images instead of
from
JPEGs .
The results were surprising:
Moving the cursor over the image switches from the JPEG-based panorama (cursor off) to
TIFF-based one (cursor on).
I can't see any difference apart from a slight difference in
framing.
hugin
reports two
values for control point alignment, the mean error and the maximum, both in pixels.
They
were:
Image
mean
max
error
error
Out-of-camera
2.3
84.6
DxO JPEG
2.1
7.0
DxO TIFF
2.7
14.3
That's surprising, to be investigated yet further.
I'm assuming that the maximum error with
the out-of-camera images was due to distortion, but why should the results with TIFF be
worse than the results with JPEG?
I'd assume that the image geometry is the same.
Maybe it
has something to do with the strange way
hugin
chooses control points.

DxO improves your image
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
While working on some old photos, found the collection for my
60th birthday party
(coincidentally about the
same time I built the “new” machine).
They didn't look too good, and on
investigation it seems that I had taken them only in raw format and converted
to
JPEG
with
ufraw .
At the time I had had some problems
with those conversions, and so it seemed a perfect example to use
DxO Optics "Pro"
on.
Ran through that, taking over an hour again, and somehow ending up
with
TIFF
output—one of the settings I
gave stuck, and I forget how to reset it.
I wish these packages would only save settings
when you ask them to.
Spent some time running cursors over illegible icons, only to
discover that the description popped up under the cursor arrow (something that I can't
capture from the screen).
Finally got the images, and... I couldn't see much difference
between the images.
On the other hand, I've already seen how difficult it is to compare different renditions of
the same image, even when they're side by side.
That's why I developed the mouseover
compare technique, where you can swap the images in place.
Cursor over the following image
shows the old one ( ufraw ), cursor off shows the new one (DxO):
Now it's clear that DxO shows a great improvement.
It looks as if it's worthwhile after
all.
If only it wasn't so emetic to use.

It's cool again, and I didn't feel like doing much, but
Yvonne
wanted to get rid of the dead hops, so out to lend her moral support.
When we installed
the original wooden beds in the eastern garden about 3 years ago, we planted some
spring-flowering
bulbs— Narcissus , I
think—in one of them.
After removing all the weeds, I found them still there, and
having multiplied nicely:
After separating them (far too late in the season, but what can you do?) I ended up with 32
bulbs, a couple damaged enough that they might not survive:
Planted half of them, along with another 3 that I had found elsewhere.
The rest will have
to wait until tomorrow.

USPS and tracking
Topic: photography, opinion
Link here
I've had things sent by
United States Postal Service
before.
Even the cheapest form,
“First Class
International” , offers what they call tracking, as I discovered
a couple of years ago .
On that occasion I received a lens in
record time—only 6 days.
It had the tracking ID LJ 237 183 639 US.
Their
tracking service
tells me that they're still waiting for the shipper to bring the package to them.
When I bought my panorama head last week, the seller offered a better quality of USPS
shipping,
“Priority Mail International” .
At the time I decided that it couldn't
harm to get it even faster, so paid the extra.
He got it to the post office in record time,
and the tracking seemed to work.
Until last Friday, when it left Chicago and disappeared
from view.
That was 6 days ago, and despite the more expensive rating, it has already taken
considerably longer than the last USPS package.
Has something gone wrong?
Did they entrust
it to
idiots
like
UPS
to deliver it this end?
Did some investigating and found
a number for USPS: 1-800-222-1811, which I can't call from here.
Asked a friend in the US
to call them for me, and in the process looked at the tracking page again.
It arrived in
Australia yesterday:
Out of Foreign Customs, May 05, 2011, 4:16 pm,
AUSTRALIA
Into Foreign Customs, May 05, 2011, 4:10 pm,
AUSTRALIA
Arrived Abroad, May 05, 2011, 4:10 pm, AUSTRALIA
International Dispatch, April 29, 2011, 4:41 pm, ISC
CHICAGO IL (USPS)
Arrival
Processed through Sort Facility, April 28, 2011, 2:09

Electronic Shipping Info Received, April 27,
2011
Acceptance, April 27, 2011, 11:47 am, MINNETONKA, MN
55345
I suppose you have to put up with the
upside-down
chronology, but at least it's there.
They don't say where in AUSTRALIA it landed, but I
presume it was Melbourne or Sydney, both UTC+10.
Chicago is currently UTC-5.
So it arrived
5 days, 8½ hours after leaving Chicago.
Where has it been?
At least it got through Customs
quickly, 6 minutes after arrival.
So it should be here on Monday.
That's nearly 2 weeks,
much worse than my last experience.

Panoramas with DxO
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
Photo day again today.
The first Saturday of the month is special, since I take a few more
photos than normal, and managed to just about completely fill up an 8 GB memory card.
Decided to process the raw images with
DxO Optics "Pro" , and
after fighting my way through the windows, was presented with the information that the
conversion (415 images) would take 6 hours, 20 minutes.
Let that run and tried stitching them together from
the
JPEGs , intending to catch up with the
real images later.
That proved to be more work than I wanted, since many of them required
masking.
I need to look at the bleeding edge version of
hugin
to see whether they've fixed the mask
handling.
Currently it's painful.
Wouldn't it be nice to have a mask that you could invert
and apply to another image, so that you could put an image together exactly out of two
partial images taken from the same position.
As it is, I found it a little easier to take a
screen shot of the mask on the first image of a pair
with
xv , and use that to set
the second mask.
Still not what you'd call computer-assisted.
That got to be enough work that I gave it up and waited for the DxO run to finish.
I think
I'm going to have to do this in batches, one photo at a time, so DxO can do its thing in the
background while I process the ones it has finished.
Started doing that and found that the
treatment of
EXIF
data is very irritating:
it doesn't keep them, and when I
use
exiftool
it doesn't seem to
copy the
Maker Notes ,
so I don't get the crop factor in the data, and I have to enter it manually.
I think I'll
fake something when copying the data.
That wasn't the only problem: I ran out of swap, and X crashed Yet Again.
In the end had to
give up with only a couple of panoramas completed.
Next week should be less of a stress.

Bleeding edge Hugin
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
Continued with my panorama processing today, and it took me until midday to complete—a
day later than normal.
This mask processing adds a lot to the time, as of course does
DxO Optics "Pro" .
Clearly time to investigate the development version of
hugin .
That's in a
Mercurial
repository, and it was relatively
straightforward to get a clone.
Building was another matter.
It uses
cmake , a program with which I haven't been able to
make friends, and according to the somewhat confusingly named instruction
file
INSTALL_cmake , building is as simple as
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local .
make
make install
That didn't even get started: it couldn't find
wxWidgets :
CMake Error at /usr/local/share/cmake/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:91 (MESSAGE):
Could NOT find wxWidgets (missing: wxWidgets_FOUND)
Call Stack (most recent call first):
/usr/local/share/cmake/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:252 (_FPHSA_FAILURE_MESSAGE)
/usr/local/share/cmake/Modules/FindwxWidgets.cmake:831 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
CMakeLists.txt:154 (FIND_PACKAGE)
Neither could I.
You'd think that you'd have a port called
wxWidgets
or some such,
but the closest I came was
/usr/ports/x11-toolkits/p5-Alien-wxWidgets .
But
then I found, in
/usr/ports/graphics/hugin/Makefile
(the real
hugin
port):
CMAKE_ARGS=	-DwxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=${WX_CONFIG}
Clearly there's some magic there.
Added a target to the
Makefile
to print
out
CMAKE_ARGS , and was surprised to find:
cmake -DwxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/wxgtk2u-2.8-config -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:STRING=cc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:STRING=c++ -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING=-O2 -pipe  -fno-strict-aliasing -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-O2 -pipe -fno-strict-aliasing  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DTHREADS_HAVE_PTHREAD_ARG:BOOL=YES -DCMAKE_THREAD_LIBS:STRING=-pthread -DCMAKE_USE_PTHREADS:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING=-pthread -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON .
That failed too, for more normal reasons: it wanted a newer version
of
libpano13
than I had installed.
Mañana.

Backup strategies for photos
Topic: photography, technology, opinion
Link here
Mail from Michael Hughes today, asking how I back up photos.
That's certainly an
interesting topic.
Digital technology has made many things easier than before, but it's
also easier to completely lose images.
Paradoxically, it's also easier to keep multiple
backups, and that's what both Michael and I do.
I've been backing up my computer for ever, of course.
In the days
of
CP/M
and
MS-DOS
I used floppies. They were
slow, expensive and unreliable.
Later I used tape,
both
QIC
and some strange format that I now
forget.
It was slow, expensive and unreliable.
About 18 years ago I moved
to
DDS
storage, which proved
to be a little faster, have a little more capacity, but it was still expensive and
unreliable.
I also briefly used
a
DLT
tape drive, but it was
an older model, and tapes were so expensive that I never tested the reliability.
In the end, I gave up on tape altogether, and for nearly 9 years now I have been backing up
to disk.
The difference is surprising:
from the
outset
I noticed an increase in speed, and it was clear that they were cheaper: at the
time an 80 GB disk drive cost about as much as a 40 GB tape cartridge.
They've also proven
to be
much
more reliable—I can't recall a single loss of backup disk, though
clearly that's possible.
In that time, though, disk capacity has increased markedly.
My total disk capacity at the
time was about 80 GB.
Now I have:
Filesystem  1048576-blocks    Used  Avail Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/ad4s1d           9916    7796   1326    85%    /
/dev/ad4s1a           9916    7647   1475    84%    /destdir
/dev/ad4s1e         439117  129710 274277    32%    /home
/dev/ad6s1a         923856  735787 114160    87%    /Photos
/dev/ad8s1d         923856  313848 536099    37%    /src
/dev/ad1s1d         236579  232739   1473    99%    /dump
total              2543241 1427530 928812    61%
Those values are in MB, so I have a total of 2.5 TB of disk space, of which about 1.4 TB are
in use.
But looking more carefully, 230 GB are on
/dump , clearly a backup
disk (for other systems on the network), and 735 GB are on
/Photos , not
surprisingly my photo disk.
/destdir
is a second root file system, which I
only use when I'm upgrading, so it doesn't need backup either.
I'm left with a much more
manageable:
Filesystem  1048576-blocks   Used  Avail Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/ad4s1d           9916   7796   1326    85%    /
/dev/ad4s1e         439117 129710 274277    32%    /home
/dev/ad8s1d         923856 313848 536099    37%    /src
total              1372889 451355 811703    36%
I used to back these file systems up to other systems on the net, but lately I've been using
a USB drive directly connected to the system.
I'm not sure I'm completely happy with that,
but for the time being it seems to work.
I dump the the root file system and
make
tar
backups of
individual file systems on
/home
and
/src .
The reason for
the difference is due to the size of the file systems: a complete dump
of
/src
would be about 200 GB in size after compression, and restoring files
from an archive of that size takes forever.
On the first day of each month I do a complete backup, on Saturdays I do a level 1 dump and
tar backups since the beginning of the month, and on other days I do level 2 dumps and
backups since the previous level 1 or level 0 dump.
I keep two level 0 dumps (beginning of
this month and beginning of last month) That works well, and I get by with about a total of
500 GB.
Photos are a different matter.
They're as good as not compressible (though some of the
smaller accompanying files are), so there's no point wasting time with a compressed dump.
But that leaves me with (currently) nearly 1 TB of backup.
That's different enough to take
a different approach.
Since compression doesn't have much effect, I keep duplicate file
systems and use
rsync
to keep
them synchronized with the online file system.
I have two disks, one of which is always at
Chris Yeardley's place.
On Sundays or Mondays I swap the disks, so that the one at Chris'
place is up to a week out of date, but since I take most of my photos at the weekend, that's
not a big issue.
That way I have a total of four copies of most photos: the one on my disk,
the one on the external web site, and the two backup copies.
Once I have at least one
backup copy of the images, I erase the flash cards in my cameras.
Michael does a number of things differently.
He backs up DLT, and he keeps no less than 5
backup copies.
That would become very expensive with my amount of data.
I haven't looked
at tapes for nearly 10 years now, but it seems that the highest capacity DLT tape is DLT-S4,
with 800 GB.
They call it “800 GB/1.6 TB”, but the latter value is an estimate
after compression, and that won't work for compressed images
like
JPEG
and raw images.
These tape
cartridges are available on
eBay
for $140
each.
By comparison, you can get 2 TB external disk drives from about $110.
He also keeps CRC signatures for each file on disk and regularly checks them for any
corruption.
That's certainly worth thinking about, though it's a lot of work for any
reasonable data volume.
ALDI Traveler Z14: First and last impressions
Topic: photography, opinion
Link here
Yvonne
has been having trouble with her camera, a
Kodak M1093 IS , for
some time.
I've been reluctant to blame just the camera, since “it works for
me”, but today I tried it again, and it's definitely defective.
It often gives up
trying to focus properly, and even when it thinks it's in focus, it's completely off.
I
took 8 photos of the garden today, every single one of them completely out of focus.
So
it's timely that
ALDI
have a new camera on
offer this week, a
Traveler Z14
(something that they manage to keep out of the announcement, though
Google finds
more details ).
The price looked right, the resolution is higher than anything I've
ever had, and we can give it back within two months if we don't like it.
Today I tried it out.
It has a surprising number of options, but what are the photos like?
Went out on the verandah and took a photo of the bird bath, in bright sunshine.
The flash
went off.
Tried again at full focal length.
More flash.
A couple more attempts gave me
camera shake, despite the shutter speed, and a completely different white balance:
Tried again with the flash turned off, and got an exposure of 1/30s at full
aperture—in bright sunshine!
Another photo had an exposure of 1/12s at f/6.5 (full
aperture at the longest focal length), or EV 9.0.
By comparison, my
E-30
took the same scene at
1/250s at f/6.3, or EV 13.3.
That's only a tenth of the exposure!
It's not due to the
sensitivity: both cameras claim a sensitivity of 200/24° ISO.
In general, all the photos I
took with it were exposed about 10 times as long as my Olympus did.
There's clearly
something very wrong here.
On top of that, the images are terrible.
Here a comparison with my Olympus.
No prizes for
guessing which image is which:
It's possible that tweaking some of the settings might improve things, but that's enough.
It's supposed to have image stabilization, but I haven't seen any evidence of it.
The focus
is glacially slow; even when taking sequential images of the same subject, focus takes about
1 second in bright sunlight.
In summary: the best thing about the camera is that I can return it for a full refund.
That's what I'll do.
I still need to investigate what camera to buy for Yvonne, who is
particularly keen on the smallest possible camera.
That will require some investigation.
Panorama head: finally
Topic: general, photography
Link here
Into town to talk to Peter O'Connell about my investments.
He's not very optimistic about
the market, and it seems that the best thing to do is cash investments; at least we get good
interest in Australia.
To be observed.
My panorama head has finally arrived after only 12 days.
It's just what I asked for, but I
fear not what I want.
Played around with it to see how to get it to do what I want, so far
with very limited success.
To be investigated more fully.
A rose arch
Topic: gardening

On the way home, stopped off
in
Napoleons
to take a look at an arch
for training roses that
Yvonne
had seen at the roadside plant
sales yesterday.
We've been thinking about that for some time, and the price ($30) was
right, so I took it.
But how?
It was too wide to fit in the boot of the car, and I couldn't dismantle it.
It
originally came in 3 pieces which were screwed together, but of course the screws had seized
up.
In the end, stuck it sideways in the back window and drove home, very slowly:

really
cool lately:
The lowest temperature measured by the weather station was 0.7°, and the highest was 13.6°,
but it lies.
We had a frost, and even inside the greenhouse, the temperature at the top
dropped to -0.1°.
That caught me by surprise: I had wanted to put
the
Mandevilla
in the greenhouse
before any frost, but fortunately it seems the frost wasn't heavy enough to affect most of
the garden, just some of
the
Tropaeolums .
I had thought that
that would have been the earliest in the year we've ever had a frost, but I see that two
years ago we had not one but two
in April , and
the lowest temperature I ever recorded with the weather station was on
22 May 2010 .
So why didn't the weather station report a lower temperature?
Presumably because it's an
inversion, and the temperature sensor was mounted too high.
I need to move it further down.
The cables are long enough, and it would make changing batteries a lot easier.
The only
problem is that the unit is designed to be mounted on the rod with the others, but there
should be a way round that.
Manfrotto 303PLUS panorama head
Topic: photography, opinion
Link here
Spent some time looking at the
new Manfrotto 303PLUS
panorama head .
Parts of it are excellent.
It's worth looking back at the criteria I identified
a
year ago :
Rotate the camera about the nodal point.
Level the camera independently of the tripod.
Switch from horizontal to vertical orientation, preferably without remounting the
camera.
Rotate the camera in specific increments for equally-spaced images.
Interestingly, it does all this, but only because I didn't state criterion 1 carefully
enough.
It should read:
Rotate the camera about the nodal point in both vertical and horizontal axes.
And it doesn't fulfil that criterion.
It only rotates around a vertical axis:
In addition, it requires that the camera lens axis be horizontal.
That's an extreme
restriction, and it makes me wonder what they were thinking of when they designed it.
It's
not cheap—the new price at
B & H
is $400, without the levelling base shown in these images.
Even a normal pan head can
tilt, and the Manfrotto 804RC2 costs only $68.
What's needed, of course, is pretty much the same as what I have already put together, a
second pivot with a horizontal axis.
That's as simple as an L bracket between the two
slides:
Or it should be.
A problem becomes clear when you try to mount a camera on the thing:
The problem is that the camera now has to point 90° from the way it was intended.
And that
doesn't work, because the mounting plate is hexagonal, so you can only mount it at 30°
either side of the correct direction.
And then the axis of rotation doesn't go through the
nodal point, as the third image shows.
I still need to work out what to do here.
The plate is mounted with screws (see the second
photo above with the L bracket), so I could drill new holes and mount it at 30° from where
it was intended.
But in view of the resale value (and resale is very much on the cards), I
suspect it would be better to buy another el cheapo focusing rail on
eBay .
Apart from that, the supplied L (“elbow”) bracket, apparently
part number 340 , is more than puzzling.
It must be one of the most baroque pieces of
equipment I have seen.
I've already commented on the hexagonal mounting plates, but it's
amazingly complicated.
What it
should
have is some kind of adjustment, so that the
lens axis doesn't change when you switch from horizontal to vertical.
That's not provided
for.
Instead, it has a second screw (⅜") for large cameras, an alternative mounting
point for a Nikon MD4, a “safety peg” for heavy telephoto lenses and another peg
whose function is neither described nor clear, but which can be seen in the middle of the
first image below:
And for all that, I can't easily mount my
Asahi Pentax SV
vertically on it.
If I mount it as shown in the instructions, the lens axis is always too far to the left, not
above the axis of rotation of the head.
I can mount the camera the other way round on the
bracket, and then I can adjust it correctly, but that only works with vertical orientation.
When I try to mount it horizontally, a funny and apparently useless projection from the MD4
mount fouls the mounting plate:
Instead, I need to turn the camera around on the bracket to point in the opposite
(originally intended) direction.
And when I do that, I also have to adjust the horizontal
position by about 1 cm.
That's not the intention.
Of course, who takes panoramas with an SV any more?
I certainly don't.
I chose it for
these photos because I needed my
Olympus E-30
to take the
photos, and the SV is a nice looking camera.
I considered the possibility that the problem
only exists because the SV is so small (it is, after all, a full frame camera), but the same
problem occurs with my E-30 as well.
Apart from that, the build quality is excellent.
The levelling plate works, though I'm sure
the range is nothing like what I need; I'll find myself playing with the tripod legs again,
I'm afraid.
But I'm puzzled that a company like Manfrotto could build such a badly
conceived system.
Was it a design study done by students?
DxO and Olympus "Viewer 2"
Topic: photography, technology, opinion
Link here
Coincidentally to my investigation of
DxO Optics "Pro" , I found
an article about raw converters in the
c't
special
Digitale Fotografie 02/2011 .
This is a different article from
the one
I mentioned
last month , and it pays more attention to the kind of operations you'd
expect from a raw converter, notably correction for lens aberrations.
It seems that there
aren't many converters that do this kind of correction, but the article mentions that the
Olympus converter (not tested) is one of them.
I've used it before and have been
impressed—negatively—but it's becoming clear that all photo processing software
has significant issues.
Went looking and after considerable searching on the
Olympus web site
found a reference to
Olympus Master 2
as an “accessory” for the E series cameras.
Was that
the free one or the one they wanted money for?
The other one was called
“Studio”, and the names are so meaningless that I can't recall which is which.
All I could find was that it was no longer available for download, and that I should
download
Olympus
Viewer 2
instead.
There's a name that means something, and it's clear that it's not
what I want: I want to convert, not view.
But that's what it does!
It seems to be a replacement for both “Master” and
“Studio”, and it's free (as it should be), though I had to enter the serial
number of my camera to download it.
That's easy: it's in
the
EXIF
data of every photo.
But why?
Who
would download the software if they didn't have Olympus images to convert?
On the positive side, they seem to have improved things a lot.
Last time
it drove me mad.
Now it just irritates me.
They've made
it look more like all other commercially available software, white on anthracite text and
all, with a directory tree on the left to make you search instead of allowing you to just
enter the directory name:
This one had an additional trick up its sleeve, though: I couldn't slide the tiny scroll bar
down to the directory I wanted.
I tried 3 times, and in each case, shortly before I got to
the bottom, the display popped up to the top again.
I don't know whether I accidentally got
off the scroll bar, or whether the software didn't expect that many directories—I
suspect the later.
Got round that problem by creating a
directory
00-is-what-Oly-Viewer-is-worth
(highlighted), into which I was
able to link the images I wanted, in much the same way as I have worked around the
“features” of
hugin 	and DxO.
I had an immediate test case.
In one of the photos I took of the panorama bracket, the
left-hand flash unit didn't fire.
That's a known problem: it's a slave unit, and the
modelling light interferes with the receptor.
Normally I turn the modelling light out, but
this time I forgot.
So clearly a case for raw conversion.
Tried first with DxO, which was glacially slow.
Finally got a result that looked relatively
good, but it was also brighter than the others I had taken.
Here the uncorrected image, the
corrected image, and the one it's supposed to resemble:
It was so painful adjusting with DxO that I gave up at this point.
Started playing around
with “Viewer 2”, but there are lots of things I needed to understand better.
At
least it's fast enough to be usable, and yes, it applies lens-specific corrections,
presumably only for Olympus lenses, but with the exception of the old Macro-Takumar, that's
all I use.
More experimentation needed, but I suspect that when the free trial runs out, I
won't buy DxO.

ALDI Traveler Z14: second chance
Topic: photography, opinion
Link here
We discussed the poor performance of the
ALDI
Traveler Z14
on
IRC, and people suggested that I should have set it to defaults rather than to the
“P” setting, which allows more tweaking of the settings.
It's still here (will
go back on Friday), so went and took some more photos, this time in AUTO mode and using my 5
year old
Nikon
“Coolpix” L1 , itself not a particularly good camera, for comparison.
Yes,
the exposure times now look more in line (in fact, they're pretty much what they were last
time, but then it was bright sun and today was pretty overcast), though they still seem to
be about 1 EV lower than what the Nikon got (somewhat skewed by different choice of ISO
sensitivity).
But the picture quality is still terrible, and the digital image
stabilization, whatever that is, is useless.
Here two shots taken at 1/60s and 1/30s
respectively, which I can normally hold well enough without shaking.
The following photos
are in pairs, the full frame and a 600×450 pixel selection.
The Traveler has 14 MP (2 MP
more than my
Olympus
E-30 !), while the Nikon has only 6 MP, so clearly the size of the crop is different,
but that way the “small” images render directly.
I took the remaining photos with the Traveler mounted on a tripod, so any unsharpness here
is not due to camera shake.
The first pair is taken with the Traveler, the second with the
Nikon.
The details show that it's still not at all sharp, and there is clear serration (or
pixellation?) on the leaves.
The colour is also very washed-out.
The Nikon is better in
both regards:
The photos of the birch trees show amazingly poor resolution, far worse than the Nikon.
There are clear JPEG artefacts round the leaves:
One issue is probably the
JPEG
image size.
The 12 MP JPEGs from my E-30 are typically about 7 MB in size, and the 6 MP JPEGs of the
Nikon are about 2.5 MB.
The original JPEGs for the Traveler photos above ranged from 3.5 to
7.7 MB.
Clearly there's been some pretty aggressive compression there.
So: in summary, no, it's still a terrible camera.
About the only thing that I'm no longer
so sure about is the discrepancy in the exposure that I saw last time, but that could have
been due to the way the exposure measurements are performed.
A new camera for Yvonne
Topic: photography
Link here
Yvonne 's camera is clearly no longer usable, and next week
she's off to
Albury
for a
dog training seminar, and clearly she'd like to take a camera with her.
Spent a lot of time
looking for something for her, hampered by a number of things:
Yvonne wants the smallest, thinnest camera she can find.
She found the Traveler too thick
(2.0 cm).
She needs image stabilization, which adds to the thickness.
This kind of camera isn't as sexy as DSLRs, and there are very few tests of them.
In
particular, there are a number of cameras for which I have found no tests at all.
The manufacturers seem to enjoy giving multiple different names to the same camera, just
to confuse the issue.
The vendors seem to enjoy spelling the names differently.
The cameras on
eBay
don't seem to match the
reviews.
The manufacturers don't document older cameras.
One potential camera was the Olympus T
100.
But
Google
only found
one page
which
barely mentions it, though it does link to a
better
description .
In the case of others, though, I drew a complete blank.
Magazines seem to test cameras from the biggest manufacturers, and I have my doubts about
their impartiality.
In the end, took a look at the
Budget Camera Shootout
published in
Digital Camera Resource
and
decided on the
IXUS 105 , or
maybe the American name
PowerShot SD1300 IS , or perhaps the
IXY 200F
as it's called in Japan.
Why do they do that?
The were available from Hong Kong for $148, including postage, but I found one in Australia
for $156.85, so in view of the urgency, I bought that one.
Then I discovered that I had
misread the model number.
And I had Bought It Now!
The vendor offered returns, so I
contacted them and asked if I could do an immediate return.
No, the return was just an
exchange if the thing was DOA.
So I had to bite the bullet and pay a $15 restocking fee,
and then buy the one from Hong Kong (thus lowering the loss to $6.15).
They say that the
postage will be fast; we'll see.
But what a pain this all is!
It took me half the day.

More raw conversion comparisons
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
I still haven't got my head (or my stomach) around
Olympus
Viewer 2 , but I do need to do some more comparisons before my test license for
DxO Optics "Pro"
runs out.
In particular, I haven't done any comparison of lens distortion yet.
I know
from past experience that my
Zuiko Digital ED
12-60mm F2.8-4.0 SWD , otherwise an excellent lens, has severe barrel distortion at
full wide-angle and close up.
Here's an example, taken about 20 cm from an A4-sized test
chart:
Running the cursor over the image shows what DxO makes of it:
much
better.
It's also
better at longer focal lengths (also meaning further away, of course).
Here it is at 60 mm
focal length (left), still not as good as the
Zuiko Digital ED 50mm F2.0
Macro
(right).
It's clear that I'm right to use the macro lens for any close-up work.
But the images themselves, taken with on-camera flash, are terrible.
I need to take better
images and then compare them with Olympus.
In the process, had to load a number of DxO “modules”.
It proves to be very
simplistic about that; it can't download the modules directly when it finds they're needed.
At the very least you need to abort the processing, and then there was some way to get it to
load the ones it wants, but it didn't show today.
So I tried loading all 8 combinations: 4
lenses for two cameras.
I already had 3 of them, but that didn't stop it loading all 8
anyway.
They're quite big—I think I loaded about 120 MB in total.
Frustration with Manfrotto panorama bracket
Topic: photography
Link here
So I've come up with a plan to work around the serious defects of the
Manfrotto 303PLUS
panorama head .
In the process I found that I can reposition the mounting for the L
bracket slightly, which would solve the adjustment problem I mentioned
a couple of days ago .
Or I should be able to:
The problem is that one of the screws was done up so tight that the Allen key killed the
socket, and I can't get it out.
Spent quite some time trying to drill it out, but
paradoxically it seems that the rest of the screw is so solid that I can't drill through it,
and I want to avoid damaging the rail itself.
Somehow these screws are another indication
of brain damage in the design of the rail.
For some reason there are two different screws
with different shapes, though the thread is the same:
Why do they do that?
It doesn't make any sense, and it seems that the dished recess for the
right-hand screw makes it easy to overtighten it.
It's clearly stuck to the rail and not
the mount, which I can move slightly, but not enough to unscrew it.
I'll have to consider
alternative ways of removing it.
What a pain!

Olympus Viewer 2
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
As planned, did some playing around with
Olympus
Viewer 2
today.
It's amazing how much reading I need to do for any of this stuff.
Somehow the whole approach is different.
I won't complain about the file name selection any more; all commercial software has that
problem.
But according to the help (which only showed up when I downloaded a 12 month old
update—why didn't I get that version from the web site?), I need to process every
image individually.
Maybe that's what they mean by this silly word
“develop”—they're still thinking in terms of darkrooms and chemicals.
It's possible that I'll find a way to apply the corrections to a set of images, but it's not
the way they present it, and I haven't found one yet.
The conversions themselves?
I didn't do many, and I haven't got round to doing the
presentation yet.
But it certainly does a good job with automatic correction of lens
distortion, notably the close-up with the
Zuiko Digital ED
12-60mm F2.8-4.0 SWD
at full wide-angle.
Strangely, though, it didn't do an automatic
correction of the chromatic aberration.
If I really have to do that manually every time, I
don't think I'll bother.
But I'm not done yet.
This takes an amazing amount of time to investigate.
Officially winter

The weather isn't as chilly as it has been, but there are warnings of more frosts.
Finally
got round to moving the
Mandevilla
into the greenhouse for winter.
I'll consider that a sign that winter is here.
It's still flowering happily.
It'll be interesting to see how it survives the winter.
In
previous years it only just survived.

House photos with new hardware
Topic: photography, opinion
Link here
House photo day again today.
I had intended to take the photos with the new panorama
hardware, but it wasn't really ready.
About the only thing I used was the
Manfrotto
3416 leveling base, which even Manfrotto
doesn't want to know about.
They have replaced it with the
model 338 , which looks pretty much identical to me.
So I mounted that on the tripod, replacing the
ball head I had previously been using, and put the pan and tilt head on top of that:
What did I get out of that?
It wasn't all positive.
On the one hand, I got much better
leveling—the spirit level is much more sensitive than on the old ball head—and
the base was much more stable than the ball head, which tended to move when I adjusted the
pan and tilt head.
But on the other hand, as I suspected, adjustments are less than
perfect.
Firstly the 120° orientation of the adjusting screws makes it difficult to adjust
correctly, and then there's a very limited adjustment range further hampered by the lack of
any “reset to mid-point” functionality.
So I had to resort to changing the
length of the tripod legs, which is exactly what this base is supposed to eliminate.
Once
again, it seems, an expensive tool that doesn't really do what it is intended for.
Last week I took photos into the sun with additional images where I blocked out the sun with
my hand.
That was a great improvement, but I'm not there yet.
I blocked out too much, and
as a result the images look burnt out in areas where it's not necessary:
Today I tried with something smaller, a teaspoon:
It's still not perfect—probably that's not possible without retouching with
GIMP
or similar—but it's a lot better.
Trailer ramps and photo hardware
Topic: general, photography
Link here
We've been given some free trailer ramps via
Freecycle , but when
Yvonne
went into town to pick them
up yesterday, she discovered they wouldn't fit into the car.
Today I borrowed Chris
Yeardley's LandBruiser and went in to pick them up.
While I was there, dropped into
Ballarat Bolts and Fasteners
in the rather vain hope to find a replacement for the
damaged screw in the panorama head.
To my surprise, they had an almost exact
replacement, just about 1 mm longer—something that is no problem at all.
I had been
fearing that I'd have to order one from Italy and pay real money for it, but the thing cost
35¢. so I bought three of them to be on the safe side.
Then on to
Gays
to
look for various bits and pieces, some of which I found.
Found a better-looking extractor
for the damaged screw, but no hardware for mounting the projector or closing the skylight.
I suppose I'll have to go to
Bunnings , but
not today: Chris needed her car back.

Finishing the panoramas
Topic: photography, opinion
Link here
Continued working on my panoramas today, in the process running into more annoyances with
DxO Optics "Pro" .
There was a bug in one of the scripts I wrote to work around DxO's deficiencies (no
EXIF data, wrong directory), and I accidentally truncated a number of files to 0.
No
problem, just run the conversion again.
But how?
DxO knows that the files have been converted, and that's once and for all.
To
quote
John 19:22 , “What I have
written, I have written”.
There seems to be no way to do it again.
What if you want
to try two different conversions for different purposes?
No idea.
Deleting the output
files doesn't seem to help.
In the end I created a new “Project”, something
that I really don't want at all, and processed the files again.
Why do people make things
so difficult?
All I want is a program that takes input and creates output.
Run it again,
it does it again.
Processing the panoramas took me until lunch time.
The trick with the spoon improved
things, but as I suspected, it's not really sufficient.
I'll put up with the current
situation for the time being.
Panorama bracket: more frustration
Topic: photography
Link here
After that to the garage with my new tools to drill out the defective screw from the
panorama bracket.
Total failure.
Despite the fact that I was able to strip the socket for
the
Allen key —though I may just
have completed what somebody else started—I was unable to drill a hole into it.
The
instructions with the screw extractor stated that I should drill a 4 mm pilot hole for it.
I had bought a new set of drill bits just in case, but it wasn't up to the strength of the
screw.
Despite cooling the bit several times, it burnt out before I got more than 1 mm into
the screw.
As if that wasn't bad enough, the extractor had a strange socket that I've never seen
before, about 5 mm square.
I have no idea what kind of handle would take it, but I don't
have one.
Put it in the drill—probably not a good idea—but it didn't engage in
the screw, either because it was too hard, the pilot hole wasn't deep enough, or both.
So I
tried drilling out the screw with a 6.5 mm bit, also brand new, in the hope of removing the
head.
That bit, too, burnt out before I got more than about 1 mm into the screw:
Clearly this is a particularly hard screw—I haven't had anything like these
difficulties before.
So how
do
I get it out?
For the moment I'm stumped.
I'm also
amazed that the Allen key socket of so hard a screw could be damaged by a normal Allen key.
And in view of this problem,
WHY
did
Manfrotto
use this kind of screw?
I've established with the new screws that they sit
extremely firmly, and even a slight overtightening makes it very difficult to undo them.
I
can imagine that I'm not the only person to run into this problem.

DHL: Fast delivery without excuses
Topic: general, opinion, photography
Link here
I've been following the progress of
Yvonne 's camera over the
weekend.
Although I paid for it on
Wednesday , it didn't
get sent until Friday evening, by
DHL .
It got to
Australia pretty quickly, and I was expecting to see it here today.
But what did the
tracking page 	say?
Awaiting pick up by recipient as requested as of: May 16, 2011 09:55
Called up DHL on 13 14 06—I had to find the phone number in the phone book, since it's
not modern to make that kind of information available on the web—and spoke to Jodie,
who told me that the courier passed by our house at 9:55 and found nobody home, so he took
it to Sebastopol Post Office.
It seems that they had entrusted the parcel to a third party
called Eparcel, so they can't do anything about it.
That's nonsense, of course.
I was here the whole time, and if DHL wants to get somebody
else to deliver, fine, but they're still responsible.
Asked to be connected to her
superior—why do I always end up having to do that?—and while I waited listened
to the blurb they have instead of music: “Rely on DHL”, “Fast delivery
without excuses”.
At least I had some ammunition by the time Angela replied.
That was informative in both directions.
It seems that
eParcel
is a service of of Australia
Post, who don't deliver here—something that Angela didn't know.
I asked why they
entrusted the delivery to a lesser class of service, which she also couldn't answer.
I
asked for compensation, and she wanted to send me a claim form by email, which, based on my
experience with this kind of company, I really didn't want to do.
But she said it would be
OK, and she would wait on the phone until it arrived.
Indeed, the message did arrive, and so we left it at that.
Only later did I read it:
[-- Attachment #2: AU Claim Evaluation Form.ZIP --]
[-- Type: application/x-zip-compressed, Encoding: base64, Size: 552K --]
[-- application/x-zip-compressed is unsupported (use 'v' to view this part) --]
Sigh
why do people do this?
Saved the archive, and looked at it:

I might have known.
Just dealing with this kind of environment drives me mad.
Decided to
get away from it all, pick up the camera and visit a couple of new plant nurseries on the
Midland Highway
somewhere near
Meredith , if my
calculations were correct.
Picked up the new camera, and then the navigator wanted to take us through Ballarat, though
Meredith is in the other direction.
Set off anyway and then checked.
It seems that my
calculations were wrong.
Both places are on the other side
of
Ballarat .
Gave that a miss and
decided to take a look at the
Buninyong Botanic Gardens
instead, which I believe is celebrating its 150th
anniversary this year—not that you'd find that out from the web page, which appears
not to have been updated in 3 years.
The gardens are tiny.
If I can extrapolate from the description, it's 10 acres (4 ha), only
about 3 times the size of our current garden.
But it's quite pretty:
The new camera
Topic: photography
Link here
Back home and took a look at the camera.
It came without any instructions, just a CD-R with
a copy of the
manual , which I had already downloaded last week.
The manual states all the names it
knows for the camera: “PowerShot SD1300 IS”, “IXUS 105” and
“Digital Elph”.
It also contains the advice “Make sure you read this
guide before using the camera”.
Checking the following page, it seems that this document is only supplied in PDF form.
There should have been a “Getting started” document, a warranty card and a
“Canon Customer Support” leaflet.
Of all these, there was just a single sheet
of paper written in Japanese except for the text, in the middle of one page, “This
warranty is valid only in Japan”.
But then, it isn't a “PowerShot SD1300 IS”.
It also isn't a “IXUS
105”, nor is it a “Digital Elph”.
It's an IXY 200F, as both the box and
the camera itself say:
The image on the manual doesn't have anything written where the IXY is on this case, but it
seems that the other models have their model number instead.
It's a little early to say much about the camera.
It makes a solid impression
(“heavy”, as
Yvonne
would put it), and it's not
noticeably smaller than the
Kodak M1093 IS .
The
USB connection seems to be particularly useless: you can't charge the camera with it (you
need to put it in the charger), and it doesn't want to provide a mass storage interface.
I
suppose it's modern to require special software to access special devices, something that
people recognized as a serious problem 40 years ago, and for
which
Unix
in particular found good
solutions.
Yvonne took some photos with it and despite the image stabilization managed to
get camera shake at 1/60 s.
But then, that happened with the Kodak too.
Correcting underexposure
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
I took two photos at the
Buninyong
Botanic Gardens : the first time round I discovered I had the camera set to manual
exposure, which proved to be 3.7 EV underexposed:
Not a problem, since I noticed it and took a correctly exposed version.
But it's
interesting to see what my software can do.
Tried
DxO Optics "Pro"
and
Ashampoo photo optimizer , both individually
and in combination.
The results, though not as good as correct exposure, and surprisingly
good given the extreme underexposure.
Here Ashampoo, DxO and both:
This was all with automatic settings.
I suspect I could do even better with a few manual
tweaks, but DxO is so horribly slow that I couldn't be bothered.

Image stabilization
Topic: photography, opinion
Link here
I was rather surprised that
Yvonne
managed to get camera
shake at 1/60 s in her photos yesterday, but it matches what I saw with the
Traveler Z14 .
Tried a
couple of forgettable photos of Yvonne in her office, one with the
Canon IXY 200F
and one with the
E-30 .
The Canon chose a
shutter speed of 1/10s, so I set the Olympus to the same.
The results show some camera shake with the Canon (first two photos), less with the Olympus:
The fuzziness in the Canon shot is much more pronounced laterally than vertically, so it's
camera shake, not focus.
Presumably it would have been OK at 1/60s, but it's also clear
that the Canon produces a considerably worse image than the Olympus, and that the image
stabilization isn't nearly as good.
But I suppose that's to be expected.
On the other
hand, the white balance looks better.

Slowly in the garden
Topic: gardening
Link here
The weather hasn't been conducive to garden work lately, but there's plenty to be done.
Removed another hop rhizome, taking about an hour to do so.
It's tiring work, and there are
still another two to be done.
Put them off to some other time and attended to the overgrown bed that I last worked on
two weeks ago .
Spent yet more time trying to
remove the stump of the River Red Gum that we tried to remove
18 months ago .
Got through the lateral roots, but it's still firm as a
rock.
Looks like I'll have to cut down under it.
Also found yet more bulbs:
I had difficulty finding space for the ones I found two weeks ago, and I still don't know
what to do with these ones.
It's amusing to think that at the time I bought them, I was
concerned how few there were.

Slow progress in the garden
Topic: gardening

Somehow I'm not making much progress in the garden.
It's been windy lately, and I've had to
tie down the
Alyogyne huegelii ,
which has nearly been uprooted.
Did a bit of weeding—I really should be planting
things.

More garden progress

The weather's nicer again, and so more work in the garden.
Finally got all the bulbs
planted, both the ones I dug out the other day and the ones we bought at
Lambley Nursery
nearly a
month ago .
Most of them are in the garden area east of the verandah.
Also more
attention to the weeds in the north bed; there's some satisfaction in removing large
quantities of weeds, though there's no point unless I get out all the roots too.

Too windy for photos
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
Today should have been garden photo day, like every Saturday, but it was too windy.
I
should have done them yesterday: the weather forecast was correct, and they're forecasting
more wind tomorrow and rain on Monday.
Still, did some photo processing, notably the egg photos.
And for some reason the
Ashampoo
photo optimizer didn't want to run.
It just hung there, and when I aborted with
^C , I got the message:
err:module:attach_process_dlls "winspool.drv" failed to initialize, aborting
What caused that?
I really have no idea.
Tried a new version of
wine , but got the same problem I noted on
18 March 2011 :
ELF interpreter /libexec/ld-elf.so.1 not found
Abort trap: 6
This appears to be related to the value of
kern.maxdsiz , which I have set to
2048000000 bytes.
Jürgen Lock tells me that that's no longer needed, but it's not something
I feel like testing right now.
We'll see what problems I run into with the new system.
Reinstalled the old version of
wine
and discovered that it wasn't a complete hang: it
took several minutes to start up, and then it ran.
No idea why.
I'll see if I run into the
same problems with the new system.

Removing the Verbena
Topic: gardening
Link here
We've had our eye on removing
the
Aloysia citrodora
(Lemon
Verbena) for some time, but it's really more like moving: we don't want to get rid of the
plant altogether.
Last month
I took some
cuttings, and finally a couple are showing signs of taking, so today was the big day:
You can almost hear the
Camellia
behind
breath a sigh of relief.
The strike rate on the cuttings wasn't very high, so planted a few
more as well.

Belated house photos
Topic: photography, opinion
Link here
Today the weather was finally—just—good enough to take the house photos, with a
few more parts of the
new Manfrotto 303PLUS
panorama head :
Last week I just used the leveling head.
This week I had the main part of the panorama head
as well, including the rotator.
How did it go?
I've found more problems, of a more basic
nature.
Firstly, yes, the leveling base is becoming a nuisance.
It has only two advantages over the
much cheaper ball head I was using before:
It's more stable.
It has a better spirit level, allowing more accurate adjustments.
But that's all.
It's bulky and difficult to adjust, and in particular it doesn't have the
range, so I'm still continually changing the length of the tripod legs.
But if I do that, I
don't need the leveling head except for the spirit level.
And there must be a cheaper way
to get that, possibly electronic.
And the panorama bracket?
Well, the layout is almost unchanged, so there wasn't much
difference except for the rotator with the click stops.
That is “nice to have”,
but it didn't stop me taking one shot too few on one occasion:
I only took 11 instead of 12 shots, and there's a little bit missing at the bottom towards
the right.
I've left it that way because it's part of a series.
Apart from that, there are
disadvantages too: if I want to take less than a 360° panorama, the start and end points are
important.
The following 180° photo is made from 6 shots taken at 30° increments:
Clearly the start and end points are important, and I used to do this by manually selecting
directions 30° apart.
But now I'm locked in to particular directions, and I can't select
the starting point.
The only way to move the head so that the start point is somewhere in
between is to rotate the tripod.
So I set it to 15° and took every second detent.
Not
quite the comfort I was looking for.
As if that wasn't enough, there are protrusions on the bracket that limit the angle that the
camera can be turned towards the ground:
In particular, the brass screw at the top right appears in the picture if the camera is
tilted too far down.
Of course, this bracket isn't designed for that sort of thing, but
it's completely unnecessary and somehow an indication of the limited thought that has gone
into designing the bracket.
In summary, I don't really have much more than I had before.
The big part is still to come:
rotating the lens about the nodal point when mounted horizontally.
Finally extracted the screw
Topic: photography, opinion
Link here
While in town, dropped in at Ballarat Automotive and asked Paul Sperber to extract the screw
from my panorama bracket.
I had to wait in the reception, and I heard a surprising amount
of banging from the workshop.
After about 10 minutes he returned, confirming that the thing
had been a real problem, and that he almost thought he wouldn't get it out.
He had finally
removed it by hammering in a
Torx
driver and
twisting it out like that:
Looking at the separated components confirms my low opinion of this device.
The holder for
the camera plate has a groove in it which in no way resembles the profile of the rail it
fits on, and part of the screw thread is missing as a result.
The third image shows the
holder on top of the rail with the gap in between:
Why do people build things like that?

Garden flowers in late autumn
Topic: gardening
Link here
Took my monthly
garden flower photos
today.
It's clear that summer is over—in fact, autumn is nearly over—and
there aren't nearly as many flowers as last month.
Of those that are still looking happy,
the
Alstroemerias
and
the
Begonias
are particularly obvious:
Those are the volunteer Begonias; the expensive tuberous one still has a couple of flowers
on, but it's nothing to look at.
Flowers that seem to be really coming into their own now seem to be
the
Alyogyne ,
the
Dahlia imperialis
and the
unknown ginger sort that had been looking relatively unhappy
last month :
Some of the
Grevilleas
are still
flowering, and the
Hardenbergia
violacea
is just starting:
Some
Hebe
or another seems to flower most of
the time, though they're gradually dying back:
Some of the
Salvias
are also doing well,
the
Salvia microphylla
that we
have had here since the beginning, and
the
Salvia leucantha
that we
bought only
a couple of months ago :
Other things that are looking relatively happy are some of
the
Pelargoniums ,
the
Tradescantia
and the
Vinca minor :
In the greenhouse, this season's tomatoes are gradually dying back, though we still have
flowers, and some of the new ones are also flowering.
So is the lemon, and the creeper
cuttings that
Yvonne
brought back
from
Albury
seem not to
have noticed that they have been cut and replanted.
And
the
Mandevilla
is still flowering
happily:

Sourdough in Dereel
Topic: general, cooking, brewing, gardening
Link here
I started my next batch of
sourdough bread 	yesterday, and by chance somebody on
Freecycle
asked for a starter today.
Even more unusually, the person was
in
Dereel .
Sent a reply offering to show
them how I made the bread, but they didn't call back until I had started: it seems that
Freecycle has significant delays in sending messages.
The person in question turned out to be Peter Dilley, with whom I had spoken about brewing
last month .
He came by with his wife Victoria
and picked up the starter, lending me a couple of books while he was at it.
He also left
with one of the Pride of Ringwood hop rhizomes and a number of garden cuttings.
Had an
interesting discussion.
We're planning to do some cooperative brewing sessions.

Strange camera problems
Topic: photography, technology
Link here
Yvonne
asked me to take some photos of her riding Carlotta,
so out onto the road.
Carlotta is gaited, so it made sense to take some high-speed
sequences.
In all photos I used manual focus, because I can't count on the autofocus to do
the right thing so quickly.
I have a “focus once” function button on the
camera, which performs an autofocus when in manual mode.
Pressed that and took some photos.
First took a single photo, then switched to high speed sequence.
Here the first (normal
mode) and the first of the sequence:
Not only was the complete sequence out of focus, but it was overexposed by 2 stops.
What
went wrong?
Took at look at the
EXIF
data,
but there wasn't anything obvious to note.
Here extracts of a
diff :
-File Name                       : P5316639.JPG

-Light Value                     : 12.0
+Light Value                     : 10.0
But why can the focus suddenly be “Not ready”?
Did I maybe change the focus
when I set the multiple exposure mode?
Or is this what it says when I didn't manually
autofocus before taking the image?
Comparing with other images taken in sequence in manual
mode, it seems not to be the case.
Only later did I discover that one of the sequence was recorded as having been rotated by
270°.
Here a comparison with the following image, taken in sequence.
These are sequential images, as the
Special Mode
below shows, and taken in
the same second.
Not only does it claim rotation, but also that the focal length and focus
distance (in manual? how does that work?) had changed:
-File Name                       : P5316644.JPG
+File Name                       : P5316645.JPG

-Light Value                     : 10.0
+Light Value                     : 9.6
Fortunately I noticed the overexposure at the time and did a bit of checking.
First the
thing told me I had no card in the slot.
Powered off, popped and reseated the card, and
after that (and powering on, of course) it worked again, and I got some reasonable photos:
That worries me, though.
Why did it happen?
Will it happen again?
How will I know in
time?
Preparing for winter
Topic: gardening
Link here
Gradually the combination of cool weather and the winds of the past week have transformed
the garden, and it's looking quite wintery.
While looking around, discovered a plant that I
had thought was an
Iris .
It's
blooming for the first time, and it looks nothing like an Iris:
I thought it was one of the plants I bought at the
Melbourne
International Flower and Garden Show
two years ago, and indeed I have a photo of
something like that in my diary entry for the day:
Unfortunately, the description isn't in sequence with the photos: according to the
description the plant in question (second from right) would be
a
Sedum
“gold mound”, which it
most certainly isn't (the Sedum is in the middle).
I also know the
Liriope muscari
and
the
Sedum
“gold mound”, so that
only leaves the
Carex
morrowii
varieagata
and
the
Iris
japonica
variegata .
Clearly the suffix
variegata
fits.
On the face of it, it has to be the Iris, and
that would mean that I had just transposed the Iris and the Sedum, but it just doesn't look
right.
In any case, the plant was hidden under one of
the
Buddleja globosas .
The Buddlejas
later
proved to
be
Buddleja × weyeriana ,
not globosa.
I had intended to trim the whole hedge back in a month or so when it had finished flowering,
but clearly I couldn't wait that long.
Trimmed the end back, in the process discovering a
number of
Helleborus , which had also
been smothered by grass, and also another bulb of some description.
I'm going to have to be
stricter about how far I allow the Buddleja to grow.
Also a lot of weeding in front of the dining room (south-east of the verandah).
Found some
clump of roots which I vaguely recall planting, but which I think I thought had died, maybe
some kind of
Salix .
It doesn't look too
unhappy, though of course at this time of year it has no leaves.
One thing I notice, though: a lot of these plants aren't flowering.
The Japanese Iris (if
that's what it is) has produced dozens of offspring in the last 2 years, but this is the
first flower I've seen.
None of the other plants aren't flowering, and neither is
the
Canna -like plant near the birdbath.
As
far as I can tell, it has never flowered.
Am I being too miserly with fertilizer?
To be on
the safe side, spread some now, though clearly it's not much use to the Canna, which won't
flower before summer.
