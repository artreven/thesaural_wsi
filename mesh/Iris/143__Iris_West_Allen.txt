When former Transmuto websites Transbuddha and
RazorFine Review
went silent in the Spring of 2010 the Internet found a new home for awesome. You can now find more regular crazed awesomeness at
dadsbigplan , and more current and past reviews at
RazorFine
(which is slowly being rebuilt). Or, if you're in the mood, you can find a little extra random Xplosion of Awesome from the mind of a rabbit super-hero here on a semi-irregular basis.

New trailer arrives for The Avengers (with Decepticons?)
Although it's still giving away nothing about the threat, other than the presence of Loki ( Tom Hiddleston ), I've got to say I'm pretty positive on this second trailer for this summer's big budget super-hero flick
The Avengers . Sure Captain America's ( Chris Evans ) costume still doesn't quite look right, and, more importantly, the action looks far too
Michael Bay
for my tastes (and even includes a giant Depticon-ish looking monstrosity in the final shot), but that shot with Thor ( Chris Hemsworth ) bringing down his Hammer on Captain America's shield? Yeah, that looks pretty cool (and a hellova lot better than that
awful new poster ).
Robert Downey Jr. ,
Scarlett Johansson ,  Cobie Smulders ,  Mark Ruffalo , and  Samuel L. Jackson
also star. The fun stars everywhere on May 4th.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #7
The latest issue of the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
reboot not only gives us the first appearance of
General Krang
and the early beginnings of
Casey
and
April 's relationship, but an entire army of
Mousers
for
Splinter ,
Leonardo , and
Donatello
to take on. With the exception of the introduction of Krang, which I've got to admit works better than I thought it would, storywise this one's a little light as it merely inches the existing stories incrementally forward. However, in terms of action the latest issue proves to be a hell of a lot of fun as the Turtles protect their home from a
seemingly endless supply of killer robots . If you're not reading this comic, I don't know what to tell you. It's got talking brains inside mechanical bodies, giant philosophical rats, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Honestly, what more do you want? Worth a look. [IDW, $3.99]

Morning Glories #16
This month's issue picks up the thread's of
issue #13
(from way back in October) as we finally learn a little more about what happened to  Casey  and
Miss Hodge . The final panels of the earlier issue are true, the pair have traveled back into the past, but far further than Miss Hodge had planned. Casey comes face-to-face with a father who doesn't recognize her (his daughter is only three years-old and safe at home in bed), and has to deal with torture, shock, and an understanding that her life has been turned completely upside-down (even more so than her time at Morning Glories Academy). The issue works pretty well. I'd like a little more explanation in how Miss Hodge enforces her will on others, and how Casey has the same ability. Is it a natural talent, until now untapped? Or is this something Hodge granted her? In either case a little clarity (which I'll admit is asking quite a bit from this comic) would have been nice.

Introducing Jim Lee’s Avengers
Seriously? Take a
look at this
and tell me it doesn't remind you of countless examples of photoshopped characters, all staring in different directions, and always against random destruction in the background, that has become a staple of
Justice League
since the
New 52
reboot.

I Melt with You
I Melt with You
is a mess. The film gathers four 40 year-old friends ( Thomas Jane ,  Jeremy Piven ,  Rob Lowe ,  Christian McKay ) together for a wild alcohol and drug-fueled reunion. Most of the film's first hour is little more than stars acting crazy, drinking and snorting everything in sight, and trying to hide how bad each of their lives has gotten from their old friends. As unstructured and pointless the first 50-minutes are, the rest of the movie is worse. The film takes a dark, and bizarre, turn when one of the friends commits suicide the others gather together to hold to a pact they made when they were kids. They hide the body from a curious local cop ( Carla Gugino ) who has begun to snoop around due to reports of their wild partying, and agree to carry out the plans their dead friend put into motion.

London Boulevard
Recently released from prison, and unwilling to go back to the life that got him sent there, Harry Mitchel ( Colin Farrell ) goes to work for a reclusive English actress ( Keira Knightley ). Charlotte has holed up in her home, with only a friend ( David Thewlis ) for company, hiding from the never-ending pressure from the paparazzi who are continuously camped outside her house for the chance at a single photograph they could sell to the tabloids. The trouble for Mitchel is his old life won't let him go. Even though he doesn't ask for it, Mitchel's old pal Billy ( Ben Chaplin ) gets him a collecting job for a local crime boss named Gant ( Ray Winstone ) who sees Mitchel's worth and wants to make him part of his organization. Mitchel's life is further complicated by his failed attempts to take care of his insane sister ( Anna Friel ), and a personal vendetta as he hunts down two teens who killed a homeless man ( Alan Williams ) Mitchel considered a friend.

The Flash #6
With the
Mob Rule
story finished
the Flash
turns his attention to
Captain Cold
who escaped prison during the blackout. An unintended side-effect of the blackout, which everyone mistakenly believes the Flash caused, is it left Cold's sister slowly wasting away in the hospital who no longer have the power to operated the laser necessary to perform the brain surgery to save her. The comic does a good job re-introducing the character of Captain Cold. I'm not sure I like that he's now a guy with cold powers, rather than his old freeze gun, but writer
Francis Manapul
does through longtime DC readers a bone by allowing the Flash to mention how the villain has changed. Aside from Flash's battle with Cold, and the reason for the villain's new motivations, we also get Barry siting down as an awkward go between between
Patty
and
Iris , and a continuation of the seed planted in last month's issue about the hero's need to watch his speed because there's a chance it could rip apart time and reality. We even get a
giant treadmill . Sweet! Best of the week. [DC, $2.99]

Awesome Characters - Detective Kate Beckett
"Most smart good looking women become lawyers, not cops. And yet here you are. Why? Well, you're not bridge-and-tunnel. No trace of the boroughs when you talk. So that means Manhattan. That means money. You went to college, probably a pretty good one. You had options. Yeah, you had a lot of options, more socailly acceptable options. But you still chose this. That tells me, something happened. Not to you. No, you're wounded, but you're not that wounded. No, it was someone you care about, it was someone you loved. And you probably could have lived with that but the person responsible was never caught." There are characters we fall in love with. The perfect mix of actor and writer that breathes magic onto the screen or inside the television. Known for her interest in unusual cases and haunted by the unsolved murder of her mother, New York City Homicide Detective Kate Beckett strives to give the kind of closure and justice to families of murder victims that she herself has yet to achieve. Beckett works as a detective for Twelfth Precinct Homicide Squad of the New York City Police Department. Under the leadership of Captain Roy Montgomery ( Ruben Santiago-Hudson ), and later Captain Victoria Gates ( Penny Johnson ), Beckett leads a small group of homicide detectives including Kevin Ryan ( Seamus Dever ) and Javier Espisito ( Jon Huertas ).

Act of Valor
Acting, it turns out, is harder than it looks. The experiment from co-directors
Mike McCoy
and
Scott Waugh
to cast real
Navy SEALs
instead of actors for the lead roles in
Act of Valor
produces mixed results and probably shouldn't be repeated any time soon. Act of Valor
isn't an awful film but it feels oddly put together. At times it films like a documentary, a pseudo-documentary, an action flick, and a hamfisted USA Armed Forces recruitment film. Despite giving us a group of impressive action sequences these pieces don't fit together well. It's hard to blame the SEALs, who were chosen to showcase what the real soldiers can do in combat situations, when they are given such uneven writing to work with. It's true, that with the possible exception of the oldest member of the team, the group certainly aren't natural actors, but  Kurt Johnstad 's script doesn't do them any favors with its share of awkward dialogue.

Hawaii Five-0 – Kupale
Five-0 is called into the jungle to investigate the murder of a John Doe dressed up as a Hawaiian NaKoa warrior whose body was discovered by a tourist. Despite Max's ( Masi Oka ) initial theory of time travel, it turns out the victim was part of a group participating in a historical reenactment, complete with period dress and weapons, run by McGarrett's ( Alex O'Loughlin ) old friend Mamo ( Al Harrington ) .

Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi #1
I understand full well that
Star Wars
comics are a mixed bag. Although I'm a fan of the
Expanded Universe
novels that have continued the tales of
Luke ,
Han ,
Leia
and their children, the expanded comics stories have more misses than hits. When I heard the idea of
Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi
I was intrigued by how John Ostrander would choose to tell the beginnings of the
Jedi Order . I know I should have known better, but I gave it a shot. This comic is a mess, from beginning to end. Although the art by Jan Duursema has a cinematic quality to it, and is pretty enough to look at, the story itself is a disaster that begins with a 12-page narration of the beginnings of the Jedi Order... and then moves quickly into the future to give us a story seemingly only slightly connected to the "Dawn of the Jedi." Also troubling is the fact the series takes at the beginning but Jedi already have lightsabers? And there are Sith (who look like
generic Vader wannabes )? The Force is not strong with this one. Pass. [Dark Horse, $3.50]

Winter Soldier #2
Part of the trouble when starting a new comic is the time necessary to set-up not only the story you want to tell but the characters, the villains, their motivations and relationships, and even the world in which the comic takes place. Despite beginning with
Bucky
and the
Black Widow
taking on a
gorilla with a machine gun and a jet-pack
(which is pretty damn cool) the second issue of
Winter Soldier
gets bogged down a bit by still setting up what this comic is going to be. Winter Soldier #2
isn't a bad read, but I'm still not quite sold on the art by
Butch Guice
which simply isn't my taste (although it fits well enough with the Cold War spy story the comic kinda wants to be), and the story gets a little bogged down by stopping to explain more about the Soviet assassins the Winter Soldier trained and give us a little more insight into the plans of
Lucia Von Bardas . The comic is still worth a look but I think once writer
Ed Brubaker
can spend less time on set-up and let the stories flow more naturally I'll be happier with the result. Worth a look. [Marvel, $2.99]

Puss in Boots
Reprising his role from
Shrek 2 ,
Antonio Banderas  returns in this prequel which explores the history and legend of
Puss in Boots . The
Shrek
spin-off is available on Blu-ray and DVD this Friday. Puss in Boots
centers around the relationship between Puss ( Antonio Banderas ) and Humpty ( Zach Galifianakis ) whose childhood friendship was destroyed after Humpty violated Puss' trust by tricking him into becoming an outlaw. Reunited with Humpty and his companion Kitty Softpaws ( Salma Hayek ), and against his better judgement, Puss agrees to help Humpty fulfill his childhood dream of climbing the beanstalk and finding the goose that lays the golden eggs. To achieve this they'll have to steal the magic beans from Jack ( Billy Bob Thornton ) and Jill ( Amy Sedaris ) and stay one step ahead of the murderous pair to claim the prize.

Martha Marcy May Marlene
Elizabeth Olsen  stars in writer/director  Sean Durkin 's story of a woman's struggles to reassmilate with the outside world after living in a cult for two years. Durkin's tale is a slow burn thriller that jumps between flashbacks of Martha's (Olsen) time in the Catskill Mountains and her present paranoia and uncertainty now that she's left that world behind. Out of the blue Lucy ( Sarah Paulson ), receives a phone call from a phone call from her younger sister and brings Martha home to live with her and her husband Ted ( Hugh Dancy ). The longer Martha stays with the couple the more obvious it becomes that there is something seriously wrong with her. Not only does Martha not understand basic boundaries (like not coming into her sister's room and laying down on the bed when Lucy is having sex with her husband), but she's also haunted by memories of the cult, which she will not discuss with her sister, and feels increasingly suspicious that they are still watching her and laying in wait to bring her back into their family.

Daredevil #9
Matt Murdock
heads underground (after a rather lame joke as
Foggy
notices Matt
wearing his Daredevil boots under his clothes) to discover what has happened to his father's body and several others that have been stolen from the cemetery where he was put to rest. I've never been a fan of the
Mole Man . The me the Silver Age
Fantastic Four
villain is better left in the 60's. So maybe it's that the latest issue of
Daredevil
is a Mole Man storyline, or perhaps its the fact that Matt Mudrock's wild night with the
Black Cat
isn't directly addressed (other than one or two
thought panels and a momentary hesitation by the thief robbing him), or maybe it's because so much of this issue felt like
LOTR
(a ton of walking before we get to any action), but I didn't think this issue #9 was as good as I expected. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the issue, and I'm sure writer
Mark Waid 's explanation into the Mole Man's behavior is a good one. I'm just hoping the arc ends quickly and get back to the Black Cat and the mysterious FF artifact everyone is after. Worth a look. [Marvel, $2.99]

Tower Heist
Director
Brett Ratner
hasn't had what I would call a distinguished career. Other than the fun, but increasingly dumb,
Rush Hour
series
the director's filmography mostly contains movies which are best left forgotten. However, at least for me, the true highlight of Ratner's career was a heist film he made back in 2004 starring  Pierce Brosnan ,  Salma Hayek ,
Woody Harrelson , and  Don Cheadle .
After the Sunset
isn't a great film by any definition, but it is a pretty good heist flick that's far more fun than it has any right to be. When I heard Ratner was going to try his hand at another heist film I was cautiously optimistic. Sadly,
Tower Heist , even with a pretty good cast and relatively low expectations, is something of a disappointment.

Nightwing #6
While
Haly's Circus
travels across the country
Nighwing
spends his free time
beating up thugs
for any information about
Saiko . But when
Raya
informs Dick the circus will be returning to Gotham for the anniversary of his parents' death, Dick knows exactly when his mysterious enemy will choose to strike. Here's another
New 52
storyline that has been dragged out far too long. At the end of the sixth issue the villain is revealed (which may shock Grayson but does nothing for the reader as we still have no idea who Raymond is or what his insane grudge against Dick is). There are some nice moments including Raya wavering on her part of Raymond's plan and an uncoonected scene involving a cops retreiving one of Nightwing's batons from a murder scene. Whether this is frame job is part of Raymond's plan, or something else, we'll just have to wait and see. Worth a look. [DC, $2.99]

The Mentalist - War of the Roses
Although Lisbon ( Robin Tunney ) thinks it's a terrible idea, Jane ( Simon Baker ) is intrigued when he is contacted by one of the murderers he helped put away, Erica Flynn ( Morena Baccarin ), who believes she can help CBI solve the latest murder of a woman ( Christine Garver ) who was once her client.

Red Hood and the Outlaws #6
The latest issue of
Red Hood and the Outlaws
takes a look back at the first meeting between
Jason Todd
and
Starfire
months before the events of the first issue. Writer
Scott Lobdell
has taken quite a bit of heat for the current version of Starfire and this month's comic is obviously an attempt to try and molify some of the criticism the title has garnered. You can certainly argue Lobdell's writing has been lacking in how he has expressed the character's redesign on the page, but I'm actually like the idea of expanding on the character's existing alien look at emotional and physical relationships. In more than one way Kory saves Jason Todd in this issue, first from his wounds and later by offering her friendship and a simple view of the world that at least begins to put him on a better path. Would I like this version of Kory to be a little more sentimental and care about the past? Sure. But as a concept her current outlook fits not only the redesign of the character but also the comic and relationship with Todd she finds herself in.

Super Dinosaur #8
As
Doctor Dynamo
and his team learn the Exile has taken control of Squidious' former soldiers and is working on gaining access to inner-Earth
Derek
must also deal with the gravest threat to his world - a homeschool evaluation.
Derek's quandary over taking part in the mission and reporting to Miss Finkle for his grade school exemption is solved by doing both at the same time, with the help of an android duplicate. Of course when things get too crazy in the field and the android malfunctions Derek finds himself under fire from two sides. Although the idea of Derek fighting off monsters underwater while controlling the android from thousands of miles away is an interesting (if highly implausable) one, the reveal doesn't work as well as it should. There's plenty of actions, and a couple of fun moments, but I'm a little afraid
Robert Kirkman
and
Jason Howard 's latest comic (much like
Astounding Wolf-Man ) may have peaked too soon. Here's hoping next issue ramps up the zany fun. Worth a look. [Image, $2.99]

Atomic Robo and the Ghost of Station X #5 (of 5)
It's always fun to get to the final issue of an
Atomic Robo
series and see how writer
Brian Clevinger
will tie things together and what crazy climax artist
Scott Wegener
will save for each series' finale.
Atomic Robo and the Ghost of Station X
has given us a trips to space and Nebraska (which more action-packed than you might initially expect), and Japan, a well-financed shadowy government conspiracy, and a convoy of truckers (for science!). The final issue reveals who has been behind the attacks on
Atomic Robo 's life, and why. And as the title states it's a ghost... well kinda. It's a computer ghost. Under Hashima Island, Japan, Atomic Robo discovers an "Automatic Learning Algorithm Network" built by
Dr. Alan Turning
in 1951. The program has been running unsupervised since Turning lost security clearance the following year. Over time the artifical intelligence has used beureaucrazy, secrecy and telecommunications to influence the world and predict the collapse of human civilization.

The Rothman Disintegration
When a professor is forced to retire Sheldon ( Jim Parsons ) and Kripke ( John Ross Bowie ) fight over which one of them will get his office (which not only gives us the return of
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
but the worst game of one-on-one basketball has ever seen). Meanwhile Penny ( Kaley Cuoco ) struggles to tell Amy ( Mayim Bialik ) she doesn't like her unexpected gift (a hideous painting of the two of them together).

Young Justice #13
In the sewers below Gotham City the
Young Justice
team tracks and
fights the new character of Clayface
(who was introduced in
last month's issue ). The team soon discovers the difficulty in fighting a villain who can assume the shape and mannerisms of anyone he comes into contact with. With
Aqualad
distracted with thought of Atlantis and the team divided
Clayface
takes them down one-by-one. It's only the arrival of
Batman
that saves complete disaster. Although it's a bit of a letdown after a
terrific Batman and Robin issue
and well-done
Talia al Ghul
issue that introduced the character of Clayface,
Young Justice #13
continues to define this new version of Clayface and bring Aqualad's indecision to the forefront as the team is bested far too easily by this new enemy. It will be interesting to see if Aqualad's story plays out in similar fashion to the similar arc on the television show or if the comic takes a different path beginning next month. Worth a look.

Teen Titans return as part of Cartoon Network’s DC Nation
Honestly, other than the catchy theme song I was never a big fan of Cartoon Network's
Teen Titans
which was far too anime in style for my tastes. However, the idea of updating the characters and
returning the New Teen Titans in shorts
as part of DC Nation (the new DC programming block on Cartoon Network which premieres March 3rd) is an intriguing one.

Batman and Robin #6
Damian 's true colors are shown as
Nobody
attempts to turn him into his new sidekick. Not surprisingly, Nobody finds him as hard to control as
Batman
has ever since the
New 52
DC reboot. As Batman searches for his son we get more of the flashbacks of his early days with
Henri Ducard
and his son and the confrontation that led to the end of their partnership. The flashbacks are told almost as if Bruce is making a recording for Damian in case anything happens to him, to let him know the truth. Damian's turning on Nobody is hardly surprising, but I'm thankful writer
Peter J. Tomasi
didn't milk the story for another issue or two. It's also good to see Damian standing up for something other than himself for a change (even if there's no one else to witness it). The final panels, suggesting some serious injury to the boy, should lead to a brutal confrontation between Batman and Nobody in next month's conclusion of the arc. Worth a look. [DC, $2.99]

Captain America #8
Writer
Ed Brubaker 's "Powerless" story arc continues which means we get more of skinny pre-Super-Soldier Serium
Steve Rogers
who finds himself at the mercy of a mob whose anger has been fueled by a Madbomb. I haven't been the biggest fan of this story arc, but it hasn't turned me off the comic either. There's a nice action sequence where Captain America and Sharon Carter get some revenge on
Cobra ,
Eel , and
Viper . We also get a glimpse at how imposing
Sharon Carter
can be in the interrogation room and learn the villains are working with
Codename: Bravo . I feel like I missed a page (or three) as Sharon comes to the conclusion of what
villain
is behind Cap's regression back to Skinny Steve Rogers. It's possible Cobra let this slip off-panel in Sharon's interrogation but I just don't see him knowing that much of the operation. Worth a look. [Marvel, $3.99]

Castle - Pandora
When a body is found choked, shot, stabbed and thrown out a fourth-story window Beckett ( Stana Katic ) and Castle ( Nathan Fillion ) are quick to identify and track down the killer ( David Chisum ), who took a hostage ( Julia Whelan ) and fled the scene. And then things get really interesting.

Green Lantern #6
After being returned to Earth with no way to power the ring
Sinestro
left him
Hal Jordan
picks up the pieces of his life, and his relationship with
Carol Ferris , and puts his past as Green Lantern behind him. Of course the universe has other plans. As Carol tries to get used to the new Hal, Sinestro searches out
Lyssa Drak
but what he learns from the
Book of the Black
shocks him to his core. Now knowing what the
Guardians of the Universe
have in store, with foreknowledge of his own death, and with the entire universe on the brink of disaster, Sinestro has no choice but to search out the only man he can trust - even if that man's name is Hal Jordan. I really enjoyed this issue. It was nice, given the tumultuous events of Jordan's life over the past few years, to see him given a chance to enjoy life - even without a ring. Of course this respite was going to be short lived, but now we'll find out just how far Sinestro is willing to go to stop the future he glimpsed from happening. Worth a look. [DC, $2.99]

In Time
In a world where the population is genetically engineered to stop aging at 25, time becomes a commodity to be bartered, traded, and stolen. Without acquiring more time those who have already reached their 25th birthday begin to see the final year of their limited life start to fade away. When a wealthy benefactor ( Matt Bomer ) looking to die bequeaths Will ( Justin Timberlake ) a century of time the young man from the ghetto learns the truth about how time is horded by the wealthiest class and decides to do something about it. Kidnapping a young girl ( Amanda Seyfried ) and persued by a time cop ( Cillian Murphy ), Will does his best by living day to day with a limited amount of time by committing the worst crime in the world, the same thing that got his father killed - giving away time.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine #6
As
Buffy
deals with news that's she's pregnant writer
Andrew Chambliss
takes the opportunity to showcase not only the current Slayer's fears of what a pregnancy might mean but that of another Slayer who went through the same emotions a few decades earlier -
Robin Wood 's mother
Nikki . For a comic book centered around a tiny blond who kills vampires this issue has quite a bit going on. I'm really liking how personal
Season Nine
feels after
Season Eight
spiraled so far out of control. And for a comic that I've found the art to be inconsistant so far artist
Georges Jeanty
nails the characters this time around. Not only do we get flashbacks between Nikki and her Watcher but we get frank conversations between Buffy and Robin, and later between Buffy and Spike. And, although the some might object, I was certainly impressed how the issue of an abortion was not only introduced but
discussed . Even if you haven't read the first arc of
Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine , if you're a fan of the character you should definitely find a copy, especially if you can find the old school variant cover. Best of the week. [Dark Horse, $2.99]

Scarlet Spider #2
Despite his plans to take the money and run
Kaine
finds himself in Houston protecting a young woman, the lone surviving victim of a human trafficking ring the new Scarlet Spider uncovered last issue. The Scarlet Spider finds himself fighting a fire-controlling assassin intent on killling the girl and anyone else in his way. Despite all his denials Kaine
proves to be a hero , not a killer, by saving the woman and deciding to stay in Houston (at least for the time being). Although we get more narration into Kaine's past we sadly don't get another flashback of the original
Scarlet Spider
this time around. However, the two issues do a pretty good job reintroducing and establishing Kaine as a new hero in the Marvel Universe. Worth a look. [Marvel, $2.99]

Snake Eyes #10
The "Cobra Command" crossover continues as
Cobra
destroys the opium fields of Nanzhao and Storm Shadow's ninja teams take out the U.N. trops helping with the civilian evacuation. Realizing there's no one else for the job
Snake Eyes
take it upon himself, with
Helix
in tow, to go deep into the jungles of Nanzhao and find his blood brother. As
Snake Eyes and Helix
go deep into the jungles we learn the Storm Shadow's latest cat-and-mouse game involving Snake Eyes are not part of the new
Cobra Commander 's master plan. Meanwhile, the rest of the Joes at Fort Baxter try to determine Cobra's endgame and what they are after by depopulating the country, destroying its drug supply, and leaving the highways and utilities intact. There's plenty of ninja action here and more than a little foreshadowing that we're going to get a major throwdown between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow before "Cobra Command" ends. And we've still got plenty of unanswered questions as to what the new Cobra Commander is really after and what plans he has for the dirty nuclear bombs
Destro
is seen unloading in the comic's final panel. Worth a look. [IDW, $3.99]
