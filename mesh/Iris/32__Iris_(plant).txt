The season of the paddy-rice
Weather peculiar to
East Asian rainy season
continues now in the Far East. Hydrangea
and
Iris . They give glory around the rice field. The clothes of the flowers are totally gorgeous like illumination. The season of the
rice
growing began in earnest. Even the
Emperor
plants rice. The
paddy-rice
is Japanese mind itself. Iris is flowers representing this time. It is the beauty of the moisture...

Reply Delete lotusleaf June 29, 2010 at 7:06 PM The rice fields are a familiar sight to me, but not the irises and hydrangia blossoms bordering the field. Beautiful! Reply Delete San June 29, 2010 at 7:16 PM i love hydrangea (we call them hortensias), they're my childhood flowers. and my favorite food is probably rice, too. i see these rice fields of yours bordered with hydrangea and i think they're literally fabulous. Reply Delete LE CHEMIN DES GRANDS JARDINS June 29, 2010 at 7:44 PM Le travail des hommes penchés sur la terre, devient rituel, répétition, rythme corporel. Il se veut, nourricier du
monde et voila que sa perfection devient œuvre d'art, parce qu'un
photographe en a perçu l'essence. Cette photo est un hommage rendu à leur travail. Bravo, Bonne journée, Roger Reply Delete claude June 29, 2010 at 9:37 PM Very nice photos, Ruma !

Reply Delete Beatriz June 30, 2010 at 3:32 AM The first flowers, in spain are called Hortensias.
I lovely your way of being careful and planting the fields of rice; I think the ancestral sophia/Wisdom of the far west is guarded very well after this occupation. If there are as love as careful the field... the earth all the hope in this world is still possible.

Hydrangea's name in Polish is hortensja :) Reply Delete RNSANE July 26, 2010 at 8:31 AM My dear Ruma, how did I ever miss these spectacular photos.
I love the hydraneas ( I am not sure I spelled this correctly ) and the purple irises are so beautiful.
I'm glad I am looking back through some of your photos on the Sunday afternoon.
To have missed this would have made me so sad!! The little rice plants are pretty - I remember my three days in Akita and driving in the countryside and seeing the full grown ones - and tasting the wonderful sake from that area....wonderful. Reply Delete Add comment Load more...
