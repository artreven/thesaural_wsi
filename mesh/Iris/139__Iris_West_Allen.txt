When former Transmuto websites Transbuddha and
RazorFine Review
went silent in the Spring of 2010 the Internet found a new home for awesome. You can now find more regular crazed awesomeness at
dadsbigplan , and more current and past reviews at
RazorFine
(which is slowly being rebuilt). Or, if you're in the mood, you can find a little extra random Xplosion of Awesome from the mind of a rabbit super-hero here on a semi-irregular basis.

Lassiter
1984's
Lassiter
was a pretty obvious attempt to cash in on
Tom Selleck 's popularity from
Magnum, P.I.
It's also surprisingly good. The film was directed by
Roger Young , who also helmed the first episode of for
Magnum
(as well as the TV mini-series adaptation of
The Bourne Identity
starring
Richard Chamberlain  and  Jaclyn Smith ). Although a little dated in spots, the film holds up fairly well nearly 30 years after its initial release. On the eve of World War II, framed for a crime he didn't commit, London's premiere cat burglar Nick Lassiter (Selleck) is pressured by a British Police Investigator ( Bob Hoskins ) and an agent of the FBI ( Joe Regalbuto ) to use his unique skill set to break into German Embassy in London and steal $10 million in precious uncut gems.

Batman: The Dark Knight #9
I wasn't a fan of this Bat-tile before the
New 52
reboot and I've given the new volume a pretty wide berth. However, the latest issue had three points of interest to make me pick it up.
First,
Judd Winick
was guest-writing and although his his latest work hasn't been his best, he's produced good stories in the past. Two, the cover showcased
Red Robin
on the cover (who only appears in one panel, isn't connected to the story at all, and doesn't utter a word). Three, it was a
Night of the Owls
crossover. The problem with this issue, as has been the trouble with almost all of the Night of the Owls crossovers, is that once again the focus here is on a villain, another
Talon , instead of the comic's main character. This issue is all about
Alton Carver , the Talon sent to kill Lincoln March, and his history with the
Court of Owls
and
Batman .

Interviews with Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron
To help promote their upcoming movie
Snow White and the Huntsman , based on the fairy tale by the
Brothers Grimm ,
Kristen Stewart
and
Charlize Theron
each sat down for an
interview with Elvis Mitchell
as well as pose for a photoshoot (which you'll find pics of inside). In the interview Stewart discusses working with female directors, her first role in
The Safety of Objects , how
Twilight
helped her understand the character of Snow White, and her roles in
On the Road ,
The Runaways , and
Welcome to the Rileys . Theron talks about her fear of live performance, her love of playing characters who are hard to love, working with
Tom Hanks
on
That Thing You Do! , and her roles in
Monster
and
Young Adult .

The Flash #9
Writer and artist
Francis Manapul
(along with co-writer
Brian Buccellato ) gives us
the Flash
vs.
Gorilla Grodd , Round One. Honestly, given the early teases we'd seen of the
New 52
versions of Grodd and
Gorilla City
this was better than I expected. I'm not sure I like the change from Gorilla City from an advanced scientific race of apes into a more magical religious group but this certainly wasn't the total disaster which I feared. The Flash shows up in Gorilla City at a loss as to how he arrived there and who he is and learns from a group of elder Gorillas that the secret tribe worship the Lightning (the
Speed Force ) and the prophesied appearance of
the Runner
(the Flash). Although awkward in places, the comic picks up after the Flash regains his memory and puts down Grodd's rule and plans of world conquest. The issue has several important small plotlines including
Iris
still stuck in limbo, the
Pied Piper
deciding to come out of retirement when Central City is left without a hero,
Dr. Elias
mounting a protest against the scarlet speedster, and a teaser for the introduction of another of
the Flash's Rogues
next month - the
Weather Wizard . Worth a look. [DC, $2.99]

Rampart
Woody Harrelson  stars as David Douglas Brown, a crooked cop forced to face up to his choices in the midst of the
1999 Rampart Scandal
in which more than 70 Los Angeles police officers were implicated in the most widespread case of police misconduct in history. The story is presented in the form of a character study of "Date Rape" Dave, a womanizing, bigoted bully who has daughters ( Brie Larson ,  Sammy Boyarsky ) from a pair of sisters ( Cynthia Nixon ,  Anne Heche ) and is facing charges of police brutality and viciously beating a man who crashed into his police car on camera. In need of help Dave recruits a retired cop ( Ned Beatty ) and old friend of his father's who puts him onto a heist that only gets him in further trouble with the LAPD. His involvement also puts an investigator ( Ice Cube ) from the District Attorney's office on his case.

Batman Incorporated #1
Please, for the love of God, would somebody at DC stop letting
Grant Morrison
write
Batman
stories. Morrison resurects several of his
Batman Incorporated
supporting players
and throws them haphazardly in the
New 52
for the new (but not really improved)
Batman Incorporated . The issue starts with a group in animal masks mutilating livestock to lure Batman and Robin into the crosshairs of the assassin known as
Goatboy . Sigh. Goatboy, it seems, has decided to cash in on the hit
Leviathan
has laid on young
Damian . Morrison gives us the Dead Heroes Club ( Batwing ,
El Gaucho ,
The Hood ,
Wingman , and
Halo ) almost all of whom I didn't even know existed in the New 52 before now. He also gives us
Dark Knight Returns
mutants (for no more reason than he gave us Goatboy), and one hell of a bullshit ending even an newbie first-time comic book reader could call. Seriously, I can't believe Morrison went for such an obvious sleight of hand in the first issue of a new Bat-title where we know damn well nothing bad is going to happen to the Dynamic Duo.

Captain America #12
As
S.H.I.E.L.D . doctors try to help
Diamondback , who has slipped into a coma after the beatdown from the new
Scourge ,
Captain America
and
Dum Dum Dugan
set out to get a little revenge by attacking an underground
HYDRA
base and learning the secret of the S.H.I.E.L.D. leak. We get a couple of revelations here including
Sharon Carter 's discovery of the leak within S.H.I.E.D. to be a brainwashed
Henry Gyrich
as well as a look at the face of the man wearing the new Scourge costume -
Dennis Dunphy . Although the inclusion of Gyrich and Dunphy does nothing to help sell me on the story, there's certainly enough here to pick this one up including some good inner monologue from Cap during his attack on the HYDRA base and the art by
Patrick Zircher
whose action sequences really pop. Worth a look. [Marvel, $3.99]

Coriolanus
For his directorial debut
Ralph Fiennes  chooses a modern adaptation of
William Shakespeare 's
Coriolanus . To help, Fiennes enlisted the help of screenwriter
John Logan  ( Hugo ,
The Last Samuari ,
Sweeney Todd ,
Rango ,
Gladiator ). It's an ambitious project to be sure but despite some solid performances the film hits some snags when adapting the story to modern day. Fiennes stars as
Caius Marcius Coriolanus , a legendary general of Rome who cares little for politics, and far less for the troubles of the common man. Despite his disinterest he agrees to run for the Senate to please his mother ( Vanessa Redgrave ). This action, far more than any risk ever taken on the battlefield, will prove to be his undoing.

Top Ten Summer 2012 Preview
It's going to be hard for any film this summer to meet the bar
The Avengers
set this Spring. In Hollywood terms Memorial Day has always been (more or less) the start of the summer movie season. So what do they have in store for us this year? A couple more super-hero flicks, new films by director
Wes Anderson
and
Woody Allen , time travel, a fictional character literally brought to life, and the end of the world. Not all of these look to be box office winners, but with all do respect to that
Schwarzenegger remake
(which didn't make my list), these are your best bets at finding some real movie magic this summer.

Green Lantern: The Animated Series - Homecoming
Green Lantern: The Animated Series
concludes it's first season with an invasion of Oa, a fleet of
Red Lanterns
on the verge of invading
Guardian
space, and a trip home for
Hal Jordan
( Josh Keaton ). Although it's taken me a little time to warm to the design and look of the show the first season did have its moments and I'll be interested to see where it goes from here with the conclusion of the Red Lantern story arc.

Awesome Characters - Agent XXX
There are characters we fall in love with. The perfect mix of actor and writer that breathes magic onto the screen or inside the television. Who's your favorite Bond Girl? That's a question with so many possible answers you might have the conversation (or more likely heated argument) for hours. There have been several through the years I have enjoyed, but one who always ranks near the top of my list is
Major Anya Amasova .
The KGB's top spy, Agent XXX not only gets the drop on James Bond ( Roger Moore ) when they first meet in
The Spy Who Loved Me , but at times proves to be his equal, possibly even his better (even if she can't quite decide whether or kill the British Secret Agent for murdering her former lover or sleep with him).

Rookie Blue - The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
I caught the first couple of episodes of
Rookie Blue 's first season back when it premiered in the summer of 2010. Although I'm a fan of the show's star
Missy Peregrym , there wasn't enough to bring me back every week and I wondered how long the show would manage to stick around. After completing two 13-episode seasons
Rookie Blue
returned this week for it's Third Season and, with most of the shows I'm currently watching now on hiatus (or waiting to begin their own summer runs) I decided to give it another shot.

Men in Black III
Well that was... in 3D. I wonder how many film series will find themselves resurrected for the soul purpose of cashing-in on Hollywood's latest love affair with 3D. If
Men in Black III
is any indication (a franchise that died a decade ago only to have it's undead corpse dug up and trotted out to make a few dollars at the box office) perhaps movie studios may want to be a little more selective in choosing which movie series to resurrect. Men in Black III
isn't a bad film. It has some enjoyable moments (like
Bill Hader 's cameo as
Andy Warhol ) and some nice performances. Hell,
Josh Brolin
playing a younger version of Agent K ( Tommy Lee Jones 's character) is almost worth the price of admission by itself. Almost. However, the story is stuck in neutral with a generic time travel adventure involving a grizzled alien ( Jemaine Clement ) out for revenge. Much like Tommy Lee Jones (who only appears on-screen in a limited role this time around), the film simply feels tired and only vaguely aware of what's going on.

Glee - Goodbye
In the series third season finale the graduating members of the New Directions say goodbye to the Glee Club and prepare to for their lives after graduation. Although the show undercut the finality of each moment by announcing almost all the characters will be returning in some role next season, it's still nice to see each get their own final story and a chance to say farewell.

Nightwing #9 (New 52)
Nightwing
battles his great-grandfather William Cobb, the greatest of
the Talons , and tries to save
Mayor Hady
from assassination as " Night of the Owls " continues. During the bloody battle which Nightwing barely survives we get Cobb's backstory and his reasoning for joining the
Court of Owls . Although the battle between Nighwing and Talon works, the flashbacks take up far too much of the comic (you'd almost think Cobb was the comic's main character). Neither Dick Grayson, nor the reader, really needs this amount of back story for the Grayson's zombie assassin ancestor. The Court of Owls storyline, which started in Batman, is working far better in than title than most of other Bat-titles it's spread to this month. In terms of "Night of the Owls" this tie-in certainly isn't a must-read to keep up with the main story, but for fans of Nightwing the action may, may be enough to still warrant picking it up. Hit-and-Miss. [DC, $2.99]

Winter Soldier #5
"The Longest Winter" concludes at the
Winter Soldier
and the
Black Widow
are able to stop
Lucia von Bardas ' plans to launch missiles from
Doctor Doom 's secret nuclear silos using the codes the Latverian monarch
programmed into his Doombots . With their tenuous alliance with Doctor Doom, Bucky and the Black Widow are able to take down Bardas and the second Soviet sleeper agent trained by the Winter Soldier, Dimitri. However, the
Red Ghost
alludes capture, and the fate of the third sleeper agent is unknown. A good conclusion of the arc that still leaves a couple of threads let unanswered. It also marks the returns of the Red Ghost's army of gorillas with machine guns (c'mon, who doesn't love that?). There's plenty of action and even an ending that gives Bucky some of his beloved solitary brooding time (along with a quick assassination at the end). No, he's certainly not Captain America anymore. Worth a look. [Marvel, $3.99]

Jesse Stone - Benefit of the Doubt
Robert B. Parker 's Jesse Stone ( Tom Selleck ) returned to television this past weekend, but sadly without his author's voice. Written by Selleck and
Michael Brandman
Benefit of the Doubt
continues to examine the the life of the recovering alcoholic police chief of Paradise, Massachusetts. Although the latest made-for-TV film delivers another strong character-centered story, the script is lacking the flair of Parker's trademark wit.

Captain Atom #9 (New 52)
While searching the future for the cause of the end of the world
Captain Atom
comes to face-to-face with the destructive god-like force known as Chrono Mota and he's shocked to see the unintended effect his time on Earth has had on those he's saved. While Captain Atom finds little war and bloodshed he's at a loss in trying to process the fact that he's become a god to those like Ramita and Mikey Parker. Mikey has become a doomsday prophet ready to destroy and remake the world in his name, and Ramita has become a warrior using the power unknowingly gifted to her to help those who can't help themselves. But it's in the final pages where Captain Atom looks into the heart of the time-space paradox and world killer known as Chromo Mota that he learns the truth about his own future and the destruction of the Earth.

Red Hood and the Outlaws #9 (New 52)
" Night of the Owls " continues as the
Red Hood
finds himself in Gotham doing a favor for
Batman
and protecting
Mr. Freeze
from an man brought back to life as an assassin. The irony of the situation isn't lost on Jason Todd. As Todd gets reacquainted with his hometown, and deals with his conflicted feels with helping his former boss who he is adamant he now hates (although it's clear his feelings are far more complicated),
Starfire
and
Arsenal
try to
keep Freeze under control
so the Red Hood can deal with the
Talon
sent to kill him. Although I'm not thrilled with the redesign of Freeze or the conclusion of the Red Hood's battle with Talon there are several nice moments here including Kory's reaction to being attacked by Mr. Freeze, Todd's inner struggle and walk down memory lane, and his confrontation
with Batgirl
in the comic's final pages. Worth a look. [DC, $2.99]

Sherlock - The Complete Second Season
Former  Doctor Who  showrunner  Steven Moffat  and  Mark Gatiss
(who does double duty by playing Sherlock's brother Mycroft Holmes) continue their reimagining of
Sherlock Holmes
in modern day London. The Second Season starts out with one of Holmes' most famous cases and the introduction of "The Woman," followed by a demon hound loose on the moors, and ends with the fall, and apparent death, of the detective at the hands of Jim Moriarty ( Andrew Scott ). Of the three episodes from this season, the first (" A Scandal in Belgravia ") is my favorite. The episode introduces the character of Irene Adler ( Lara Pulver ), the only character to ever best Holmes in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories. Pulver makes a deliciously conniving Adler and brings out a side in this version of Sherlock Holmes ( Benedict Cumberbatch ) we had not seen before.

Atomic Robo Presents Real Science Adventures #2
The latest
Atomic Robo
series gives us four more short stories. Two are continuations from the opening chapters from issue #1 as Atomic Robo trains with
Bruce Lee
and
The Sparrow
and Scarecrow fight off Nazis during WWII. We're also given a pair of separate stories. The first involves an Atomic Robo impostor who gets a team killed while trying to capture the apparently invulnerable
Yonkers Devil . The final, and best story of this issue, finds Robo attacked by
Thomas Edision
and the ghost of
Rasputin
while trying to study for finals. Although all four stories are fun The Sparrow is still missing a certain robotic hero to liven things up, and it certainly feels like it would have been better served told in more than a few pages at a time (honestly, I'd completely forgotten what happened in this story in issue #1). Sadly, the killer robotic dogs on the cover don't make an appearance in this issue. Only the Rasputin tale stands out and I would have gladly traded the pages of one of the other stories to have this one fleshed-out a little more. Worth a look. [Red 5, $2.75]

Daredevil #13
After being interupted by the
Black Spectre
on his date with
Kristin McDuffie
in the last issue,
Daredevil
dons his red long johns, grabs the Omega Drive and heads for Times Square where he draws out not only Black Spectre, but  A.I.M. ,  HYDRA , Agence Byzantine, and  The Secret Empire . Although he holds his own, eventually the numbers are simply too much and one of the groups makes off with
the Omega Drive , but, then again, that was all part of Daredevil's plan. The twist works well-enough, but given that Daredevil knows what's happening his internal monologue during the fight doesn't quite work once the reveal has been made. The issue seems to wrap-up the Omega Drive storyline, at least until the epilogue where Daredevil finds himself transported to Latveria against his will. Next month should see a pretty good matchup of Daredevil vs.
Doctor Doom
as well as let us in on what Foggy was shocked to find in Matt's desk. Worth a look. [Marvel, $2.99]

Justice League #9 (New 52)
As
Batman
calls in
Superman
and
Cyborg
to help quash an uprising in
Arkham Asylum
caused by
The Key ,
The Flash ,
Green Lantern , and
Wonder Woman
take down the
Weapons Master
who was terrorizing Central City. Although they don't realize it, both attacks are connected to the mysterious
Graves
who is amassing information about all the league's members. Near death and running out of time, Graves kidnaps and tortures
Steve Trevor
for information about the League and how to get into their satellite. When the torture doesn't work Graves threatens the soldier's family to get what he wants. The return of artist
Jim Lee
means the overall quality of the art improves, but once again we get odd group shots where characters are presented and posturing at odd angles while in battle or attempting to communicate with each other. The back-up story gives us
Billy
standing up for his foster siblings (but still being a jerk), and
Sivana
unearthing a mystical tomb. It's certainly not great, but for JL fans it is worth a look. [DC, $3.99]

Avengers vs. X-Men #4
The fourth-issue of Marvel's big summer event only moves forward the larger story in a minuscule way as the
Phoenix Force
awaits in space above Earth. However,
Avengers vs. X-Men #4
does give give us a face-to-face confrontation between
Hope Summers
and
Wolverine
as the mutant messiah attempts to convince the man who wants her dead that she should be given the opportunity to try and control the Phoenix Force. With frozen beers and a well-reasoned argument Hope convinces Logan to help get her to the moon where she can confront the looming cosmic entity. Although Logan agrees, he proves to have other motives leading to another confrontation between Marvel's two marquee teams on the surface of the moon. The comic does a good job by showcasing how powerful the Phoenix Force is (it takes down
Thor
and the rest of the space-fairing Avengers with little effort), and Hope's early scenes with Wolverine work really well, but Logan's multiple turns are a little awkward and far too rushed.

Community - Digital Estate Planning
What happens when you take the cast of
Community
and digitize them as 8-bit characters and then let them loose upon a computer generated world? A awful lot of fun! Pierce ( Chevy Chase ) shows up with the study group to meet Gilbert ( Giancarlo Esposito ), his father's longtime assistant and executor of his will who informs he before his death Pierce's father created an old school 8-bit video game for Pierce and seven friends. Whoever wins the game will become the heir to the Hawthorne fortune.

Battleship
I don't know the history behind how this movie based on a
Hasbro board game
got made, but I have an idea. I'm pretty sure director
Peter Berg
must have found himself at a Hollywood party where the alcohol was flowing freely and he stated emphatically that
Michael Bay
was a hack and anyone could make one of his movies.
Battleship , I assume, was his attempt to prove this point. Even for a movie based on a board game,
Battleship
is dumb. In fact it's incredibly, inexcusably, mind-numbingly dumb. And for a film filled with explosions, big budget special effects, and alien attacks, the film is neither all that exciting nor enjoyable.

First Look - Elementary
CBS has released a teaser for
Elementary , the new modern day American take on
Sherlock Holmes
starring  Jonny Lee Miller  as the great detective and  Lucy Liu  as Joan Watson. I have serious doubts as to whether or not the CBS series will be able to reach the bar set by BBC's
Sherlock
(and this short behind-the-scenes look doesn't instill me with confidence), but as a Holmes' fan I'm willing to give it a shot.
Elementary
is set to premiere on September 20, 2012.

Glee - Nationals
New Directions makes it to Chicago for nationals but immediately faces trouble when Mercedes ( Amber Riley ) goes down with a 24-hour bug. While Sue ( Jane Lynch ) tries everything to speed her recovery she also drafts Tina ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) and Quinn ( Dianna Agron ) into the Troubletones' number in case her diva isn't able to perform. Will ( Cory Monteith ) starts to fear that destiny might be against them again and maybe he hasn't done enough to prepare the team to win, but is touched to learn the team wants to dedicate their win to him.

Batman and Robin #9 (New 52)
Damian
gets his first solo mission of the New 52 in this " Night of Owls " tie-in issue as he's sent to
protect Major General Benjamin Burrows
from a being the latest victim of the
Court of Owls . Although it's not a bad issue, Damian taking control of a small squad of soldiers to save their wounded leader, for Damian's first big adventure on his own it's far from memorable. The dialogue of Damian convincing the soliders to take his orders, and eventually lead them is pretty damn awkward. I'm also not totally sold on the art by
Lee Garbett
which in some panels feels a little too goofy for so serious a storyline. If you're only picking this up as a "Night of Owls" tie-in you could probably give it a pass. If, however, you're a fan of Damian (even the New 52 version) there's enough here to keep your interest, at least for awhile. For fans. [DC, 2.99]

Bones - The Past in the Present
Just when they are needed most to make sure Christopher Pelant's ( Andrew Leeds ) appeal doesn't overturn his original conviction, Booth ( David Boreanaz ) is given a new murder case involving the discovery of a body in the National Hamilton Wildlife Refuge where all the evidence points to Bones ( Emily Deschanel ).

Captain America #11
Dum Dum Dugan
and
Diamondback
discover that someone out there, posing as the new
Scourge , is killing former terrorists and minor super-villains who are now protected witnesses for
S.H.I.E.L.D.
Okay, it turns out they aren't that well protected. A little digging into the leak leads to the discovery of an even bigger problem when Captain America finds a HYDRA infiltrator in to the echelons of S.H.I.E.L.D. Meanwhile the group tries to narrow down the list of potential targets the new Scourge may hit next which leads to a confrontation between the assassin and Diamondback and the murder of another witness. I like the inclusion of Dugan and Dimondback here, the later (given she's a former super-villain) will have a real stake in the case. Scourge, in one for or another, has been around forever in the Marvel Universe to help trim the fat. I'm intrested to see how writer
Ed Brubaker
uses the character in this new arc. Worth a look. [Marvel, $3.99]

Fairest #3
Finding themselves captured by the
Snow Queen ,
Jonah Panghammer  regales the the unlikely group with the story of  Briar Rose 's birth and magical blessings bestowed upon the princess. Slighted, and at the most opportune hour, the Snow Queen also bestows her own curse on the newborn child. This series is becoming an awful lot of fun and the third issue shows us the complexity and deviousness of Panghammer who has used the situation involving the Snow Queen to his own advantage. We're going to have to wait until the next issue to find out what the imp really has in mind, but writer
Bill Willingham
has certainly crafted and intriguing new character in the
Fables
universe. There are a couple of small, but fun, touches as we learn magical blessings can have quite
literal translations
in the real world (and the reason why Briar Rose never sang for her 60's girl band). With strong art by
Phil Jimenez
and another cool cover by
Adam Hughes , this tale of Sleeping Beauty is definitely worth a look. [Vertigo, $2.99]

Morning Glories #18
"P.E." continues, and although we don't get any answers about the school and its mysterious ways we do learn a little about
Abraham 's group working against Morning Glories Academy. The issue is centered around
Jun
(really Hisao) who gets into another fight with his brother
Hisao
(really Jun) but is rescued by a childhood fried,
Guillame . As Guillame and Jun reconnect and kill time in a way that would be sure to make Bill O'Reilly shout down the evil homosexual comic book agenda of Image Comics, we also get flashbacks to Jun and Guillame's time together as children growing up in Abraham's compound. Although the issue doesn't really move the plot forward it does cement a couple of important points (other than Jun's sexual preference). One, we know Jun isn't alone working for Abraham. And two, we discover which other member of the new Morning Glories recruits is not only part of the group but in charge of their mission. It's not who you expect. Worth a look. [Image, $2.99]

Fatale #5
Hank wakes bloodied, chained, and with odd symbols carved into his chest. He's a guest of the Satanic cult deep below the bowels of the city. Their Bishop plans to use him as a sacrifice to, as he puts it, "help me see my god again."
Jo finds herself betrayed by her former lover Walter Booker who has found a way to lessen her hold on him and now it seems he plans to turn her over to the very people who he saved her from all those years ago, but appearances aren't all that they seem. Issue #5 concludes the series' first arc "Death Chases Me." And although Hank is saved from the cult and makes away safely with Josephine it's clear evil has only been stymied, not stopped. As to whether Hank's life is better today than before he met the woman he loves with all his heart, well, that's a little murky as well. Credit to
Ed Brubaker
and
Sean Phillips
for delivering a noir/horror thriller that it appears is only getting started. Bring on Book Two. Worth a look. [Image, 3.50]

Chuck Versus the Fifth (and Final) Season
The final season of
Chuck
finds the Intersect in the head of Morgan Grimes ( Joshua Gomez ) and our super-CIA spies entering the private sector as Carmichael Industries. As Chuck ( Zachary Levi ) and Sarah ( Yvonne Strahovski ) enjoy married life, Casey ( Adam Baldwin ) gets a girlfriend ( Carrie-Anne Moss ) and goes to jail with Lester ( Vik Sahay ). This year's missions include a computer super-virus, the return of old foes Decker ( Richard Burgi ) and Shaw ( Brandon Routh ), and an even deadlier new one in Nicholas Quinn ( Angus Macfadyen ). We'll also learn Sarah's darkest secret and meet her mother ( Cheryl Ladd ), Chuck will briefly return to his hacker roots, and two members of the team not named Chuck will have adverse effects from the Intersect as the super-computer begins to melt their brains and alter their personalities. And in the series' final arc Chuck finds himself at war with a wife who doesn't recognize him and a vengeful former spy who wants the Intersect for himself.

Scarlet Spider #5
Now that
Kaine 's battles with the Assassin's Guild are over (at least until they ask him to make good on his promise to assassinate someone on their behalf) the Scarlet Spider can relax. Except he can't because a small group of terrorists have chosen Houston to detonate a nuclear device. With time running out
Wally Layton
asks for the Scarlet Spider's help (a name Kaine is
less than thrilled
that people have begun using for him) in finding the bomb. However, the police officer is a little unprepared for how brutal Houston's new super-hero gets while pumping suspects for information. With Kaine and Lawton the comic has a fun odd-couple buddy-cop movie feel which when mixed with the countdown and suspense of the story turns out to be a hell of a lot of fun. We do get cameoes from
Iron Man ,
Maria Hill , and (for some unknown reason)
Ultimate Universe Nick Fury , but none of them interact with our hero or make it to Houston in time. Worth a look. [Marvel, $2.99]

Batman #9
The
Night of Owls
continues as
Batman
fights off an army of
Talons
inside the Batcave while dressed in an
armored Bat-suit
designed for the most hostile and alien places on Earth, and armed with a pet dinosaur and an army of bats that come in the nick of time. Most of the issue deals with the fight in the cave but I do wonder why so many Talons were sent after Bruce Wayne (who they didn't yet know was Batman) when the other targets didn't garner so much attention. The back-up story features
Alfred 's father Jarvis in his final days of service for the Wayne family and his attempts to leave Wayne Manor and make it back home only to be stopped by a member of the
Court of Owls . I wish the last few pages had dealt with the Night of Owls other than a mostly forgetable back-up story. I'm also not thrilled with writer Scott Snyder's attempt to rope Alfred's family into the seemingly all-encompassing Court of Owls arc. Worth a look [DC, $2.99]
