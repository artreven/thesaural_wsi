Now that the summer heat is over and the drought is ending, our thoughts turn to fall planting.
The
Tulsa Garden Center
has several events to usher in this wonderful season.
If you have little ones, the
Linnaeus Teaching Garden
is having a harvest party on Saturday, September 15.
Steve Grantham of Up With Trees will explain to the Little Green Thumbs how trees get ready for winter.
They will then visit the arboretum and choose leaves to make leaf rubbings.
The program is from 9:30 - 11:30 a.m.
Call 918-746-5125 for registration; fees for Tulsa Garden Center members is $10 and $15 for non-members.
If you are looking for plants, several of the Center's affiliate organizations will be having sales on Saturday, September 15 from 9 a.m. - 3 p.m. or until they are sold out.
The Tulsa Area
Daylily

Iris
Society and
Cacti
and
Succulent
Society will be located in the Tulsa Garden Center auditorium.

Sustainable
