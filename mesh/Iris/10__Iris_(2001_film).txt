Kate Winslet "Shankee's Celeb of the week"
Kate Winslet is my favorite female actor and i
couldn't resist myself from writing about her. She is most beautiful natural beauty and has been voted the most beautiful in the world a no. of times in various categories. So this post is dedicated to the beauty-queen. As a testament to her talent, Kate Winslet is a record holder: She's the youngest actress to score six Academy Award nominations, receiving her first for Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility (1995) and her latest for The Reader (2008). Kate Elizabeth Winslet
(born 5 October 1975) is an
English
actress
and occasional
singer . She is noted for having played diverse characters over her career, but probably best-known for her critically acclaimed performances as Marianne Dashwood in
Sense and Sensibility ,
Rose DeWitt Bukater
in
Titanic , Clementine Kruczynski in
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ,
Sarah Pierce in
Little Children , April Wheeler in
Revolutionary Road , and Hanna Schmitz in
The Reader . Early life
Winslet was born in
Reading ,
Berkshire ,
England ,
United Kingdom , the daughter of Sally Anne (née Bridges), a barmaid, and Roger John Winslet, a swimming-pool contractor. parents were "jobbing actors", with Winslet commenting that she "didn't have a privileged upbringing" and that their daily life was "very hand to mouth". Her maternal grandparents, Linda (née Plumb) and Archibald Oliver Bridges, founded and operated the Reading Repertory Theatre, and her uncle, Robert Bridges, appeared in the original
West End
production of
Oliver! . Her sisters,
Beth Winslet
and
Anna Winslet , are also
actresses .
Winslet, raised as an
Anglican , began studying
drama
at the age of eleven at the
Redroofs Theatre School , [ 5 ]
a co-educational
independent school
in
Maidenhead ,
Berkshire , where she was
head girl
and appeared in a television commercial for
Sugar Puffs
cereal, directed by
Tim Pope . Winslet is born in Reading, England to a theatrical family that includes her uncle, the late stage actor Robert Bridges. From an early age, she is inspired to act by her grandparents, who run a local theater. "It's in my family to act," she tells the
New York Times
in 1995. "I always knew that this was what I wanted to do." At 11, she gets her first paycheck pitching Sugar Puffs cereal in British commercials before appearing in the British series
Shrinks
and
Get Back . early 1990s Making Weight By 16, a 5'6 ½" Winslet
tops the scale
at 185 pounds. "I just knew I wouldn't work if I stayed that way," she tells PEOPLE in 1998. After slimming down, she works on the BBC-TV children's sci-fi show
Dark Season , where she meets actor and TV writer Stephen Tredre, 28, who she begins dating. They eventually move in together in London, and she calls Tredre "the most important thing in my life after my family." After nearly five years together, their romance ends and Winslet has a three-month romance with actor Rufus Sewall.
November 22 Winslet Weds Threapleton Winslet marries assistant film director Jim Threapleton (left), whom she met in Morocco while on the set of
Hideous Kinky . They wed in a pub in her hometown of Reading, England. "It was quite amazing," Winslet, who wore a white Edwardian-style gown, tells PEOPLE. "It was the most amazing day of our lives." 2003 February Shrinking Kate A digitally-slimmed Winslet appears on a UK edition of men's magazine
GQ . The faux physique ensues a wave of controversy, with Winslet even criticizing the mindset of equating sex appeal with thinness: "What is sexy? All I know from the men I've ever spoken to is that they like girls to have an arse on them, so why is it that women think in order to be adored they have to be thin?" In 2007, she
sues
and
wins libel damages
from a British magazine that claimed she saw a diet specialist.
