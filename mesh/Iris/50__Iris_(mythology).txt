Digimon Frontier
Edit The Ancient Warriors do not actually appear in
Digimon Frontier
except for the flashback in the episode with Baromon. However, they are mentioned several times in the series as a group of legendary
Digimon
who lived in the
Digital World
a long time before the events of Digimon Frontier.
The Digital World of Digimon Frontier once had a war between human-form Digimon and beast-form Digimon some time in its past. The war ended when the Angel Digimon
Lucemon
brought peace between the two groups. However, Lucemon soon became corrupted and ruled with an iron fist over the Digital World. During this time, ten Digimon appeared and fought Lucemon, sealing him away in the center of the Digital World known as the " Dark Area ". These were the ten "Ancient Warriors".
The act of sealing away Lucemon cost these Digimon their lives. However, before dying, the ten used their own data to create a set of Spirits that can be used by
Legendary Warriors
of the future. The
Spirits
were placed into the care of the three
Celestial Digimon —Wind and Light with
Seraphimon ; Fire, Ice and Thunder with
Ophanimon ; Earth, Wood, Water, Steel and Darkness with
Cherubimon .
Digimon Frontier: Island of the Lost Digimon
Edit Island of Lost Digimon
is the 7th Digimon movie. In this movie, it is revealed that AncientGreymon and AncientGarurumon once fought against another evil Digimon named
Onismon

Murmukusmon , the two ancient Warriors appeared once again to destroy Onismon, this time for good.
