popular culture
and eccentric
Americana , its attention to modern
fiction
by the inclusion of
short stories
and literary
reviews , its rigorous
fact checking
and
copyediting , its
journalism
on politics and

History
The New Yorker
debuted on February 21, 1925. It was founded by
Harold Ross
and his wife,
Jane Grant , a
New York Times
reporter. Ross wanted to create a sophisticated humor magazine that would be different from perceivably "corny" humor publications such as
Judge , where he had worked, or
Life . Ross partnered with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann (who founded the General Baking Company [ 3 ] ) to establish the F-R Publishing Company and established the magazine's first offices at 25 West 45th Street in
Manhattan . Ross edited the magazine until his death in 1951. During the early, occasionally precarious years of its existence, the magazine prided itself on its cosmopolitan sophistication. Ross famously declared in a 1925 prospectus for the magazine: "It has announced that it is not edited for the old lady in
Dubuque ." [ 4 ]
Although the magazine never lost its touches of humor, it soon established itself as a pre-eminent forum for serious
fiction
literature
and journalism. Shortly after the end of
World War II ,
John Hersey 's essay
Hiroshima
filled an entire issue. In subsequent decades the magazine published short stories by many of the most respected writers of the 20th and 21st centuries, including
Ann Beattie ,
Truman Capote ,
John Cheever ,
Roald Dahl ,
Mavis Gallant ,
Geoffrey Hellman ,
John McNulty ,
Joseph Mitchell ,
Alice Munro ,
Haruki Murakami ,
Vladimir Nabokov ,
John O'Hara ,
Dorothy Parker ,
Philip Roth ,
J. D. Salinger ,
Irwin Shaw ,
James Thurber ,
John Updike ,
Eudora Welty ,
Stephen King , and
E. B. White . Publication of
Shirley Jackson 's " The Lottery " drew more mail than any other story in the magazine's history.
In its early decades, the magazine sometimes published two or even three short stories a week, but in recent years the pace has remained steady at one story per issue. While some styles and themes recur more often than others in its fiction, the stories are marked less by uniformity than by variety, and they have ranged from Updike's introspective domestic narratives to the surrealism of
Donald Barthelme , and from parochial accounts of the lives of neurotic New Yorkers to stories set in a wide range of locations and eras and translated from many languages. [ citation needed ]
Writers like
Kurt Vonnegut
said that
The New Yorker
has been an effective institution for getting a large audience through the learning process required for appreciating modern literature. Kurt Vonnegut's 1974 interview with Joe David Bellamy and John Casey, published in
The New Fiction
and in
Conversations with Kurt Vonnegut , contained a discussion of
The New Yorker ‍ '​s influence:
One thing we used to talk about – when I was out in Iowa – was that the limiting factor is the reader. No other art requires the audience to be a performer. You have to count on the reader's being a good performer, and you may write music which he absolutely can't perform – in which case it's a bust. Those writers you mentioned and myself are teaching an audience how to play this kind of music in their heads. It's a learning process, and The New Yorker has been a very good institution of the sort needed. They have a captive audience, and they come out every week, and people finally catch on to Barthelme, for instance, and are able to perform that sort of thing in their heads and enjoy it. I think the same is true of S. J. Perelman; I do not think that Perelman would be appreciated if suddenly his collected works were to be published now to be seen for the first time. It would be gibberish. A learning process is required to appreciate Perelman, although it's very easy to do once you learn how to do it. Yeah, I think the readers are coming along; that's a problem; I think writers have tried to do it always and have failed because there's been no audience for what they've done; nobody's performed their music.
The non-fiction feature articles (which usually make up the bulk of the magazine's content) cover an eclectic array of topics. Recent subjects have included eccentric evangelist
Creflo Dollar , the different ways in which humans perceive the passage of time, and
Münchausen syndrome by proxy .
The magazine is notable for its editorial traditions. Under the rubric
Profiles , it publishes articles about notable people such as
Ernest Hemingway ,
Henry R. Luce
and
Marlon Brando , Hollywood restaurateur
Michael Romanoff , magician
Ricky Jay
and mathematicians
David and Gregory Chudnovsky . Other enduring features have been "Goings on About Town", a listing of cultural and entertainment events in New York, and "The Talk of the Town", a miscellany of brief pieces—frequently humorous, whimsical or eccentric vignettes of life in New York—written in a breezily light style, or
feuilleton , although in recent years the section often begins with a serious commentary. For many years, newspaper snippets containing amusing errors, unintended meanings or badly mixed metaphors ("Block That Metaphor") have been used as filler items, accompanied by a witty retort. There is no masthead listing the editors and staff. And despite some changes, the magazine has kept much of its traditional appearance over the decades in typography, layout, covers and artwork. The magazine was acquired by
Advance Publications , the media company owned by
Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr. , in 1985.
Ross was succeeded as editor by
William Shawn
(1951–87), followed by
Robert Gottlieb
(1987–92) and
Tina Brown
(1992–98). Among the important nonfiction authors who began writing for the magazine during Shawn's editorship were
Dwight Macdonald ,
Kenneth Tynan , and
Hannah Arendt ; to a certain extent all three authors were controversial, Arendt the most obviously so (her
Eichmann in Jerusalem
reportage appeared in the magazine before it was published as a book), but in each case Shawn proved an active champion.
Brown's nearly six-year tenure attracted more controversy than Gottlieb's or even Shawn's, thanks to her high profile (Shawn, by contrast, had been an extremely shy, introverted figure) and the changes which she made to a magazine that had retained a similar look and feel for the previous half-century. She introduced color to the editorial pages (several years before
The New York Times ) and photography, with less type on each page and a generally more modern layout. More substantively, she increased the coverage of current events and hot topics such as celebrities and business tycoons, and placed short pieces throughout "Goings on About Town", including a racy column about nightlife in Manhattan. A new letters-to-the-editor page and the addition of authors' bylines to their "Talk of the Town" pieces had the effect of making the magazine more personal. The current editor of
The New Yorker
is
David Remnick , who succeeded Brown in 1998.
Tom Wolfe
wrote about the magazine: "The
New Yorker
style was one of leisurely meandering understatement, droll when in the humorous mode, tautological and litotical when in the serious mode, constantly amplified, qualified, adumbrated upon, nuanced and renuanced, until the magazine's pale-gray pages became High Baroque triumphs of the relative clause and appository modifier". [ 5 ]
Joseph Rosenblum, reviewing
Ben Yagoda 's
About Town , a history of the magazine from 1925 to 1985, wrote, "...
The New Yorker
did create its own universe. As one longtime reader wrote to Yagoda, this was a place 'where
Peter DeVries
... [ sic ] was forever lifting a glass of
Piesporter , where
Niccolò Tucci
(in a plum velvet
dinner jacket ) flirted in Italian with
Muriel Spark , where Nabokov sipped tawny
port
from a prismatic goblet (while a
Red Admirable
perched on his pinky), and where John Updike tripped over the master's Swiss shoes, excusing himself charmingly". [ 6 ]
As far back as the 1940s the magazine's commitment to
fact-checking
was already well known. [ 7 ]
Yet the magazine played a role in a literary scandal and defamation lawsuit over two 1990s articles by
Janet Malcolm , who wrote about
Sigmund Freud 's legacy. Questions were raised about the magazine's fact-checking process. [ 8 ]
As of 2010,
The New Yorker
employs 16 fact checkers. [ 9 ]
In July 2011, the magazine was sued for defamation in
United States district court
for a July 12, 2010 article written by David Grann, [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
but the case was summarily dismissed. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]
Since the late 1990s,
The New Yorker
has used the Internet to publish current and archived material. It maintains a website with some content from the current issue (plus exclusive web-only content). Subscribers have access to the full current issue online, as well as a complete archive of back issues viewable as they were originally printed. In addition,
The New Yorker' s cartoons are available for purchase online. A digital archive of back issues from 1925 to April 2008 (representing more than 4,000 issues and half a million pages) has also been issued on DVD-ROMs and on a small portable hard drive. More recently, an iPad version of the current issue of the magazine has been released.
In its November 1, 2004 issue, the magazine for the first time endorsed a presidential candidate, choosing to endorse
Democrat
John Kerry
over incumbent
Republican
George W. Bush . [ 14 ]
This was continued in 2008 when the magazine endorsed
Barack Obama
over
John McCain , [ 15 ]
and in 2012 when it endorsed Obama over
Mitt Romney . [ 16 ]
Change of ownership
In 1985, the magazine was acquired by
Samuel Newhouse
and became part of his media empire,
Advance Publications . [ 17 ]
Cartoons
The New Yorker
has featured cartoons (usually
gag cartoons ) since it began publication in 1925. The cartoon editor of
The New Yorker
for years was
Lee Lorenz , who first began cartooning in 1956 and became a
New Yorker
contract contributor in 1958. [ 18 ]
After serving as the magazine's art editor from 1973 to 1993 (when he was replaced by
Françoise Mouly ), he continued in the position of cartoon editor until 1998. His book
The Art of the New Yorker: 1925–1995
(Knopf, 1995) was the first comprehensive survey of all aspects of the magazine's graphics. In 1998,
Robert Mankoff
took over as cartoon editor, and since then Mankoff has edited at least 14 collections of
New Yorker
cartoons. In addition, Mankoff usually contributes a short article to each book, describing some aspect of the cartooning process or the methods used to select cartoons for the magazine.
The New Yorker' s stable of cartoonists has included many important talents in American humor, including
Charles Addams ,
Peter Arno ,
Charles Barsotti ,
George Booth ,
Roz Chast ,
Tom Cheney ,
Sam Cobean ,
Leo Cullum ,
Richard Decker ,
Helen E. Hokinson ,
Ed Koren ,
Reginald Marsh ,
Mary Petty ,
George Price ,
Charles Saxon ,
David Snell ,
Otto Soglow ,
Saul Steinberg ,
William Steig ,
James Stevenson , Richard Taylor,
James Thurber ,
Pete Holmes , Barney Tobey, and
Gahan Wilson .
Many early
New Yorker
cartoonists did not caption their own cartoons. In his book
The Years with Ross , Thurber describes the newspaper's weekly art meeting, where cartoons submitted over the previous week would be brought up from the mail room to be gone over by Ross, the editorial department and a number of staff writers. Cartoons would often be rejected or sent back to artists with requested amendments, while others would be accepted and captions written for them. Some artists hired their own writers; Helen Hokinson hired James Reid Parker in 1931. ( Brendan Gill
relates in his book
Here at The New Yorker
that at one point in the early 1940s, the quality of the artwork submitted to the magazine seemed to improve. It was later found out that the office boy (a teenaged
Truman Capote ) had been acting as a volunteer art editor, dropping pieces he didn't like down the far edge of his desk.) [ 19 ]
Several of the magazine's cartoons have climbed to a higher plateau of fame. One 1928 cartoon drawn by
Carl Rose
and captioned by
E. B. White
shows a mother telling her daughter, "It's broccoli, dear." The daughter responds, "I say it's spinach and I say the hell with it." The phrase " I say it's spinach " entered the vernacular (and three years later, the Broadway musical
Face the Music
included
Irving Berlin 's musical number titled " I Say It's Spinach (And The Hell With It) "). [ 20 ]
The
catchphrase
" back to the drawing board " originated with the 1941 Peter Arno cartoon showing an engineer walking away from a crashed plane, saying, "Well, back to the old drawing board." [ 21 ] [ 22 ]
The most reprinted is
Peter Steiner 's 1993 drawing of two dogs at a computer, with one saying, " On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog ". According to Mankoff, Steiner and the magazine have split more than $100,000 in fees paid for the licensing and reprinting of this single cartoon, with more than half going to Steiner. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]
Over seven decades, many hardcover compilations of cartoons from
The New Yorker
have been published, and in 2004, Mankoff edited
The Complete Cartoons of The New Yorker , a 656-page collection with 2004 of the magazine's best cartoons published during 80 years, plus a double CD set with all 68,647 cartoons ever published in the magazine. This features a search function allowing readers to search for cartoons by a cartoonist's name or by year of publication. The newer group of cartoonists in recent years includes
Pat Byrnes , Frank Cotham, Michael Crawford, Joe Dator, Drew Dernavich,
J. C. Duffy , Carolita Johnson, Zachary Kanin, Farley Katz,
Robert Leighton , Glen Le Lievre, Michael Maslin, Ariel Molvig, Paul Noth, Barbara Smaller, David Sipress, Mick Stevens,
Julia Suits , Christopher Weyant,
P. C. Vey , and Jack Ziegler. The notion that some
New Yorker
cartoons have punchlines so
non sequitur
that they are impossible to understand became a subplot in the
Seinfeld
episode " The Cartoon ", as well as a playful jab in an episode of
The Simpsons , " The Sweetest Apu ".
In April 2005, the magazine began using the last page of each issue for "The New Yorker Cartoon
Caption Contest ". Captionless cartoons by
The New Yorker' s regular cartoonists are printed each week. Captions are submitted by readers, and three are chosen as finalists. Readers then vote on the winner, and any resident of the US, UK, Australia, Ireland or Canada (except Quebec) age 18 or older can vote. Each contest winner receives a print of the cartoon (with the winning caption), signed by the artist who drew the cartoon.
Films
The New Yorker
has been the source of a number of movies. Both fiction and non-fiction pieces have been adapted for the big screen, including:

Sundance Film Festival ;
The Namesake
(2007), similarly based on
Jhumpa Lahiri 's novel which originated as a short story in the magazine;
The Bridge
(2006), based on
Tad Friend 's 2003 non-fiction piece "Jumpers";

The New Yorker
in 1996 before its film adaptation was released in 1999;
The Addams Family
(1991) and its sequel,
Addams Family Values
(1993), both inspired by the work of famed
New Yorker
cartoonist
Charles Addams ;
Brian De Palma 's

(1989), which began as a
New Yorker
article by Daniel Lang;
Boys Don't Cry
(1999), starring Hilary Swank, began as an article in the magazine, and

The history of
The New Yorker
has also been portrayed in film: In
Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle , a film about the celebrated
Algonquin Round Table
starring
Jennifer Jason Leigh
as
Dorothy Parker ,
Sam Robards
portrays founding editor Harold Ross trying to drum up support for his fledgling publication. The magazine's former editor,
William Shawn , is portrayed in
Capote
(2005),
Infamous
(2006) and
Hannah Arendt
(2012).
Style
The New Yorker' s signature display typeface, used for its nameplate and headlines and the masthead above
The Talk of the Town
section, is Irvin, named after its creator, the designer-illustrator
Rea Irvin . [ 25 ]
The body text of all articles in
The New Yorker
is set in
Adobe Caslon . [ 26 ]
One uncommonly formal feature of the magazine's in-house
style
is the placement of
diaeresis marks
in words with repeating
vowels —such as
reëlected ,
preëminent
and
coöperate —in which the two vowel letters indicate separate vowel sounds. [ 27 ]
The magazine also continues to use a few spellings that are otherwise little used, such as
focussed ,
venders , and
teen-ager . [ 28 ]
The magazine also spells out the names of numerical amounts, such as "two million three hundred thousand dollars" instead of "$2.3 million", even for very large figures. [ 29 ]
Readership
Notwithstanding its title,
The New Yorker
is read nationwide, with 53 percent of its circulation in the top ten U.S. metropolitan areas. According to Mediamark Research Inc., the average age of
The New Yorker
reader in 2009 is 47 (compared to 43 in 1980 and 46 in 1990). The average household income of
The New Yorker
readers in 2009 is $109,877 (the average income in 1980 was $62,788 and the average income in 1990 was $70,233). [ 30 ]
Eustace Tilley
Image of
Count d'Orsay , published by
James Fraser .
The magazine's first cover illustration, a
dandy
peering at a butterfly through a
monocle , was drawn by
Rea Irvin , the magazine's first art editor, based on an 1834 caricature of the then
Count d'Orsay
which appeared as an illustration [ 31 ]
in the 11th edition of the
Encyclopædia Britannica . The gentleman on the original cover, now referred to as "Eustace Tilley", is a character created by
Corey Ford
for
The New Yorker . The hero of a series entitled "The Making of a Magazine", which began on the inside front cover of the August 8 issue that first summer, Tilley was a younger man than the figure on the original cover. His top hat was of a newer style, without the curved brim. He wore a
morning coat
and striped trousers. Ford borrowed Eustace Tilley's last name from an aunt—he had always found it vaguely humorous. "Eustace" was selected by Ford for
euphony . [ 32 ]
The character has become a kind of
mascot
for
The New Yorker , frequently appearing in its pages and on promotional materials. Traditionally, Rea Irvin's original Tilley cover illustration is used every year on the issue closest to the anniversary date of February 21, though on several occasions a newly drawn variation has been substituted. [ 33 ]
Covers
"View of the World" cover
Main article:
View of the World from 9th Avenue
Saul Steinberg 's "View of the World from Ninth Avenue" cover.
Saul Steinberg created 85 covers and 642 internal drawings and illustrations for the magazine. His most famous work is probably its March 29, 1976 cover, [ 34 ]
an illustration most often referred to as "View of the World from
9th Avenue ", sometimes referred to as "A
Parochial
New Yorker's View of the World" or "A New Yorker's View of the World", which depicts a map of the world as seen by
self-absorbed
New Yorkers.
The illustration is split in two, with the bottom half of the image showing
Manhattan 's 9th Avenue,
10th Avenue , and the
Hudson River
(appropriately labeled), and the top half depicting the rest of the world. The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a square, with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing
"Jersey" , the names of five cities ( Los Angeles ;
Washington, D.C. ;
Las Vegas ;
Kansas City ; and
Chicago ) and three states ( Texas ,
Utah , and
Nebraska ) scattered among a few rocks for the United States beyond New Jersey. The Pacific Ocean, perhaps half again as wide as the Hudson, separates the United States from three flattened land masses labeled China, Japan and Russia.
The illustration—humorously depicting New Yorkers' self-image of their place in the world, or perhaps outsiders' view of New Yorkers' self-image—inspired many similar works, including the poster for the
1984 film
Moscow on the Hudson ; that movie poster led to a lawsuit,
Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. , 663 F. Supp. 706 ( S.D.N.Y.
1987), which held that
Columbia Pictures
violated the
copyright
that Steinberg held on his work.
The cover was later satirized by Barry Blitt for the cover of
The New Yorker
on October 6, 2008. The cover featured
Sarah Palin
looking out of her window seeing only Alaska, with Russia in the far background. [ 35 ]
The March 21, 2009 cover of
The Economist , "How China sees the World", is also an homage to the original image, but depicting the viewpoint from Beijing's
Chang'an Avenue
instead of Manhattan. [ 36 ]
9/11
Hired by Tina Brown in 1992,
Art Spiegelman
worked for
The New Yorker
for ten years but resigned a few months after the
September 11 terrorist attacks . The cover created by Françoise Mouly and Spiegelman for the September 24, 2001 issue of
The New Yorker
received wide acclaim and was voted in the top ten of magazine covers of the past 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Editors, which commented:
New Yorker
Covers Editor Françoise Mouly repositioned Art Spiegelman's silhouettes, inspired by
Ad Reinhardt 's black-on-black paintings, so that the North Tower's antenna breaks the "W" of the magazine's logo. Spiegelman wanted to see the emptiness, and find the awful/awe-filled image of all that disappeared on 9/11. The silhouetted Twin Towers were printed in a fifth, black ink, on a field of black made up of the standard four color printing inks. An overprinted clear varnish helps create the ghost images that linger, insisting on their presence through the blackness.
At first glance, the cover appears to be totally black, but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the
World Trade Center
towers in a slightly darker shade of black. In some situations, the ghost images only become visible when the magazine is tilted toward a light source. [ 37 ]
In September 2004, Spiegelman reprised the image on the cover of his book
In the Shadow of No Towers , in which he relates his experience of the Twin Towers attack and the psychological after-effects.

In the December 2001 issue the magazine printed a cover by
Maira Kalman
and
Rick Meyerowitz
showing a map of New York in which various neighborhoods were labeled with humorous names reminiscent of Middle Eastern and Central Asian place names and referencing the neighborhood's real name or characteristics (e.g., "Fuhgeddabouditstan", "Botoxia"). The cover had some cultural resonance in the wake of September 11, and became a popular print and poster. [ 38 ] [ 39 ]
Controversial covers
Crown Heights in 1993
For the 1993
Valentine's Day
issue, the magazine cover by
Art Spiegelman
depicted a black woman and a
Hasidic Jewish
man kissing, referencing the
Crown Heights riot
of 1991. [ 40 ] [ 41 ]
The cover was criticized by both black and Jewish observers. [ 42 ]
Jack Salzman and
Cornel West
describe the reaction to the cover as the magazine's "first national controversy". [ 43 ]
2008 Obama cover satire and controversy
Barry Blitt's cover from the July 21, 2008 issue of
The New Yorker
Wikinews has related news:
New Yorker's Obama cover sparks outrage
"The Politics of Fear", a cartoon by Barry Blitt featured on the cover of the July 21, 2008 issue, depicts then presumptive
Democratic
presidential
nominee
Barack Obama
in the
turban
and
salwar kameez
typical of many
Muslims ,
fist bumping
with his wife,
Michelle , portrayed with an
Afro
and wearing
camouflage
trousers with an
assault rifle
slung over her back. They are standing in the
Oval Office , with a portrait of
Osama Bin Laden
hanging on the wall and an
American flag
burning
in the fireplace in the background. [ 44 ]
Many
New Yorker
readers saw the image as a lampoon of "The Politics of Fear", as the image was titled. Some of Obama's supporters as well as his presumptive Republican opponent,
Sen. John McCain , accused the magazine of publishing an incendiary cartoon whose irony could be lost on some readers. However, editor David Remnick felt the image's obvious excesses rebuffed the concern that it could be misunderstood, even by those unfamiliar with the magazine. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]
"The intent of the cover," he said, "is to satirize the vicious and racist attacks and rumors and misconceptions about the Obamas that have been floating around in the
blogosphere
and are reflected in public opinion polls. What we set out to do was to throw all these images together, which are all over the top and to shine a kind of harsh light on them, to satirize them." [ 47 ]
In an interview on
Larry King Live
shortly after the magazine issue began circulating, Obama said, "Well, I know it was
The New Yorker' s attempt at satire... I don't think they were entirely successful with it". But Obama also pointed to his own efforts to debunk the allegations portrayed in
The New Yorker
cover through a web site his campaign set up: "[They are] actually an insult against Muslim-Americans, something that we don't spend a lot of time talking about." [ 48 ] [ 49 ]
Later that week,
The Daily Show ' s
Jon Stewart
continued
The New Yorker
cover's argument about Obama stereotypes with a piece showcasing a montage of clips containing such stereotypes culled from various legitimate news sources. [ 50 ]
The
New Yorker
Obama cover was later parodied by Stewart and
Stephen Colbert
on the October 3, 2008, cover of
Entertainment Weekly
magazine, with Stewart as Obama and Colbert as Michelle, photographed for the magazine in New York City on September 18. [ 51 ]
New Yorker
covers are not always related to the contents of the magazine or are only tangentially so. In this case, the article in the July 21, 2008, issue about Obama did not discuss the attacks and rumors but rather Obama's political career. The magazine later endorsed Obama for president.
This parody was most likely inspired by
Fox News
host
E. D. Hill 's paraphrasing of an anonymous internet comment in asking whether a gesture made by Obama and his wife Michelle was a "terrorist fist jab". [ 52 ] [ 53 ]
Later, Hill's contract was not renewed. [ 54 ]
2013 Bert and Ernie cover
The New Yorker chose an image of
Bert and Ernie
by artist Jack Hunter, titled 'Moment of Joy', as the cover of their July 8, 2013 publication which covers the Supreme Court decisions on the
Defense of Marriage Act
and
California Proposition 8 . [ 55 ]
The
Sesame Street
characters have long been rumored in popular culture and urban legend to be
homosexual
partners, though
Sesame Workshop
has repeatedly denied this, saying they are merely "puppets" and have no sexual orientation. [ 56 ]
Reaction was mixed. Online magazine
Slate
criticized the cover, which shows Ernie leaning on Bert's shoulder as they watch a television with the Supreme Court justices on the screen, saying "it's a terrible way to commemorate a major civil-rights victory for gay and lesbian couples."
The Huffington Post , meanwhile, said it was "one of [the magazine's] most awesome covers of all time." [ 57 ]
