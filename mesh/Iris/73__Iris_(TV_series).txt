Super Junior
( Korean :
슈퍼주니어 ;
Japanese :
スーパージュニア ; Chinese: 超级少年) is a South Korean
boy band
formed by
S.M. Entertainment
in 2005. The group debuted with 12 members:
Leeteuk
(leader),
Heechul , Yesung ,
Shindong ,
Sungmin ,
Eunhyuk ,
Donghae ,
Siwon ,
Ryeowook , and later added a 13th member named
Kyuhyun . As of September 2011, eight members are currently active, [ 1 ]
due to Han Geng's lawsuit (now pursuing his own singing career in the
Mandarin pop entertainment industry), Heechul and Kangin's temporary
leave of absence for mandatory
military service
and Kibum's pursuit of an acting career. [ 2 ]
However, the other members have insisted that all four (Heechul,
Kangin, Kibum and Han Geng) are still part of the group, despite
mentioning that they are saddened by Han Geng's departure from the
group. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Super Junior has released and contributed 20 records with varying degrees of success. [ 5 ]
Over the years, they have been divided into smaller subgroups,
simultaneously targeting different music industries and audiences.
Largely due to Super Junior's success as entertainers, other Korean
entertainment managements began to train their music groups in other
areas of entertainment, such as acting and hosting. [ 5 ]
In addition to their commercial success, Super Junior has earned six music awards from the
Mnet Asian Music Awards , eleven from the
Golden Disk Awards , and is the second singing group to win Favorite Artist Korea at the 2008
MTV Asia Awards
after
jtL
in 2003. [ 6 ]

History
[ edit ]
Pre-debut
In 2000, the company held their first overseas casting auditions and discovered Han Geng in
Beijing ,
China , who was chosen from among three thousand applicants. [ 7 ]
That same year, Yesung was discovered under Seoul's casting system.
Sungmin and Donghae became trainees after jointly winning the first
place in Best Outward Appearance in an S.M.-sponsored contest. In 2002,
Heechul and Kangin were recruited along with Kibum, who was discovered
in
Los Angeles ,
California. Siwon was encountered in 2003 after being scouted at age 16
in front of his high school, and Ryeowook in 2004, in which the latter
was discovered through the Chin Chin Youth Festival singing competition. [ 8 ]
In 2005, Shindong was selected. The last member, Cho Kyuhyun, was then
discovered after winning third place at the Chin Chin Singing
Competition in 2005.
Not long after boy band
TVXQ 's
debut in 2003, news about Lee's unprecedented plans of forming another
boy band quickly spread on the Internet. In early 2005, Lee confirmed
the news and announced that an all-boy project group of twelve members
would debut near the end of the year, promoting this singing group to be
"The Gateway to Stardom of Asia." [ 9 ]
Lee announced that that most members in this group were chosen because of their performing experiences as actors,
MCs , models, and
radio hosts
prior debut. Heechul and Kibum were already established entertainers,
and most of the other members had already made various kinds of
appearances on television and media. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
Highly inspired by the rotational concept of Japan's girl group
Morning Musume ,
this group would also experience line-up changes, with new members
replacing some selected members every year to keep the group constantly
young and all-rounded. This concept was then newly introduced to the
K-pop
market.
For a while the group was rumored to be called O.V.E.R, the acronym for "Obey the Voice for Each Rhythm." [ 13 ] [a]
However, before the group settled with their current name, S.M. simply
referred to them as Junior, a representation of the members' young ages
when they first became S.M. trainees. [ 13 ]
After the members' showcased their different talents to the company at a
picnic, the company finalized their concept name to Super Junior. The
group thereafter became officially Super Junior 05, the first generation
of Super Junior. [ 8 ]
Leeteuk said on
Star Golden Bell
that "at first, Super Junior's name was S.M. Junior, but after Lee Soo
Man saw our performance, he said we have super talent and quickly change
our name to Super Junior". [ citation needed ]
Super Junior 05 made their pre-debut on the Korean channel Mnet on September 11, 2005. [b]
At the showcase, they performed various styles of
hip-hop dancing , where they danced to
B2K 's "Take It to the Floor". Han Geng, Eunhyuk, and Donghae also performed a separate dance away from the group, dancing to
Usher 's " Caught Up ." However, the performance did not air on television until May 16, 2006, as a segment in the
Super Junior Show , the group's first television documentary.
[ edit ]
2005–06: The Super Junior project
Super Junior 05 debuted on
SBS 's music program
Popular Song
on November 6, 2005, performing their first single, " Twins (Knock Out) ". A
digital single
with "Twins (Knock Out)", "You Are the One", and three additional tracks were released online on November 8. A physical
CD single
was scheduled to be released the following week but a more complete album,
SuperJunior05 (Twins) ,
was released on December 6, 2005, instead. Their debut album sold
28,536 copies in the first month of release and debuted at number three
in the monthly chart of December 2005. [ 14 ] [c]
In that same month, they released " Show Me Your Love ",
a collaboration single with TVXQ. "Show Me Your Love" became the
best-selling record of December 2005, selling 49,945 copies that month. [ 14 ]
In February 2006, Super Junior 05 began performances for " Miracle ",
the second promotional single from their debut album. "Miracle" was the
group's first single to top the online music charts of South Korea as
well as the music charts of
Thailand , drawing interest from international markets. [ 15 ]
As promotions for "Miracle" came to an end, S.M. Entertainment began
selecting new members for Super Junior's second line-up project, Super
Junior 06. The company even prepared a list of chosen members that were
to graduate from the group. However, no members were taken out and a
thirteenth member was added instead in May 2006. The line-up project has
been abandoned since then, and the group became known as just Super
Junior, without the suffix "05". [ 16 ] [ 17 ]
[ edit ]
2006–07:
U ,
Don't Don
and breakthrough success
On May 23, 2006, S.M. Entertainment revealed the thirteenth member
Kyuhyun, who was discovered through a singing competition in 2005. They
released their single " U "
online for free download on May 25, 2006, on their official website.
"U" had over 400,000 downloads within five hours of release and it
ultimately exceeded 1.7 million downloads, crashing the server. [ 18 ] [ 19 ]
The
physical single
of "U" with a total of three tracks was released on June 6, 2006, eventually selling over 81,000 units. [ 20 ]
The single became one of Korea's most popular songs of the year,
yielding number one spots for five consecutive weeks on two of Korea's
top music programs. [ 21 ]
By the end of the year, Super Junior collected over seven awards in
five of South Korea's top music award ceremonies, winning the title as
Best New Group of 2006.
Super Junior's first sub-unit, the ballad-singing trio
Super Junior-K.R.Y. , debuted on November 5, 2006, with a performance of
Hyena
theme song "The One I Love" on
KBS
music program
Music Bank . [ 22 ]
A second sub-unit arrived in February 2007 called
Super Junior-T . The
trot -singing group released their first single " Rokuko " on February 23, 2007, and made a debut performance on
Popular Songs
two days later. [ 23 ]
Super Junior's second official album was intended for a late 2006 release, but due to several accidental setbacks,
Don't Don
was not released until September 20, 2007. [ 24 ] [ 25 ]
Within the first three days of release, offline album sales for
Don't Don
passed the 11,000 unit mark, debuting as number one in all available
offline charts. It finished the September monthly album sales as number
one. 60,000 units were shipped by the first week of release and
additional copies were printed. [ 26 ]
Although
Don't Don
received rather bland reviews from critics, the album sold more than
160,000 copies by the end of the year, becoming the second best-selling
record of 2007. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [c]
The album also found success in
Taiwan ;
it broke the record for being the highest ranked Korean album on the
G-music Combo Billboard Chart, surpassing the albums of TVXQ and
Shinhwa . Super Junior's album also ranked above Taiwanese boy band
K One , whose album debuted at number six. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]
Supported by the release of
Don't Don , Super Junior was
nominated in seven separate categories at the 2007 Mnet/KM Music
Festival that was held on November 17, 2007. Super Junior won three of
those categories including "Netizen Choice Award" and "Mobile
Popularity", being the biggest winner of the night. The group also won
"Best Artist of the Year" (Daesang), termed by many as the highest
recognition of the ceremony. [ 31 ]
Super Junior collected two more awards on December 14 at the 2007 Golden Disk Awards. [ 32 ]
Although defeated by
SG Wannabe
in winning the "Daesang", Super Junior won a "Bonsang" and the "TPL
Anycall Popularity Award", which were reported as expected wins for the
group by the media after the success of
Don't Don . [ 32 ]

2008–09: Beyond Korea and
Sorry, Sorry
On October 2, 2007, S.M. Entertainment announced a third Super Junior sub-unit
Super Junior-M , a subgroup designated for the Chinese market. [ 33 ] [ 34 ]

national and international success. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]
After only a month of release, the album became South Korea's best-selling album of 2009.

Artistry
[ edit ]
Musical style
As a whole, Super Junior has released five studio albums and one
physical single, including occasional contributions to drama
soundtracks. They are acclaimed for their vocal harmonization and unison
as each member contributes a different position range in their music.
Some members are credited for their
vocal belting
techniques. [g] [ 95 ]
Super Junior works closely with
Yoo Young-jin ,
who has produced and arranged most of the group's promotional singles
since debut. Yoo's also known for creating the renowned SMP style, a
genre that includes a balanced infusion of rock, R&B, and rap, with
complementing musical elements such as the
electric guitar , bass, and other different
percussion instruments . [ 96 ]
Super Junior has prominently used this SMP style in
Don't Don . [ 97 ]
Super Junior displayed a wide genre concept for each and every albums: they pursued
bubblegum pop
in
SuperJunior05 ;
ethereal
and
alternative rock
in
Don't Don ;
pop
and
contemporary R&B
in
Sorry, Sorry
and
Bonamana ; and
electropop
and
synthpop
in
Mr. Simple . The group has also covered few songs in their albums. Their debut single "Twins (Knock Out)" is a
cover
of
Triple Eight 's
"Knockout," which was released in 2003. While the musical style is
mostly maintained as the original, "Twins (Knock Out)" touches closer to
rap rock, with quicker rap and more emphasis on the bass. In most of
their covers, the original titles are kept. Examples include Cape's
"L.O.V.E" and
Exile's
"Believe." However, most of these covers are re-arranged to different accompaniments, such as
H.O.T 's "Full of Happiness".
[ edit ]
Dance Style
Super Junior are known for doing performances that are heavily
centered around their choreography, and are acclaimed for their highly
synchronized dances. The group's pre-debut performance was a hip hop
dance and they have also joined
B-boy
battles and performances throughout their career. [ 98 ]
Their dance styles are widely termed as street dancing, with a
majority of their choreography containing hip hop dance moves such as
popping, waving, floating, and liquid dancing. Dances in the form of
martial arts are widely used in their dance routines as Han Geng and
Sungmin are professionally trained in that area. [ 99 ] [ 100 ]
Shindong was the main choreographer for "U" and for a majority of the
group's other dance sequences. Eunhyuk choreographed the dance for
"Boom, Boom" (Fourth Album) and also worked with the other members to
create the dance choreography for "Don't Don" and "Marry U", both
promotional singles for the group's second album. The dance for their
hit single "Sorry, Sorry" was choreographed by Nick Bass and Trent
Dickens, who has also worked with Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson.
Nick Bass also choreographed the dance for "BONAMANA". The dance for "No
Other" was choreographed by THE GEMINIZ,
Rino Nakasone
and Maryss From Paris. Super Junior M "Perfection" was choreographed by
Misha Gabriel who had worked with other well known acts and
choreographed Justin Timberlake's "Future Love Sex Show," Pussycat
Dolls' "Doll Domination World Tour," "Dancing with the Stars" and more.

Popularity
On December 8, as the proponents of Hallyu Wave, idol group Super Junior was guested in

talked about the secret of their huge popularity and their strategy for advancing into the world music industry. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]
Super Junior is receiving attention worldwide. Recently they have
extended beyond Asia, gaining popularity in Bulgaria, Slovenia,
Argentina, Peru, Brazil and various other locations worldwide. In the
year 2010, Peru’s Listas put up the top 30 rankings of
The Sexiest Men in the World , whereby all of the members’ names appeared on the list [ 103 ]
and a Slovenian newspaper also reported about their agency and album
sales. Super Junior also appeared in a publication of a specialty
magazine recently in Iran that contains a personal interview with all of
the Super Junior members and their individual profiles, which is
explained briefly in Persian. [ 104 ]
According to the Korea Cultural Foundation, Super Junior is selected by Brazilian fans as the Korea best group. [ 105 ]
Earlier this year, in a survey conducted by Brazil’s Rede TV, Super
Junior was chosen as the number one Korean singer who should come to
Brazil. The results concluded with Super Junior being the top artist of
choice with 30.9% of the vote. [ 106 ]

conducted by Mexico's TV Azteca, as well as the various Mexican
communities of this band on the Internet. Also, England’s

the Hallyu star that you want to travel Korea with .
Super Junior received overwhelming votes from Asia including China,
Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries as well as Europe such as France. [ 108 ]
[ edit ]
Subgroups
Since debut, S.M. Entertainment has created four subgroups for Super
Junior. Every member was put into different subgroups excluding
Kibum ,
due to his busy acting schedule. The intentions of the subgroups were
part of SM's strategy to not limit Super Junior's activities, [ 109 ]
and the goal was to show that the group could accommodate different
musical genres. However, this strategy was later challenged by critics,
as it has influenced an overwhelming amount of music groups to create
official and unofficial subgroups alike. [ 110 ]
SM announced that Super Junior will form more subgroups in the future,
and possible focuses of these subgroups include a variety of genres such
as
electropop ,
rock
and
hip hop . [ 111 ]
Previous Super Junior subgroups will also return to the industry along with appearances of new subgroups. [ 111 ]

officially released a single or album, and only participated in
collaboration albums and
original soundtracks . However, a new album is expected from KRY in the future. [ 111 ]

became a best-selling record and were sold-out in both Korea and
oversea markets, which was more than enough to make up for the
production loss of 8.5 billion won. [ 120 ]

Influence and impact
During the course of Super Junior's career, several pop groups were formed similarly extraordinary numbers of members.
JYP Entertainment
recruited thirteen boys to be in a boy band, who were all revealed in the show,
Hot Blood Men . Of these thirteen, eleven were split into two groups that debuted at different times:
2AM , which has four members, and
2PM , which has seven. [ 128 ]
Together, the two groups form the eleven-member boy band One Day. Ast'1, a boy band under
DSP Entertainment ,
released a promotional video in March 2008. In the short preview the
boy band expressed that they would "Knock Down Super Junior", [ 129 ]
which resulted in a lot of criticism lashed into the group. However,
they clarified that they had no means to create conflict, and explained
the reason why they want to defeat Super Junior is because they see
Super Junior as their answer of success. [ 130 ]

Controversies
[ edit ]
Expansion to China
For more details on this topic, see
Super Junior-M .
After the subgroups Super Junior-K.R.Y. and Super Junior-T, on
October 2, 2007, S.M. Entertainment announced the birth of another Super
Junior sub-unit project that would begin activities in China starting
2008.
Zhou Mi
and S.M. Entertainment's new Chinese-Canadian trainee
Henry Lau , who was also featured in the music video of "Don't Don", were also members of the subgroup. [ 131 ]
The announcement brought in a huge wave of dissatisfaction and
opposition from fans of Super Junior after the announcement of two new
members. Initially, fans were planning to boycott the company's
products, however, most fans agreed on a silent protest instead.
Thousands of fans from Super Junior's official fanclub E.L.F. silently
sat in front of the SM building and held signs that supported the group
to have only thirteen members. [ 132 ]
After more rumors regarding adding a Chinese member to the subgroup,
the fans decided to gain a legal representation as part of S.M.
Entertainment's stockholders. As of March 20, 2008, Super Junior fans
purchased 58,206 stocks of S.M. Entertainment, holding 0.3% of the
company's entire stock. [ 133 ]
They released a statement that they will obtain all chances to prevent
S.M. Entertainment from adding new members and to keep Super Junior as
only thirteen. [ 133 ]
[ edit ]
Conflict with MBC
For more details on this topic, see
Kangin .
A time-slot dispute occurred between
S.M. Entertainment
and
MBC
when SM insisted to have Kangin stay on SBS's
Explorers of the Human Body
instead of MBC's
Sunday Night Dong-An Club
(동안클럽) where Kangin has been a regular host. MBC temporarily banned the
rest of Super Junior from appearing in any future performances and
shows hosted by MBC. [ 134 ]
Kangin also lost his MC jobs to
T.O.P.
of
Big Bang
for the music show,
Show! Music Core
and also two more variety shows, which both soon canceled after Kangin left due to low ratings. [ 135 ]
MBC demanded an apology from S.M. Entertainment in order for Super
Junior to appear on shows hosted by the channel again. However, MBC
concluded that Super Junior's ban was never official, but just a
decision for shows' producers to decide. [ 136 ]
[ edit ]
Han Geng's lawsuit and departure from group
For more details on this topic, see
Han Geng .
On December 21, 2009,
Han Geng
filed for contract termination with
S.M. Entertainment ,
label company of the group. The following day, Han Geng's lawyer stated
the claimed reasons behind the action: provisions were in S.M.
Entertainment's favour, unlawful 13-year contract length, unfair sum of
money to end the contract, not allowed to request to revise his
contract, forced to do things that were not in his contract, forced to
do things against his will, fined if he disobeyed the company, missed
any events or even was late, and there was uneven profit distribution.
Along with this, it was disclosed that because of S.M. Entertainment's
refusal to give him a day off in over two years, he had developed
gastritis
and
kidney disease . [ 137 ]
Han Geng's current manager, Sun Le, also submitted a statement to the
court of South Korea citing S.M. Entertainment's violation of Han
Geng's rights. [ 138 ]
Sun Le's statement contended that: Han Geng was forced to wear a mask
due to company's ill handling of the visa issue, company purposely
discriminated against Han Geng and his family, company refused to
cooperate or listen to any of Han Geng's suggestions, company purposely
turned down individual activities for Han Geng (including
Ariel Lin 's
"Fireflies" music video, which later starred Siwon and Donghae) and
that the company treated Han Geng's potential endorsers poorly. [ 139 ]
On December 21, 2010, the Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor
of Han Geng. The court stated, “All three contracts – from the January
2003 contract, the altered contract from February 2007, and the
affiliated contract from December 2007 – do not exist.” A representative
of S.M. Entertainment stated that that they would file an immediate
appeal to reverse the decision. [ 140 ]
On September 27, 2011, Han Geng's departure from Super Junior was
made official when legal representatives of both Hangeng and S.M.
Entertainment eventually released a statement stating, "Han Geng and
S.M. Entertainment have amicably settled on a mutual agreement, and the
lawsuit was able to come to a close after Hangeng submitted his 'Notice
of Withdrawal of Appeal'."
[ 141 ] [ 142 ]
Additionally, S.M. Entertainment's official Super Junior website and
sub-unit Super Junior-M also no longer lists Han Geng as one of the
current members of both groups as of November 2011. [ 143 ]
[ 144 ]

Conflict during Expo 2010
On May 26, 2010, organized by South Korea Pavilion of
Expo 2010 ,
many Korean pop stars including Super Junior were invited to the "South
Korean classical and pop concert" which was planned to be launched at
Expo Cultural Centre on May 30. As the tickets were not for sale to the
public, visitors who want to enjoy the show could only exchange the
ticket via expo ticket in the west door of the Expo Cultural Centre on
May 30. The total ticket number is 5000, while 2500 of which would be
assigned to Korea visitors for free which caused the actual available
number to be 2500. Super Junior fans collected in the entry of the Expo
Cultural Centre, and the strong emotion led to the occurrence of
violence, resulting in casualties. A local armed police said that this
is his first time to see such a “crazy” situation in
Expo 2010
since the Expo park was opened. [ 145 ] [ 146 ]

[MUST READ IT ]"Alasan Mengapa Kita Harus Bangga Menjadi EVERLASTING FRIEND"
Ini pembukaannya yaah... "Alasan Mengapa Kita Harus Bangga Menjadi EVERLASTING FRIEND" >
#1.Dear ELFs , apa kalian tahu, nama kita ini diberikan oleh Leader Park Jung Soo ? URI LEADER!!! Adakah orang lain memberikan nama kepada fansnya seperti Uri Leader menyebut kita EVERLASTING FRIEND ? Kau tahu apa makna EVERLASTING FRIEND ? Teman selamanya , bukankah menjadi teman untuk selamanya itu lebih berarti daripada menjadi fans ? Daripada
menyebut dan menjadikan kita sekedar penggemar, mereka menyebut kita
teman untuk selamanya . Indah bukan , EVERLASTING FRIEND – dua kata ini
terdengar begitu tulus. *bagaimana benarkah ini,apakah kalian
setuju akan ini,lihatlah betapa sayangnya mereka terhadap kita, mereka
menganggap kita lebih dari sekedar fans. Mereka menganggap kita ini
TEMAN, yah TEMAN selamanya, taman selalu akan ada disaat suka maupun
duka, tidak perduli halangan sebesar apapun. berikan tanggapan kalian yah memberdeul ? XD
#2.
Bukankah kalian bangga mengenal mereka, sebuah grup yang berbeda dengan
grup lain. Saat Grup lain tumbuh dari promosi yang besar-besaran, Super
Junior kita tumbuh dan mengawali ini semua dari rasa sakit . Super
Junior kita hanya dijadikan sebuah project Group bernama Super Junior
05 , kalian tahu apa artinya Project Group? Sebuah Group yang akan
mengalami pergantian member tiap tahun dan akan bubar sewaktu-waktu bila
tak bisa memasuki pasar. Dan sekarang lihatlah, sebuah Project Group itu kini menjadi KING OF KOREAN WAVE !!! TIDAKKAH KALIAN BANGGA? Rasa sakit kita berganti menjadi rasa puas, air mata kesedihan kita berubah menjadi airmata haru. Jika
ada banyak cibiran bahkan hinaan diluar sana, seperti kata-kata "Kalian
mencintai idola kuno, mencintai kumpulan-kumpulan orang yang tidak
begitu menarik di panggung dengan usia yang sudah tua." ABAIKAN
SAJA, kita jangan pernah kita tinggalkan mereka, janganlah malu untuk
tetap menjadi seorang ELF sejati, dan jangan pernah malu menyebut diri
kalian ELF. Karena hanya Super Junior kita yang melakukan apa yang tidak
dilakukan orang lain dan mereka adalah cinta kita . Mereka membuat kita
mengenal banyak hal yang lain. Mereka membuat kita mengenal kalian dari
berbagai negara . Mereka membuat kita belajar bahasa asing . Mereka
memberi kita semangat dalam keseharian keseharian kita. **benarkan ini memberdeul, SUPER JUNIOR adalah BINTANG KEHIDUPAN kita....
#3.Adakah
kalian temukan sebuah grup yang sangat erat seperti ini? Yang menangis
saat jumlah angka di panggung tidaklah lengkap, yang terus meyakinkan
para fans nya bahwa mereka baik-baik saja . Siapa kah yang
memperkenalkan diri pada fans sebagai Kangin , Kibum dan Hangeng di atas
panggung saat mereka bertiga tidak hadir? Dia Leader kita , Park Jung
Soo – The best Leader ever !!! Hanya ada 10 orang di panggung
kemudian Leeteuk kita mengambil langkah ke samping, meloncat ke kiri dan
berkata “namaku Kim Ki Bum “ , mengambil langkah lagi “namaku Kangin ”
dan sekali langkah terakhir “namaku Hankyung” . Tidakkah kalian menangis??? Apa maksudnya??? kalian tahu? Dia meyakinkan kita bahwa Super Junior bukanlah 10 orang melainkan 13 orang!!! *apakah
kalian ingat semua ini memberdeul, lihatlah sebenarnya betapa sakitnya
hati mereka akan hal ini, mereka terluka saat mereka harus terpisah,
saat mereka harus jauh, tapi mereka tetap berusaha meyakinkan kita,
kalau mereka baik-baik saja, mereka jarang mengungkapkan kesedihan
mereka ini didepan ELF, mereka hanya menyimpan ini sendiri, mereka ga
mau kalau kita merasakan sakit perih, sesakit yang mereka rasakan.
Mereka benar-benar menagis saat tahun demi tahun kebersamaan mereka
semakin hilang dan menurun, sebenarnya bukan hilang, tapi mereka sedang
berada dalam masa tidak seperti dulu, secara nyata mereka memang tidak
bersama lagi, tetapi yakinlah hati mereka tetap satu, marilah kita tetap
tautkan hati dan kepercayaan pada BINTANG KEHIDUPAN kita, kita bantu
mereka, kita tunjukkan kepada mereka, kalau kita juga kuat, kita bisa
melewati semua ini bersama, dan indah pada waktunya nati,PERCAYALAH
ELF..^^
#4.Apa
kalian ingat saat Heechul tidak keluar kamar sama sekali setelah
kepergian Hankyung? Kemudian Heechul menundukkan wajahnya, menutup
mukanya di panggung dan menyanyi sambil duduk, setelah itu ia mendongak
dan wajahnya tampak basah. Ia lari ke belakang panggung terlebih dahulu,
tidak ingin ELF melihatnya , tak ingin melihat kesedihannya. Saat itu
kita tahu, Ia merindukan Hankyung. Kalian juga ingat dengan
kejadian ini, “Kyuhyun , sembuhlah, aku berjanji kalau kau sembuh maka
tidak masalah jika tiap hari kau menjahiliku” siapa yang mengucapkan ini
sambil menangis?wajahnya menunduk dan buliran airmatanya terus
berjatuhan saat KyuHyun mengalami kecelakaan parah tahun 2007 silam? Dia
Yesung kita!!! Kim Jong Woon!!! Bukankah ini membuat airmata kita jatuh
juga, tulang rusuk Kyuhyun patah dan divonis sudah tidak bisa bernyanyi
lagi, atau kemungkinan lain ialah ia akan mati. Semua member
menangis saat itu dan apa kalian tahu saat tampil di panggung pun
EunHyuk kita, Lee Hyuk Jae kita menangis melihat seorang ELF membawa
banner “Get Well Soon KyuHyun opaa” . Saat menonton idola di panggung, bukankah kebanyakan fans akan membawa banner bertuliskan kalimat pujian untuk idola ? Tapi elf melakukan yang lain , … Kita membawa tulisan dan doa , kita berdoa agar Kyuhyun kita cepat sembuh
Saat
semua orang sibuk menyanyi, seseorang menarik diri dari kerumunan dan
membungkuk di hadapan fans saat itu, ia membungkuk 90 derajat , ia
berterimakasih pada kita, kalian tahu siapa? ITU PARK JUNG SOO !! LEADER
KITA!! LEADER unggulan yang selalu bersikap baik-baik saja meskipun ia
jatuh sakit! *lihatlah mereka saling melindungi satu sama lain,
betapa besarnya rasa cinta mereka akan kebersamaan mereka. Adakah yang
lebih hebat dari mereka ? mereka lah yang terhebat, mereka punya hati
& perasaan cinta yang tulus. Sikap merekalah yang menjadi motivasi
kita para ELF, kita mengikuti jejak mereka, kita selalu berusaha
melakukan yang terbaik, tak hanya demi mereka bahkan antara kita para
ELF.
#5.Adakah
orang lain yang meminta maaf atas kesalahan yang tidak ia perbuat di
Chin Chin radio? Dia adalah KANGIN , KIM YOUNG WOON kita !! Bukankah
berjiwa besar, bahkan ia meminta maaf pada para pendengar radio atas
kesalahan yang sebenarnya dibuat teman siarannya saat itu. Bukankah
kita bangga memiliki SHIN DONG kita, seorang pekerja keras yang rendah
hati. Ia selalu berkata bahwa ia tak pantas berada di dalam Group ini,
tapi kita semua tahu bahwa dia layak di sini . Dia pintar dance, dia
juga bisa bernyanyi . Apa kalian menemukan orang lain yang merendah
seperti ini? Sungguh, aku bangga menjadi everlasting friend untuk super
junior . Ki Bum selalu merasa bahwa ia hanyalah anak cover Super
Junior, ia selalu merasa ia jauh lebih buruk daripada yang lain. Dia
tidak pernah menyombongkan diri akan kemampuan yang ia punya. Bahkan
setiap hari minggu setelah pulang ke Gereja pun ia menyempatkan latihan
vocal lagi, ia ingin bisa bernyanyi seperti yang lain. Dear ELF, kita
memang harus dan harus bangga mengenal orang penuh talenta tapi ia
merasa sangat kecil seperti ini? Hanya KI BUM!! Ki Bum superjunior!! *Lihatlah
betapa mulianya hati mereka, betapa rendah hatinya mereka, bahkan
mereka sering merasa tidak percaya diri pada diri mereka sendiri,
padahal bagi kita mereka itu sudah sangat lebih dari sempurna.!!!
tenanglah kami ELF akan selalu memberikan dukungan & cinta pada
kalian...BINTANG KEHIDUPAN KAMI..!!!
#6.Kita
harus bangga dengan SIWON kita , bahkan ia mengucapkan ucapan bela
sungkawa kepada fan yang meninggal dunia . Apa artis lain melakukan ini
juga? Saat artist lain menyebut penggmarnya dengan sebutan ‘fans
kami’ , SJ kita lebih memilih untuk menyebut diri kita “ELF YEOROBUN” .
Suju kita sering bukan mengucapkan selamat tidur, selamat pagi kepada
kita ? mereka ramah sekali bukan, bahkan tak Cuma berkata “Good night
fans” tetapi “Good night ELFs”. Di saat Super Show berlangsung,
apakah member SUJU kita berlaku jaim? TIDAK!! Mereka selalu tampil apa
adanya . Bahkan satu persatu member mengucapkan “ Saranghae ELF ,
saranghaeyo ELF , Wo ai ni ELF, ELF I LOVE YOU” Mereka selalu menyebut nama kita, selalu berterimakasih terhadap kita, selalu ELF , ELF dan ELF yang disebut!! Dan
tahun kemarin saat mereka kalah dalam GDA, leeteuk kita menangis. Kita
tahu setelah itu member suju meminta maaf kepada kita “maaf, kami akan
berusaha lebih baik, fighting!” . Airmata yang tak seharusnya jatuh itu
hanya karena mereka takut membuat ELF kecewa. SEE ELFs !! Mereka sangat
mencintai kita. SJ kita berjalan ke seluruh sudut panggung lalu
membungkukkan badan, mereka sangat berterimakasih terhadap kehadiran dan
dukungan kita. Bahkan mereka berteriak kepada salah satu penonton
yang merupakan seorang nenek tua di situ , member SJ berkata
“terimakasih nenek atas kehadirannya, kami mencintaimu” ELFs, apa
kalian tahu? Saat pertama kali SUJU memenangkan award, kalimat pertama
yang di ucapkan DongHae kita adalah “ayah, aku harap kau sehat” . Siapa
yang bisa melakukan ini? Bahkan DongHae kembali ke panggung setelah 2
hari ayahnya meninggal . Hanya seorang Lee Dong Hae dari Super Junior
yang bisa melakukan ini. Semua sakit yang kita lewati bersama,
biarkan menjadi sebuah kenangan yang indah. Apa kalian sudah jenuh
dengan Super Junior? Apa kalian letih melihat jumlah angka yang tidak
genap? Bukan hanya kalian, suju kita pun sakit hati. Tapi bukankah
mereka selalu meyakinkan pada kita bahwa selamanya suju tetaplah 13 ?
#7.KyuHyun
berkata “ Super Junior itu di awali dari LeeTeuk dan diakhiri dengan
ELFs” . Leeteuk berkata “Super Junior tumbuh dari cinta ELF dan
masyarakat, bukan dari cinta yang lain” YA!! BENAR sekali , Super
Junior kita bertahan karena cinta dari ELF . Apa kalian pikir management
mereka akan mempertahankan SJ bila tidak ada ELF? Tidak! Selama 6 tahun
ini pun, lihatlah … bukankah peran ELF dan BROADCAST management mereka
LEBIH BESAR, ELF & BROADCAST management LEBIH PEDULI dengan SJ
daripada perusahaan mereka sendiri?pesawat yang dimiliki anak suju
berasal dari SM? Tidak! Pesawat itu hadiah dari Broadcast management
Super Junior. Maka dari itu kita harus sangat berterimakasih kepada
BroadCast management . Kita semua telah sakit hati ketika
mendengar kabar ketidak adilan perusahaan terhadap SJ kita, bukan hanya
itu tapi komentar pedas dari Lee Soo Man mengenai suju pun menyakiti
kita. Jadi begitukah? SJ didebutkan karena ‘kasihan’ ? Dan mari kita tunjukan pada mereka bahwa ini tidak benar !! Apa kalian fikir kita bertahan karena belas kasihan? TIDAK !!! Kalian
tahu, ELFs ?? SUJU kita bertahan hingga tahun ke-enam. INI HEBAT,
DAEBAK!!! Kita memecahkan rekor kutukan 5 tahun dalam SM entertainment
!!! INI KARENA KALIAN , ELFs . INI SEMUA KARENA KITA PARA ELF, karena cinta kita kepada mereka dan hanya untuk mereka BINTANG KEHIDUPAN KITA.
#8.HANYA ELF YANG BISA MELAKUKAN INI …!! Di saat fans lain membuatkan satu atau dua buah lagu untuk idolanya, maka ELF kita membuatkan SATU ALBUM PENUH . ELF
bahkan membeli 0,1 persen saham di SM entertainment sejak Henry tampil
di video don’t don, bukankah kita sangat ingin ikut andil menyangkut
apapun terkait SJ kita? Saat itu kita khawatir SJ akan bertambah member
lagi dan kita bersama membuat project “protect 13” Hanya ELF yang
bisa membuat 13 member SUJU menangis tanpa kecuali saat kalian semua
satu stadion menyanyikan lagu MARRY YOU sampai selesai *di SUSHOW 1,
disitu Leeteuk yang paling menangis sedih. Hanya ELF yang bisa membuat janji paling indah , 13elieve in their prom15e … Hanya ELF yang rela berhari-hari digigit nyamuk karena membuat tenda di dekat dorm suju … Hanya ELF yang bisa membuat SWALAYAN BESAR di korea menampilkan tulisan dukungan untuk 4jib super junior, bonamana … Hanya ELF yang bisa membuat seorang anak kecil tunanetra bermain piano dan menyanyikan lagu SHINING STAR … Hanya ELF … Hanya kita … sekali
lagi lihatlah betapa hebatnya kita para ELF yang bersatu, kita rela
mengeluarkan uang sebesar apapun demi BINTANG KEHIDUPAN kita ini. Bahkan
rela menyisihkan sebagian besar uang saku kita, hanya untuk membeli
segala hal yang terkait dengan SJ, sebagai bentuk nyata dukungan kepada
SJ. Kita rela mengeluarkan uang yang tidak sedikit, untuk
memberika dukungan langsung kepada mereka dan melihat secara langsung
betapa hebatnya mereka dan luar biasanya mereka saat menghibur kita
diatas panggung. Hanya ELF yang bisa membuat penjualan tiket habis dalam hitungan menit saja. Hanya ELF yang mampu membuat SJ kini sejajar bahakn lebih dari artis-artis lain diluar Korea, seperti Hollywood Ent.
#9.Lihatlah tulisan dalam handuk yang dipegang leader kita ini ? *lihat piccu yang admin share.* Handuk ini bertuliskan “SUJU RULES THE WORLD” , maksudnya SUPER JUNIOR WILL NOT STOP UNTIL SHAPPIRE BLUE COVERS THE WORLD !!! "SUPER JUNIOR TIDAK AKAN BERHENTI SAMPAI SHAPPIRE BLUE *ELF* MENYEBAR/MENUTUPI SELURUH DUNIA" ketika Leeteuk ditanya , “apa yang akan kamu lakukan akhir tahun ini” kemudian ia menjawab “menerima penghargaan” jadi
ELF, kita mau kan sama-sama membantu Super Junior kita? memenangkan
Daesang tahun ini? Kita bersama-sama akan mengantarkan Leader kita wamil
dengan daesang di tangan. Jangan biarkan dirimu menyesal, satu voting suara kalian sangat berarti . Kita bukan pengemis, kita tidak harus meminta bantuan fandom lain dengan cara kotor. dan ingat, voting kita bertujuan untuk SUJU bukan untuk balas dendam . Berikan
bukti dukungan kita di semua ajang yang diikuti SJ, bahkan buktikan
dengan meningkatkan penjualan ALBUM FISIK & ALBUM DIGITAL mereaka. Mari kita sama-sama ciptakan keajaiban lain, ELF dan SUPER JUNIOR adalah KEAJAIBAN~ SUPER JUNIOR DAEBAK~~~ELF DAEBAK~~~@@@~~~!!!!
