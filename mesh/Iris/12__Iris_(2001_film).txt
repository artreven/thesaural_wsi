Common Disorders in Retirement Age. There are literally hundreds of labelled mental illnesses and disorders, and this summary is not an attempt to list them all, we wish to stick to the basic most common causes of illness in retirement age mental health. It is important for any mental health professional to know the basics of the biology of the human brain and how different sections of the brain affect behaviours and illicit changes in the function as a human being, it is of paramount importance to recognise that a deficit in function of a person, must be a refocus on what the person can do. I have started off here with a summary of what is commonly referred to as the 3 D's ( Delerium, Depression and Dementia), these three broadly title subjects are the most common causes of illness in the retirement age population. All present with confusion symptoms. When tackling the broad field of dementia I have included detailed descriptions of the most common types of dementia. Here are a few links to ther biology of the brain and how it affects human behaviour. 1.

Confusion is a common condition of older adults that often presents a challenging nursing concern. An estimated 5% to 10% of older adults experience some degree of cognitive impairment. Some degree of cognitive dysfunction is noted in as many as one-half of patients over 80 years old. Up to 95% of institutionalized (extended care) older adults have cognitive or neuropsychological problems (Christensen & Benfield, 1998; Costa & Somerfield, 1996). Mental disorders in older adults present a major challenge in terms of accurate diagnosis and management. Evaluating the cognitive status of confused older adults is an essential skill that is poorly understood and often overlooked by nurses. Often the nurse attributes the confusion to Alzheimer's
disease
and assumes that interventions are not necessary, although the older adult may actually have a treatable delirium or depression. The ability to differentiate among three disorders--delirium, dementia, and depression--may lead to early identification and treatment of potentially reversible causes of confusion, and to an increase in the quality of life for older adults.
Here is a link below to an ICU confusion assessment process, this helps us understand the process of elimination of root causes of symptoms of confusion.

Dementia
Dementia is the most prevalent neurologic disorder in older adults. An estimated 5% to 10% of the U.S. adult population ages 65 and older is affected by a dementing disorder, and incidence doubles every 5 years after age 65. As many as 40% are affected by age 85 (Messinger-Rapport, 2003). Currently, 4 million people in the United States have dementia, with a projected increase to 9 million by the year 2030 (Howarth, Heath, & Snope, 1999).
Broadly defined, dementia is an observable, irreversible decline in mental abilities (APA, 2000). Age is the most important risk factor. The incidence of dementia increases exponentially with age, approximately doubling every 5 years. Dementia affects only 1% of individuals under the age of 65, and approximately 22% of those 65 to 85 years of age, but incidence increases to 40% in individuals over the age of 85 (Howarth et al., 1999). Study results have shown no consistent differences in rates of dementia between men and women or among races (Howart et al., 1999; Messinger-Rapport, 2003). However, significantly more women than men are affected by dementia because a higher proportion of women live to advanced old age. Deduced from given statistics, trauma appears to be an independent risk factor but perhaps only in people with a genetic disposition for dementia. Additionally, a family history increases the risk of the disease fourfold (Perkins, 1998).
Dementia is defined specifically as a
cognitive
disorder characterized by multiple deficits of physiologic causes (APA, 2000). It is a permanent progressive decline in cognitive function. Dementia is a syndrome characterized by (a) a decrease in cognition from a previously higher level, (b) emergence of behavioral disturbances, and (c) interference with daily function and independence (APA, 2000). Symptoms progress along a continuum from forgetfulness to a total lack of capacity for self-care, incontinence, and failure to recognize relatives, including spouses. As the disease progresses, problems of language, apraxia (inability to carry out motor function despite intact motor ability), and agnosia (failure to recognize of identify objects) become increasingly apparent. The occurrence of behavioral disturbances often is the factor that forces the family members of individuals with dementia to seek medical help. Common disruptive behaviors include wandering, refusing care, combative behaviors, and socially inappropriate behaviors. Extra-pyramidal features often emerge with the appearance of primitive reflexes such as grasper or sucking reflexes. The condition generally lasts 7 to 15 years (Perkins, 1998). == Alzheimer's disease (AD) (53%), vascular dementia (23%), or a combination of both (14%) account for the majority of progressive dementias. The remaining 10% of dementias are caused by metabolic or toxic effects on cognitive brain functioning--vitamin deficiencies ([B.sub.12]), hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, heavy metal intoxication--or by central nervous system disease such as diffuse Lewy body disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, Parkinson's, Huntington's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, HIV, and Pick's disease (Perkins, 1998).
Here in some detail are the two most common forms of dementia accounting for 76% of all diagnosed dementia. It is important to note that many people suffer a mixed dementia of the two types.
Alzheimer's
Characteristics
The disease course is divided into four stages, with progressive patterns of
cognitive
and
functional
impairments .
Pre-dementia
The first symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to
aging
or
stress . [ 5 ]
Detailed
neuropsychological
testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up to eight years before a person fulfills the clinical criteria for
diagnosis
of AD. [ 20 ]
These early symptoms can affect the most complex
daily living activities . [ 21 ]
The most noticeable deficit is memory loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information. [ 20 ] [ 22 ]
Subtle problems with the
executive functions
of
attentiveness ,
planning , flexibility, and
abstract thinking , or impairments in
semantic memory
(memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of the early stages of AD. [ 20 ]
Apathy
can be observed at this stage, and remains the most persistent
neuropsychiatric
symptom throughout the course of the disease. [ 23 ]
The preclinical stage of the disease has also been termed
mild cognitive impairment , [ 22 ]
but whether this term corresponds to a different diagnostic stage or identifies the first step of AD is a matter of dispute. [ 24 ]
Early
In people with AD the increasing impairment of learning and memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small portion of them, difficulties with language, executive functions,
perception
( agnosia ), or execution of movements ( apraxia ) are more prominent than memory problems. [ 25 ]
AD does not affect all memory capacities equally.
Older memories
of the person's life ( episodic memory ), facts learned ( semantic memory ), and
implicit memory
(the memory of the body on how to do things, such as using a fork to eat) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]
Language problems
are mainly characterised by a shrinking
vocabulary
and decreased word
fluency , which lead to a general impoverishment of oral and
written language . [ 25 ] [ 28 ]
In this stage, the person with Alzheimer's is usually capable of adequately communicating basic ideas. [ 25 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ]
While performing
fine motor tasks
such as writing, drawing or dressing, certain movement coordination and planning difficulties ( apraxia ) may be present but they are commonly unnoticed. [ 25 ]
As the disease progresses, people with AD can often continue to perform many tasks independently, but may need assistance or supervision with the most cognitively demanding activities. [ 25 ]
Moderate
Progressive deterioration eventually hinders independence; with subjects being unable to perform most common activities of daily living. [ 25 ]
Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions ( paraphasias ). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost. [ 25 ] [ 29 ]
Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases. [ 25 ]
During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives. [ 25 ]
Long-term memory , which was previously intact, becomes impaired. [ 25 ]
Behavioural and
neuropsychiatric
changes become more prevalent. Common manifestations are
wandering ,
irritability
and
labile affect , leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated
aggression , or resistance to caregiving. [ 25 ]
Sundowning
can also appear. [ 30 ]
Approximately 30% of people with AD develop
illusionary misidentifications
and other
delusional
symptoms. [ 25 ]
Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations ( anosognosia ). [ 25 ]
Urinary incontinence
can develop. [ 25 ]
These symptoms create
stress
for relatives and caretakers, which can be reduced by moving the person from
home care
to other
long-term care facilities . [ 25 ] [ 31 ]
Advanced
During this last stage of AD, the person is completely dependent upon caregivers. [ 25 ]
Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech. [ 25 ] [ 29 ]
Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. [ 25 ]
Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and
exhaustion
are much more common results. [ 25 ]
People with AD will ultimately not be able to perform even the simplest tasks without assistance. [ 25 ]
Muscle mass
and mobility deteriorate to the point where they are bedridden, and they lose the ability to feed themselves. [ 25 ]
AD is a terminal illness, with the cause of death typically being an external factor, such as infection of
pressure ulcers
or
pneumonia , not the disease itself. [ 25 ]
Causation
Microscopy image of a neurofibrillary tangle, conformed by hyperphosphorylated
tau protein
The cause for most Alzheimer's cases is still essentially unknown [ 32 ] [ 33 ]
(except for 1% to 5% of cases where genetic differences have been identified). Several competing
hypotheses
exist trying to explain the cause of the disease. The oldest, on which most currently available drug therapies are based, is the
cholinergic
hypothesis , [ 34 ]
which proposes that AD is caused by reduced synthesis of the
neurotransmitter
acetylcholine . The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support, largely because medications intended to treat acetylcholine deficiency have not been very effective. Other cholinergic effects have also been proposed, for example, initiation of large-scale aggregation of amyloid, [ 35 ]
leading to generalised neuroinflammation. [ 36 ]
In 1991, the
amyloid
hypothesis
postulated that amyloid beta (AÎ²) deposits are the fundamental cause of the disease. [ 37 ] [ 38 ]
Support for this postulate comes from the location of the gene for the
amyloid beta precursor protein
(APP) on
chromosome 21 , together with the fact that people with
trisomy 21
( Down Syndrome ) who have an extra
gene copy
almost universally exhibit AD by 40Â years of age. [ 39 ] [ 40 ]
Also
APOE4 , the major genetic risk factor for AD, leads to excess amyloid buildup in the brain before AD symptoms arise. Thus, AÎ² deposition precedes clinical AD. [ 41 ]
Further evidence comes from the finding that
transgenic
mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with spatial learning deficits. [ 42 ]
An experimental vaccine was found to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, but it did not have any significant effect on dementia. [ 43 ]
Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque AÎ² oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of AÎ². These toxic oligomers, also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. [ 44 ]
One receptor for AÎ² oligomers may be the
prion protein , the same protein that has been linked to
mad cow disease
and the related human condition,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease. [ 45 ]
In 2009, this theory was updated, suggesting that a close relative of the beta-amyloid protein, and not necessarily the beta-amyloid itself, may be a major culprit in the disease. The theory holds that an amyloid-related mechanism that prunes neuronal connections in the brain in the fast-growth phase of early life may be triggered by aging-related processes in later life to cause the neuronal withering of Alzheimer's disease. [ 46 ]
N-APP, a fragment of APP from the peptide's
N-terminus , is adjacent to beta-amyloid and is cleaved from APP by one of the same enzymes. N-APP triggers the self-destruct pathway by binding to a neuronal receptor called death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as
TNFRSF21 ). [ 46 ]
DR6 is highly expressed in the human brain regions most affected by Alzheimer's, so it is possible that the N-APP/DR6 pathway might be hijacked in the aging brain to cause damage. In this model, beta-amyloid plays a complementary role, by depressing synaptic function.
A 2004 study found that deposition of amyloid plaques does not correlate well with neuron loss. [ 47 ]
This observation supports the
tau hypothesis , the idea that
tau protein
abnormalities initiate the disease cascade. [ 38 ]
In this model, hyperphosphorylated tau begins to pair with other threads of tau. Eventually, they form
neurofibrillary tangles
inside nerve cell bodies. [ 48 ]
When this occurs, the
microtubules
disintegrate, collapsing the neuron's transport system. [ 49 ]
This may result first in malfunctions in biochemical communication between neurons and later in the death of the cells. [ 50 ]
Herpes simplex
virus type 1 has also been proposed to play a causative role in people carrying the susceptible versions of the
apoE
gene. [ 51 ]
Another hypothesis asserts that the disease may be caused by age-related
myelin
breakdown in the brain. Demyelination leads to axonal transport disruptions, leading to loss of neurons that become stale. Iron released during myelin breakdown is hypothesized to cause further damage. Homeostatic myelin repair processes contribute to the development of proteinaceous deposits such as amyloid-beta and tau. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ]
Oxidative stress
and dys- homeostasis
of
biometal (biology)
metabolism may be significant in the formation of the pathology. [ 55 ] [ 56 ]
AD individuals show 70% loss of
locus coeruleus
cells that provide
norepinephrine
(in addition to its neurotransmitter role) that locally diffuses from "varicosities" as an endogenous
antiinflammatory
agent in the microenvironment around the neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels in the neocortex and hippocampus. [ 57 ]
It has been shown that norepinephrine stimulates mouse microglia to suppress AÎ²-induced production of cytokines and their
phagocytosis
of AÎ². [ 57 ]
This suggests that degeneration of the locus ceruleus might be responsible for increased AÎ² deposition in AD brains. [ 57 ]
Pathophysiology
Main article:
Biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease

Neuropathology
Alzheimer's disease is characterised by loss of
neurons
and
synapses
in the
cerebral cortex
and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross
atrophy
of the affected regions, including degeneration in the
temporal lobe
and
parietal lobe , and parts of the
frontal cortex
and
cingulate gyrus . [ 36 ]
Studies using
MRI
and
PET
have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults. [ 58 ]
Both
amyloid plaques
and
neurofibrillary tangles
are clearly visible by
microscopy
in brains of those afflicted by AD. [ 11 ]
Plaques are dense, mostly
insoluble
deposits of
amyloid-beta
peptide
and
cellular
material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau which has become hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles as a consequence of aging, the brains of people with AD have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe. [ 59 ]
Lewy bodies
are not rare in the brains of people with AD. [ 60 ]
Biochemistry
Enzymes act on the APP (amyloid precursor protein) and cut it into fragments. The beta-amyloid fragment is crucial in the formation of senile plaques in AD.
Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a
protein misfolding
disease ( proteopathy ), caused by accumulation of abnormally folded A-beta and tau proteins in the brain. [ 61 ]
Plaques are made up of small
peptides , 39Â43Â  amino acids
in length, called
beta-amyloid
(also written as A-beta or AÎ²). Beta-amyloid is a fragment from a larger protein called
amyloid precursor protein
(APP), a
transmembrane protein
that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival and post-injury repair. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]
In Alzheimer's disease, an unknown process causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments by
enzymes
through
proteolysis . [ 64 ]
One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of beta-amyloid, which form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as
senile plaques . [ 11 ] [ 65 ]
In Alzheimer's disease, changes in tau protein lead to the disintegration of microtubules in brain cells.
AD is also considered a
tauopathy
due to abnormal aggregation of the
tau protein . Every neuron has a
cytoskeleton , an internal support structure partly made up of structures called
microtubules . These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the
axon
and back. A protein called
tau
stabilizes the microtubules when
phosphorylated , and is therefore called a
microtubule-associated protein . In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming
hyperphosphorylated ; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system. [ 66 ]
Disease mechanism
Exactly how disturbances of production and aggregation of the beta amyloid peptide gives rise to the pathology of AD is not known. [ 67 ]
The amyloid hypothesis traditionally points to the accumulation of beta amyloid
peptides
as the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated amyloid
fibrils , which are believed to be the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's
calcium
ion
homeostasis , induces
programmed cell death
( apoptosis ). [ 68 ]
It is also known that AÎ² selectively builds up in the
mitochondria
in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected brains, and it also inhibits certain
enzyme
functions and the utilisation of
glucose
by neurons. [ 69 ]
Various inflammatory processes and
cytokines
may also have a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.
Inflammation
is a general marker of
tissue
damage in any disease, and may be either secondary to tissue damage in AD or a marker of an immunological response. [ 70 ]
Alterations in the distribution of different
neurotrophic factors
and in the expression of their receptors such as the
brain derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) have been described in AD. [ 71 ] [ 72 ]
Genetics
The vast majority of cases of Alzheimer's disease are sporadic, meaning that they are not genetically inherited although some genes may act as risk factors. On the other hand, around 0.1% of the cases are familial forms of
autosomal
dominant (not sex-linked) inheritance, which usually have an onset before age 65. [ 73 ]
This form of the disease is known as
Early onset familial Alzheimer's disease .
Most of autosomal dominant familial AD can be attributed to mutations in one of three genes:
amyloid precursor protein
(APP) and
presenilins
1 and 2. [ 74 ]
Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called
AÎ² 42, which is the main component of
senile plaques . [ 75 ]
Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between AÎ²42 and the other major formsÂe.g., AÎ²40Âwithout increasing AÎ²42 levels. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]
This suggests that presenilin mutations can cause disease even if they lower the total amount of AÎ² produced and may point to other roles of presenilin or a role for alterations in the function of APP and/or its fragments other than AÎ².
Most cases of Alzheimer's disease do not exhibit autosomal-dominant inheritance and are termed sporadic AD. Nevertheless genetic differences may act as
risk factors . The best known genetic risk factor is the inheritance of the Îµ4
allele
of the
apolipoprotein E
(APOE). [ 77 ] [ 78 ]
Between 40 and 80% of people with AD possess at least one apoE4 allele. [ 78 ]
The APOEÎµ4 allele increases the risk of the disease by three times in heterozygotes and by 15 times in homozygotes. [ 73 ]
However, it must be noted that this "genetic" effect is not necessarily purely genetic. For example, certain Nigerian populations have no relationship between presence or dose of APOEÎµ4 and incidence or age-of-onset for Alzheimer's disease. [ 79 ]
[ 80 ]
Geneticists agree that numerous other genes also act as risk factors or have protective effects that influence the development of late onset Alzheimer's disease, [ 74 ]
but results such as the Nigerian studies and the incomplete
penetrance
for all genetic risk factors associated with sporadic Alzheimers indicate a strong role for environmental effects. Over 400 genes have been tested for association with late-onset sporadic AD, [ 74 ]
most with null results. [ 73 ]
Diagnosis
PET scan
of the brain of a person with AD showing a loss of function in the temporal lobe
Alzheimer's disease is usually diagnosed clinically from the patient history, collateral history from relatives, and clinical observations, based on the presence of characteristic
neurological
and
neuropsychological
features and the
absence of alternative conditions . [ 81 ] [ 82 ]
Advanced
medical imaging
with
computed tomography
(CT) or
magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), and with
single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) or
positron emission tomography
(PET) can be used to help exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia. [ 83 ]
Moreover, it may predict conversion from prodromal stages (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer's disease. [ 84 ]
Assessment of intellectual functioning
including memory testing can further characterise the state of the disease. [ 5 ]
Medical organisations have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardise the diagnostic process for practicing physicians. The diagnosis can be confirmed with very high accuracy
post-mortem
when brain material is available and can be examined
histologically . [ 85 ]
Criteria
The
National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke
(NINCDS) and the
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association
(ADRDA, now known as the
Alzheimer's Association ) established the most commonly used
NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria
for diagnosis in 1984, [ 85 ]
extensively updated in 2007. [ 86 ]
These criteria require that the presence of
cognitive impairment , and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by
neuropsychological testing
for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A
histopathologic
confirmation including a
microscopic
examination of
brain tissue
is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good
statistical reliability
and
validity
have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. [ 87 ]
Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in ADÂ memory ,
language ,
perceptual skills ,
attention , constructive abilities,
orientation ,
problem solving
and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-IV-TR) published by the
American Psychiatric Association . [ 88 ] [ 89 ]
Techniques
Neuropsychological
screening tests
can help in the diagnosis of AD. In them people have to copy drawings similar to the one shown in the picture, remember words, read, and subtract serial numbers.
Neuropsychological tests
such as the
mini-mental state examination
(MMSE), are widely used to evaluate the cognitive impairments needed for diagnosis. More comprehensive test arrays are necessary for high reliability of results, particularly in the earliest stages of the disease. [ 90 ] [ 91 ]
Neurological examination
in early AD will usually provide normal results, except for obvious cognitive impairment, which may not differ from that resulting from other diseases processes, including other causes of dementia.
Further neurological examinations are crucial in the
differential diagnosis
of AD and other diseases. [ 5 ]
Interviews with family members are also utilised in the assessment of the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, as well as on the decrease, over time, of the person's
mental function . [ 84 ]
A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own
deficits . [ 92 ]
Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician. [ 93 ]
Another recent objective marker of the disease is the analysis of
cerebrospinal fluid
for amyloid beta or tau proteins, [ 94 ]
both total tau protein and phosphorylated tau 181P
protein concentrations. [ 95 ]
Searching for these proteins using a
spinal tap
can predict the onset of Alzheimer's with a
sensitivity
of between 94% and 100%. [ 95 ]
When used in conjunction with existing
neuroimaging
techniques, doctors can identify people with significant memory loss who are already developing the disease. [ 95 ]
Spinal fluid tests are commercially available, unlike the latest neuroimaging technology. [ 96 ]
Alzheimer's was diagnosed in one-third of the people who did not have any symptoms in a 2010 study, meaning that disease progression occurs well before symptoms occur. [ 97 ]
Supplemental testing provides extra information on some features of the disease or is used to rule out other diagnoses.
Blood tests
can identify other causes for dementia than AD [ 5 ] Âcauses which may, in rare cases, be reversible. [ 98 ]
It is common to perform
thyroid function tests , assess
B12 , rule out
syphillis , rule out metabolic problems (including tests for kidney function, electrolyte levels and for diabetes), assess levels of heavy metals (e.g. lead, mercury) and anemia. (See differential diagnosis for Dementia). (It is also necessary to rule out
delirium ).
Psychological tests
for
depression
are employed, since depression can either be concurrent with AD (see
Depression of Alzheimer disease ), an early sign of cognitive impairment, [ 99 ]
or even the cause. [ 100 ] [ 101 ]
Imaging
When available as a diagnostic tool,
single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) and
positron emission tomography
(PET) neuroimaging are used to confirm a diagnosis of Alzheimer's in conjunction with evaluations involving
mental status examination . [ 102 ]
In a person already having dementia, SPECT appears to be superior in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from other possible causes, compared with the usual attempts employing mental testing and
medical history
analysis. [ 103 ]
Advances have led to the proposal of new diagnostic criteria. [ 5 ] [ 86 ]
A new technique known as
PiB PET
has been developed for directly and clearly imaging beta-amyloid deposits
in vivo
using a
tracer
that
binds
selectively to the A-beta deposits. [ 104 ]
The PiB-PET compound uses
carbon-11
PET scanning. Recent studies suggest that PiB-PET is 86% accurate in predicting which people with mild cognitive impairment will develop Alzheimer's disease within two years, and 92% accurate in ruling out the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's. [ 105 ]
A similar PET scanning
radiopharmaceutical
compound called (E)-4-(2-(6-(2-(2-(2-([ 18 F]-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)pyridin-3-yl)vinyl)-N-methyl benzenamine, or
18 F AV-45, or florbetapir-fluorine-18, or simply
florbetapir , contains the longer-lasting radionuclide
fluorine-18 , has recently been created, and tested as a possible diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ]
Florbetapir, like PiB, binds to beta-amyloid, but due to its use of fluorine-18 has a half-life of 110 minutes, in contrast to PiB's radioactive half life of 20 minutes. Wong
et al.
found that the longer life allowed the tracer to accumulate significantly more in the brains of people with AD, particularly in the regions known to be associated with beta-amyloid deposits. [ 109 ]
One review predicted that amyloid imaging is likely to be used in conjunction with other markers rather than as an alternative. [ 110 ]
Volumetric
MRI
can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study. [ 111 ]
Non-Imaging biomarkers
Recent studies have shown that people with AD had decreased
glutamate
(Glu) as well as decreased Glu/ creatine
(Cr), Glu/myo-inositol (mI), Glu/N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and NAA/Cr ratios compared to normal people. Both decreased NAA/Cr and decreased
hippocampal
glutamate may be an early indicator of AD. [ 112 ]
Early research in mouse models may have identified markers for AD. The applicability of these markers is unknown. [ 113 ]
A small human study in 2011 found that monitoring blood
dehydroepiandrosterone
(DHEA) variations in response to an oxidative stress could be a useful proxy test: the subjects with MCI did not have a DHEA variation, while the healthy controls did. [ 114 ]
Prevention
Intellectual activities such as playing
chess
or regular social interaction have been linked to a reduced risk of AD in epidemiological studies, although no causal relationship has been found.
At present, there is no definitive evidence to support that any particular measure is effective in preventing AD. [ 115 ]
Global studies of measures to prevent or delay the onset of AD have often produced inconsistent results. However, epidemiological studies have proposed relationships between certain modifiable factors, such as diet, cardiovascular risk, pharmaceutical products, or intellectual activities among others, and a population's likelihood of developing AD. Only further research, including clinical trials, will reveal whether these factors can help to prevent AD. [ 116 ]
Although cardiovascular risk factors, such as
hypercholesterolemia ,
hypertension ,
diabetes , and smoking, are associated with a higher risk of onset and course of AD, [ 117 ] [ 118 ]
statins , which are
cholesterol
lowering drugs, have not been effective in preventing or improving the course of the disease. [ 119 ] [ 120 ]
The components of a
Mediterranean diet , which include fruit and vegetables,
bread ,
wheat
and other
cereals ,

fish , and
red wine , may all individually or together reduce the risk and course of Alzheimer's disease. [ 121 ]
Its beneficial cardiovascular effect has been proposed as the mechanism of action. [ 121 ]
There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly red wine, is associated with lower risk of AD. [ 122 ]
Reviews on the use of
vitamins
have not found enough evidence of efficacy to recommend vitamin C, [ 123 ]
E, [ 123 ] [ 124 ]
or folic acid with or without vitamin B 12 , [ 125 ]
as preventive or treatment agents in AD. Additionally vitamin E is associated with important health risks. [ 123 ]
Trials examining folic acid (B9) and other B vitamins failed to show any significant association with cognitive decline. [ 126 ]
Docosahexaenoic acid , an Omega 3 fatty acid, has not been found to slow decline. [ 127 ]
Long-term usage of
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAIDs) is associated with a reduced likelihood of developing AD. [ 128 ]
Human
postmortem
studies, in
animal models , or
in vitro
investigations also support the notion that NSAIDs can reduce inflammation related to amyloid plaques. [ 128 ]
However trials investigating their use as palliative treatment have failed to show positive results while no prevention trial has been completed. [ 128 ]
Curcumin
from the
curry
spice
turmeric
has shown some effectiveness in preventing
brain damage
in
mouse models
due to its anti-inflammatory properties. [ 129 ] [ 130 ]
Hormone replacement therapy , although previously used, is no longer thought to prevent dementia and in some cases may even be related to it. [ 131 ] [ 132 ]
There is inconsistent and unconvincing evidence that
ginkgo
has any positive effect on cognitive impairment and dementia, [ 133 ]
and a recent study concludes that it has no effect in reducing the rate of AD incidence. [ 134 ]
A 21-year study found that coffee drinkers of 3Â5 cups per day at midlife had a 65% reduction in risk of dementia in late-life. [ 135 ]
People who engage in intellectual activities such as reading, playing board games, completing crossword puzzles, playing
musical instruments , or regular
social interaction
show a reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease. [ 136 ]
This is compatible with the
cognitive reserve
theory, which states that some life experiences result in more efficient neural functioning providing the individual a cognitive reserve that delays the onset of dementia manifestations. [ 136 ]
Education delays the onset of AD syndrome, but is not related to earlier death after diagnosis. [ 137 ]
Learning a second language even later in life seems to delay getting Alzheimer disease. [ 138 ]
Physical activity
is also associated with a reduced risk of AD. [ 137 ]
Medical marijuana
appears to be effective in delaying Alzheimer's Disease. The active ingredient in marijuana,
THC , prevents the formation of deposits in the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease. THC was found to inhibit acetylcholinesterase more effectively than commercially marketed drugs. THC was also found to delay amylogenesis. [ 139 ] [ 140 ]
Some studies have shown an increased risk of developing AD with
environmental factors
such the intake of
metals , particularly
aluminium , [ 141 ] [ 142 ]
or exposure to
solvents . [ 143 ]
The quality of some of these studies has been criticised, [ 144 ]
and other studies have concluded that there is no relationship between these environmental factors and the development of AD. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ] [ 148 ]
While some studies suggest that
extremely low frequency
electromagnetic fields may increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease, reviewers found that further epidemiological and laboratory investigations of this hypothesis are needed. [ 149 ]
Smoking is a significant AD risk factor. [ 150 ]
Systemic markers
of the
innate immune system
are risk factors for late-onset AD. [ 151 ]
Management
There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease; available treatments offer relatively small symptomatic benefit but remain
palliative
in nature. Current treatments can be divided into pharmaceutical, psychosocial and caregiving.
Pharmaceutical
Three-dimensional
molecular model
of
donepezil , an
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
used in the treatment of AD symptoms
Molecular structure of
memantine , a medication approved for advanced AD symptoms
Four medications are currently approved by regulatory agencies such as the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and the
European Medicines Agency
(EMA) to treat the cognitive manifestations of AD: three are
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
and the other is
memantine , an
NMDA receptor antagonist . No drug has an indication for delaying or halting the progression of the disease.
Reduction in the activity of the
cholinergic
neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. [ 152 ]
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
are employed to reduce the rate at which
acetylcholine
(ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. [ 153 ]
As of 2008 [update] , the cholinesterase inhibitors approved for the management of AD symptoms are
donepezil
(brand name
Aricept ), [ 154 ]
galantamine
( Razadyne ), [ 155 ]
and
rivastigmine
(branded as
Exelon [ 156 ]
and
Exelon Patch [ 157 ] ). There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, [ 158 ] [ 159 ]
and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. [ 160 ]
The use of these drugs in
mild cognitive impairment
has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. [ 161 ]
The most common
side effects
are
nausea
and
vomiting , both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10Â20% of users and are mild to moderate in severity. Less common secondary effects include
muscle cramps , decreased
heart rate
( bradycardia ), decreased
appetite
and weight, and increased
gastric acid
production. [ 162 ]
Glutamate
is a useful excitatory
neurotransmitter
of the
nervous system , although excessive amounts in the
brain
can lead to
cell
death through a process called
excitotoxicity
which consists of the overstimulation of glutamate
receptors . Excitotoxicity occurs not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also in other neurological diseases such as
Parkinson's disease
and
multiple sclerosis . [ 163 ]
Memantine
(brand names
Akatinol ,
Axura ,
Ebixa / Abixa ,
Memox
and
Namenda ), [ 164 ]
is a noncompetitive
NMDA receptor antagonist
first used as an anti- influenza
agent. It acts on the
glutamatergic system
by blocking
NMDA receptors
and inhibiting their overstimulation by glutamate. [ 163 ]
Memantine has been shown to be moderately efficacious in the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. Its effects in the initial stages of AD are unknown. [ 165 ]
Reported adverse events with memantine are infrequent and mild, including
hallucinations ,
confusion ,
dizziness ,
headache
and
fatigue . [ 166 ]
The combination of memantine and donepezil has been shown to be "of
statistically significant
but clinically marginal effectiveness". [ 167 ]
Antipsychotic
drugs are modestly useful in reducing
aggression
and
psychosis
in Alzheimer's disease with behavioural problems, but are associated with serious adverse effects, such as
cerebrovascular
events,
movement difficulties
or cognitive decline, that do not permit their routine use. [ 168 ] [ 169 ]
When used in the long-term, they have been shown to associate with increased mortality. [ 169 ]
People with AlzheimerÂs disease who have taken
Huperzine A
may have improved general cognitive function, global clinical status, functional performance and reduced behavioural disturbance compared to people taking placebos, according to a Cochrane Review, however, the poor methodological quality of the small trials, including problems with blinding and randomization, led reviewers to conclude "There is currently insufficient evidence of the effects of Huperzine A for Alzheimer's disease (AD)." [ 170 ]
Psychosocial intervention
A specifically designed room for sensory integration therapy, also called
snoezelen ; an emotion-oriented psychosocial intervention for people with dementia
Psychosocial
interventions are used as an adjunct to pharmaceutical treatment and can be classified within behaviour-, emotion-, cognition- or stimulation-oriented approaches. Research on efficacy is unavailable and rarely specific to AD, focusing instead on dementia in general. [ 171 ]
Behavioural interventions
attempt to identify and reduce the antecedents and consequences of problem behaviours. This approach has not shown success in improving overall functioning, [ 172 ]
but can help to reduce some specific problem behaviours, such as
incontinence . [ 173 ]
There is a lack of high quality data on the effectiveness of these techniques in other behaviour problems such as wandering. [ 174 ] [ 175 ]
Emotion-oriented interventions include
reminiscence therapy ,
validation therapy , supportive
psychotherapy ,
sensory integration , also called
snoezelen , and
simulated presence therapy . Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness. [ 171 ]
Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for
cognition
and
mood . [ 176 ]
Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is based on
attachment theories
and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce
challenging behaviours . [ 177 ]
Finally, validation therapy is based on acceptance of the reality and personal truth of another's experience, while sensory integration is based on exercises aimed to stimulate
senses . There is little evidence to support the usefulness of these therapies. [ 178 ] [ 179 ]
The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, which include reality orientation and
cognitive retraining , is the reduction of
cognitive deficits . Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person in order to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities, [ 180 ] [ 181 ]
although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported. [ 171 ]
Stimulation-oriented treatments include
art ,
music
and
pet
therapies,
exercise , and any other kind of
recreational activities . Stimulation has modest support for improving behaviour, mood, and, to a lesser extent, function. Nevertheless, as important as these effects are, the main support for the use of stimulation therapies is the change in the person's routine. [ 171 ]
Caregiving
Further information:
Caregiving and dementia
Since Alzheimer's has no cure and it gradually renders people incapable of tending for their own needs, caregiving essentially is the treatment and must be carefully managed over the course of the disease.
During the early and moderate stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase
patient safety
and reduce caretaker burden. [ 182 ] [ 183 ]
Examples of such modifications are the adherence to simplified routines, the placing of safety locks, the labelling of household items to cue the person with the disease or the use of modified daily life objects. [ 171 ] [ 184 ] [ 185 ]
The patient may also become incapable of feeding themselves, so they require food in smaller pieces or pureed. [ 186 ]
When
swallowing difficulties
arise, the use of
feeding tubes
may be required. In such cases, the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of the caregivers and family members. [ 187 ] [ 188 ]
The use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease, although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with AD or their caregivers. [ 171 ]
As the disease progresses, different medical issues can appear, such as
oral and dental disease ,
pressure ulcers ,
malnutrition ,
hygiene
problems, or
respiratory ,
skin , or
eye
infections . Careful management can prevent them, while professional treatment is needed when they do arise. [ 189 ] [ 190 ]
During the final stages of the disease, treatment is centred on relieving discomfort until death. [ 191 ]
A small recent study in the US concluded that people whose caregivers had a realistic understanding of the prognosis and clinical complications of late dementia were less likely to receive aggressive treatment near the end of life.
[ 192 ]
Feeding tubes
There is strong evidence that
feeding tubes
do not help people with advanced Alzheimer's
dementia
gain weight, regain strength or function, prevent aspiration pneumonias, or improve quality of life. [ 193 ] [ 194 ] [ 195 ] [ 196 ]

The early stages of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living. [ 25 ]
Life expectancy
of the population with the disease is reduced. [ 9 ] [ 197 ] [ 198 ]
The mean life expectancy following diagnosis is approximately seven years. [ 9 ]
Fewer than 3% of people live more than fourteen years. [ 10 ]
Disease features significantly associated with reduced survival are an increased severity of cognitive impairment, decreased functional level, history of falls, and disturbances in the neurological examination. Other coincident diseases such as
heart problems ,
diabetes
or history of
alcohol abuse
are also related with shortened survival. [ 197 ] [ 199 ] [ 200 ]
While the earlier the age at onset the higher the total survival years, life expectancy is particularly reduced when compared to the healthy population among those who are younger. [ 198 ]
Men have a less favourable survival prognosis than women. [ 10 ] [ 201 ]
The disease is the underlying
cause of death
in 70% of all cases. [ 9 ]
Pneumonia
and
dehydration
are the most frequent immediate causes of death, while
cancer
is a less frequent cause of death than in the general population. [ 9 ] [ 201 ]

Two main measures are used in
epidemiological
studies: incidence and prevalence.
Incidence
is the number of new cases per unit of personÂtime at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand personÂyears); while
prevalence
is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at any given time.
Regarding incidence,
cohort
longitudinal studies
(studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand personÂyears for all dementias and 5Â8 for AD, [ 202 ] [ 203 ]
which means that half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every five years after the age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. [ 202 ] [ 203 ]
There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. [ 203 ] [ 204 ]
Prevalence of AD in populations is dependent upon different factors including incidence and survival. Since the incidence of AD increases with age, it is particularly important to include the mean age of the population of interest. In the United States, Alzheimer prevalence was estimated to be 1.6% in 2000 both overall and in the 65Â74 age group, with the rate increasing to 19% in the 75Â84 group and to 42% in the greater than 84 group. [ 205 ]
Prevalence rates in less developed regions are lower. [ 206 ]
The
World Health Organization
estimated that in 2005, 0.379% of people worldwide had dementia, and that the prevalence would increase to 0.441% in 2015 and to 0.556% in 2030. [ 207 ]
Other studies have reached similar conclusions. [ 206 ]
Another study estimated that in 2006, 0.40% of the world population (range 0.17Â0.89%; absolute number
26.6 million , range
11.4Â59.4 million ) were afflicted by AD, and that the prevalence rate would triple and the absolute number would quadruple by 2050. [ 3 ]
History
Alois Alzheimer's patient
Auguste Deter
in 1902. Hers was the first described case of what became known as Alzheimer's disease.
The
ancient Greek and Roman
philosophers
and
physicians
associated old age with increasing
dementia . [ 1 ]
It was not until 1901 that German
psychiatrist
Alois Alzheimer
identified the first case of what became known as Alzheimer's disease in a fifty-year-old woman he called
Auguste D . Alzheimer followed her until she died in 1906, when he first reported the case publicly. [ 208 ]
During the next five years, eleven similar cases were reported in the
medical literature , some of them already using the term Alzheimer's disease. [ 1 ]
The disease was first described as a distinctive disease by
Emil Kraepelin
after suppressing some of the clinical (delusions and hallucinations) and pathological features (arteriosclerotic changes) contained in the original report of Auguste D. [ 209 ]
He included
Alzheimer's disease , also named
presenile
dementia
by Kraepelin, as a subtype of
senile dementia
in the eighth edition of his
Textbook of Psychiatry , published on
July 15,
1910. [ 210 ]
For most of the 20th century, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals between the ages of 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and
pathological
manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not rule out the possibility that they had different causes. [ 211 ]
This eventually led to the diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease
independently of age. [ 212 ]
The term
senile dementia of the Alzheimer type
(SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used for those younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical
nomenclature
to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and
neuropathology . [ 213 ]
Society and culture
Social costs
Dementia, and specifically Alzheimer's disease, may be among the most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, [ 18 ] [ 19 ]
while their cost in other countries such as
Argentina , [ 214 ]
or
South Korea , [ 215 ]
is also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the
ageing
of society, becoming an important
social problem . AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as
nursing
home care , direct nonmedical costs such as in-home
day care , and indirect costs such as lost
productivity
of both patient and caregiver. [ 19 ]
Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160Â billion, [ 216 ]
while costs of Alzheimer in the United States may be $100Â billion each year. [ 19 ]
The greatest origin of costs for society is the
long-term care
by
health care professionals
and particularly
institutionalisation , which corresponds to 2/3 of the total costs for society. [ 18 ]
The cost of living
at home is also very high, [ 18 ]
especially when informal costs for the family, such as caregiving time and caregiver's lost earnings, are taken into account. [ 217 ]
Costs increase with dementia severity and the presence of behavioural disturbances, [ 218 ]
and are related to the increased caregiving time required for the provision of physical care. [ 217 ]
Therefore any treatment that slows cognitive decline, delays institutionalisation or reduces caregivers' hours will have economic benefits. Economic evaluations of current treatments have shown positive results. [ 19 ]
Caregiving burden
Further information:
Caregiving and dementia
The role of the main
caregiver
is often taken by the spouse or a close relative. [ 14 ]
Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on
caregivers
which includes social, psychological, physical or economic aspects. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]
Home care is usually preferred by people with AD and their families. [ 219 ]
This option also delays or eliminates the need for more professional and costly levels of care. [ 219 ] [ 220 ]
Nevertheless two-thirds of nursing home residents have dementias. [ 171 ]
Dementia
caregivers are subject to high rates of physical and
mental
disorders. [ 221 ]
Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and
social isolation . [ 222 ] [ 223 ]
Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47Â hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 per year in the United States, depending on the study. [ 14 ] [ 217 ]
Cognitive behavioural therapy
and the teaching of
coping strategies
either individually or in group have demonstrated their efficacy in improving caregivers' psychological health. [ 15 ] [ 224 ]

Research directions
Main article:
Alzheimer's disease clinical research
As of 2010 [update] , the safety and efficacy of more than 400 pharmaceutical treatments had been or were being investigated in 858
clinical trials
worldwide, and approximately a quarter of these compounds are in
PhaseÂ III
trials; the last step prior to review by regulatory agencies. [ 245 ]
One area of clinical research is focused on treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of
amyloid beta
levels is a common target of compounds [ 246 ]
(such as
apomorphine ) under investigation.
Immunotherapy
or
vaccination
for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. [ 247 ]
Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy would be used to treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training
the immune system
to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. [ 248 ]
An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, [ 249 ] [ 250 ]
although the trials were suspended in 2008. [ 251 ]
Another similar agent is
bapineuzumab , an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. [ 252 ]
Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, [ 253 ]
and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. [ 254 ]
A
TNFÎ±
receptor
fusion protein ,
etanercept
has showed encouraging results. [ 255 ]
In 2008, two separate clinical trials showed positive results in modifying the course of disease in mild to moderate AD with
methylthioninium chloride
(trade name
rember ), a drug that inhibits tau aggregation, [ 256 ] [ 257 ]
and
dimebon , an
antihistamine . [ 258 ]
The consecutive Phase-III trial of Dimebon failed to show positive effects in the primary and secondary endpoints. [ 259 ]
The possibility that AD could be treated with
antiviral
medication is suggested by a study showing colocation of
herpes simplex
virus with amyloid plaques. [ 260 ]
Preliminary research on the effects of meditation on retrieving memory and cognitive functions have been encouraging. Limitations of this research can be addressed in future studies with more detailed analyses. [ 261 ]
An FDA panel voted unanimously to recommend approval of
florbetapir
(tradename: Amyvid), which is currently used in an investigational study. The agent can detect Alzheimer's brain plaques, but will require additional clinical research before it can be made available commercially. [ 262 ]

Multi-infarct dementia
is one type of vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is the second most common form of
dementia
after
Alzheimer's disease
(AD) in older adults. [ 1 ]
Multi-infarct dementia (MID) is thought to be an irreversible form of dementia, and its onset is caused by a number of small strokes or sometimes, one large stroke preceded or followed by other smaller strokes. [ 2 ]
The term refers to a group of syndromes caused by different mechanisms all resulting in vascular lesions in the brain. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are important, as vascular dementia is at least partially preventable.
The main subtypes of this disease are:
mild cognitive impairment , multi-infarct dementia, vascular dementia due to a strategic single
infarct
(affecting the
thalamus , the
anterior cerebral artery , the
parietal lobes
or the
cingulate gyrus ), vascular dementia due to hemorrhagic lesions, and mixed Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.
Vascular lesions can be the result of diffuse
cerebrovascular disease
or focal lesions; usually both. Mixed dementia is diagnosed when patients have evidence of AD and cerebrovascular disease, either clinically or based on neuroimaging evidence of ischemic lesions. In fact vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease often coexist, especially in older patients with dementia.
Signs and symptoms
MID and AD, despite the fact that the two organic disorders have different causes, can be almost impossible to tell apart clinically and are often misdiagnosed. [ 3 ]
Patients suffering from vascular dementia present with cognitive impairment, acutely or subacutely, after an acute cerebrovascular event. After the onset a stepwise progression is typical.
In small vessel disease the incidence peaks between the 4th and the 7th decades of life and 80% will have a history of
hypertension . Patients develop progressive cognitive, motor and behavioral signs and symptoms. A significant proportion of them also develop
affective
symptoms. These changes occur over a period of 5Â10 years. If the frontal lobes are affected, which is often the case, patients may present as
apathetic
or
abulic . This is often accompanied by problems with attention, orientation and urinary incontinence.
As already stated, small vessel disease and focal lesions often overlap, so these two patterns may be evident in the same individual concurrently.
Rare genetic disorders which result in vascular lesions in the brain have other patterns of presentation. As a rule of thumb they tend to present earlier in life and have a more aggressive course.
Diagnosis
Several specific diagnostic criteria can be used to diagnose vascular dementia, [ 4 ]
including the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria, the
International Classification of Diseases , Tenth Edition (ICD-10) criteria, the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke - Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria, [ 5 ]
the Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Center criteria, and the Hachinski ischemic score. [ 6 ]
Lateralizing signs such as
hemiparesis ,
bradykinesia ,
hyperreflexia ,
extensor plantar reflexes ,
ataxia ,
pseudobulbar palsy , and
gait
and
swallowing difficulties
may be observed.
In terms of cognitive testing patients have patchy deficits. They tend to have better
free recall
and fewer recall intrusions compared with patients with Alzheimer's disease. As small vessel disease often affects the frontal lobes, apathy early in the disease is more suggestive of vascular dementia because it usually occurs in the later stages of Alzheimer's. Consequently patients with vascular dementia perform worse than their Alzheimer's disease counterparts in frontal lobe tasks such as verbal fluency. They also tend to exhibit more perseverative behavior. They may also present with general slowing of processing ability, difficulty shifting sets and impairment in abstract thinking. In the more severe patients, or those patients affected by strategic infarcts in the Wernicke or Broca areas,
dysarthrias ,
dysphasias
and
aphasias
may be present.
The recommended investigations for cognitive impairment should be carried out, including a dementia screening blood test, chest X-Ray,
CAT scan
and
ECG . The screening blood test should typically include
full blood count ,
liver function tests ,
thyroid function tests , lipid profile,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate ,
C reactive protein ,
syphilis
serology, calcium serum level, fasting glucose,
urea
and
electrolytes ,
vitamin B-12 ,
folate . In selected patients HIV serology and autoantibody testing may be done.
Cause
Risk factors for vascular dementia include
hypertension , smoking,
hypercholesterolemia ,
diabetes mellitus , and
cardiovascular disease
and
cerebrovascular disease .
Treatment
The aim of the management is the prevention of further cerebrovascular lesions. This includes administering antiplatelet drugs and controlling major vascular risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking and diabetes mellitus to mention a few).
The general management of dementia includes referral to community services, judgment and decision-making regarding legal and ethical issues (e.g., driving, capacity, advance directives), and consideration of caregiver stress.
Cholinesterase inhibitors
such as
galantamine
have shown to be helpful in various randomized controlled trials. However their use is not licensed yet for this indication.
Behavioral and affective symptoms are particularly important in this patient group and deserve special consideration. These problems, if they develop, tend to be resistant to conventional psychopharmacological treatment and in many cases lead to hospital admission and placement in permanent care.
Prognosis
The 5-year survival rate is 39% for patients with vascular dementia compared with 75% for age-matched controls. Vascular dementia is associated with a higher mortality than "Alzheimer's", presumably because of the excess in cardiovascular risk factors.
Epidemiology
Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia in the United States and Europe in the elderly, but it is the most common form in some parts of Asia. The
prevalence
of the illness is 1.5% in Western countries and approximately 2.2% in Japan. It accounts for 50% of all dementias in Japan, 20% to 40% in Europe and 15% in Latin America. The
incidence
of
dementia
is 9 times higher in patients who have had a stroke than in controls. 25% of stroke patients develop new-onset dementia within 1 year of their stroke. The
relative risk
of incident dementia is 5.5% within 4 years of suffering a stroke.
The prevalence of vascular dementia is higher in men than in women and it increases with age. Posterior Cortical Atrophy or Benson's Disease
What is posterior cortical atrophy?
What is PCA? (Audio version, Part 1)
Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a progressive degenerative condition involving the loss and dysfunction of brain cells particularly at the back (posterior) of the brain. In the vast majority of cases, this loss of brain cells is associated with the same pathological brain changes seen in typical AlzheimerÂs disease, namely amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In other words, posterior cortical atrophy is most usually considered to be an unusual or atypical variant of AlzheimerÂs disease.
Differences to typical AlzheimerÂs disease
Despite being caused by the same disease process, the effects of posterior cortical atrophy and typical AlzheimerÂs disease upon the behaviour, thought processes and skills of individuals with each condition are very different. Typical AlzheimerÂs disease is most commonly associated with deterioration in memory, language, perception and a host of other skills and abilities. By contrast, individuals with posterior cortical atrophy tend to have well preserved memory and language but instead show a progressive, dramatic and relatively selective decline in vision and/or literacy skills such as spelling, writing and arithmetic. The reason for this marked distinction between posterior cortical atrophy and typical AlzheimerÂs disease is that the distribution of the disease in the brain is different; in typical AlzheimerÂs disease, disease-related changes are evident across most brain areas, whereas in posterior cortical atrophy the changes are restricted to or focussed upon the rear of the brain and so initially only the skills which those brain areas normally support are affected.
Symptoms
The most common problem first noticed by individuals with posterior cortical atrophy is with vision. Quite understandably, this leads many people to consult their optician, but in fact the visual problems experienced are not related to the eye. Rather, the problems stem from the difficulty the affected brain has with interpreting the information sent to it by the healthy eyes. The precise nature of the visual problems experienced may vary widely but often include difficulty with some or all of the following:
recognising objects in pictures (for example household items in a catalogue, especially if the pictures were taken from obscure angles or the picture is incomplete)
recognising faces (for example TV characters, friends, relatives)
appreciating the spatial location of objects around them (for example missing when reaching out to pick something up, finding it hard to press the correct numbers on a telephone, not seeing something you are looking for when it is right in front of you)
judging distances (for example when driving, when descending stairs).
judging the speed of moving traffic
perceiving movement among things which are stationary
following the text when trying to read a book or newspaper, causing one to miss some lines of text or to read others twice
reading particular words, finding that letters appear to move around or become superimposed over one another
reading certain types of text (for example large print such as newspaper headlines, handwritten notes)
experiencing objects as having an unusual colour
experiencing increased sensitivity to bright light or shiny surfaces
seeing clearly, experiencing double vision
seeing clearly, feeling that one eyes are jerking around or not completely under oneÂs control.
However, vision is not the primary or only area of difficulty for everyone with posterior cortical atrophy. Skills such as literacy, numeracy, and the ability to make skilled movements may also be affected. Such difficulties may be experienced in the following ways:
problems recalling the exact spelling of words
difficulties with handwriting
difficulties with remembering the shape or name of particular letters or numbers
slowness and difficulty with mental arithmetic
problems dealing with money and small change
awkwardness making gestures (e.g. waving, thumbs up)
difficulties with using particular tools, kitchenware or implements (e.g. cutlery, scissors, glasses)
problems with dressing and clothing (partly related to difficulties with visual perception).
Posterior cortical atrophy can affect people in different ways initially. In some instances, the disease affects both sides of the brain equally, leading to a combination of many of the symptoms described above. For other people, the disease affects one particular brain area earlier or more significantly; as a result, problems with spelling and writing for example might be the first sign of the condition with vision relatively unaffected, whereas as for others, difficulties in seeing where objects are might be the initial symptom.
Getting a diagnosis
Posterior cortical atrophy tends to affect people at an earlier age than typical AlzheimerÂs disease, with individuals often being in their mid-fifties or early sixties at the time of their first symptoms. However, it can also affect older people. The first signs are often subtle symptoms which may be difficult for the person experiencing them to explain. Individuals with early visual complaints are typically referred to opticians and eye specialists before referral to a neurologist. However, as mentioned earlier, other selective problems with spelling, numeracy and learned motor skills have also been reported. Even once an appropriate referral has been made, it may take some time before the diagnosis is made formally. Understandably, patients may feel frustrated by the time of diagnosis, typically one to three years from the onset of symptoms.
The underlying cause of posterior cortical atrophy in the majority of cases is abnormal alterations to brain cells similar to what is seen under the microscope in AlzheimerÂs disease. However, a small number of other conditions can result in similar symptoms, at least initially. These include:
Dementia with Lewy bodies, where individuals may also experience visual hallucinations and may become stiff and slow down in their movements, in a similar manner to people with ParkinsonÂs disease.
Corticobasal degeneration, where individuals may have difficulty using one side of their body. Sometimes they have difficulty controlling the movement of one arm, which seems to move on its own as if it had a Âmind of its ownÂ..
Prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, very rare conditions in which individuals may rapidly decline in their cognition and develop other problems such as jerking movements of their limbs (myoclonus), stiffness, loss of balance control, and develop seizures.
Tests
There is no diagnostic test for posterior cortical atrophy. However, tests such as specialised visual tests (organised by eye-specialists), neuropsychological tests of cognitive skills (for example memory, perception, literacy), blood tests, brain scans (magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) or computerised tomography (CT)), lumbar puncture (examination of the fluid circulating around the brain and spinal cord) and EEG (recording of the electrical activities of the brain) may help to exclude potentially treatable causes such as infection, inflammation or brain tumours. The shrinkage of the back part of the brain as a result of brain cell loss may be visible on the brain scan. It may be difficult to come up with one diagnosis in life and a definitive diagnosis can only be made once the brain tissue is examined by the pathologist. Posterior cortical atrophy is a rare condition but its exact prevalence in the normal population is currently unknown.
Later stages of the disease
What is PCA? (Audio version, Part 2)
As the disease progresses, word finding, day-to-day memory and general cognitive functions may become affected. In the later stages of the disease, people with posterior cortical atrophy may develop jerking movements of their limbs and occasionally seizures. Unfortunately as with typical AlzheimerÂs disease, the condition is progressive with a gradual deterioration of skills and abilities over the years following diagnosis. The duration of the posterior cortical atrophy condition is poorly understood, with some people living approximately the same length of time as individuals with typical AlzheimerÂs disease (on average 10-12 years following the onset of symptoms) and others living with the condition for longer.
Treatment
Although there is no medication available to treat posterior cortical atrophy specifically, patients may find some of the medications available to treat patients with typical AlzheimerÂs disease helpful. The medications are called acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors and include donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Reminyl). However, these medications are only designed to treat the symptoms of the disease and are not a cure (see Factsheet 407, Drug treatments for AlzheimerÂs disease).
Although individuals with posterior cortical atrophy often show relatively preserved insight, they are frequently very disabled by the decline in their ability to interact successfully with the visual world around them. In particular, the cognitive problems associated with the condition often lead to a loss of independence, cause activities of daily living to be compromised, and inhibit the enjoyment of previous hobbies, especially reading. Such problems can lead to depression, irritability, frustration and a loss of self-confidence. Individuals with posterior cortical atrophy who are experiencing low mood may benefit from a trial of antidepressant medication.
Supporting people with posterior cortical atrophy
There are a number of similarities between the support that may be offered to individuals with posterior cortical atrophy and people with other forms of dementia, especially typical AlzheimerÂs disease. These include the distribution of information about available financial benefits (e.g. Disability Living Allowance) and financial provisions (e.g. Lasting Power of Attorney).
There is a range of practical visual aids designed to assist individuals with different types of visual impairment which may be of use to people with posterior cortical atrophy. These include devices such as talking clocks and watches, mobile telephones with simplified displays or pre-programmable direct-dial buttons, and cooking aids such as sensors which beep when a cup is nearly full.
There is also an increasingly wide range of talking books and audio recordings available either on CD or downloadable from the internet, with a range of titles from romantic novels to biographies and technical manuals. Audio guides are also available for many cultural events including the theatre and museums.

Dementia with Lewy bodies
(DLB), also known under a variety of other names including
Lewy body dementia ,
diffuse Lewy body disease ,
cortical Lewy body disease , and
senile dementia of Lewy type , is a type of
dementia
closely allied to both
Alzheimers
and
Parkinson's Diseases . It is characterized anatomically by the presence of
Lewy bodies , clumps of
alpha-synuclein
and
ubiquitin
protein in
neurons , detectable in post-mortem brain biopsies. [ 1 ]
Lewy Body dementia affects 1.3 million individuals in the United States alone.
Classification
Dementia with Lewy bodies overlaps clinically with
Alzheimer's disease
and
Parkinson's disease , but is more associated with the latter. [ 1 ]
With DLB, the loss of cholinergic ( acetylcholine -producing)
neurons
is thought to account for the degradation of cognitive functioning, as in Alzheimer's disease; while the loss of dopaminergic ( dopamine -producing) neurons is thought to account for the degradation of motor control, as in Parkinson's disease. Thus, DLB is similar in some ways to both the dementia resulting from Alzheimer's disease and the movement problems of Parkinson's disease. The overlap of neuropathologies and presenting symptoms (cognitive, emotional, and motor) can make an accurate differential diagnosis difficult. In fact, it is often confused in its early stages with Alzheimer's disease and/or vascular dementia ( multi-infarct dementia ) although, where AlzheimerÂs disease usually begins quite gradually, DLB often has a rapid or acute onset, with especially rapid decline in the first few months. DLB tends to progress more quickly than AlzheimerÂs disease. [ 2 ]
Despite the difficulty, a prompt diagnosis of DLB is important because of the risks of sensitivity to
neuroleptic
drugs and because appropriate treatment of symptoms can improve life for both the person with DLB and their caregivers. [ 2 ]
DLB is distinguished from the dementia that sometimes occurs in Parkinson's Disease by the time frame in which dementia symptoms appear relative to Parkinson symptoms. [ 3 ]
Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) would be the diagnosis when dementia onset is more than 1 year after the onset of Parkinson's. DLB is diagnosed when cognitive symptoms begin at the same time or within a year of Parkinson symptoms.
Signs and symptoms
While the specific symptoms in a person with DLB will vary, core features of DLB are: 1) fluctuating cognition with great variations in attention and alertness from day to day and hour to hour 2) recurrent visual
hallucinations
(observed in 75% of people with DLB), and 3) motor features of Parkinson's. Suggestive symptoms are
rapid eye movement(REM)-sleep behavior disorder
and abnormalities detected in
PET
or
SPECT scans . [ 4 ]
Parkinson's features could include shuffling gait, reduced arm-swing during walking, blank expression (reduced range of facial expression), stiffness of movements, ratchet-like
cogwheeling
movements; low speech volume,
sialorrhea
and difficulty swallowing. Tremors are less common in DLB than in Parkinson's disease. [ 5 ]
DLB patients also often experience problems with
orthostasis , including repeated falls,
syncope
(fainting), and transient loss of consciousness.
One of the most critical and distinctive clinical features is hypersensitivity to
neuroleptic
and
antiemetic
medications that affect dopaminergic and cholinergic systems. [ 6 ]
In the worst cases, a patient treated with these drugs could become catatonic, lose cognitive function and/or develop life-threatening muscle rigidity. Some commonly used drugs which should be used with great caution, if at all, for people with DLB are
chlorpromazine ,
haloperidol , or
thioridazine . [ 2 ]
Visual hallucinations in people with DLB most commonly involve perception of people or animals that aren't there. Delusions may include
reduplicative paramnesia
and other elaborate misperceptions or misinterpretations. [ 7 ]
These hallucinations are not necessarily disturbing and in some cases, the person with DLB may have insight into the hallucinations and even be amused by them or conscious that they are not really there. People with DLB may also have problems with vision, including double vision [ 2 ]
and misinterpretation of what they see, for example, mistaking a pile of socks for snakes or a clothes closet for the bathroom. [ 7 ]
Causes
The causes are not yet well understood, but a genetic link with the
PARK11
gene has been described. [ 8 ]
As with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, most cases of DLB appear sporadically and DLB is not thought to be a strongly hereditary disease. [ 6 ]
As with Alzheimer's Disease, DLB risk is heightened with inheritance of the Îµ4
allele
of the
apolipoprotein E
(APOE). [ 9 ]
Pathophysiology
Pathologically, DLB is characterized by the development of abnormal proteinaceous ( alpha-synuclein ) cytoplasmic inclusions, called
Lewy bodies , throughout the brain. These inclusions have similar structural features to "classical" Lewy bodies seen subcortically in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, there is a loss of
dopamine -producing neurons (in the
substantia nigra ) similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease, and a loss of
acetylcholine -producing neurons (in the
basal nucleus of Meynert
and elsewhere) similar to that seen in Alzheimer's disease. Cerebral atrophy (or shrinkage) also occurs as the
cerebral cortex
degenerates. Autopsy series have revealed that the pathology of DLB is often concomitant with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. That is, when Lewy body inclusions are found in the cortex, they often co-occur with Alzheimer's disease pathology found primarily in the
hippocampus , including: senile plaques (deposited beta amyloid protein) and granulovacuolar degeneration (grainy deposits within, and a clear zone around hippocampal neurons).
Neurofibrillary tangles
(abnormally phosphorylated
tau protein ) are less common in DLB, although they are known to occur., It is presently not clear whether DLB is an Alzheimer's variant or a separate disease entity.
Depression
Overview
In general, the elderly are in good mental
health.
However, due to major milestones that people face on their voyage through the drama of life, and the subtle change in brain chemistry that aging produces, people over 65 are the most susceptible to clinical depression. Clinical, or major depression, is the "very low mood" that does not gradually respond to everyday distractions, and decreases functioning enough to require treatment. In comparison, the "reactive depression" that many people experience lasts a short time, is related to a particular stressful situation and disappears when coping skills are re-activated.
Age Related Physical Changes The aging brain produces less of the main chemicals, called neurotransmitters, that help to create positive moods and give people the mental boost to participate in the activities of life. After many years, this balancing act becomes difficult, but it still can be maintained. There also may be chronic conditions such as pain, or deteriorating conditions such as osteoporosis or cirrhosis of the liver.
Age Related Social Changes
The social changes that affect an aging individual's mood and perception of the world are varied, and for the most part, universal. The death of a spouse, loss of a long-loved home, loss of siblings, as well as failing health contribute to the stress of living a long life. Retirement and financial concerns may overwhelm those who have not planned ahead for this supposed "Golden Age."
Warning Signs of Depression in the Elderly
A behavior pattern often found among the elderly is called the "depletion syndrome," according to
"Adult Development and Aging." It is described as a feeling that "everything requires too much effort." The first signs of depression may include lack of motivation, sleeping too much or too little, and appetite problems that can lead to malnutrition or weight gain. The elderly person may show changes in ability to concentrate or focus attention. Crying or tearfulness may be related to feelings of worthlessness and there may be recurrent thoughts of death,.according to the American Psychiatric Association. Isolation is common, since other people are often too challenging, too helpful, or just plain annoying to the sufferer.
Misconceptions About Aging and Depression
Younger people may think it is normal for old people to be depressed. This attitude can "infect" the older person's view of what is normal. Older people may not recognize the symptoms of depression at all. They may think it is a mild medical illness and will go away by itself. There is also shame and guilt about needing help for things they think that they can, and should, handle themselves. Medical conditions often wrap themselves around and through an older person's life, and it is difficult to distinguish physical from depressive complaints. Since depression causes all sorts of physical pain as well as mental anguish, it is important for physicians to assess patients properly.
Treatment of Depression in the Elderly
People over age 65 have the highest rates of clinical depressive symptoms, and yet the highest rate of diagnosis of depression goes to those 25-65. Depressed people often refuse to participate in research, so most statistics show significantly lower levels of the incidence of elder depression, and under-treatment of the symptoms. Treatment of depression in the elderly usually takes the form of medication. The newer anti-depressants block the recycling of neurotransmitters such as serotonin so that the person has enough for "normal" moods. Anti-anxiety medication may also be prescribed in order to limit the experience of shakiness or racing thoughts, as well as insomnia. If an older individual can be persuaded to seek the help of a therapist, the combination of increasing coping skills through behavior change and re-assessment of "depressing" situations, the benefits are greater than with drugs alone, according to the American Psychiatric Association.
Untreated Depression in the Elderly
There is a significantly higher risk of suicide in the elderly when compared with younger adults. Although the number of reported suicides has decreased over the past few years, knowledge of real numbers is still faulty The reasons for avoiding a report of suicide are numerous, and may include protecting others from self-blame, financial or religious reasons. Until social stigma, fear of the falsely believed "incurable" nature of depression, and the undeniable confusion engendered by trying to separate brain and body, the elderly will continue to be undiagnosed, misdiagnosed and under-treated for the painful symptoms and causes of depression.(Secouler, 1999: See Reference)

Delerium
Delerium presents as what we call psychotic symptoms and can feature in all 3 D's, for this reason psychosis in itself is not a diagnosis, merely a description of symptoms most commonly associated in retirement age illness in the 3 D's.
Delirium
An estimated 10% to 30% of all confusion is reversible (Richardson, 2003). Delirium occurs in 6% to 30% of the general hospital population, 7% to 52% of postsurgical patients, and up to 16% of all elderly. Twenty percent of delirious patients suffer from dementia, suggesting that hospitalizations exacerbate the symptoms of mild dementia (Wright, 2000). Delirium, also known as
acute confusion , has been defined as an acute, potentially reversible change in behavior characterized by a clouding of consciousness, mental incoherence, and difficulty maintaining concentration and attention. It represents acute failure in response to underlying medical or mental illness and requires immediate diagnosis and treatment (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000).
Delirium is not actually a disease but a syndrome resulting from a variety of causes. One defining characteristic of delirium is the presence of an underlying cause resulting in confusion. Delirium is a transient state that manifests itself as an acute impairment in cognition and attention with concomitant alterations in the sleep-wake cycle and psychomotor behavior. The behavioral manifestations vary and can include disorientation to time, person, and place; disorganized thinking; decreased alertness; agitation; hallucinations; delusions; or emotional lability. Mental status fluctuations occur frequently and may be accompanied by possible lucid periods. Not all patients exhibit behavioral manifestations. Lyness (1990) noted that many older patients may experience a "quiet delirium" where atypical behaviors may include withdrawal or classic symptoms but to a lesser degree.
Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness accompanied by change in cognition that cannot be accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia (APA, 2000). It is an acute confusion that represents brain failure in response to underlying medical or mental illnesses. The causes of delirium are as varied as the individuals themselves. Common causes include the exacerbation of preexisting disease, drug toxicity or interactions, and infections with accompanying sepsis. Some medications commonly prescribed for the older adult may cause cognitive impairment. These include amitriptyline, lithium, thioridazine, propranolol, metoprolol, and atenolol. In addition, anticholinergic agents, antipsychotic agents, antidepressants, digoxin, [H.sub.2]-blocking agents, and antihypertensive agents are also common causes of delirium (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS], 1997). A more complete list is located in Table 1.
Nearly any condition that results in the disruption of metabolic or structural integrity can lead to delirium. Disruption in the delivery of oxygen (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), nutrients (hypoglycemia), failed removal or inactivation of endogenous toxins (high ammonia from hepatic failure) or exogenous toxins (alcohol intoxication and poisoning), and lesions resulting from tumors all are implicated in the development of delirium (Marcantonio, 2000).
Delirium and dementia can sometimes be difficult to differentiate clinically. Although delirium, like dementia, is marked by disturbances in cognition, it can be distinguished from dementia by disruptions of consciousness and attention, its clinical course, the development of clinical features over a short period of time (usually hours to days), and significant fluctuations in the degree of cognitive impairment over the course of a day.
Acute confusion or delirium carries serious consequences. Individuals experiencing delirium are more likely to experience falls and iatrogenic sequelae, and require chemical or physical restraints (McNicoll et al., 2003). Cacchione (2000) noted a 3-month mortality rate of 34% for the acutely confused.
The single most important principle in managing delirium is to diagnose and treat the cause. Suspicious medications should be eliminated, infection treated, and electrolyte imbalances corrected. Often the cause is multifactorial. The delirious older adult should be reassured, reoriented, and shielded from unnecessary stimuli. Reassuring the family that the delirium is reversible in most cases will ease the fears as the family copes with the acute confusional phase.
Psychosis
Psychosis
(from the
Greek
ÏÏÏÎ® "psyche", for mind/soul, and -ÏÏÎ¹Ï "-osis", for abnormal condition) means abnormal condition of the mind, and is a generic
psychiatric
term for a mental state often described as involving a "loss of contact with
reality ". People suffering from psychosis are described as
psychotic.
Psychosis is given to the more severe forms of psychiatric disorder, during which
hallucinations
and
delusions
and impaired
insight
may occur. [ 1 ]
Some professionals say that the term psychosis is not sufficient as some illnesses grouped under the term "psychosis" have nothing in common (Gelder, Mayou & Geddes 2005).
People experiencing psychosis may report
hallucinations
or
delusional
beliefs, and may exhibit personality changes and
thought disorder . Depending on its severity, this may be accompanied by unusual or bizarre behavior, as well as difficulty with social interaction and impairment in carrying out daily life activities.
Let us start by stating that many psychotic events are treatable and have differing root causes. The most common in people of retirement age is an infection, for example a urine or chest infection or constipation, it is of paramount importance to rule out any physical impairment before worrying over permanent episodes of ongoing treatment of a psychotic disorder e.g. schizophrenia.
Here is a link to a slide show by Prof Alistair Burns, summarising in some detail differing psychotic episodes, assessment criteria and treatment options.
