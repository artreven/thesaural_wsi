When former Transmuto websites Transbuddha and
RazorFine Review
went silent in the Spring of 2010 the Internet found a new home for awesome. You can now find more regular crazed awesomeness at
dadsbigplan , and more current and past reviews at
RazorFine
(which is slowly being rebuilt). Or, if you're in the mood, you can find a little extra random Xplosion of Awesome from the mind of a rabbit super-hero here on a semi-irregular basis.

The Flash #6
With the
Mob Rule
story finished
the Flash
turns his attention to
Captain Cold
who escaped prison during the blackout. An unintended side-effect of the blackout, which everyone mistakenly believes the Flash caused, is it left Cold's sister slowly wasting away in the hospital who no longer have the power to operated the laser necessary to perform the brain surgery to save her. The comic does a good job re-introducing the character of Captain Cold. I'm not sure I like that he's now a guy with cold powers, rather than his old freeze gun, but writer
Francis Manapul
does through longtime DC readers a bone by allowing the Flash to mention how the villain has changed. Aside from Flash's battle with Cold, and the reason for the villain's new motivations, we also get Barry siting down as an awkward go between between
Patty
and
Iris , and a continuation of the seed planted in last month's issue about the hero's need to watch his speed because there's a chance it could rip apart time and reality. We even get a
giant treadmill . Sweet! Best of the week. [DC, $2.99]
