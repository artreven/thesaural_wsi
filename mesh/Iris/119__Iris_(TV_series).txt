The most refreshing about this story is its portrayal of how little things can cause problems in the relationships and how their increasing
frequency if they not to solve the problem which can lead to break up. The mystery of love is also
shown as Cherie and Jimmy despite their incompatibility cannot let go of
each other. Their interactions with each other and their friends are the main
source of laughs with ample amounts of swearing. There are also additional
laughs for those who are familiar with Hong Kong and mainland actors
like Ekin Cheng or Huang Xiao-ming.

THE KOREAN FILM_4
The Korean Movie- The King and the Clown
The King and the Clown
( Korean :
왕의
남자 ;
Wang-ui Namja ) is a
2005
South Korean
film, adapted from the 2000 Korean play titled
Yi
("You") about
Yeonsangun of Joseon , a
Joseon dynasty
king who falls in love with a court clown who mocks him. The movie is based on a small passage from the
Annals of the Joseon Dynasty
that briefly mentions the king's favorite clown. Production costs were relatively modest for a Korean film, approximately $4.5 million dollars. With box office receipts of $85 million, it was the highest-grossing Korean film from 2005.
The movie is referred to by various names. It is sometimes known as
The King's Men
or
The King's Man
(the literal translation of the Korean title to English) and
All the King's Men
(working title). In Chinese, the title is " 王的男人 " or " 王和小丑 ", and in Japanese, it is known as " 王の男 ". It is also known as "The Royal Jester" in English, as the movie's English translator found it more fitting than the original title. This film was chosen by Korea as its submission for the Oscars in the best foreign film category.

I watched it, when I was high school during class. I was laugh so much but I was cried either because I thought this movie is consisted very well. Especially, the movie sound track is very famous as it.

THE KOREAN FILM_2
The Korean Movie-
Shiri
(film)
Shiri
( Hangul :
쉬리 ;
Swiri ) is a
1999
South Korean
action film , written and directed by
Kang Je-gyu .
Shiri
was the first
Hollywood -style big-budget
blockbuster
to be produced in the "new" Korean film industry (i.e. after Korea's major economic boom in late 1990s). Created as a deliberate homage to the "high-octane" action film made popular by Hollywood through 1980s, it also contained a story that draws on strong Korean national sentiment to fuel its drama. [1]
Much of the film's visual style shares that of the
Asian
action cinema, and particularly Hong Kong action cinema, of
John Woo ,
Tsui Hark ,
Ringo Lam , and the relentless pace of the second unit directors, like
Vic Armstrong
and
Guy Hamilton , in the
James Bond
films.
The movie was released under the name
Shiri
outside of
South Korea ; inside Korea, the title was spelled
Swiri . The name refers to
Coreoleuciscus splendidus , a fish found in Korean fresh-water streams. At one point Park has a monologue wherein he describes how the waters from both North and South Korea flow freely together, and how the fish can be found in either water without knowing which it belongs to. This ties into the film's ambitions to be the first major-release film to directly address the still-thorny issue of
Korean reunification . The film would later serve as the basis for the successful drama series
Iris , starring
Lee Byung-hun
and
Kim Tae-hee .
Reference:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiri_(film)
I watched this movie, when I was 9 years old. I did not understood some part of movie scenes because I was so young but it was really impressed to me because the movie is consisted of the North and South Korean story and love. I remember the main actor scene which he agonizes between his nation and his girl but he chooses his nation and kills his girl. I thought the part was made good and was impressively.

I have watched this movie when I was 14 years old. I was cried so much during watching movie because this movie is based on Korean sad history. Before I watched it, I have prejudged about the both main actors playing but they act very well their parts on movie. Thus this movie is very excellent.

FILM FESTIVAL_3
The Venice International Film Festival
The
Venice International Film Festival
is the oldest international film festival in the world. Founded by Count Giuseppe Volpi in 1932 ,
the festival has since taken place every year in late August or early September on the island of the Lido, Venice, Italy.It is known world-wide for the International Film Festival, the International Art Exhibition and the International Architecture Exhibition, and continues the great tradition of the Festival of Contemporary Music, the Theatre Festival, now flanked by the Festival of Contemporary Dance.
It is clear to see that the Venice International Film Festival is the most creative, enriching,  contemporary festival which consists of diverse music, dance and art exhibitions. This typical film festival awards the best film on screen in competition with ‘Leone d’Oro’ (Golden Lion) and the ‘Leone d’Argento ’ (Silver Lion) given to the best director.
In observing the top 3 famous international film festivals worldwide, I was able to identify the fact that different film festivals have their own sense of uniqueness in referring the name of awards, their way of presenting the film festival in creativity and variety. It was interesting for me to see how these top 3 film festivals are widely known and are held annually for its recognition and reputation.
