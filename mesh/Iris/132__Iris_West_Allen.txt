When former Transmuto websites Transbuddha and
RazorFine Review
went silent in the Spring of 2010 the Internet found a new home for awesome. You can now find more regular crazed awesomeness at
dadsbigplan , and more current and past reviews at
RazorFine
(which is slowly being rebuilt). Or, if you're in the mood, you can find a little extra random Xplosion of Awesome from the mind of a rabbit super-hero here on a semi-irregular basis.

The Flash #8
Following the events of the last issue
the Flash
finds himself in the void of the
Speed Force . Unable to find
Iris
or the other people plucked out of time, the Flash's only companion is
Turbine , an insane WWII pilot who has been trapped in the void for 70 years. Although the idea of Turbine is an intriguing one, how writers
Francis Manapul
and
Brian Buccellato
play out the tale leaves something to be desired. We do get an explanation for the time rifts and how the Flash is connected to the Speed Force. However, everything feels rushed and not quite as well thought-out as I'd like. It doesn't quite stumble, but this is definitely the weakest issue of the title so far. That doesn't mean the comic doesn't have its bright spots. Manapul's art is again terrific, and even if the ideas aren't as well fleshed-out as I'd like they do open the doors for further discovery down the line. I'm less pleased with the new
Grodd
and
New 52
version of
Gorilla City
both of which were going to get plenty of in next month's issue. Worth a look. [DC, $2.99]

Fairly Legal - Teenage Wasteland
Kate ( Sarah Shahi ) is called in by an old friend ( Laura Regan ) to mediate a dispute between a student ( Jonna Walsh ) expelled over cheating and her former high school. Lauren ( Virginia Williams ), getting the scent of old money, decides to tag along in hopes of signing the school as a long-term client but things get complicated when Kate sides with the girl and her working class father ( Eric Keenleyside ) over the institution and uncovers a far more scandalous reason why the young girl is actually being expelled.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Micro Series #4
In much the same way Marvel's ".1" comics have futhered filled in stories and focused on aspects not covered in the main title, IDW's "Micro Series" has done the same for their current
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
series. Each issue of the series has centered around one of the Turtles. With issue four we finally get to the team's leader, and my favorite TMNT,
Leonardo . This issue picks up where the current series has left off with
Splinter
captured by
Old Hob . While out on patrol alone, Leonardo finds himself ambushed by an entire army of
Foot Ninjas
at an abandoned construction site.
You definitely get your money's worth in terms of action as almost the entire comic showcases Leo's fight with the ninja and their mysterious leader (who may, or may not be the Shredder). In terms of writing and art I don't think it measures up to the the main title. However, if you have a favorite Ninja Turtle, this series has given you a chance to grab a comic centered solely around them. That's not too shabby, even if it is slightly overpriced. Worth a look.

Person of Interest – Matsya Nyaya
Memories of Reese's ( Jim Caviezel ) final mission for the CIA in China with Snow ( Michael Kelly ) and Stanton ( Annie Parisse ) continue to haunt him as he goes undercover working for an armored car service while attempting to protect the Machine's latest number, an armored car guard ( Pablo Schreiber ) on a route that's been targeted by robbers. After his latest case takes an unexpected turn, Reese's thoughts turn back to his days in China where he was tasked by Snow to retrieve a computer virus and kill his partner only to find they've both been sent into a trap to make sure neither makes it out alive.

What If… Bruce Timm Designed the New 52?
I think we can all agree
DC Comics New 52
has been a mixed success, at best. There are several reasons for this including the choice of characters and titles not included in the reboot, the vast difference in how much of each character's history was rebooted compared to others, and odd yearning to recapture the style and gritty feel of the 1990's. No one is more responsible (or more to blame, depending on your perspective) than artist
Jim Lee . Lee's redesign of each member of the Justice League set the standard for the style of the New 52. But what if DC had decided to go in a different direction? What if, instead of Lee's 90's-inspired grittiness, DC had decided to allow
Bruce Timm
(the man largely responsible for the look of DC Animation for the better part of two decades) to redesign the DCU? Here's what that much more vibrant, joyous, sultry, and kick-ass DCU might have looked like. I give you Bruce Timm's New 32.

Moon Knight #12
When comic nerds talk about B-list and C-list heroes it's characters like
Moon Knight
we're often referring. Sure, sometimes they make a splash and end up on one of the big teams (although usually it's the modest Secret or West-Coast version), but more often than not they find themselves without a book of their one, floating near the fringe of the bigger comic universe. With this twelve-issue run, which ends all too soon,
Brian Michael Bendis
not only gave us fun stories month after month, he reminded us Moon Knight is a pretty good hero. Whacked out of his mind, sure, but also a pretty good hero. The final issue of the series deals with Moon Knight's final confrontation with
Count Nefaria
(who still can't believe he was taken down by Moon Knight), an appearance by the
Avengers
(the real ones, not just those in the hero's head), and a rather casual conversation with
Tony Stark
about the impending Robot Holocaust. In other words, classic Bendis' Moon Knight. Worth a look - in fact pick up the whole series in trade paperback. You'll be glad you did. [Marvel, $3.99]

Captain Atom #8
Captain Atom
finds himself pulled into the timestream with
alternate versions of himself , including a future version who warns of the impending end of the world. Unable to change their past, without possibly ending their own existence, the other versions must instead help Captain Atom alter his future in order to save the world. Once again writer J. T. Krul gives us big ideas brought marvelously to life by Freddie E. Williams II' art. Captain Atom's tour of the future leads him to old friends and new enemies including a look forward at what his attempt to help Ranita may lead to quite a few unforeseen consequences. Far on the outside of the DCU, and with a focus far from your usual super-heroics, Captain Atom is a title you need to be reading. However, it's by far one of the most ambitious projects of the
New 52 , and continues to be one of it's most pleasant surprises. Worth a look. [DC, $2.99]

Justice League #8
The latest issue of
Justice League
is basically one long joke as
Green Arrow
keeps showing up to help the
Justice League
and keeps getting turned down when he asks to join. It gets old pretty quick. However, what's more infuriating is the real reason so many of the leaguers are against adding another member to the team is relegated to a single splash page that isn't even explained. In the back-up story, "The Curse of Shazam Part 2,"
Billy Batson
meets his new foster family which includes a bossy
Mary
and (for some odd reason) a blond
Freddy Freeman . As we got last issue the main point of the story is for Billy to act like a little prick and be put in his place by those who know better. Yeah, he's got hero written all over him. The main story has some nice one-liners from
Batman
and
Green Lantern , and an intriguing offer by Steve Trevor for Ollie, but it's pretty forgettable. The only saving grace in the Shazam story is the introduction of Mary's pet rabbit and slightest glimmer of hope that someday we just might see
Hoppy the Marvel Bunny . Hit-and-Miss. [DC, $3.99]

Nightwing #8
" Night of the Owls " continues as
Nightwing
receives
Alfred 's call for help and sets out to save the Mayor from a
Talon
attack. Issue #8 is a little different from what we've seen of the title so far as most of the issue isn't presented from Nightwing's perspective, but from that of a character who will only appear on the final page. Most of the issue is narrated flashback of William Cobb, retelling his life story including his early days with
Haly's Circus
and his recruitment into the
Court of Owls . Nightwing is able to save the Mayor by defeating one of the Talons, but
our final panel
gives the arrival of another, far more deadly Talon (Cobb, who arrives to kill his descendant). For an issue where Dick Grayson's voice is largely absent the story still works, although I'm not sure we needed this much of Cobb's backstory. I'm more surprised, however, by the continued level of smart aleck banter from the zombie-ish Talons. Who knew the undead were so talkative? Worth a look. [DC, $2.99]

Bones - The Warrior in the Wuss
While investigating the remains of a trucker found in the woods Booth ( David Boreanaz ) is distracted by the return of his son Parker ( Ty Panitz ) from his extended stay in Europe with his mother. Although at first unconcerned, a little snooping by Bones ( Emily Deschanel ) discovers evidence of Parker's jealousy of his younger sister and his father's new family.

Avengers vs. X-Men #2
For an entire issue that only covers a handful of minutes this one's full of action. Picking up right where
issue #1
left off the Avengers invade Utopia and throw down with the X-Men as
Captain America
tries to talk some sense into
Cyclops
before
the Phoenix Force
arrives from deep space. There are quite a few interesting match-ups as we get Cap vs. Cyclops,
Iron Man
vs.
Magneto
(which isn't as over as fast as you might assume),
Colossus
vs.
Red Hulk ,
Storm
vs. the
Black Panther , and
Wolverine
sneaking into Utopia through the sewers to assassinate a teenage girl... you know, for the good of humanity. But it's bad news for the Avengers as it seems Cyclops has bought
Hope
enough time as the
Phoenix has indeed started to rise . The fallout of this issue, in two weeks, should be very interesting. Worth a look. [Marvel, $3.99]

In Plain Sight - The Medal of Mary
The unexpected return of James Wiley Shannon ( Stephen Lang ), Mary's ( Mary McCormack ) father, brings all kinds of new trouble Mary's way including the return of Agent O'Conner ( Will McCormack ) who needs Mary's help to get her father to testify against his old boss Cormac "Sully" Sullivan ( Steve Eastin ) which might put Jinx ( Lesley Ann Warren ) and Brandi ( Nichole Hiltz ), as well as Mary's half-brother ( Aaron Ashmore ), in danger.

Batman #8
DC's new Bat-Family summer crossover begins here. The
Court of Owls
story explodes into other Bat-titles as " Night of the Owls " finds several
Talons
sent to assassinate Gotham's most prestigious citizens - including
Bruce Wayne . With Batman busy
fending off the killers
sent after his alter-ego,
Alfred
sends out a distress call to all members of the Bat-Family ( Nightwing ,
Red Robin , the
Red Hood ,
Batgirl , the
Birds of Prey ) with a list of the Court of Owls' targets. Although I've been lukewarm on
Scott Snyder 's Court of Owls stories the past few months, now with the Talons unleashed on the city and several more Bat-folk looking to show up in the coming months, things certainly seem to have picked up in a hurry. The structure of the book is a little odd as the first half is written by Snyder with art by regular
Greg Capullo . However, the second-half of the story, drawn by
Rafael Albuquerque , has a completely different look (which still works, although not quite as well). Worth a look.

Super Dinosaur #10
With
Derek
busy trying to learn something from the mysterious Exile,
Super Dinosaur
returns to the volcano searching for signs of the Dino-Men, only to walkin into the middle of an ambush. To make matters worse he's got Erin along with him who decided to tag along not grasping just how dangerous SD's missions truly are. Meanwhile
Dr. Dyanmo
turns
Max Maximus
back over to his people in order to be reunited with his wife Julianna, but that leaves the doctor and his newly rediscovered wife at the hands of his greatest enemy. Things are even bleaker for SD, whose knockout leaves Erin completely unprotected, and Derek is shocked to learn just how powerful the Exile is as he takes control Earthcore Headquarters from his prison cell. Robert Kirkman and Jason Howard deliver another fun issue which gives us some dinosaur-on-dinosaur action, multiple cliffhangers, and several possibilities for next month's issue. Worth a look.

Batgirl Teaches Batman a Lesson about Equal Pay
Was Batgirl the first Booster Gold? In the 60′s I guess it was appropriate to expect to get paid for saving lives and even lecture those in mortal danger about equal pay before attempting to, you know, save them from an explosion.

Red Hood and the Outlaws #8
The
Red Hood
returns to Gotham along with
Starfire
and
Arsenal
in an issue that gives us the backstory of
Suzie Su
and begins to weave Jason Todd back into the Bat-Family (at least for the foreseeable future). The Outlaws show up Gotham to take down Su who is holding the residents of the Children's Ward at Gotham General Hospital hostage in order to draw out the Red Hood and take revenge for the murder of her entire clan. The Suzie Su story works well enough, but the issue is memorable for two other reasons. The first the Red Hood responding to
Alfred 's message for help with the
Court of Owls
unleashing their assassins across Gotham. The choice of the
man
Red Hood is supposed to save should make for a fun next issue. And the second is a small scene between Todd and
Tim Drake
that suggests the pair have an interesting relationship that may not be sanctioned, or known about, by the Dark Knight Detective. Worth a look. [DC, $2.99]

The Cabin in the Woods
Despite languishing in obscurity for three years (the film was completed back in 2009)
Joss Whedon
and
Drew Goddard
collaborative effort is a stunning success. Co-written by the pair, and directed by Goddard,
The Cabin in the Woods
pokes fun at horror movie convention before providing one of the most memorable final acts you'll see in theaters this year. The perspective of the film is broken into two groups. On one hand we have a quintet of college kids (played by Hollywood actors in their late 20's and early 30's:
Kristen Connolly ,  Chris Hemsworth ,  Anna Hutchison ,  Jesse Williams ,
Fran Kranz ) out for some weekend fun in the mountains. On the other hand we have a group of scientists ( Bradley Whitford ,  Richard Jenkins ,  Amy Acker ) preparing for the most important night of the year. Without giving two much away, the two stories are linked. Those in the secret compound are controlling the horrors that will unfold on the unsuspecting group of students whose every choice will lead to how they will meet their end.

The Shadow #1
Dynamite Entertainment brings another old-timey public domain hero back into the spotlight with
The Shadow
written by
Garth Ennis
with art by
Aaron Campbell . As first issues go it's certainly not going to knock your socks off. The character of
The Shadow
has been around since his first radio show back in 1930. Set in the early days of WWII, the comic does a fair job of reintroducing Lamont Cranston and Margo Lane to both old and new readers alike. Ennis wouldn't be my first choice to write this character and so far I'm less than impressed with Campbell's art. The comic certainly takes the character back to his darker roots (fans of the
Alec Baldwin version
might be surprised by the body count in the first issue).
At best the first issue of
The Shadow
is a mixed success with a great cover by
Alex Ross . Is that enough to keep me reading the title? Maybe, but much like Dynamite's
Green Hornet
titles it's going to have to get better for me to plop down $4 each month. Hit-and-Miss. [Dynamite Entertainment, $3.99]

Beware the Batman teaser
Premiering next year on Cartoon Network, here's a tease at
Beware the Batman
which it appears will look more like the CGI-heavy
Green Lantern: The Animated Series
than the initial artwork suggested. The cartoon will focus on "a classic-looking Batman (sans classic yellow oval Bat-logo) teaming up with a gun-toting Alfred Pennyworth and a female ninja sidekick" named Katana.

Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close
Based on the novel by
Jonathan Safran Foer
Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
follows the search of nine year-old with Asberger's Syndrome who finds a key in his father's ( Tom Hanks ) possessions and embarks on the kind of adventure his father used to create for him before his death on 9/11. Oskar Schell's ( Thomas Horn ) adventure takes him all over New York in an attempt to find a man or woman with the last name of Black who may be the only person who knows what lock the key fits. Over the course of his search Oskar meets several people including the mysterious mute renter ( Max von Sydow ) of his grandmother's ( Zoe Caldwell ), who Oskar begins taking with him on his search.
Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
is too cute for its own good. Although similar in the type of story told in Foer's
Everything Is Illuminated
(one of
my favorite films of 2005 ) director
Stephen Daldry
struggles with framing the tale.

Green Lantern #8
For a storyline entitled "The Secret of the Indigo Tribe" it's sure seems like the comic would rather tease us then give us any real answers as to who the
Indigo Tribe
really is or explain their connection to
Abin Sur . Although the story arc continues to be intentionally vague in order to draw it out over more comics than necessary, it does have some moments including (finally!) showcasing
Hal Jordan 's ingenuity in how he finds away to recharge his ring without a power battery. Hal's search for
Sinestro
leads him into the Indigo Tribe's sacred temple where he finds a giant statue of Abin Sur as well as altered Sinestro, who is now part of the tribe. After months of treating him as little more than a guy who never bothered to learn what his ring could really do, writer
Geoff Johns
finally showcases Hal Jordan and his ability to make it through several Indigo Lanterns with only a partially charged ring. Worth a look. [DC, $2.99]

Scarlet Spider #4
Kaine 's past finally catches up with him as the Assassin's Guild send several of their most skilled killers to Houston to kill the new Scarlet Spider over an old grudge. Kaine, however,
has other plans . The latest issues is high on action, but the B-story of Doctor Medlund confronting the man who put a hit on him for the death of his wife and baby girl keeps killing the momentum of the main storyline. Kaine's unorthodox solution to stopping the assassins by offering to perform one murder for them in the future, at their convenience, certainly isn't something Peter Parker would do but it reminds us, despite his new career as a super-hero, how Kaine troubleshoots and deals with problems. We also get yet another person ( Annabelle ) learning the Scarlet Spider's secret identity (geez, this guy keeps secrets worse than movie Batman) as well as getting our first glimpse at
Aracely 's hidden talents. Worth a look. [Marvel, $2.99]

Andrew . It turns out not only is Andrew responsible for downloading Buffy's brain and sticking it into a robot, but he did it to help the Slayer. Now the group has to retreive Buffy's real body (which is living out an idyllic life in the suburbs with no knowledge of who she really is) before someone else finds her. However, they may already be too late. With the first big
Season Nine
twist writer
Andrew Chambliss
keeps going for the unexpected. This isn't some nefarious plot by a big bad to hurt the Slayer, but an ill-thought-out attempt by a friend to keep her safe. Meanwhile, with the Slayer out of action
Xander

Dawn

Detective Dowling
with his Zompire problem. Worth a look. [Dark Horse, $2.99]

Batman and Robin #8 (New 52)
I really enjoyed the last issue of
Batman
and
Robin
but was put-off by the final panel which saw a tortured Damian kill
Nobody
in front of Batman. I was skeptical as to how this event would play out, but I have to admit
Peter J. Tomasi
gives us a thoughtful follow-up that includes a frank, and loving, conversation between estranged father and son that should lead to a fresh start for Batman and Robin. The issues is definitely light on action but character is brought to the forefront as Batman and Damian lick their wounds and discuss Batman's desire for deadly vengeance and his promise to his parents to never let that happen.
The issue doesn't ignore Damian's actions from last issue, but it also doesn't condemn him for it (as I expected it to do, further driving a wedge between the two). Instead Bruce uses the opportunity as a lesson for his son to move both of them forward. By the end of the issue we're given a Batman and Robin I really want to see more of, and that's really all you can ask. Worth a look. [DC, $2.99]
