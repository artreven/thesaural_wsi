The Flash
is able to stop
Captain Cold
and save Patty but not without a cost. In order to save as many passengers from the boat as possible the Flash must break his promise to
Dr. Elias
to control his speed use. And although Barry is able to save his girlfriend,
Iris
and several other passengers are lost in a wormhole the Flash unintentionally created.
The main story is well told and terrifically laid out by writer/artist
Francis Manapul
and co-writer
Brian Buccellato . There are also several interesting nuggets scattered throughout including the Flash’s first run on the
cosmic treadmill
(or at least the
New 52
equivalent), our first look at the reimaganed natives of
Gorilla City
(who…are religous zealots? Hrm.), as well as a tease at the new
Pied Piper .
Seeing how the next issue is going to be firmly centered around the speed force this issue did a good job of ending the Captain Cold story and starting a new problem for Barry with
Patsy ‘s now firmly anti-Flash stance. Worth a look.
[DC, $2.99]
