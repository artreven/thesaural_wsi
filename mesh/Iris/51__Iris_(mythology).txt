Exekias .
Achilles and Ajax Playing Dice .
c.540-530 B.C. Attic black figure amphora from Vulci. Height: 24″ (61cm). Museo Gregoriano Etrusco, VaticanExekias was both painter and potter, thus signed.In the black-figure technique of Greek vase painting, figures were painted using slip which turned back when the vase was fired. The red background is the unslipped area of the ceramic surface. A stylus was used to scratch through the slipped surface to create details in red - the complex, delicate, deftly incised patterns on the cloaks worn by Achilles and Ajax in this image testify to Exekias’ genius. Although engaged in a game of dice (Achilles calls out “tesara” [four] and Ajax calls out “tri” [three]), both heroes sit poised for action, holding their spears at the ready.

The
François Vase , a milestone in the development of Greek pottery, is a large volute kraterdecorated in the black-figure style which stands at 66cm in height. Dated at circa 570/560 B.C.E. it was found in 1844 in an Etruscan tomb in the necropolis of Fonte Rotella near Chiusi and named after its discoverer Alessandro François; it is now in the Museo Archeologico at Florence. It bears the inscriptions "Ergotimos mepoiesen" and "Kleitias megraphsen", meaning "Ergotimos made me" and "Kleitias painted me", respectively - early evidence that the roles of potter and painter had become separate at this date.The uppermost frieze, on the neck of the krater, depicts on side A [1]
the Calydonian Boar Hunt, including the heroes Meleager, Peleus, andAtalanta. The scene is flanked by two sphinxes which are separated from it by a band of lotus blossoms and palmettes. On the other side of the vessel, this zone features the dance of Athenian youths led by Theseus who is playing the lyre, standing opposite Ariadne and her nurse.The second band on side A shows the chariot race which is part of the funeral games for Patroclus, instituted by his friend [2]
Achilles, in the last year of the Trojan War. Here, Achilles is standing in front of a bronze tripod, which would have been one of the prizes, while the participants include the Greek heroes Diomedes and Odysseus. On side B, the painted scene depicts a battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs. The most famous of these conflicts took place at the wedding party of Pirithous and Hippodamia, which is probably depicted here, as the hero Theseus is found among the combatants, a friend of Pirithous who himself was not a Lapith, but said to be among the wedding guests. The scene also includes the demise of the Lapith hero Caeneus.The third frieze on both sides, the highest and also most prominent one because of its location on the top of the body vessel, depicts the procession of the gods to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. Because of its large number of figures, the procession is a suitable topic to decorate the long band. The end of the procession shows Peleus between an altar and the house where Thetis can be seen sitting inside. He is greeting his teacher, the centaur Chiron, who is heading the procession together with the divine messenger Iris, followed by many other deities.The fourth frieze on side A depicts Achilles’ ambush on Troilus outside the gates of Troy, side B shows the return of Hephaestus to Olympus. Hephaestus, sitting on a mule, is led to the Olympian gods by Dionysus, followed by a group of silens and nymphs.The fifth frieze shows sphinxes and griffins flanking lotus blossom and palmettes ornaments and panthers and lions attacking bulls, a boar, and a deer.On the foot of the vessel, there is on both sides a depiction of the battle between the Pygmies and the cranes.The handles are decorated as well, showing on their outer sides the so-called Mistress of Animals above a vignette showing Ajax carrying the dead Achilles. The fields on the inner sides of the handles above the rim of the pot each feature a Gorgon in motion.

Lekythos , ca. 550 B.C.; black-figure Attributed to the Amasis Painter Greek, Attic TerracottaH. 6 7/8 in. (17.50 cm) Purchase, Walter C. Baker Gift, 1956 (56.11.1)The scene that decorates the body of this small lekythos (oil flask) is our earliest and most complete representation of an Attic wedding. The bridal couple and the best man, the parochos, are seated in the foremost cart, which is drawn by two donkeys, distinguishable by their white muzzles and stringy tails. Four guests, all men, follow in a second cart drawn by two mules. Beside each team, two women and a man walk in the procession, with the women on the left and the man on the right. The lead woman holds two torches, which indicates that the wedding procession, as was the tradition, took place at night. The bride holds a wreath and pulls her veil forward in a gesture associated with marriage in Greek art. Her bridegroom sits next to her, holding the reigns; he has a beard and must be much older than the bride, as was the custom in ancient Greece.The procession has almost reached its destination–a brightly painted doorway flanked by two Doric columns just under the handle of the vase. This is the bridegroom's house, the place where the newlyweds are going to live. The doors are open and behind the entrance stands the bridegroom's mother, who carries a torch and raises her hand in a gesture of welcome. The bridal procession, the critical point of passage between the bride's home and that of the groom, was the most conspicuous public part of a wedding ceremony in ancient Attica. Torches and songs added to the festive occasion when the bride's mother, torch in hand, led the couple to their new home.The shoulder of the lekythos is painted with a subsidiary scene of a dance: three groups of three women dance in a chain that is separated by a musician playing the aulos and another playing the lyre. In the
Iliad , Homer describes an aulos and lyre that accompanied the wedding dance. In ancient Attica, both men and women danced at the wedding, but in separate groups well within view of each other.

EXEKIAS One of his most famous works is the so called Dionysos cup (Munich, Antikensammlung 2044). The cup falls into the category of eye cups and is decorated on the outside with two pairs of eyes. Unlike other examples of this group, figuratice scenes are filling the space at the handles, probably an innovation by Exekias. The interior shows a depiction of the god Dionysos on top of a coral-red slip, which coated the entire picture-space. The Dionysos kylix uses the bottom of a wine bowl as a working surface for the main scenario. Dionysos was the god of inspiration. The painting depicts the initial journey of Dionysos to Athens by ship. Pirates had seized the ship and were going, perhaps, to sell Dionysos into slavery. Instead the god caused vines to grow from the mast, frightening the pirates so much that they jumped overboard and were changed into dolphins.

Museum Collection: Musée du Louvre, Paris, France
Catalogue Number: Louvre G103 Beazley Archive Number: 200064 Ware: Attic Red Figure Shape: Krater Painter: Signed by Euphronios Date: ca 515 - 505 BC Period: Late ArchaicSUMMARY Herakles wrestles the Libyan giant Antaios, grasping him in a neck lock. The two women may be the daughters of the giant. The calyx, as was stated earlier, was used for mixing water with wine for revelers at parties, usually held in private residences. Euphronios, as he painted it, separated it into basically four parts: the first being the base, the second a bulging strip taking up most of the bottom third of the bowl right underneath the main, flat third section of the calyx, and the fourth being the lip of the calyx. A masterpiece of Greek pottery, this calyx-krater by Euphronios, known as the "Krater of Antaeus," is one of the most elegant Attic red-figure vases ever produced. The detailed rendering of the muscles of the bodies in combat is precise and original. The realism of Antaeus's face is equally innovative. The monumental group is highlighted by the divergent composition of the women fleeing in the background. Euphronios and the pioneers The red-figure technique appeared in Attica in around 530 BC and sounded the death knell of the black-figure technique. The first ten years were a period of exploration. Then, around the 520s, a group of unique painters known as the "Pioneers" emerged. It included Phintias, Euthymides, and in particular Euphronios. Eclectic, curious, and innovative, they worked with potters like Cachrylion and Euxitheos to form a group of imaginative and audacious precursors who shared their discoveries. Liberated from the rigid frameworks of their predecessors, they filled the space of the vase by painting bodies in more natural postures, giving them volume and introducing foreshortening to create a kind of perspective. The musculature is rendered in precise anatomical detail, thanks to the use of a diluted glaze in light brown tones. The same naturalism characterizes the treatment of the folds of the fabrics. They also invented new vase forms, like the stamnos, the pelike, and the amphora with twisted handles. Euphronios began his career as a painter around 520 BC and was active for twenty years. During the first three decades of the 5th century BC, he worked as a potter. His final works—some cups painted by the Pistoxenos Painter—date from around 470 BC.
The hero and the giant Euphronios painted both mythological compositions and scenes from daily life. Both types of decoration coexist on this vase. Side B shows a music competition, with a young man holding an aulos mounting a platform amid his seated companions, while on side A the battle between Heracles and the giant Antaeus is taking place. The hero's weapons—the club, quiver, and lion skin—are suspended in the field. Antaeus, the son of Poseidon and Ge (the Earth), is identified by an inscription. We are at the end of the battle: Antaeus was drawing his strength from contact with the Earth. To weaken him, Heracles has lifted him up before suffocating him. The body of Antaeus is drawn in a position of abandonment. His right hand is already limp, devoid of strength, and his face is marked by the effort. His half-open mouth shows his teeth in a rictus of pain. His iris, in the upper part of his eye, also underlines the fact that the end is near. Heracles, still bent over in a dynamic position, reveals nothing of the effort he is making. The different treatment of their hair and beards emphasizes the opposition between the two figures: Heracles' are neat, with the curls surrounding his face perfectly drawn with beading; Antaeus's are tousled and painted in coarse brushstrokes, while his moustache and eyebrows are heavily accentuated. The painter has done this to highlight the major difference between the hero of the civilized Greek world and the barbarian giant. The women in the background are drawn on a smaller scale, thereby creating a perspective that accentuates the importance of the two bodies.

Attic Red-Figure Skyphos This skyphos, signed by the potter Hieron and attributed to Macron by J.D. Beazley, is an example of the collaboration between the potter and the painter during the early part of the fifth century BC. Both sides illustrate episodes from the Trojan War: the abduction of Briseis, Achilles' slave, by Agamemnon, and the embassy to Achilles, who is angry and does not wish to resume fighting. The scenes are separated beneath the handles by a tree on one side and a stool on the other. The Abduction of Briseis and the Embassy to Achilles At the beginning of the Iliad, the abduction of Briseis enrages Achilles, who decides to withdraw from battle. However, an embassy comprising Ulysses and Ajax asks him to rejoin the battle. This interruption, caused by the abduction of the young girl, lasted 51 days, until the death of his friend Patroclus. The embassy to Achilles, who is prostrate in grief, is often represented on Greek vases. On the Louvre skyphos, which is of an imposing size for this type of drinking vase, allowing the decoration to be developed further, Macron has painted the abduction of Briseis by Agamemnon on one side. The bearded king, wearing his breastplate embellished with lambrequins, is armed with his spear and sword, which is slipped into a scabbard whose end is adorned with a lion's head. He is seizing young Briseis by the arm; her chiton and himation cover her head. The two figures are followed by Talthybios and Diomedes, who are named in the inscriptions. They are each wearing a petasus, a chlamys and endromides (boots). The composition on the other side is more ambitious, and presents Achilles seated on a folding stool ("diphros") similar to the one that the painter has placed on the handle. He is enveloped in his himation, wearing fine sandals painted in red highlights, and his helmet and sword are hanging from the wall. Sent by the Greeks, Ulysses is leaning on his spears, his legs crossed in an attitude of a figure in discussion, negotiating the return of Achilles with Ajax and Phoenix. Macron and Hieron Macron, one of the most prolific artists in Attic red-figure pottery (around 350 vases are attributed to him), signed very few vases as a painter but worked constantly with the potter Hieron, whose signature appears on around 30 cups. During the early part of the fifth century BC, Hieron was in charge of a famous workshop of cup painters which rivaled those of Euphronios, Brygos and Python. Hieron and Macron produced a large number of cups with elegant forms, and produced and meticulously decorated some large skyphoi, like the one in the Louvre and its counterpart in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, which bears the signature of Macron and represents Helen and Paris on the bowl. Macron favored subjects associated with the Trojan cycle, Dionysiac scenes, and scenes of the palaestra and banqueting. On the Louvre skyphos his style is characterized by the composition, which is simply organized around four monumental figures placed side by side; by the heads, which have rounded contours and are slightly flattened on top; and by the clothing of his figures, which is drawn with great finesse – particularly the women's draperies, with their undulating, lively folds, which clothe the dancing maenads on his cups. Macron's pupils and successors, including the Clinic Painter, worked in the same workshop and continued to produce small vases until 470 BC.

The Berlin Painter This excellent anonymous Attic painter, to whom J.D. Beazley gave the name of the eponymous amphora in Berlin, did not inscribe his signature on his vases. He trained with the Attic red-figure Pioneers, who taught him to study the body in movement and represent nudity. An excellent draughtsman, he produced a large number of vases over the course of his career (from 500 to 460 BC). He decorated large vases but also numerous amphoras, making little use of the secondary decoration in favor of isolated figures linked by a common action. His technique of fine, fluid lines allowed him to excel in the use of relief lines and diluted slip, as evidenced by Ganymede's hair. Greek, about 500-480 BC Made in Athens, Greece; Found at Cerveteri, Lazio, ItalyAchilles fighting Hector on one side, Achilles fighting Memnon on the otherThe figure scenes on this volute- krater
are confined to a narrow, frieze-like band that encircles the lower element of the neck. This has the advantage of providing a limited and almost straight-walled field on which the painter can work. The uninterrupted, glossy black surface of the body emphasizes its perfect contours, while the lighter clay ground of the curled volute handles and the immaculately painted double lotus and palmette chain draw the eye upwards to the figure scenes.On one side Achilles fights the Ethiopian king Memnon, brother of Priam, king of Troy and son of Eos, goddess of the dawn. Achilles attacks from the left (as victors generally do in Greek art) and Memnon falters before his onslaught. Behind each hero stands his mother - the sea-nymph Thetis behind Achilles, Eos behind Memnon. According to tradition, the anxious mothers rushed to Zeus, who weighed the destinies of the pair in his balance and found that Memnon's weighed the heavier.More crucial to the defeat of the Trojans was the death of the Trojan prince Hector at the hands of Achilles, as shown on the other side of this vase. Achilles again attacks from the left, and this time the heroes are backed by their patron deities: Athena signals encouragement to Achilles, while Apollo turns away, abandoning Hector to his fate. Once more Zeus got out the balance, and Hector's fate proved heavier.

n Athenian White-Ground LekythosIn Athenian pottery, by the late 6th century B.C. the shape of the lekythos was more or less standardised into the type we see here, with a tall cylindrical body, a chimney-like neck and a swelling funnel mouth. Black- and red-figure lekythoi were used for domestic purposes. But the so-called white-ground lekythoi, with their coating of a white slip and delicate outline figure drawing, became associated with funerary rituals. Filled with precious oil, they were placed both in and on graves, for the benefit of the deceased. The Achilles Painter, working in the period between 450 and 425 B.C., was one of the great painters of white ground lekythoi.

Apollo and Artemis killing the children of Niobe, red-figure calyx krater by the Niobid Painter, c.
(credit: Cliché Musées Nationaux, Paris) Attic Red-Figure Calyx Krater known as the "Niobides Krater" The Niobides Painter, probably inspired by the large frescoes produced in Athens and Delphi, decorated this exceptional krater with two scenes in which the many figures rise in tiers on lines of ground that evoke an undulating landscape. On one side, Apollo and Artemis are shown decimating the children of Niobe with their arrows; on the other side is Heracles surrounded by Athena and heroes in arms, in a composition whose serenity is already classical, and whose meaning is still uncertain. Description A Mysterious Gathering The main side of the vase shows eleven figures placed at different levels. Only two of them are recognizable: Heracles, in the center, holding his club and bow, with his lion skin over his left arm, and Athena on the left. Around them several warriors are represented in varying poses. Many questions have been asked about the meaning of this image. Two hypotheses frequently crop up: the Argonauts awaiting favorable winds in Iolcos, and the episode of Heracles descending into Hades to rescue Theseus and Pirithous, who were guilty of trying to carry off Persephone. Heracles and the Warriors of Marathon A final, more recent, hypothesis looks at the obvious emphasis given to Heracles – crowned with laurels, wrinkled and standing on a stepped base almost invisible to the naked eye. It is thought to be a statue of the deified hero, after he had completed his exploits. We know from ancient sources that Heracles was thought to have helped Marathon to victory and was subsequently the object of a cult in Athens. We may therefore be seeing, in this image, the warriors of Marathon, come to place themselves under the protection of the hero before battle. The B side of the vase illustrates a legend that is rarely represented, and gave the painter his name. Here we see the massacre of the children of Niobe by Apollo and Artemis. Niobe, the mother of seven girls and seven boys, had bragged that she was superior to the goddess Leto, who only had two children. These two children, Apollo and Artemis, hastened to avenge the honor of their mother by killing all the children of the unfortunate mortal. This is the moment that the painter has chosen to represent – the divine archers shooting down the Niobides with their arrows. Half of them are already lying dead on the ground. The Influence of Sculpture and Large-Scale Paintings The stylistic characteristics of this krater owe much to contemporary sculpture and wall paintings. The poses of the key figures – Artemis, Apollo and Heracles – are reminiscent of those in Severe style statues, which can be seen in Olympia. However, by bringing in elements of wall paintings, the painter has given this vase its exceptional character. Wall painting was a major art form that developed considerably during the late fifth century BC, and is now only known to us through written accounts. Complex compositions were perfected, which involved numerous figures placed at different levels. This is the technique we find here where, for the first time on a vase, the traditional isocephalia of the figures has been abandoned.

early 5th c. Analysis: a multi-figure narrative encircling the shoulder is very unusual on this shape. The detailed rendering of the Sack of Troy was painted shortly after the Persians had invaded Athens and sacked the Acropolis: a contemporary event is associated with the mythical past.

Apollo and Artemis killing the children of Niobe, red-figure calyx krater by the Niobid Painter, c.
(credit: Cliché Musées Nationaux, Paris) Mysterious Gathering The main side of the vase shows eleven figures placed at different levels. Only two of them are recognizable: Heracles, in the center, holding his club and bow, with his lion skin over his left arm, and Athena on the left. Around them several warriors are represented in varying poses. Many questions have been asked about the meaning of this image. Two hypotheses frequently crop up: the Argonauts awaiting favorable winds in Iolcos, and the episode of Heracles descending into Hades to rescue Theseus and Pirithous, who were guilty of trying to carry off Persephone.
