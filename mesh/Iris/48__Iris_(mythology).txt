How did Siri get its name?
Siri, Inc. released to the Apple app store, the iOS app called Siri just about one year ago on October 26th, 2010. In 2008 SRI [Stanford Research Institute] International ( http://www.sri.com/ ) spun off Siri, Inc. to develop a private market for the advanced DARPA funded research in Voice recognition and artificial-intelligence systems the company created. Siri Inc. got it’s name from the sounds the initials of SRI International creates.
As an aside, Siri is also
Iris
spelled backwards.
In Greek mythology, Iris (Ἶρις) is the personification of the rainbow and messenger of the gods. As the sun unites Earth and heaven, Iris links the gods to humanity. She travels with the speed of wind from one end of the world to the other, and into the depths of the sea and the underworld.
