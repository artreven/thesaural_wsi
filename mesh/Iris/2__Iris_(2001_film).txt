Personal life and family
Main article:
Redgrave family
Redgrave was born in
Greenwich , London, the daughter of actors Sir
Michael Redgrave
and
Rachel Kempson .
Laurence Olivier
announced her birth to the audience at a
performance of
Hamlet
at the
Old Vic , when he said that
Laertes
(played by Sir Michael) had a daughter. She was educated
at
The Alice Ottley School ,
Worcester
&
Queen's Gate School , London before "coming out" as a debutante.
Her late siblings,
Lynn Redgrave
and
Corin Redgrave , were also acclaimed actors.
Redgrave's daughters,
Natasha Richardson
(1963–2009) and
Joely Richardson
(b. 1965) from her 1962–67 marriage to film
director
Tony Richardson , also built respected acting careers. Redgrave's
son
Carlo Gabriel Nero
( né
Carlo Sparanero), by Italian actor
Franco Nero
(né Francesco Sparanero), is a writer and film
director. She met Franco while filming
Camelot
in 1967, the year she divorced her husband Tony
Richardson, who left her for the French actress
Jeanne Moreau . Redgrave and Nero married on 31 December 2006. [2]
She is also the grandmother of Michaél and Daniel Neeson, Daisy Bevan,
and Raphael and Lilli Sparanero.
In 1967, Redgrave was made a
Commander (CBE) of the
Order of the British Empire . It was reported that she
declined
a damehood in 1999. [3]
From 1971 to 1986, she had a
long-term relationship with actor
Timothy Dalton , with whom she had starred in the film
Mary, Queen of Scots . [ citation

Within 14 months in 2009-2010,
she lost both a daughter and her two younger siblings. Her daughter
Natasha Richardson died on 18 March 2009 from a traumatic brain injury
caused by a skiing accident. [4] [5]
On 6 April 2010, her brother Corin Redgrave died, and on 2 May 2010,
her sister Lynn Redgrave died.
Career
Stage
Vanessa Redgrave entered the
Central School of Speech and Drama
in 1954. She first appeared in
the West End, playing opposite her brother, in 1958.
In 1960, Redgrave had her first
starring role in
Robert Bolt 's
The Tiger and the Horse , in which she co-starred with her
father. In 1962 she played
Imogen
in
William Gaskill 's production of
Cymbeline
for the
Royal Shakespeare Company . In 1966 Redgrave created the role of
Jean Brodie in the
Donald Albery
production of
The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie , adapted for the stage by
Jay Presson Allen
from the novel by
Muriel Spark . She won four
Evening Standard Awards
Best Actress
Evening Standards Awards for Best Actress in four
decades. She was awarded the
Laurence Olivier Award for Actress of the Year in a Revival
in
1984 for
The Aspern Papers
In the nineties, her theatre work
included
Prospero
in
The Tempest
at
Shakespeare's Globe
in London. In 2003 she won a
Tony Award
for Best Actress in a Play for her performance in the
Broadway
revival
of
Eugene O'Neill 's
Long Day's Journey Into Night . In January 2006, Redgrave was
presented the Ibsen Centennial Award for her "outstanding work in
interpreting many of
Henrik Ibsen 's works over the last decades." [6]
Previous recipients of the award include
Liv Ullmann ,
Glenda Jackson , and
Claire Bloom .
In 2007, Redgrave played
Joan Didion
in her Broadway stage adaptation of her 2005 book,
The Year of Magical Thinking , which played 144 regular
performances in a 24-week limited engagement at the
Booth Theatre . For this, she won the
Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show
and was nominated
for the
Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play .
She reprised the role at the
Lyttelton Theatre
at The
Royal National Theatre
in London to mixed reviews. She also spent
a week performing the work at the Theatre Royal in Bath in September
2008. She once again performed the role of Joan Didion for a special
benefit at New York's
Cathedral of Saint John the Divine
on 26 October 2009. The
performance was originally slated to debut on 27 April, but was pushed
due to the death of Redgrave's daughter Natasha. The proceeds for the
benefit were donated to the
United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and the
United Nations Relief and Works Agency
(UNRWA). Both charities
work to provide help for the children of Gaza.
In October 2010 she starred in
the Broadway premiere of
Driving Miss Daisy
starring in the title role opposite
James Earl Jones . The show premiered on 25 October 2010 at the
John Golden Theatre in New York City to rave reviews. [7]
The production was originally scheduled to run through 29 January 2011
but due to a successful response and high box office sales, was
extended to 9 April 2011. [8]
In May 2011, she was nominated for a
Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play
for
the role of Daisy in
Driving Miss Daisy . [9]
In a poll of "industry experts"
and readers conducted by
The Stage
in 2010, Redgrave was ranked as the ninth greatest
stage actor of all time. [10]
Early film work
Highlights of Redgrave's early
film career include her first starring role in
Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment
(for which she earned an
Oscar nomination, a
Cannes
award, a
Golden Globe
nomination and a
BAFTA Film Award nomination ); her portrayal of a cool London
swinger in 1966's
Blowup ; her spirited portrayal of dancer
Isadora Duncan
in
Isadora
(for which she won a National Society of Film Critics
Award for Best Actress, a second Prize for the Best Female Performance
at the
Cannes film festival , along with a Golden Globe and Oscar
nomination in 1969); and various portrayals of historical figures –
ranging from Andromache in
The Trojan Women , to
Mary, Queen of Scots
in
the film of the same name . She also played the role of
Guinevere in the film
Camelot
with Richard Harris and Franco Nero.
Julia ,
The Palestinian
and the Oscar controversy
In 1977, Redgrave funded and
narrated a documentary film
The Palestinian
about Palestinians and the activities of the
Palestinian Liberation Organization. That same year she starred in the
film
Julia , about a woman murdered by the
Nazi
German regime in the years prior to World War II for her
anti-Fascist
activism. Her co-star in the film was
Jane Fonda
(playing writer
Lillian Hellman ), who, in her 2005 autobiography, noted that:
there is a quality about Vanessa
that makes me feel as if she resides in a netherworld of mystery that
eludes the rest of us mortals. Her voice seems to come from some deep
place that knows all suffering and all secrets. Watching her work is
like seeing through layers of glass, each layer painted in mythic
watercolor images, layer after layer, until it becomes dark – but even
then you know you haven't come to the bottom of it ... The only other
time I had experienced this with an actor was with
Marlon Brando
... Like Vanessa, he always seemed to be in another
reality, working off some secret, magnetic, inner rhythm. [11]
When Redgrave was nominated for
an Oscar in 1978, for her role in
Julia,
members of the
Jewish Defense League
(JDL), led by Rabbi
Meir Kahane , burned effigies of Redgrave and picketed the Academy
Awards ceremony to protest against both Redgrave and her support of
the Palestinian cause. [12]
Redgrave's performance in
Julia
garnered an
Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress . Accepting the award,
Redgrave said:
My dear colleagues, I thank you
very much for this tribute to my work. I think that
Jane Fonda
and I have done the best work of our lives, and I think
this is in part due to our director,
Fred Zinnemann .
And I also think it's in part
because we believed and we believe in what we were expressing--two out
of millions who gave their lives and were prepared to sacrifice
everything in the fight against
fascist
and
racist
Nazi Germany .
And I salute you, and I pay
tribute to you, and I think you should be very proud that in the last
few weeks you've stood firm, and you have refused to be intimidated by
the threats of a small bunch of
Zionist
hoodlums whose behavior is an insult to the stature of
Jews all over the world and their great and heroic record of struggle
against fascism and oppression.
And I salute that record and I
salute all of you for having stood firm and dealt a final blow against
that period when
Nixon
and
McCarthy
launched a worldwide witch-hunt against those who tried
to express in their lives and their work the truth that they believe
in. I salute you and I thank you and I pledge to you that I will
continue to fight against
anti-Semitism
and fascism. [13]
Later in the broadcast veteran
screenwriter and Oscar presenter
Paddy Chayefsky
told the audience members that
there's a little matter I'd like
to tidy up...at least if I expect to live with myself tomorrow
morning. I would like to say that I'm sick and tired of people
exploiting the Academy Awards for the propagation of their own
personal propaganda. I would like to suggest to Miss Redgrave that her
winning an Academy Award is not a pivotal moment in history, does not
require a proclamation, and a simple "thank you" would have sufficed.
In 1978, Rabbi Meir Kahane
published a book entitled
Listen Vanessa, I am a Zionist , which
was later renamed
Listen World, Listen Jew , in direct response
to Redgrave's comments at the Academy Awards. To this day many
rightwing Jewish groups, such as the
Jewish Defense League , consider Redgrave an opponent and a
supporter of terrorism, citing remarks she has made such as, "Zionism
is a brutal, racist ideology. And it is a brutal racist regime." [14]
Later film career
Vanessa Redgrave
Later film roles of note include
those of suffragist Olive Chancellor in
The Bostonians
(1984, a fourth Best Actress
Academy Award
nomination), transsexual tennis player
Renée Richards
in
Second Serve
(1986); Mrs. Wilcox in
Howards End
(1992, her sixth Academy Award nomination, this
time in a supporting role); crime boss Max in
Mission: Impossible
(1996, when discussing the role of Max,
DePalma and Cruise thought it would be fun to cast an actor like
Redgrave; they then decided to go with the real thing); Oscar Wilde’s
mother in
Wilde
(1997); Clarissa Dalloway in
Mrs. Dalloway
(1997); and Dr. Sonia Wick in
Girl, Interrupted
(1999). Many of these roles and others,
garnered her various accolades.
Her performance as a lesbian
grieving the loss of her longtime partner in the HBO series
If These Walls Could Talk 2
earned her a
Golden Globe
for “Best TV Series Supporting Actress” in 2000, as
well as earning an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a
TV Movie or Miniseries. This same performance also led to an
“Excellence in Media Award” by the
Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation
(GLAAD). The award
honours “a member of the entertainment community who has made a
significant difference in promoting equal rights for lesbian, gay,
bisexual, and transgendered people”. In 2004, Redgrave joined the
second season cast of the hit
FX
series
Nip/Tuck , portraying
Dr. Erica Noughton , the mother of
Julia McNamara , who is played by her real-life daughter
Joely Richardson . She also made appearances in the third and sixth
seasons. In 2006, Redgrave starred opposite
Peter O'Toole
in the acclaimed film
Venus . A year later, Redgrave starred in
Evening
and the acclaimed
Atonement , in which she garnered a
Broadcast Film Critics Association
award nomination for her
performance that only took up seven minutes of screen time. In 2008,
Redgrave appeared as a narrator in an Arts Alliance production,
id – Identity of the Soul . In 2009, Redgrave starred in the BBC
remake of
The Day of the Triffids , with her daughter Joely. In the midst
of losing her daughter, Natasha Richardson, Redgrave signed on to play
Eleanor of Aquitaine
in Ridley Scott's version of
Robin Hood , which began filming shortly after Natasha's death.
Redgrave later withdrew from the film for personal reasons. The part
was given to her
Evening
co-star
Eileen Atkins . [15]
She was next seen in
Letters to Juliet
opposite her husband
Franco Nero .
She had small roles in
Eva , a Romanian drama film that premiered at the
2010 Cannes Film Festival
as well as in
Julian Schnabel 's Palestinian drama,
Miral
that was screened at the
67th Venice International Film Festival
and played the role of
Winnie the Giant Tortoise in the 2010 environmental animated film
Animals United . She has a supporting role in the
Bosnia -set political drama,
The Whistleblower , which premiered at the
2010 Toronto International Film Festival . Both
Miral
and
The Whistleblower
are scheduled for US theatrical release in 2011.
Redgrave also narrates
Patrick Keiller 's semi-fictional upcoming documentary,
Robinson in Ruins .
She has also filmed leading lady
roles for two upcoming 2011 historical films. This includes,
Ralph Fiennes ' directorial debut of Shakespeare's
Coriolanus
in which Redgrave plays
Volumnia ; and
Roland Emmerich 's
Anonymous
in which Redgrave plays
Queen Elizabeth I .
Political activism
In 1980, Redgrave made her
American TV debut as
concentration camp
survivor
Fania Fénelon
in the
Arthur Miller -scripted TV movie
Playing for Time , a part for which she won an
Emmy
as Outstanding Lead Actress in 1981. The decision to cast
Redgrave as Fénelon was, however, a source of controversy. In light of
Redgrave's support for the
Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO), [16]
even Fénelon objected to her casting. Redgrave was perplexed by such
hostility, stating in her 1991 autobiography her long-held belief that
"the struggle against
anti-Semitism
and for the self-determination of the Palestinians
form a single whole." [17]
In 1984, Redgrave sued the
Boston Symphony Orchestra , claiming that the orchestra had fired
her from a performance due to her support of the PLO. [18]
Lillian Hellman
testified in court on Redgrave's behalf. [18]
Redgrave won on a count of
breach of contract , but did not win on the claim that the Boston
orchestra had violated her civil rights by firing her. [18]
In 1995, Redgrave was elected to
serve as a
UNICEF
Goodwill Ambassador .
In December 2002, Redgrave paid
£50,000 bail for
Chechen
separatist Deputy Premier and special envoy
Akhmed Zakayev , who had sought
political asylum
in the United Kingdom and was accused by the
Russian government
of aiding and abetting hostage-takings in the
Moscow Hostage Crisis of 2002 —in which 128 hostages lost their
lives to the Chechen terrorists during a Russian special forces ( OMON )
action – and guerrilla warfare against Russia.
At a press conference Redgrave
said she feared for Zakayev's safety if he were extradited to Russia
on terrorism charges. He would "die of a heart attack" or some other
mysterious explanation offered by Russia, she said. [19]
On 13 November 2003, a London court rejected the Russian government's
request for Zakayev's extradition. Instead, the court accepted a plea
by lawyers for Zakayev that he would not get a fair trial, and could
even face torture, in Russia. "It would be unjust and oppressive to
return Mr Zakayev to Russia," Judge Timothy Workman ruled. [20]
In December 2003 it was revealed
that Redgrave had
declined
the offer of being made a
Dame
from
Tony Blair 's New Labour government. [21]
In 2004, Vanessa Redgrave and her
brother
Corin Redgrave
launched the
Peace and Progress Party , which campaigned against the
Iraq War
and for human rights. However, in June 2005 Redgrave left
the party.
Redgrave has been an outspoken
critic of the " war
on terrorism ". [22] [23]
During a June 2005 interview on
Larry King Live , Redgrave was challenged on this criticism and
on her political views. In response she questioned if there can be
true democracy if the political leadership of the United States and
Britain does not "uphold the values for which my father's generation
fought the Nazis, [and] millions of people gave their lives against
the
Soviet Union 's regime. [Such sacrifice was made] because of
democracy and what democracy meant: no torture, no camps, no detention
forever or without trial...[Such] techniques are not just alleged
[against the governments of the U.S. and Britain], they have actually
been written about by the
FBI . I don't think it's being 'far left'...to uphold the rule of
law." [24]
In March 2006, Redgrave remarked
in an interview with US broadcast journalist
Amy Goodman : “I don't know of a single government that actually
abides by international human rights law, not one, including my own.
In fact, [they] violate these laws in the most despicable and obscene
way, I would say.”
Goodman’s interview with Redgrave
took place in the actress’s West London home on the evening of 7
March, and covered a range of subjects, particularly the cancellation
of the
Alan Rickman
production,
My Name is Rachel Corrie , by the
New York Theater Workshop . Such a development, said Redgrave, was
an "act of catastrophic cowardice" as "the essence of life and the
essence of theatre is to communicate about lives, either lives that
have ended or lives that are still alive, [and about] beliefs, and
what is in those beliefs." [25]
In June 2006, she was awarded a
lifetime achievement award from the
Transilvania International Film Festival , one of whose sponsors is
a mining company named
Gabriel Resources . She dedicated the award to a community
organisation from
Roşia Montană , Romania, which is campaigning against a
gold mine
that Gabriel Resources is seeking to build near the
village. Gabriel Resources placed an "open letter" in
The Guardian
on 23 June 2006, attacking Redgrave, arguing the
case for the mine, and exhibiting support for it among the
inhabitants: the open letter is signed by 77 villagers. [26]
In December 2007, Redgrave was
named as one of the possible suretors who paid the £50,000 bail for
Jamil al-Banna , one of three British residents arrested after
landing back in the UK following four years' captivity at
Guantanamo Bay . Redgrave has declined to be specific about her
financial involvement but said she was "very happy" to be of "some
small assistance for Jamil and his wife", adding, "It is a profound
honour and I am glad to be alive to be able to do this. Guantanamo Bay
(Gitmo) is a concentration camp." [27]

Dench ,
CH ,
DBE ,
FRSA
(born 9
December 1934) is an English film, stage and television actress.
Dench made her professional debut
in 1957 with the
Old Vic Company . Over the following few
years she played in several of
William Shakespeare's plays
in such roles
as
Ophelia
in
Hamlet ,
Juliet
in
Romeo and Juliet
and
Lady Macbeth
in
Macbeth . She branched into film work,
and won a
BAFTA Award as Most Promising Newcomer ;
however, most of her work during this period was in theatre. Not
generally known as a singer, she drew strong reviews for her leading
role in the musical
Cabaret
in 1968.
HIDE TEXT
During the next two decades,
she established herself as one of the most significant British
theatre performers, working for the
National Theatre Company
and the
Royal Shakespeare Company . In television,
she achieved success during this period, in the series
A Fine Romance
from 1981 until 1984
and in 1992 began a continuing role in the television romantic
comedy series
As Time Goes By .
Her film appearances were
infrequent until she was cast as
M
in
GoldenEye
(1995), a role she has played
in each
James Bond
film since. She received several
notable film awards for her role as
Queen Victoria
in
Mrs. Brown
(1997), and has since been
acclaimed for her work in such films as
Shakespeare in Love
(1998),
Chocolat
(2000),
Iris
(2001),
Mrs Henderson Presents
(2005) and
Notes on a Scandal
(2006), and the
television production
The Last of the Blonde Bombshells
(2001).
Regarded by critics as one of the
greatest actresses of the post-war period, and frequently named as the
leading British actress in polls, Dench has received many award
nominations for her acting in theatre, film and television; her awards
include ten
BAFTAs , seven
Laurence Olivier Awards , two
Screen Actors Guild Awards , two
Golden Globes , an
Academy Award , and a
Tony Award . In June 2011, she received a
fellowship
from the
British Film Institute
(BFI). [3]
She was married to actor
Michael Williams
from 1971 until his death
in 2001. They are the parents of actress
Finty Williams .
Personal life
Dench was born in Heworth,
York , England, the daughter of Eleanora
Olave (née Jones), a native of Dublin, and Reginald Arthur Dench, a
doctor who met Judi's mother while studying medicine at
Trinity College ,
Dublin . [4]
Dench was raised a
Methodist
until, at age 13, she attended
The Mount School , a
Quaker
Independent Secondary school in
York,thus becoming a Quaker. [5] [6]
Her brothers, one of whom is actor
Jeffery Dench , were born in
Tyldesley ,
Lancashire . [5] [6]
Notable relatives also include her niece, Emma Dench, a
Roman
historian and professor previously at
Birkbeck, University of London , and
currently at
Harvard University ,
Cambridge, Massachusetts . [7]
In 1971, Dench married British
actor
Michael Williams
and they had their only
child, Tara Cressida Frances Williams, known professionally as
Finty Williams , on 24 September 1972.
Dench and her husband starred
together in several stage productions, and the
Bob Larbey
British television sitcom,
A Fine Romance
(1981–84). Michael
Williams died from lung cancer in 2001, aged 65.
Career
In Britain, Dench has developed a
reputation as one of the greatest actresses of the post-war period,
primarily through her work in theatre, which has been her forte
throughout her career. She has more than once been named number one in
polls for Britain's best actress. [8] [9]
Early years
Through her parents, Dench had
regular contact with the theatre. Her father, a physician, was also
the GP for the York Theatre, and her mother was its wardrobe mistress. [10]
Actors often stayed in the Dench household. During these years, Judi
was involved on a non-professional basis in the first three
productions of the modern revival of the
York Mystery Plays
in the 1950s. In 1957,
in one of the last productions in which she appeared during this
period, she played the role of the
Virgin Mary , performed on a fixed stage in
the
Museum Gardens . [11]
Though she initially trained as a set designer, she became interested
in drama school as her brother Jeff attended the
Central School of Speech and Drama . [10]
She applied and was accepted, where she was a classmate of
Vanessa Redgrave , graduating with a first
class degree in drama and four acting prizes, one being the Gold Medal
as Outstanding Student. [10]
In September 1957, she made her
first professional stage appearance with the
Old Vic Company , at the
Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool , as
Ophelia
in
Hamlet , then her
London
debut in the same production at the
Old Vic. She remained a member of the company for four seasons,
1957–1961, her roles including Katherine in
Henry V
in 1958 (which was also her
New York
debut), and as
Juliet
in
Romeo and Juliet
in October 1960,
directed and designed by
Franco Zeffirelli . During this period, she
toured the United States and Canada, and appeared in
Yugoslavia
and at the
Edinburgh Festival .
She joined the
Royal Shakespeare Company
in December 1961
playing Anya in
The Cherry Orchard
at the
Aldwych Theatre
in London, and made her
Stratford-upon-Avon
debut in April 1962 as
Isabella in
Measure for Measure . She subsequently
spent seasons in repertory both with the
Nottingham Playhouse
from January 1963
(including a
West African
tour as
Lady Macbeth
for the
British Council ), and with the
Oxford Playhouse
Company from April 1964.
That same year, she made her film debut in
The Third Secret .
Prominence
In 1968, she was offered the role
of Sally Bowles in the musical
Cabaret . As
Sheridan Morley
later reported: "At first
she thought they were joking. She had never done a musical and she has
an unusual croaky voice which sounds as if she has a permanent cold.
So frightened was she of singing in public that she auditioned from
the wings, leaving the pianists alone on stage". [12]
But when it opened at the Palace Theatre
in February 1968,
Frank Marcus , reviewing for
Plays and
Players , commented that: "She sings well. The title song in
particular is projected with great feeling."
After a long run in
Cabaret ,
she rejoined the
RSC
making numerous appearances with the
company in Stratford and London for nearly twenty years, winning
several best actress awards. Among her roles with the RSC, she was the
Duchess in
John Webster 's
The Duchess of Malfi
in 1971. In the
Stratford 1976 season, and then at the Aldwych in 1977, she gave two
comedy performances, first in
Trevor Nunn 's musical staging of
The Comedy of Errors
as Adriana, then
partnered with
Donald Sinden
as Beatrice and Benedick in
John Barton 's "British Raj" revival of
Much Ado About Nothing . As
Bernard Levin
wrote in
The Sunday Times : "...demonstrating
once more that she is a comic actress of consummate skill, perhaps the
very best we have." [13]
One of her most notable
achievements with the RSC was her performance as Lady Macbeth in 1976.
Nunn's acclaimed production of
Macbeth
was first staged with a
minimalist
design at
The Other Place
theatre in Stratford. Its
small round stage focused attention on the
psychological
dynamics of the characters,
and both
Ian McKellen
in the title role, and Dench,
received exceptionally favourable notices. "If this is not great
acting I don't know what is", wrote
Michael Billington
in
The Guardian .
"It will astonish me if the performance is matched by any in this
actress's generation", commented
J C Trewin
in
The Lady . The production transferred to
London, opening at the Donmar Warehouse in September 1977, and was
adapted for television, later released on
VHS
and
DVD . Dench won the
SWET
Best Actress Award in 1977.
In 1989, she was cast as Pru
Forrest, the long-time silent wife of Tom Forrest, in the
BBC
soap opera
The Archers
on its 10,000th edition. [14]
She had a romantic role in the
BBC television film
Langrishe, Go Down
(1978), with
Jeremy Irons
and a screenplay by
Harold Pinter
from the
Aidan Higgins
novel, directed by
David Jones , in which she played one of
three spinster sisters living in a fading Irish mansion in the
Waterford countryside.
Dench made her debut as a
director in 1988 with the
Renaissance Theatre Company 's touring
season,
Renaissance Shakespeare on the Road , co-produced with
the
Birmingham Rep , and ending with a three
month repertory programme at the
Phoenix Theatre
in London. Dench's
contribution was a staging of
Much Ado About Nothing , set in the
Napoleonic era , which starred
Kenneth Branagh
and
Samantha Bond
as Benedick and Beatrice.
She has made numerous appearances
in the
West End
including the role of Miss Trant
in the 1974 musical version of
The Good Companions
at
Her Majesty's Theatre . In 1981, Dench was
due to play the title role of
Grizabella
in the original production of
Cats , but was forced to pull out due to
a torn Achilles tendon, leaving
Elaine Paige
to play the role. [15]
She has acted with the
National Theatre
in London where, in
September 1995, she played Desiree Armfeldt in a major revival of
Stephen Sondheim 's
A Little Night Music , for which she won
an Olivier Award.
Popular success
In 1995, she took over the role
of
M
( James
Bond 's boss) with the
James Bond film series , starting with
GoldenEye
replacing
Robert Brown . She has appeared in six James
Bond films, including
Casino Royale
(2006) and its direct
sequel
Quantum of Solace
(2008), making her
the longest-running current cast member of the series.
She has won multiple awards for
performances on the London stage, including a record six
Laurence Olivier Awards . She also won the
Tony Award
for her 1999 Broadway
performance in the role of Esme Allen in
David Hare's
Amy's View . She has taken on the role
of Director for a number of stage productions. Dench won the Academy
Award for Best Supporting Actress as
Elizabeth I
in the film
Shakespeare in Love .
Judi Dench has frequently
appeared with her close friend
Geoffrey Palmer . They co-starred in the
series
As Time Goes By , where she played Jean
Pargetter, becoming Jean Hardcastle after she married Lionel
Hardcastle. The program spanned nine seasons. They also worked
together on the films
Mrs. Brown
and
Tomorrow Never Dies , both filmed in
1997. Dench has also lent her distinctive voice to many animated
characters, narrations, and various other voice work. She plays the
role of "Miss Lilly" in the children's animated series
Angelina
Ballerina
(alongside her daughter, Finty Williams, as the voice of
Angelina) and as Mrs. Calloway in the
Disney
animated film
Home on the Range . She has narrated
various classical music recordings (notably

A Midsummer Night's Dream ,
and

Matter ), and has appeared in numerous
BBC
radio broadcasts as well as

Dame Helen Mirren ,
DBE
(born 26 July 1945) is an English actor. She has won an
Academy Award for Best Actress , four
SAG Awards , four
BAFTAs , three
Golden Globes , four
Emmy Awards , and two
Cannes Film Festival
Best Actress Awards .
HIDE TEXT
Early life and family
Mirren was born
Helen Lydia
Mironoff [1] [2]
in
Queen Charlotte's Hospital, Chiswick, West London . [3]
Her father, Vasiliy Petrovich Mironov (1913–1980), was of Russian
origin, and her mother, Kitty (née Kathleen Alexandrina Eva Matilda
Rogers; 1909–1996), was English. [4]
Mirren's paternal grandfather, Colonel Pyotr Vasilievich Mironov, was
in the Tsarist Army and fought in the 1904 Russo-Japanese War. He
later became a diplomat, and was negotiating an arms deal in Britain,
where he and his family were stranded during the
Russian Revolution . [5]
The former diplomat became a London cab driver to support his family.
His son, Helen Mirren's father,
changed the family name to the Scottish-sounding Mirren in the 1950s
and became known as Basil Mirren. He played the
viola
with the
London Philharmonic
before World War II, and later drove a cab and
was a driving-test examiner, before becoming a civil servant with the
Ministry of Transport. Mirren's mother was from
West Ham ,
East London , and was the 13th of 14 children born to a butcher
whose father had been the butcher to
Queen Victoria . [4]
Mirren considers her upbringing to have been "very anti-monarchist". [6]
The first house she remembers
living in was in
Westcliff-on-Sea , Essex, when she was two or three years old,
after the birth of her younger brother, who was named Peter Basil
after his grandfather and great-great-grandfather. Mirren was the
second of three children, born two years after her older sister
Katherine ("Kate"; born 1942). She later lived in
Leigh-on-Sea .

(March 2011)
Mirren attended
St Bernard's High School for Girls
in
Southend-on-Sea , where she acted in school productions, and
subsequently a teaching college, the
New College of Speech and Drama
in London, "housed within
Anna Pavlova 's old home, Ivy House" on the North End Road – which
leads from Golders Green to Hampstead, N. London. At age eighteen, she
auditioned for the
National Youth Theatre
and was accepted. By the time she was 20,
she was
Cleopatra
in the NYT production of
Antony and Cleopatra
at the
Old Vic , which led to her signing with the agent
Al Parker .
Theatre
Early years
Her work for the NYT led to
Mirren joining the
Royal Shakespeare Company
(RSC), playing Castiza in
Trevor Nunn 's 1966 staging of
The Revenger's Tragedy , Diana in
All's Well That Ends Well
in 1967, Cressida in
Troilus and Cressida
and Phebe [7]
in
As You Like It
in 1968, Julia in
The Two Gentlemen of Verona
in 1970, and Tatiana in
Gorky 's
Enemies
at the
Aldwych
and the title role in
Miss Julie
at
The Other Place
in 1971. She also appeared in four productions,
directed by
Braham Murray
for Century Theatre at the University Theatre in
Manchester between 1965 and 1967. [8]
In 1970, Director/producer
John Goldschmidt
made the documentary film
Doing Her Own Thing
about Mirren at the Royal Shakespeare Company. The film was made for
ATV
and shown on the ITV Network in the UK. [9]
In 1972–73, Mirren worked with
Peter Brook 's International Centre for Theatre Research, and
joined the group's tour in North Africa and the US which created
The Conference of the Birds . Returning to the RSC she played
Lady Macbeth
at
Stratford
in 1974 and at the
Aldwych Theatre
in 1975.
As reported by
Sally Beauman
in her 1982 history of the RSC, Mirren, while
appearing in Nunn's
Macbeth
(1974) and in a highly publicised
letter to
The Guardian
newspaper, attacked both the
National Theatre
and the RSC for their lavish production
expenditure, declaring it "unnecessary and destructive to the art of
the Theatre," and adding, "The realms of truth, emotion and
imagination reached for in acting a great play have become more and
more remote, often totally unreachable across an abyss of costume and
technicalities..." There were no discernible repercussions for this
rebuke of the RSC. [10]
West End and RSC
At the
Royal Court
in September 1975 she notably played rock star Maggie
in
Teeth 'n' Smiles , a musical play by
David Hare , which was revived at
Wyndham's Theatre
in May 1976 winning her the
Plays & Players
Best Actress award, voted by the London critics.
From November 1975 Mirren played
in West End repertory with the
Lyric Theatre Company
as Nina in
The Seagull
and Ella in
Ben Travers ' new farce
The Bed Before Yesterday
("Mirren is stirringly voluptuous as
the
Harlowesque
good-time girl":
Michael Billington ,
The Guardian , 10 December 1975). At the
RSC in Stratford in 1977, and at the Aldwych the following year, she
played a steely Queen Margaret in
Terry Hands ' production of the three parts of
Henry VI , while 1979 saw her 'bursting with grace' with an
acclaimed performance as Isabella in
Peter Gill 's otherwise unexceptional production of
Measure for Measure
at
Riverside Studios .
In 1981 she returned to the Royal
Court for the London premiere of
Brian Friel 's
Faith Healer . In the same year she also received acclaim for
her performance in the title role of
John Webster 's
The Duchess of Malfi , a production of Manchester's
Royal Exchange Theatre
which transferred to
The Roundhouse
in
Chalk Farm , London. Reviewing her portrayal for
The Sunday Telegraph ,
Francis King
wrote: "Miss Mirren never leaves it in doubt that
even in her absences, this ardent, beautiful woman is the most
important character of the story."
Her performance as
Moll Cutpurse
in
The Roaring Girl
at the
Royal Shakespeare Theatre
in January 1983, and at the
Barbican Theatre
April 1983), "swaggered through the action with
radiant singularity of purpose, filling in areas of light and shade
that even
Thomas Middleton
and
Thomas Dekker
omitted." –
Michael Coveney ,
Financial Times , April 1983.
After a relatively barren sojourn
in the Hollywood Hills, she returned to England at the beginning of
1989 to co-star with
Bob Peck
at the
Young Vic
in the London premiere of the
Arthur Miller
double-bill,
Two Way Mirror , performances which prompted Miller to remark:
"What is so good about English actors is that they are not afraid of
the open expression of large emotions" (interview by
Sheridan Morley :
The Times
11 January 1989). In
Elegy for a Lady
she played the svelte proprietress of a
classy boutique, while as the blonde hooker in
Some Kind of Love Story
she was "clad in a Freudian slip and
shifting easily from waif-like vulnerability to sexual aggression,
giving the role a breathy Monroesque quality" (Michael Billington,
The Guardian ).
Stage career
breakthrough
A stage career breakthrough came
in 1994, in an
Yvonne Arnaud Theatre
production bound for the West End, when
Bill Bryden
cast her as Natalya Petrovna in
Ivan Turgenev 's
A Month in the Country . Her co-stars were
John Hurt
as her aimless lover Rakitin and
Joseph Fiennes
in only his second professional stage appearance as
the cocksure young tutor Belyaev. "Instead of a bored Natalya fretting
the summer away in dull frocks, Mirren, dazzlingly gowned, is a woman
almost wilfully allowing her heart's desire for her son's young tutor
to rule her head and wreak domestic havoc....Creamy shoulders bared,
she feels free to launch into a gloriously enchanted, dreamily comic
self-confession of love." ( John
Thaxter ,
Richmond & Twickenham Times , 4 March 1994).
Mirren was twice nominated for
Broadway's
Tony Award
as Best Actress (Play): in 1995 for
A Month in the Country , now directed by
Scott Ellis
("Miss Mirren's performance is bigger and more
animated than the one she gave last year in an entirely different
London production", Vincent Canby in the NY Times, 26 April 1995).
Then again in 2002 for
August Strindberg 's
Dance of Death , co-starring with Sir
Ian McKellen , their fraught rehearsal period coinciding with the
terrorist attacks on New York on September 11, 2001 (as recorded in
her
In the Frame
autobiography, September 2007).
National Theatre
Mirren had an unhappy experience
at the
National Theatre
in 1998 when she played Cleopatra to
Alan Rickman 's Antony. In 2000
Nicholas Hytner , who had worked with Mirren on the film version of
The Madness of King George , cast her as Lady Torrance in his
revival of
Tennessee Williams '
Orpheus Descending
at the
Donmar Warehouse
in London. Michael Billington, reviewing for
The Guardian , described her performance as "an exemplary study
of an immigrant woman who has acquired a patina of resilient toughness
but who slowly acknowledges her sensuality."
At the National Theatre in
November 2003 she again won praise playing Christine Mannon
("defiantly cool, camp and skittish",
Evening Standard ; "glows with mature sexual allure",
Daily Telegraph ) in a revival of
Eugene O'Neill 's
Mourning Becomes Electra
directed by
Howard Davies .
“This production was one of the
best experiences of my professional life, The play was four and a half
hours long, and I have never known that kind of response from an
audience ... It was the serendipity of a beautifully cast play, with
great design and direction, It will be hard to be in anything better.”
( In the Frame , September 2007).
She played the tragic title role
in
Jean Racine 's
Phèdre
at the National in 2009, in a production directed by
Nicholas Hytner . The production was also staged at the
amphitheater
of
Epidaurus
on 11 and 12 July 2009.

Mirren continued her successful
film career when she starred more recently in
Gosford Park
with
Maggie Smith
and
Calendar Girls
where she starred with
Julie Walters . Other more recent appearances include
The Clearing ,
Pride ,
Raising Helen , and
Shadowboxer . Mirren also provided the voice for the
supercomputer " Deep
Thought " in the film adaptation of
Douglas Adams'
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy . During her career, she
has portrayed three British queens in different films and television
series:
Elizabeth I
in the television series
Elizabeth I
(2005),
Elizabeth II
in
The Queen
(2006), and
Queen Charlotte , the wife of
George III , in
The Madness of King George
(1994). She is the only actress
ever to have portrayed both Queens Elizabeth on the screen.
Mirren's title role of
The
Queen
earned her numerous acting awards including a
BAFTA , a
Golden Globe , and an
Academy Award , among many others. During her acceptance speech at
the Academy Award ceremony, she praised and thanked Elizabeth II and
stated that she had maintained her dignity and weathered many storms
during her reign as Queen. Mirren later appeared in supporting roles
in the films
National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets ,
Inkheart ,
State of Play , and
The Last Station , for which she was nominated for an Oscar. [11]
In preparation for her role as a
retired Israeli
Mossad
agent in the film
The Debt , Mirren reportedly immersed herself in studies of
Hebrew language, Jewish history, and
Holocaust
writing, including the life of
Simon Wiesenthal , while in Israel in 2009 for the filming of some
of the movie's scenes. The film is a remake of a 2007 Israeli film of
the same name (Hebrew: Ha-khov). [12]
Television
Mirren is well-known for her role
as
detective
Jane Tennison in the widely viewed
Prime Suspect , a multiple award-winning television drama that
was noted for its high quality, higher popularity and its unique
format, in that it ran for seven seasons in seven extended multi-act
episodes rather than in a traditional seasonal schedule. Her portrayal
of Tennison won her three consecutive BAFTA awards for Best Actress
between 1992 and 1994.

roles in TV and film in the same year. She is one of only three
actresses (the first was Liza Minnelli in 1973 and then decades later
Helen Hunt ) to win a Golden Globe, an Oscar and an Emmy for
performances given in the same year.
Along with the Golden Globe,
Mirren's acclaimed performance in
The Queen
won her the 2007
Academy Award for Best Actress . [15]
She also received Best Actress awards from the
Venice Film Festival , Broadcast Film Critics, National Board of
Review, Satellite Awards, Screen Actors Guild and a BAFTA, as well as
critics awards from all over the world. Entertainment Weekly recently
ranked her Number 2 for Entertainer of the Year for 2006 and also won
the award for best actress in film at the new
Greatest Britons Awards
for her role in
The Queen . In 2007
Mirren became an Honorary Patron of the
University Philosophical Society
at
Trinity College Dublin .
She won the Best Actress award at
the 2009 Rome International Film Festival for her performance as
Tolstoy's wife in
The Last Station . [16]

Door to Door
Critics' Circle Award
for Distinguished Service to the Arts
Mirren at
The Critics' Circle
Awards Luncheon in April 2007
Each year since 1988
The Critics' Circle
has presented an award for Distinguished
Service to the Arts, voted for by all members of the Circle, embracing
Dance, Drama, Film, Music, Visual Arts and Architecture. At a
celebratory luncheon on 10 April 2007 in the National Theatre's
Terrace Restaurant, the award for 2006 was presented to Dame Helen
Mirren. [18]
As
David Gritten , chairman of the Film section made clear, the
decision to make the award was voted on in November 2006, well in
advance of the awards hubbub that surrounded her performance in
The Queen . Accepting the award, an engraved crystal rose bowl,
Mirren described it as the most useful she has ever received, while
reflecting poignantly that this now "might be the last award I will
win in my life. It has been a most incredible year. You do the work
and then....." Previous recipients include
Peter Hall
(1988),
Judi Dench
(1997) and
Ian McKellen
(2003).
Dame Commander of the
Order of the British Empire
On 5 December 2003, she was
invested as a Dame Commander of the
Order of the British Empire
(DBE). When she received the honour,
Mirren commented that
Prince Charles
was "very graceful" but forgot to give her half of
the award; another person had to remind him to give Mirren the star.
She also said that she felt wary about accepting the award and had to
be persuaded by fellow comrades to accept the DBE. In 1996 she had
declined
appointment as a Commander of the order (CBE). [19]
Personal life
Mirren married American director
Taylor Hackford
(her
partner
since 1986) on 31 December 1997, his 53rd birthday. The
ceremony took place at the Ardersier Parish Church near Inverness in
the
Scottish Highlands . [20]
The couple had met on the set of
White Nights . It is her first marriage, and his third (he has
two children from his previous marriages). Mirren has no children and
says she has "no maternal instinct whatsoever." [21]
In the August 2011 issue of
Esquire magazine, Mirren said, "I am quite spiritual. I believed in
fairies when I was a child. I still do sort of believe in the fairies.
And the leprechauns. But I don't believe in God." [22]
Mirren's autobiography,
In the
Frame: My Life in Words and Pictures , was published in the UK by
Weidenfeld and Nicolson
in September 2007. Reviewing for
The Stage , John Thaxter wrote: "Sumptuously illustrated, at
first sight it looks like another of those photo albums of the stars.
But between the pictures there are almost 200 pages of densely printed
text, an unusually frank story of her private and professional life,
mainly in the theatre, the words clearly Mirren's own, delivered with
forthright candour." [23]
In 1990, Mirren stated in an
interview that she is an
atheist . [24]
In a
GQ
interview in 2008, Mirren stated she had been
date raped
as a student and had often taken
cocaine
at parties during the 1980s. [25] [26]
She stopped using the drug after reading that
Klaus Barbie
made a living from cocaine dealing. [25] [26] [27] [28]
On 11 May 2010, Mirren attended
the unveiling of her waxwork at
Madame Tussauds London . The figure reportedly cost £150,000 to
make and took four months to complete. [29]

"Sometimes
I feel like a farmer during a war, someone who doesn't know very much
about it and carries on digging, hoping for rain. But just the last
few days I've had this terrible feeling of... doom. It's a, er,
biblical , kind of
Old Testament
feeling. I'm an atheist, but I was suddenly thinking
of those stories of the flood and punishment. Because we've become
unbelievably greedy and destructive." Helen Mirren interviewed by
