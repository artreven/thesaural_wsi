Movies About Writers

I'm looking to develop a comprehensive list of movies about writers. I have a pretty good list that includes the likes of 'Wonder Boys', 'The Hours', 'Mrs. Parker', 'Capote' and the like. However, I know there are many small indie films that fly under the radar every year, some probably about writers. Even if you think I already have it on my list - tell me your favorite movies about writers. Thanks!

Great suggestions - several of these weren't on my list. 'Hunger' is a great catch, thanks. Movies about real flesh and blood writers such as 'Capote' would be appreciated as well. posted by

Nora
is about the early days of the relationship between James Joyce and his partner Nora Barnacle.
It's not a particularly
great
movie, but it's enjoyable if you are a Joyce fan and/or inclined to enjoy sex scenes involving Ewen McGregor. posted by

Some of my favorites:
Total Ecplise : about the 19th cent French poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud.
Carrington : primarily about the painter Dora Carrington, but also about the writer Lytton Strachey and the Bloomsbury Group.
The Pillow Book :
Told through passages and stories from the author Sei Shōnagon.
Very much about
writing .
Naked Lunch : About William S. Burroughs in as much as his book was sorta autobiographical. posted by

You don't specify if you are looking for movies about real writers or fictitious writers.
I came in to suggest Shadowlands, about C. S. Lewis, but will also mention
DeathTrap
which is about fictitious screenwriters. posted by

I don't know if I'd call them my favorites, but if you're looking to add to the list:
Iris
- Bio-pic about novelist Iris Murdoch, but less about her writing than about her late struggles with Alzheimer's.
Adaptation
- A weirdly fictionalized account about Charlie Kaufman's adaptation of Susan Orlean's real non-fiction book
The Orchid Thief .
Little Women
- Tons of versions, out there, but (like the book) most are semi-autobiographical Louisa May Alcott accounts of trying to make it as a young, female writer, no? posted by

Alan Resnais' 1977 film
Providence
stars an amazing John Gielgud as a dying novelist remembering his family and characters, and confusing the two. Dreamlike and autumnal.
Jeff Bridges plays a dime novelist roped into acting in oaters when he moves to 1920s Hollywood in
Hearts of the West
(1975.
Michael Caine plays a
pulp
(1972) novelist. The film reunited him with director Mike Hodges. They made the classic Get Carter (1970) together.
Nicholas Cage plays a screenwriter with a bit of a drinking problem in Leaving Las Vegas. posted by

Surprised not to see
The Third Man
in the thread already, so I came in to mention it. Definitely one of my favorite movies. It follows a writer (played by Joseph Cotten) trying to piece together what happened to his friend Harry (Orson Welles) in post-WW2 Vienna.
The Third Man
was written by Graham Greene, who wrote a few other works with writers as protagonists.
The End of the Affair
is about a novelist/is based on events in Greene's own life and was produced twice as a movie.
I've seen the 1999 Neil Jordan adaptation which made some interesting changes (but I still prefer the novel overall). posted by
