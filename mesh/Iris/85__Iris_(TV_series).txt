If you asked me,who is inspire me in my life ?? I will answer, first God and the second is like in the picture,,do you know he??he is Choi Siwon ( 최시원 ) , he is one of member the most popular boyband in world (my opinion ^^ )  , SUPER JUNIOR ( 슈퍼주니어 ) and until now,,i am still be an ELF and Siwonest..
Here some information about Siwon..
Choi Si-won
(born February 10, 1987), often known simply as
Siwon , is a
South Korean
singer and actor. He is best known as a member of the
K-pop
boy band
Super Junior
and its subgroup
Super Junior-M . He is also one of the first four Korean artists to be on Chinese postage stamps.
Career
Early beginnings
Siwon was scouted by a talent agent from
SM Entertainment
when he was 16 as he was waiting for friends in front of his high school. The agent recommended him to audition for the company’s
Starlight Casting System
to become an entertainer. Siwon knew his parents would object, so he had to secretly audition. Siwon’s parents were later notified that he had passed the auditions. Although his parents allowed him to sign a contract with SM Entertainment, they did not give him any help because they wanted him to take responsibility in his actions.
He later moved into dormitories with fellow trainees and was trained in areas of singing, acting, and dancing. SM Entertainment saw potential for him in acting, and thus gave him training in the field. He made his first appearance in a music video of
The Grace ‘s
Dana
when he was still a solo singer in 2003. A year after, Choi made a brief appearance in the short drama,
Precious Family . In 2005, Siwon made a brief appearance in the KBS drama
Eighteen, Twenty-Nine
as the young Kang Bong-man.
Music career
Not long after Choi’s first television appearance, SM Entertainment released an announcement that he would officially debut as one of the twelve members in a boy band. This band later became officially known as Super Junior 05, the first generation of the rotational music group Super Junior. A few months before the debut of Super Junior 05, Choi made his first official media appearance with band mate
Han Geng
as one of the runway models in a fashion show by Bum Suk.
Super Junior 05 officially debuted on November 6, 2005 on
SBS ‘s music program
Popular Songs , performing their first single, “ TWINS (Knock Out) “. Their debut performance attracted over 500 fans and also garnered oversea viewers from both China and Japan. A full studio album was released a month later, which debuted at #3 on the monthly MIAK K-pop album charts.
In March 2006, SM Entertainment began to recruit new members for the next Super Junior generation. However, plans changed when the company added in a thirteenth member and the company declared a halt in forming future Super Junior generations. The group dropped the suffix “05” and became officially credited as Super Junior. The re-polished group hit big after they released their first CD single “ U ” the following summer, which became Super Junior’s most successful single in the music charts until the release of “ Sorry, Sorry ” in March 2009.
In late 2007, Choi was put into
Super Junior-M , the Chinese subgroup version of Super Junior. Super Junior-M is the first international music group in the Chinese music industry to have members of both
Chinese
and
Korean
descent, and brought an influence in the mainland music industry to produce multi-national music groups. The subgroup specializes in singing Mandarin songs, including versions of Super Junior’s Korean songs, bringing the K-pop influence over to the Chinese music industry. Super Junior-M is the first international music group in the Chinese music industry to have members of both Chinese and Korean descent. Not long after Super Junior-M’s debut, they became one of the most celebrated boy-bands in China. The band’s popularity skyrocketed further after their highly anticipated Mini-album, “Super Girl” was released on September 2009.Super Junior-M debuted in China on April 8, 2008 at the 8th Annual Music Chart Awards with the release of their first single music video, “ U “. The subgroup released their first Chinese-language studio album,
Me , on May 2, 2008 to critical success. The album debuted on
Taiwan ‘s G-music combo charts as #2 and #1 on many of China’s and Thailand’s music charts.Choi also appeared in
Girl’s Generation
music video “ Hoot “.
Acting career
After Choi’s appearances in
Eighteen, Twenty-Nine
and
Precious Family , he was casted in a larger role for the mini-series
Spring Waltz , playing the supporting role Park Sang-woo, the teenage cousin of a diligent and working young woman. Not long after Choi’s musical debut, he was casted in a large supporting role in the Hong Kong
epic film
A Battle of Wits
as Prince Liang Shi, starring opposite
Andy Lau . The cast promoted the movie throughout China with a short tour of four cities in November 2006.While the film received mixed reviews, Choi garnered positive notices for his performance. He also received praises from co-star Lau, stating that Choi is a wonderful actor and that he sets a good example for young Hong Kong idols.
Half a year after the release of
A Battle of Wits , Choi starred in the high school mystery/comedy film
Attack on the Pin-Up Boys
with other Super Junior members. He played one of the lead roles as a controlling and severe class president who was one of the popular possible subjects of being attacked by mysterious forces. Despite positive critical ratings, that film did not do well in the box-office, but all four versions of the film’s DVD were all sold out and broke chart records. A few months later, Choi was cast in mini-drama
Legend of Hyang Dan
as the lead role, Lee Mong-ryong.
In January 2010, Choi starred in the SBS drama
Oh My Lady! . It is a romantic comedy about a top star who finds himself living with his manager, a 35 year old woman who is trying to earn money to have custody of her child. This was Choi’s first lead role in two years. He also starred as Agent Kim Jun-Ho, a data analyst and rookie elite agent in the drama
Athena , a spin-off of drama
Iris . Both roles portrayed by him earned highly positive praises from critics, senior actors, and fans alike. There is speculation in whether the series will be reintroduced in a second season, with Choi playing a much larger role.
His acting career also extends into various music videos for fellow label mates, such as SNSD’s Hoot, and Zhang Liyin and TVXQ’s Xiah’s duet
Timeless (Zhang Liyin song) , where Choi starred along with fellow Super Junior member
Han Geng , which received critical praise. Choi also made appearances in several commercial films, as well as guest appearing or hosting TV shows.
Choi is scheduled in April 2011 to film
Taiwanese drama
Extravagant Challenge
( Chinese : 華麗的挑戰) with
Ivy Chen
and fellow band member
Donghae
as the three main characters. It is a live-action adaptation of
Japanese
shōjo
manga
Skip Beat!
by
Yoshiki Nakamura
to be shot in Taiwan.
On August 1, Choi has been confirmed to be the male lead character in a new KBS drama Poseidon alongside Lee Siyoung and Lee Sungjae. In the drama, he is a part of the #9 Investigation Team, a maritime police unit. Much media attention was placed on Poseidon as it was South Korea’s first drama regarding the maritime police. Choi received praises from his fellow cast members as well as the production team for his commendable acting and friendly conduct on set. Poseidon was broadcasted on 19 October 2011 to 8 November 2011. Due to busy filming schedules that collide with Super Junior’s activites, it was decided that Choi will cease the latter during the duration of filming.
As a Model
Choi is best known for his “handsome appearance” and muscular physique. His looks have earned him spots on various idol “best” lists, such as being put at eleventh place in the show Idol Chart’s “Most Flawless Body” list. His body is often referred to as the best by his fellow Super Junior members and many fans, and he is sometimes called “sculpture man” because his body appears “perfectly chiseled out.” His fans also comically refer to his abdominal muscles frequently as “chocolate abs.” He is also the tallest among Super Junior members along with
Zhou Mi
from Super Junior-M, standing approximately 183 centimeters tall.
Super Junior’s leader
Leeteuk
jokingly mentioned in an episode of SBS’s show
Strong Heart (Korean TV show)
that Choi is purposely placed in the middle in most Super Junior photos because “putting him in the middle gives the illusion that all members of the group are really handsome.” It was also mentioned that he usually sings the first verse to their songs so that the audience would see an “appealing visual.” Apart from acting and Super Junior, Choi has also appeared in various catalogs and commercials. He modeled along with
Sulli
of girl group

André Kim
fashion show, receiving much praise and media attention. He has also been featured in notable magazines such as Cosmopolitan, Elle, High Cut, and Men’s Health, as well as modeling for large brand names such as Armani, Lacoste, Gucci,Evisu,Burberry and several others. Choi also makes several prominent appearances in Korean brand Spao’s catalogues along with SNSD and other Super Junior members. He also recently endorsed and modeled for the SK Telesys “Reaction” smart phone, also appearing in the phone’s comical mock-action commercial, as well as Acer products. In September 2011 Choi became the first male model to endorse skincare brand Mamonde.
Personal life
Choi has one younger sister. His father is currently the
CEO
of a
pharmaceutical company .His family’s background has led him to be featured at the third spot in Idol Chart’s Royalty in the Korean Idol World list. Before his debut with Super Junior, Choi stayed in

exchange student
for three months in 2004. He graduated from Gu Jeong High School in February 2006 and later went on to attend

Han Geng , whom has supported him during his stay in China.
Choi is a devout
Protestant Christian , and has said in an interview that after his career, he would like to become a missionary. [ He is also a
