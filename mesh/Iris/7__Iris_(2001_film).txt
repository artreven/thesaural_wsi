Help me break me

My girlfriend has suggested that I might be overdue for a no-holds-barred sob destruction and I think I agree.
But I'm having a hard time overcoming my disinclination towards that degree of vulnerability, so I've decided to mount an attack based on system overload.
Do you have suggestions of specific pieces of media (video clips/songs/short poems/etc) that make you tear up every time?
They don't necessarily have to be sad; the reconciliation at the end of An American Tail is definitely on my list.
Ideally they will be short-duration and high-poignancy, preferably that can be easily amassed and arranged through internet links.
My hope is that if I'm already on the edge (which seems to be more and more frequent), I can use this awful mix tape to push me over.

Huh. It's not short, but the end of the book 'Where the Red Fern Grows' (by Wilson Rawsl made me cry longer and harder than anything I have ever seen or read. My family listened to the book on tape on a car ride when I was....maybe 12-14. All of us were crying, even my dad and I, who are usually pretty stoic.
It has been made into two movies, but I haven't seen either one, so I can't comment on their ability to produce tears.
This one is totally macho-lame, but here it is anyway. The end of Braveheart, where Robert the Bruce implores the rag-tag army of Scottish rebels to 'now bleed with me', always put a lump in my throat. posted by

OH OH OH the very end of
Six Feet Under , but you'll need to have watched the rest of it. I always loved this poem:
Quarantine
Eavan Boland
In the worst hour of the worst season
of the worst year of a whole people
a man set out from the workhouse with his wife.
He was walking-they were both walking-north.
She was sick with famine fever and could not keep up.
He lifted her and put her on his back.
He walked like that west and north.
Until at nightfall under freezing stars they arrived.
In the morning they were both found dead.
Of cold. Of hunger. Of the toxins of a whole history.
But her feet were held against his breastbone.
The last heat of his flesh was his last gift to her.
Let no love poem ever come to this threshold.
There is no place here for the inexact
praise of the easy graces and sensuality of the body.
There is only time for this merciless inventory:
Their death together in the winter of 1847.
Also what they suffered. How they lived.
And what there is between a man and a woman.
And in which darkness it can best be proved. posted by

I want to second the end of Star Trek II. DESTROYS ME INTO A PUDDLE.
In that vein, this also makes me a sobbing wreck.
---
"Remember"
REMEMBER me when I am gone away,
Gone far away into the silent land;
When you can no more hold me by the hand,
Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.
Remember me when no more day by day
You tell me of our future that you plann'd:
Only remember me; you understand
It will be late to counsel then or pray.
Yet if you should forget me for a while
And afterwards remember, do not grieve:
For if the darkness and corruption leave
A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,
Better by far you should forget and smile
Than that you should remember and be sad.

where all the survivors themselves, accompanied by the actors who played them, come up two by two to leave a stone on Oskar Schindler's headstone and then someone (psst: It's Liam Neeson himself) leaves a rose as well.

Nthing Christian the Lion. Holy crap. I remember that I loved the movie The Little Princess but I think I only saw it once. I was hesitant to put WALL-E because I can't explain why that movie makes me cry but it does.
There was an episode of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition that took place in Buffalo, NY - that's where I'm from but I thought it was just amazing. The mother is an immigrant from I think the Dominican Republic who struggled to buy a house for her family. She goes to city hall to get permits to do some upgrades when she finds out that it's condemned and scheduled to be knocked down. She has five kids and one of them wants to be an architect one day so he can build a wonderful house for his mom.
What was incredible about this episode is that usually there are people who volunteer to help with the build but in Buffalo, hundreds of people showed up to help. They ended up doing projects all over the neighborhood because they had so many people to help. I loved it and I saw my husband crying during it too. posted by

Honest question for you: What pieces of media currently make you emotional, if any? Is there a particular movie or scene that kinda puts you in the mood? Knowing that might help people point you to similar but more intense examples of what you're looking.
Also, is there a particular type of media that impacts you? Books don't well up a whole lot of emotion, but movies, especially in a movie theatre? Something about that space can make more prone to being moved emotionally, so what does that for you? posted by

Is there a particular kind of stress you're facing, or is it more a low-level crankiness?

I have read LOTR approximately once a month for my entire life since I was twelve. That is two hundred and fifty two times. And there are lots of bits that still make me cry.
But the below quote makes me tear up without fail. I am trying not to cry with emotion sitting at my desk at work just copy and pasting the words. If you've not read the books it may not work, but if you haven't read the books you should so you can cry at the rest of them.
And in that very moment, away behind in some courtyard of the city, a cock crowed. shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of war nor of wizardry, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn.
And as if in answer there came from far away another note. Horns, horns horns, in dark mindolluins sides they dimly echoed. great horns of the north wildly blowing. Rohan had come at last. posted by

The anime Clannad. It's a two season show. The first season and a half is about two high school students who fall in love, get married, and live their young lives.
[SPOILER] And then the
wife dies giving birth . Father becomes depressed, gives up daughter to in laws. Father gets better,
reconnects with daughter .
Daughter dies from same disease that killed wife.
[/SPOILER]
I don't know how sad these scenes are out of context. All I know, is that after watching a whole season and a half worth of happy times, the constant emotional blows that kept on hitting me afterward left me deliriously teary-eyed. posted by

If you can see 127 Hours, there's a scene near the end where he's picturing his unborn-haven't-even-met-the-mom son and they play
this song
during it. He'd been stuck already for a really long time but seeing his son gave him the motivation to do what he had to do to get out. I actually really dug that movie and felt like crying at the end - I couldn't watch all of The Scene but it was still really good.

A poem,
Distressed Haiku , by Donald Hall, on being unable to visit his wife's grave on their anniversary. I'm choking up just remembering it.
Up made me cry repeatedly throughout the film, at least four or five times, as did Wall-E. Big Fish absolutely destroys me, and since my dad passed away, I can't even think about it. The 25th Hour, at the end, where the father tell's his son that they can just keep driving, and the story he tells.
Augie Wren's
Christmas Story
at the end of Smoke (it's two parts, the first part told entirely by Harvey Keitel's character, then told silently in black and white, accompanied by Innocent While You Dream by Tom Waits). As Acton said, "Hey dad, wanna have a catch?"
For me, though, Pompoko, and here there be SPOILERS. The Heisei Tanuki war. It's a Ghibli movie, but not directed by Miyazaki. I've mentioned it in previous asks, but the movie, a fictionalized retelling of the decision to build housing in one of the largest remaining tanuki habitats (yes, they are real) is charming and cute, until they lose. They lose badly. And then, in the end, the surviving tanuki gather on a barren hillside, on some construction equipment, and try to dream their valley back to the way it was. As the valley slowly changes, the new residents of the modern condo buildings look out their windows, stunned, as the valley reverts to the way it was years before. What gets me, even as I'm typing this, is one woman recognizing her grandmother out in the fields. In the end, though, they fail, and they can't maintain the dream. Even the so-called 'happy' ending is totally soul-crushing to me.
Enjoy. Hope it works. Just typing this, and reading the thread has me fighting back a massive wall of tears. posted by

following in the methow's suggestion, I recently planned an elective ESL lesson where I introduced the students to The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein, and gave them only the text to work with to create their own images. Before setting them loose to draw, I read the story to them, outloud. I was surprised how difficult it was for me to read it, and I had to stop a couple times for a second here and there to keep from crying in front of the students. So, yeah, read it, and read it out loud. There's something about speaking the lines that makes it more real, that makes it hit harder. posted by
