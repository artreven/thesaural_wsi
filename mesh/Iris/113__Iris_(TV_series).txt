REPLY 1997: Seo In Guk and Jung Eun Ji
I love Reply 1997 and the two main leads! Their Busan accent is so cute!
Seo In Guk and Eun Ji took some photos together during break.
Eun Ji Won’s observation on Seo In Guk and Jung Eun Ji revealed on tvN’s Taxi.
Eun Ji Won said “It actually feels like there’s something going on between them in real life. Eun Ji’s face turned red when Seo In Guk held her hand.”
At first Seo In Guk denied it, but when MCs Lee Young Ja and Gong Hyung Jin kept asking, he said, “At first I didn’t feel anything special toward Eun Ji, but now that we’ve worked together for the drama I think something’s slowly building up inside me.” The MCs then pushed for a live phone call between the two.
Seo In Guk called Jung Eun Ji and asked, “Where are you? I’m done filming. If you’re done, let’s meet up,” but Jung Eun Ji answered, “No, I don’t have any makeup on right now. We can’t meet.”
The MCs then took over the call, asking, “Seo In Guk says he likes you, what do you think” to which Jung Eun Ji said firmly, “I don’t feel anything more than that he’s a good colleague.”
About Seo In Guk’s ‘I love you’ message, she said, “It’s so pressuring because he says things like that so often.”
It appears Seo In Guk will have to settle for his fictional relationship with Jung Eun Ji as the two will be appearing as a couple in  Reply 1997 .
Although Seo In Guk got rejected, it’s okay! maybe next time! haha..the good thing is, they’re still good friends and they look so cute together!
:)
I made an FMV a few weeks ago for our Reply 1997 couple! Enjoy watching and please do SUBSCRIBE!

He sacrificed his well being for his girlfriend only to be dumped by her for another man. Then, he sets off to take revenge on her with the help of his best friend. He approaches Seo Eun Gi (Moon Chae Won), the daughter of the chaebol group executive who lost her memory in order to execute his revenge.
Bridal Mask
This series is based on the popular manhwa, “Gaksital” tells a story of two brothers, Lee Kang To (Joo Won) and Lee Kang San (Shin Hyun Joon) who live in Seoul in the 1930’s, oppressed under the Japanese rule.

Tae San (Kim Soo Ro)chose exercise but keeps smelling other people in the gym to see if they had any cigarettes. If he can’t have any, they can’t either. Yoon (Kim Min Jong) chose snacking but ate a wafer roll and treated it like a cigar. Jung Rok (Lee Jong Hyuk) chose intimate sex but it never went well.
