Who is Kate Elizabeth Winslet?
The Entertainmnet  world knows her as Kate Winslet, she is an English
actress and occasional singer. She has received multiple awards and
nominations. She is the youngest person to accrue six
Academy
Award
nominations, and won the
Academy Award for Best Actress
for
The Reader
(2008). Winslet has
been acclaimed for both dramatic and comedic work in projects ranging
from
period
to contemporary films, and from
major
Hollywood
productions to less
publicised
indie films . She has won
awards from the
Screen Actors Guild ,
British Academy of
Film and Television Arts , and the
Hollywood Foreign Press
Association
among others, and has been nominated for an
Emmy
Award
for television acting.
Winslet was born 5 October 1975, she was aised in
Berkshire , Winslet studied drama from childhood,
and began her career in British television in 1991. She made her film
debut in
Heavenly Creatures
(1994), for which
she received her first notable critical praise. She achieved recognition
for her subsequent work in a supporting role in
Sense and Sensibility
(1995)
and for her leading role in
Titanic
(1997) , the highest grossing
film for more than 12 years until 2010.
Since 2000, Winslet's performances have continued to draw positive
comments from film critics, and she has been nominated for various
awards for her work in such films as
Quills
(2000) ,
Iris
(2001) ,
Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind
(2004) ,
Finding Neverland
(2004),
Little Children
(2006),
The Reader
(2008)
and
Revolutionary Road
(2008) . Her
performance in the latter prompted
New York
magazine to describe her
as "the best English-speaking film actress of her generation".
The romantic comedy
The
Holiday
and the animated film
Flushed
Away
(both 2006) were among the biggest commercial successes of
her career.
Winslet was awarded a
Grammy
Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children
in 2000. She has been
included as a vocalist on some
soundtracks
of works she has performed in, and the single " What If "
from the soundtrack for
Christmas Carol: The Movie
(2001), was a hit single in several European countries. Winslet has a
daughter with her former husband,
Jim Threapleton , and a son with her current husband,
Sam
Mendes , from whom she is separated. She lives in New York City.
Early life Born in Reading,
Berkshire , Winslet is the daughter of Sally Anne
(née Bridges), a barmaid, and Roger John Winslet, a swimming-pool
contractor.
Her parents were "jobbing actors", which led Winslet to comment that
she "didn't have a privileged upbringing" and that their daily life was
"very hand to mouth".
Her maternal grandparents, Linda (née Plumb) and Archibald Oliver
Bridges, founded and operated the Reading Repertory Theatre,
and her uncle, Robert Bridges, appeared in the original
West End
production of
Oliver! .
Her sisters,
Beth
and
Anna
Winslet , are also
actresses .
Raised in an Anglican household, Winslet began studying
drama
at the
age of 11 at the
Redroofs Theatre School , a
co-educational
independent school
in
Maidenhead ,
Berkshire ,
where she was
head girl .
At the age of 12, Winslet appeared in a television advertisement
directed by filmmaker
Tim Pope
for
Sugar
Puffs
cereal. Pope said her naturalism was "there from the start".
Career   1991–1997 Winslet's career began on television, with a co-starring role in the
BBC
children's
science fiction
serial
Dark
Season .
This role was followed by appearances in the
made-for-TV movie
Anglo-Saxon Attitudes
in 1992, the
sitcom
Get Back
for
ITV
and an
episode of medical drama
Casualty
in 1993, also for the BBC.
Winslet at the
2006 Toronto
International Film Festival In 1992, Winslet attended a
casting call
for
Peter
Jackson 's
Heavenly Creatures
in London. Winslet auditioned for
the part of
Juliet Hulme , a teenager who assists in the
murder of the mother of her best friend,
Pauline Parker
(played by
Melanie Lynskey ). She won the role over 175 other girls.
The film included Winslet's singing debut, and her
a
cappella
version of "Sono Andata" , an
aria
from
La Bohème ,
was featured on the film's soundtrack.
The film was released to favourable reviews in 1994 and won Jackson and
partner
Fran Walsh
a nomination for an
Academy
Award for Best Original Screenplay .
Winslet was awarded an
Empire Award
and a
London Film Critics Circle Award for
British Actress of the Year
for her performance.
The Washington Post
writer
Desson Thomson
commented: "As Juliet, Winslet is a
bright-eyed ball of fire, lighting up every scene she’s in. She's offset
perfectly by Lynskey, whose quietly smoldering Pauline completes the
delicate, dangerous partnership."
Speaking about her experience on a
film set
as an absolute beginner, Winslet noted:
"With
Heavenly Creatures , all I knew I had to do was completely
become that person. In a way it was quite nice doing [the film] and not
knowing a bloody thing."
The following year, Winslet auditioned for the small but pivotal role
of Lucy Steele in the adaptation of
Jane
Austen 's
Sense and Sensibility ,
featuring
Emma Thompson ,
Hugh
Grant , and
Alan Rickman .
She was instead cast in the second leading role of
Marianne Dashwood
Director
Ang
Lee
admitted he was initially worried about the way Winslet had
attacked her role in
Heavenly Creatures
and thus required her to
exercise
tai chi , read Austen-era
Gothic novels
and poetry, and work with a
piano
teacher to fit the grace of the role.Budgeted at
US$ 16.5 million ($23.6 million in current year
dollars) the film became a financial and critical success, resulting in a
worldwide box office total of
US$ 135
million ($192.7 million) and various awards for Winslet, winning her
both a
BAFTA
and a
Screen Actors Guild Award , and
nominations for both an
Academy
Award
and a
Golden Globe .
In 1996, Winslet starred in both
Jude
and
Hamlet . In
Michael Winterbottom 's
Jude , based on the
Victorian novel
Jude the Obscure
by
Thomas
Hardy , she played Sue Bridehead, a young woman with suffragette
leanings who falls in love with her cousin, played by
Christopher Eccleston . Acclaimed among
critics, it was not a success at the box office, barely grossing
US$ 2
million ($2.8 million) worldwide.
Richard Corliss of
Time
magazine
said "Winslet is worthy of [...]
the camera's scrupulous adoration. She's perfect, a modernist ahead of
her time [...] and
Jude
is a handsome showcase for her gifts."
Winslet played
Ophelia , Hamlet's
drowned lover, in
Kenneth Branagh 's all star-cast
film version
of
William Shakespeare 's
Hamlet .
The film garnered largely positive reviews and earned Winslet her
second
Empire Award .
In mid-1996, Winslet began filming
James
Cameron 's
Titanic
(1997), alongside
Leonardo DiCaprio .Cast as the sensitive seventeen-year-old
Rose DeWitt Bukater , a fictional
first-class socialite who survives the 1912 sinking of the
RMS
Titanic ,
Winslet's experience was emotionally demanding.
" Titanic
was totally different and nothing could have prepared
me for it. We were really scared about the whole adventure. Jim
[Cameron] is a perfectionist, a real genius at making movies. But there
was all this bad press before it came out, and that was really
upsetting."
Against expectations, the film went on to become the highest-grossing
film of all time, grossing more than
US$ 1.843 billion ($2.6 billion) in box-office
receipts worldwide,
and transformed Winslet into a commercial movie star.
Subsequently, she was nominated for most of the high-profile awards,
winning a
European Film Award .
1998–2003 Shot prior to the release of
Titanic ,
Hideous Kinky ,
a low-budget
hippie
romance, was Winslet's sole film of 1998.
Winslet had rejected offers to play the leading roles in
Shakespeare in Love
(1998) and
Anna and the King
(1999) in favour of the role of a
young English mother named Julia who moves with her daughters from
London to
Morocco
hoping to start a new life.
The film garnered generally mixed reviews and received only limited
distribution,
resulting in a worldwide gross of
US$ 5
million ($6.5 million).
Despite the success of
Titanic , the next film Winslet opted to
star in was
Holy Smoke!
(1999) , featuring
Harvey
Keitel , another low-budget project—much to the chagrin of her
agents, who felt "miserable" about her preference of
arthouse
movies.
Feeling pressured, Winslet has said she "never saw
Titanic
as a
springboard for bigger films or bigger pay cheques", knowing that "it
could have been that, but would have destroyed [her]."
The same year, she voiced Brigid in the
computer animated
film
Faeries .
In 2000, Winslet appeared in the
period
piece
Quills
with
Geoffrey
Rush
and
Joaquin Phoenix , a film inspired by the life
and work of the
Marquis de Sade . The actress served as
somewhat of a " patron saint " of the film for being the first
big name to back it, accepting the role of a
chambermaid
in the
asylum
and the
courier
of The Marquis' manuscripts to the underground publishers.
Well-received by critics, the film garnered numerous accolades for
Winslet, including nominations for
SAG
and
Satellite Awards .
The film was a modest arthouse success, averaging
US$ 27,709
($35,004) per screen its debut weekend, and eventually grossing US$18
million ($22.7 million) internationally.
In 2001's
Enigma ,
Winslet played a young woman who finds
herself falling for a brilliant young
World
War II
code breaker, played by
Dougray
Scott .
It was her first
war film , and Winslet regarded "making
Enigma
a brilliant experience" as she was five months pregnant at the time of
the shoot, forcing some tricky camera work from the director
Michael
Apted .
Generally well-received,
Winslet was awarded a
British Independent Film Award
for her performance,
and A. O. Scott of
The New York Times
described Winslet as "more
crush-worthy than ever."
In the same year she appeared in
Richard
Eyre 's critically acclaimed film
Iris ,
portraying Irish novelist
Iris
Murdoch . Winslet shared her role with
Judi
Dench , with both actresses portraying Murdoch at different phases of
her life.
Subsequently, each of them was nominated for an
Academy
Award
the following year, earning Winslet her third nomination.
Also in 2001, she voiced the character Belle in the animated motion
picture
Christmas Carol: The Movie ,
based on the
Charles Dickens
classic novel . For the film, Winslet recorded the song " What If " , which was released in
November 2001 as a
single
with proceeds donated to two of Winslet's favourite charities, the
National
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
and the Sargeant
Cancer Foundation for Children.
A Europe-wide top ten hit, it reached number one in Austria, Belgium,
and Ireland,
number six on the
UK Singles Chart ,
and won the 2002
OGAE Song Contest .
Her next film role was in the 2003 drama
The Life of David Gale , in which she played
an ambitious journalist who interviews a
death-sentenced
professor, played by
Kevin
Spacey , in his final weeks before
execution . The film underperformed at international box
offices, garnering only half of its US$ 50,000,000 budget,
and generating mostly critical reviews,
with
Roger Ebert
of the
Chicago Sun-Times
calling it a "silly movie."
2004–2006 Following
The Life of David Gale , Winslet appeared alongside
Jim
Carrey
in
Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind
(2004), a
neosurrealistic
indie-drama
by French director
Michel
Gondry . In the film, she played the role of Clementine Kruczynski, a
chatty, spontaneous and somewhat
neurotic
woman, who decides to have all memories of her ex-boyfriend erased from
her mind.
The role was a departure from her previous roles, with Winslet
revealing in an interview with
Variety
that she was initially
upended about her casting in the film: "This was not the type of thing I
was being offered [...] I was just thrilled that there was something he
had seen in me, in spite of the corsets, that he thought was going to
work for Clementine.”
The film was a critical and financial success.
Winslet received rave reviews for her
Academy
Award -nominated performance, which
Peter
Travers
of
Rolling Stone
described as "electrifying
and bruisingly vulnerable."
Winslet at the
61st British Academy Film
Awards . Her final film in 2004 was
Finding Neverland .
The story of the production
focused on Scottish writer
J.
M. Barrie
( Johnny Depp ) and his platonic relationship with
Sylvia Llewelyn Davies
(Winslet),
whose sons inspired him to pen the classic play
Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up . During
promotion of the film, Winslet noted of her portrayal "It was very
important for me in playing Sylvia that I was already a mother myself,
because I don’t think I could have played that part if I didn’t know
what it felt like to be a parent and have those responsibilities and
that amount of love that you give to a child [...] and I've always got a
baby somewhere, or both of them, all over my face."
The film received favourable reviews and proved to be an international
success, becoming Winslet's highest-grossing film since
Titanic
with a total of $118 million worldwide.
In 2005, Winslet appeared in an episode of BBC's comedy series
Extras
as a satirical version
of herself. While dressed as a nun, she was portrayed giving
phone
sex
tips to the romantically challenged character of Maggie .
Her performance in the episode led to her first nomination for an
Emmy
Award .
In
Romance &Cigarettes
(2005), a
musical
romantic comedy
written and directed by
John
Turturro , she played the character Tula, described by Winslet as "a
slut, someone who’s essentially foulmouthed and has bad manners and
really
doesn’t know how to dress."
Hand-picked by Turturro, who was impressed with her display of dancing
ability in
Holy Smoke! , Winslet was praised for her performance,
which included her interpretation of
Connie Francis 's "Scapricciatiello (Do You Love Me Like You
Kiss Me)".
Derek Elley of
Variety
wrote: "Onscreen less, but
blessed with the showiest role, filthiest one-liners, [and] a perfect
Lancashire
accent that's comical enough in the Gotham setting Winslet throws
herself into the role with an infectious gusto."
After declining an invitation to appear in
Woody
Allen 's film
Match Point
(2005), Winslet stated that she
wanted to be able to spend more time with her children.
She began 2006 with
All the King's Men ,
featuring
Sean Penn
and
Jude Law . Winslet played the role of Anne Stanton,
the childhood sweetheart of Jack Burden (Law). The film was critically
and financially unsuccessful.
Todd McCarthy of
Variety
summed it up as "overstuffed and
fatally miscast [...] Absent any point of engagement to become involved
in the characters, the film feels stillborn and is unlikely to stir
public excitement, even in an election year."
Winslet fared far better when she joined the cast of
Todd
Field 's
Little Children , playing Sarah
Pierce, a bored homemaker who has a torrid affair with a married
neighbour, played by
Patrick Wilson . Both her performance
and the film received rave reviews;
A.
O. Scott
of
The New York Times
wrote: "In too many recent movies
intelligence is woefully undervalued, and it is this quality—even more
than its considerable beauty—that distinguishes
Little Children
from its peers. The result is a movie that is challenging, accessible
and hard to stop thinking about. Ms. Winslet, as fine an actress as any
working in movies today, registers every flicker of Sarah’s pride,
self-doubt and desire, inspiring a mixture of recognition, pity and
concern that amounts, by the end of the movie, to something like love.
That Ms. Winslet is so lovable makes the deficit of love in Sarah’s life
all the more painful."
For her work in the film, she was honored with a Britannia Award for
British Artist of the Year from BAFTA/LA, a Los Angeles-based offshoot
of the
BAFTA Awards .
and nominated for an
Academy Award for Best Actress ,
and at 31, became the youngest actress to ever garner five Oscar
nominations.
She followed
Little Children
with a role in
Nancy
Meyers ' romantic comedy
The
Holiday , also starring
Cameron
Diaz , Jude Law, and
Jack
Black . In it she played Iris, a British woman who temporarily
exchanges homes
with an American woman (Diaz). Released to
a mixed reception by critics,
the film became Winslet's biggest commercial success in nine years,
grossing more than
US$ 205 million worldwide.
Also in 2006, Winslet provided her voice for several smaller projects.
In the CG-animated
Flushed
Away , she voiced Rita, a scavenging sewer rat who helps Roddy ( Hugh
Jackman ) escape from the city of Ratropolis and return to his
luxurious
Kensington
origins. A critical and commercial
success, the film collected
US$ 177,665,672 at international box
offices.
2007–present
Winslet at the
81st Academy Awards
in February 2009
In 2007, Winslet reunited with
Leonardo DiCaprio
to film
Revolutionary Road
(2008),
directed by her husband
Sam
Mendes . Winslet had suggested that both should work with her on a
film adaptation of the
1961 novel of the same name
by
Richard Yates
after reading the
script by
Justin Haythe .
Resulting in both "a blessing and an added pressure" on-set, the
reunion was her first experience working with Mendes.
Portraying a couple in a failing marriage in the 1950s, DiCaprio and
Winslet watched period videos promoting life in the suburbs to prepare
themselves for the film,
which earned them favorable reviews.
In his review of the film,
David Edelstein
of
New York magazine
stated that "[t]here isn’t a
banal moment in Winslet’s performance—not a gesture, not a word. Is
Winslet now the best English-speaking film actress of her generation? I
think so."
Winslet was awarded a
Golden
Globe Award for Best Actress
for her performance, her seventh
nomination from the
Golden Globes .
Also released in late 2008, the film competed against Winslet's other
project, a
film adaptation
of
Bernhard Schlink 's 1995 novel
The
Reader ,
directed by
Stephen Daldry
and featuring
Ralph
Fiennes
and
David Kross
in supporting roles. Originally the
first choice for her role, she was initially not able to take on the
role due to a scheduling conflict with
Revolutionary Road , and
Nicole
Kidman
replaced her.
A month after filming began, however, Kidman left the role due to her
pregnancy, enabling Winslet to rejoin the film.
Employing a German accent, Winslet portrayed a former
Nazi
concentration camp
guard who has an affair with a teenager (Kross) who, as an adult,
witnesses her
war crimes
trial.
She later said the role was difficult for her, as she was naturally
unable "to sympathise with an
SS
guard."
While the film garnered mixed reviews in general,
Winslet received favorable reviews for her performance.
The following year, she earned her sixth Academy Award nomination and
went on to win the
Best Actress
award, the
BAFTA Award for
Best Actress , a
Screen Actors Guild Award for
Outstanding Supporting Actress , and a
Golden
Globe for Best Supporting Actress .
Winslet is set to headline the
HBO
miniseries
Mildred
Pierce , a five-hour remake of the
1945 film of the same name , with
production slated to begin in April 2010.
She was cast in the
Steven Soderbergh
disaster film,
Contagion
which
is scheduled to film in the fall of 2010.
Personal life While on the set of
Dark
Season , Winslet met actor-writer Stephen Tredre, with whom she
had a nearly five-year relationship.
He died of
bone cancer
soon after
Winslet completed filming
Titanic , causing her to miss the film's
premiere in order to attend his funeral in London.
She and
Titanic
co-star
Leonardo DiCaprio
have remained good friends since the
filming. Winslet was later in a relationship with
Rufus
Sewell ,
but on 22 November 1998 she married director
Jim Threapleton , whom she met while on the set of
Hideous
Kinky .
They have a daughter, Mia Honey, who was born on 12 October 2000 in
London.Winslet and Threapleton divorced in
2001,
Winslet began a relationship with
Sam
Mendes , whom she married on 24 May 2003 on the island of
Anguilla
in the Caribbean.
Their son, Joe
Alfie Winslet Mendes, was born on 22 December 2003 in
New York City.
Mendes and Winslet announced a separation in March 2010, stating, "The
split is entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement."
Mendes and his production company, Neal Street Productions, purchased
the film rights to the long-delayed biography of circus tiger tamer
Mabel
Stark .
The couple's spokesperson said, "It's a great story, they have had
their eyes on it for a while. If they can get the script right, it would
make a great film."
The media have documented her weight fluctuations over the years.
Winslet has been outspoken about her refusal to allow
Hollywood
to dictate her weight.
In February 2003,
British GQ
magazine published photographs of Winslet
which had been digitally altered to make her look dramatically thinner
than she really was.
Winslet issued a statement that the alterations were made without her
consent, saying "I just didn't want people to think I was a hypocrite
and that I'd suddenly lost 30 lbs. or whatever".
GQ
subsequently issued an apology.
She won a libel suit in 2009 against British tabloid
The Daily Mail
after it printed that
she lied about her exercise regimen.
Winslet said she had always expressed the opinion that women should be
encouraged to accept their appearance with pride, and therefore "was
particularly upset to be accused of lying about my exercise regimen, and
felt that I had a responsibility to request an apology in order to
demonstrate my commitment to the views that I have always expressed
about body issues, including diet and exercise."
Winslet and Mendes live in
Greenwich Village
in New York City.
They also own a Grade II- listed
five-bedroom house, set in 22 acres in the village
of Church Westcote in
Gloucestershire , England. After purchasing the house for
£ 3 million, they have reportedly spent a further £1
million in renovations, as the house had fallen into disrepair after the
death of its former owner, the equestrian artist
Raoul
Millais
in 1999.
Mendes was scheduled to fly on
American Airlines Flight 77 ,
which was hijacked on 11 September 2001 and subsequently crashed into
the Pentagon.
In October 2001, Winslet was seven hours into a London-Dallas flight
with her daughter Mia when a passenger who claimed to be a
terrorist , later charged with creating mischief,
stood up and shouted "We are all going to die."
As a result of these incidents, Winslet and Mendes never fly together
on the same aircraft, as they fear leaving their children parentless.
Awards and nominations Winslet won an
Academy Award for Best Actress
for her performance in
The Reader
(2008). She won two
Golden Globe Awards
in the same year:
Best
Actress (Drama)
for
Revolutionary Road
and
Best
Supporting Actress
for
The Reader . She has won two
BAFTA Awards :
Best Actress
for
The Reader , and
Best
Supporting Actress
for
Sense and
Sensibility
(1995). She has earned a total of six
Academy
Award
nominations, seven Golden Globe nominations, and seven BAFTA
nominations.
She has received numerous awards from other organisations, including
the
Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting
Actress
for
Iris
(2001) and the
Screen Actors Guild Award for
Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role
for
Sense
and Sensibility
and
The Reader .
Premiere
magazine named her
portrayal of
Clementine Kruczynski
in
Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind
(2004) as the 81st greatest film performance of
all time.
Academy
Award nomination milestones Winslet was 26 when she received her third Academy Award nomination,
for
Iris , just missing the mark of
Natalie
Wood , who received her third nomination at age 25.
She set the mark as the youngest actor to receive five nominations, at
age 31, for
Little Children
(2006). She
surpassed
Bette Davis , who was 33 when she received her
fifth nomination for her performance in
The Little Foxes
(1941).
With her Best Actress nomination for
The Reader , Winslet became
the youngest actor to receive six Oscar nominations. At age 33, Winslet
passed the mark Davis, one year older, set with
Now,
Voyager
(1942).
Winslet received Academy Award nominations as the younger versions of
the characters played by fellow nominees
Gloria
Stuart , as Rose, in
Titanic
(1997)
and
Judi Dench , as Iris Murdoch, in
Iris .
These are the only instances of the younger and older versions of a
character in the same film both yielding Academy Award nominations.
When she was not nominated for her work in
Revolutionary Road ,
Winslet became only the second actress to win a Golden Globe for Best
Actress (Drama) without getting an Oscar nomination for the same
performance ( Shirley MacLaine
was the first for
Madame Sousatzka
[1988], and she won the Golden Globe
in a three-way tie). Academy rules allow an actor to receive no more
than one nomination in a given category; as the Academy nominating
process determined that Winslet's work in
The Reader
would be
considered a lead performance—unlike the Golden Globes, which considered
it a supporting performance—she could not also receive a Best Actress
nomination for
Revolutionary Road .
Awards for other work In 2000, Winslet won a
Grammy
Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children
for
Listen To the
Storyteller .
She was nominated for an
Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a
Comedy Series
for playing herself in a 2005 episode of
Extras .
