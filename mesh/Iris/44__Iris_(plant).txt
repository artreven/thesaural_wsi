The season of the paddy-rice
Weather peculiar to
East Asian rainy season
continues now in the Far East. Hydrangea
and
Iris . They give glory around the rice field. The clothes of the flowers are totally gorgeous like illumination. The season of the
rice
growing began in earnest. Even the
Emperor
plants rice. The
paddy-rice
is Japanese mind itself. Iris is flowers representing this time. It is the beauty of the moisture...

The sign of the summer
I take glow of the morning sun in the tea plantation. Only a farmer comes to the such remote place. It ranges on the south slope of the mountain. To the distance far-off as for the view. . . . Quiet a few minutes. . . The tea leaf harvested at this time is called the best quality, here. The
green tea
which you drink may be a Japanese product. It may taste delicate if so... Here is
Ureshino-shi ,
Saga Prefecture .

"Morning" Japanese calligraphy
" 朝 " (chō, or asa). It is translated as Morning, dynasty, etc. This character is written by Kanzi,
Regular script . Etymology :　Ideogrammic compound 艸

月
(sun) It expresses the state that the sun rises from the grassy plain (horizon). I feel it to have the effect that Morning Sun does a human being cheerfully. This character is shape which is good for it. The form is cool...

The ONE on the earth
Sometimes, I feel that Nature talks to me. Of course there cannot be such a thing. It is always silent. The gentle breeze of the spring... Clouds and the flower are blown away by it. The King of the flower in the Orient,
Peony (牡丹) . Male of animals 牡 (bo) 　 + 　Vermilion 丹 (tan) The people of the ancient times might have watched his figure. And they might have heard his voice... This kanji character is good for the King.　It is Graceful. 散りてのち　　おもかげに立つ　　牡丹かな 　与謝　蕪村　 (1716-1783) After you left... 　as it used to look 　so peony 　 Yosa Buson
(1716-1783)

Sunset Double Reflection
By chance, I stopped there. The surface of the river shined. The setting sun reflects it from the opposite direction. The single track of abolition close at hand. The unmanned station of the river side... The lines of weird cloud wrapped there up from the other side of the mountain. "The sunset train" It had arrived at the station where nobody was. And it disappeared somewhere...

"Birth and Vanish" Japanese calligraphy
" 生
滅
" (shō-metsu). It is translated as Birth and Vanish. This is a Buddhism term. Even the doctrine of the Zen is used. It is related with
Impermanence
of " Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra ". My hardship... Because I mistake the limited existence for permanent, it occurs. Even if do anything. 　Even if do nothing.　 Will get there... 「諸行無常 是生滅法 生滅滅已 寂滅爲樂」　涅槃経 「諸行は無常であってこれは生滅の法であり、生滅の法は苦である。 　この生と滅とを滅しおわって、生なく滅なきを寂滅とす。寂滅は即ち涅槃、是れ楽なり。」
