History [ edit ]
2005–2006: Big Bang debut Main article:
Big Bang (Korean band) Prior to his involvement with YG Entertainment, Choi was an underground rapper and a childhood friend of
G-Dragon , another member of Big Bang. [2]
G-Dragon stated that the two were "neighborhood friend[s] from middle school" and would often dance and rap together. [3]
Although G-Dragon later moved away and the two "became distant", he
contacted Choi again when YG Entertainment was scouting for candidates
to create a boy band. [3]
The pair recorded several demos and sent them to
Yang Hyun Suk , CEO of YG Entertainment, who later asked Choi to audition. [2]
Choi was initially rejected by the record label, which deemed him too "chubby" to fit the "idealistic version" of an idol. [2]
Choi later stated that he "went home and exercised really hard because I wanted to join YG Entertainment." [2]
Six months later, he returned for another audition and was signed on. He reportedly lost 20 kg in 40 days. [2]
Choosing the stage name of T.O.P. (Korean: 탑), he became one of the
two rappers in the group Big Bang, alongside G-Dragon. The two were
paired with four others:
Taeyang ,
Daesung ,
Seungri
and So-1; a documentation of their training was aired to promote them. [4]
So-1 was dropped by the record label, and Big Bang made its official debut with five members. [5]
Their first album,
Since 2007 ,
was a fair success, [6]
and included T.O.P.'s first solo song "Big Boy." The group achieved
mainstream success with the release of the song "Lie" (Korean: 거짓말;
Revised Romanization :
Geojitmal ) from their 2007 mini-album
Always , which topped several charts upon its release. The singles, "Last Farewell" (Korean: 마지막 인사; Revised Romanization:
Majimak Insa ) from the mini-album
Hot Issue
and "Day by Day" (Korean: 하루하루; Revised Romanization:
Haru Haru ) from
Stand Up , became chart-toppers as well. [7] [8]

2007–present: Solo development Following the release of the band's albums and singles, T.O.P. began
working on his solo career. In April 2007, he was featured with fellow
Big Bang members Taeyang and G-Dragon on singer
Lexy 's single "Super Fly" for her album
Rush . Later that summer, he appeared as an actor in Red Roc’s "Hello" music video. [9]
He later became the first member of Big Bang to venture into acting, starring in the
KBS2
drama,
I Am Sam , . [1]
portraying the school's top fighter, Chae Musin. He also took the role of MC of
MBC 's
Music Core
on November 10, 2007, only to resign in April of the following year. In 2008, he collaborated with
R&B
artist
Gummy
on the song "I'm Sorry" for her album
Comfort , and later with singer
Uhm Jung Hwa
for her single "D.I.S.C.O." That same year, he was also admitted to
Dankook University , to the theater department. [10]
T.O.P later put his solo career on hold while he joined his group for
their promotional activities. After more than a year of promoting Big
Bang's materials, he returned to acting, playing the assassin Vick in
the critically acclaimed [11]
Korean television drama
Iris . [12]
T.O.P. also recorded the song "Hallelujah" for the drama's soundtrack with Taeyang and G-Dragon. Following
Iris , T.O.P. and Seungri appeared in the teenage suspense drama,
My 19 . [13]
T.O.P appeared in the movie
71: Into the Fire
which released in June 2010. He received many good critics and praise
for his acting; the movie hit 1 million views in a week, making it the
first movie of 2010 to reach that number of views in South Korea. [14]
He is also in preparation for his solo debut. [15]
During Big Bang's Big Show concert in January 2010, T.O.P. performed his new single "Turn It Up."
YG Entertainment
released a music video teaser for "Turn It Up" on June 14, 2010 which
revealed the release date for the full music video to be June 21, 2010.
The teaser itself received over 200,000 views within 48 hours of its
original posting on
YouTube . The official music video was released at noon in South Korea, with over 1,000,000 views and comments in just a few minutes. [16]
He is also the first Korean artist to have his song release worldwide
on iTunes. On 29 October 2010, he won the Hallyu Popularity Award in the
47th Grand Bell Film Awards. [17]
In November 2010, YG Entertainment announced T.O.P and bandmate
G-Dragon
would release a collaboration album. [18]
Preceding the release of the album, the duo held a world-wide premiere
showcase for their album at Times Square in Yeongdeungpo of
Seoul, South Korea , [19]
which was also broad-casted live on
YouTube . [20]
To promote their album, the duo released three singles: "High High," "Oh Yeah," and "Knock out." [21]
All three singles preceded the release of the album. The singles were commercial successes: "High High" was a chart topper [22]
while "Oh Yeah" and "Knock Out" both peaked at #2 and #3 respectively. [23] [24]
The album was released on
