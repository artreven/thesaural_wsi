She starred opposite Richard Briers in the BBC situation comedy
Ever Decreasing Circles . She has also appeared in
Doctor Who , and in the period drama
Downton Abbey . She has twice won the Critics' Circle Theatre Award.
Early life and career
Penelope Alice Wilton was born in Scarborough, North Riding of Yorkshire, the daughter of Alice Travers, a tap dancer and former actress, and Clifford William Wilton, a businessman. She is a niece of actors Bill Travers and Linden Travers and a cousin of the actor Richard Morant. Her maternal grandparents owned theatres. She and her sisters, Rosemary and Linda, attended the convent school in Newcastle upon Tyne, at which their mother had previously taught. She attended the Drama Centre London.
Wilton had a successful stage career before transitioning into television acting, and her West End debut was opposite Sir Ralph Richardson. She played Ruth in the original 1974 London stage production of Alan Ayckbourn's
Norman Conquests
trilogy.Her television acting career began in 1972, playing Vivie Warren in
Mrs. Warren's Profession
opposite Robert Powell. She then had several major TV roles, including two of the BBC Television Shakespeare productions (as Desdemona in
Othello
and Regan in
King Lear
).
Wilton's film career includes roles in
The French Lieutenant's Woman
(1981),
Cry Freedom
(1987),
Iris
(2001),
Calendar Girls
(2003) and
Shaun of the Dead
(2004), Jane Austen's
Pride and Prejudice
(2005), in Woody Allen's film
Match Point
(2005) and in
The History Boys
(2006).
However she did not become a household name until she appeared with Richard Briers in the 1984 BBC situation comedy,
Ever Decreasing Circles , which ran for five years. She played Ann, long suffering wife of Martin (Briers), an obsessive pedant 'do-gooder'. Throughout the run, Ann seeks a more adventurous lifestyle than that offered as a pillar of the community, and mildly flirts with their considerably more charismatic neighbour Paul (Peter Egan) but ultimately she remains faithful to Martin.
In 2005, Wilton guest starred as Harriet Jones for two episodes in the BBC's revival of the popular TV science-fiction series
Doctor Who . This guest role was written especially for her by the programme's chief writer and executive producer Russell T. Davies, with whom she had previously worked on
Bob and Rose
(ITV, 2001). The character of Jones returned as Prime Minister in the
Doctor Who
2005 Christmas special "The Christmas Invasion". In the first part of the 2008 series finale, "The Stolen Earth", she made a final appearance, now as the former Prime Minister who sacrifices herself for extermination by the Daleks so that the Doctor's companions can contact him. She appeared in four episodes overall.
Wilton has also appeared on television as Barbara Poole, the mother of a missing woman, in the BBC television drama series
Five Days
in 2005; and in ITV's drama
Half Broken Things
(October 2007) and the BBC production of
The Passion
(Easter 2008). Since 2010, she has appeared as Isobel Crawley in the hit period drama
Downton Abbey . She was the castaway on BBC Radio 4's
Desert Island Discs
in April 2008. In December 2012 and February 2013, she was the narrator in Lin Coghlan's dramatisation of "The Cazalets" (Elizabeth Jane Howard) broadcast on BBC Radio.
Stage
Penelope Wilton commenced her professional career at the Nottingham Playhouse, and appeared alongside Nicholas Clay in
The Dandy Lion . She was Regan to Michael Hordern's
King Lear
at Nottingham Playhouse in 1970; Anna Calder-Marshall played Cordelia, and Thelma Ruby was the elder sister, Goneril.
Personal life
Between 1975 and 1984, Wilton was married to the actor Daniel Massey. They had a daughter, Alice, born in 1977. Before this, she had a stillborn son born very premature. She has remarked that this was one of the saddest things in her life. In 1991 Wilton married Sir Ian Holm (in 1998, after he was knighted, she became
Lady Holm ) and they appeared together as Pod and Homily in the BBC's 1993 adaptation of
The Borrowers . They were divorced in 2001.
