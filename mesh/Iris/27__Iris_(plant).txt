A flower and a gemstone
There is a flower and a gemstone for each month of the year. What's in a birth date ?
When you consider that there are over 6 billion people on this planet it would seem silly to think
that one day in the year can make any one of those 6000 million special. But everyone is special to someone and a birthday is always a special day. It has been that way forever most likely. Or at least since the days when someone decided to keep time through the use of calendars. The calendar that is most commonly used today is called the Gregorian calendar and it is a solar calendar which means that it moves forward along with the cycles of the earth in relation to the sun. One spin of the earth is equal to one day. This type of solar calendar is also called a civil calendar since it is a good method to tell you when Monday comes around and when it is time to wake up and go to work. It differs from lunar calendars that work with seasons and which are more likely to be used in almanacs and in planting and sowing cycles. But the modern day Gregorian calendar is best for telling us or reminding us of coming special dates such as birthdays. Over time, since the earliest ages in Egypt, Greece, Rome and elsewhere people have used a flower and a gemstone to show appreciation and respect for those they care for. Many systems have evolved around the theme of a flower and a gemstone but in 1912 a group of people got together and decided which stone best represented each month of the year. The list that they came up with was as follows: January
is to a White Carnation and Garnet
February
is to a Violet and an Amethyst March is to a Daffodil and an Aquamarine stone April is to Daisy or Tulip and a Diamond May is to a Sunflower or Lilly of the Valley and an Emerald gem June is to a Rose or an Honeysuckle and a Pearl or a Moonstone July is to a Larkspur and a Ruby August is to a Lily or a Gladiolus and a Peridot gemstone September is to a Forget Me Not or a Morning Glory and a Sapphire October is to a Marigold or Camellia and an Opal or Tourmaline gemstone November is to a Chrysanthemum and a Yellow Topaz or Citrine December is to the Holly or the Narcissus flower and a Turquoise gemstone or Blue Topaz Just recently a new gemstone was added to the list for December and that rock is the Tanzanite.

February flowers and birthstone
The February flowers and birthstone are the Violet and the Amethyst. This however varies to some degree according to which system of classification you follow but it holds true by most modern methods. image by Orbital Joe The modern system by which gemstones are selected to represent a specific month officially adopted by some Jewelers in 1922 and it has been an accepted method ever since with very few changes. In 2002 a new gemstone was added to the modern system for the month of December and that stone was the Tanzanite. The Violet is a flower that belongs to the Viola genus. There are over 500 flowers and plants within this Viola genus. Even the name Violet can be somewhat confusing since there are several named Violets such as Sand Violets, Dogtooth Violets, African Violets, only to name a few. The violet flowers are often referred to as a pansies and these are also found under many names including field pansies, dwarf pansies, mountain pansies and others. Each of these common names also has a scientific name such as the Hookedspur Violet is the Viola Adunca, the Field Pansy is the Viola Arvensis, and the Pohe Hiwa is the Viola Kauaensis. The Amethyst is the official gemstone for February birthdates according to the "modern system". The Amethyst gemstone is cut from a Quartz of violet coloration. The name comes from a Greek period from long ago and legend has it that it could be used to prevent intoxication. This legend carried into the Roman civilization. The violet quartz was shaped into drinking vessels and was said to keep one from becoming too drunk. The word "methustos" in Greek language meant intoxicated. When the "a" is added the word amethustos signifies "not drunk". Since those days and probably long before the Amethyst violet quartz was polished and made into jewelery. It was sometimes carried by soldiers to protect them against arm. image by My Beadiful Design So it would stand to reason that those born in the month of February could be won over by an offering of a beautiful pansy or a full bouquet of selected violets and maybe a small ornament or piece of jewelery made of the violet polished quartz named the Amethyst. To go the cheap route - it's the thought that counts - you might consider a piece of costume jewelery made of assimilated amethyst along with a hand crafted violet which you can make in your spare time. Nothing is more sentimental than a thing you make from scratch. Here's a pattern for a simple Pansy made from the same material used by companies who make nylon stockings. Hence the craft is called "silk nylon stocking flowers". Click Here : February Flowers and Birthstone (coming soon) Click on the labels below to find more like this one...

A white Carnation and a Garnet
A white Carnation and a Garnet gemstone are considered to be appropriate gifts for those who's birthday falls in the month of January. The Carnation is a member of the Dianthus genus. However those who have a deep passion for gardening flowers from seeds, bulbs, or otherwise can and do classify this genus into sub categories known has families and species. The Carnation is only one of several hundred types of flowers within the flower filing system. Other popular names within the Dianthus file include the Sweet William, the Cottage Pink, and many others. These Dianthus' are perennials that have fragrant blooms and they are great for yards and rock gardens. They are usually started from seed but the can also be propagated from cuttings. They can be started indoors and transplanted to the garden later. Or if one prefers then they can be purchased at most local greenhouses or plant suppliers. A white Carnation or an arrangement of white Carnations is a popular gift to give to a person who celebrates a birthday in January. Along with the Carnation, January births are also symbolized by a garnet gemstone. image by fleurione There are several backgrounds that one can use when selecting a stone to go with a certain month or birthdate. For example some people use a traditional system while others use the Ayurvedic system which is an ancient system from India and their are yet others.
In the 1920's a group of jewelers got together and formulated what has come to be known as the "modern system" and it is by this system that a salesperson would likely come up with a choice of gem for anyone inquiring about a gift for a certain month.
The garnet gem is mostly likely named from the Latin word "granatus" which means grain or seed. If so then this would probably be a reference to the red garnet which is said to look like a pomegranate. The garnet however does not only come in red. Garnets can be of any color with the exception of blue.
Jewelers and gem cutters love this gemstone because it is a hard rock but it is easy to shape and it keeps it's shine for a long time. Collectors of gemstones also love the garnet because it is both affordable and beautiful to own. So for anyone who has a birthday in January there is no better gift to give or receive than a white Carnation and a Garnet. For those who are into crafts then making a flower arrangement that revolves around the theme of a white carnation and a garnet for a January birthday could be both fun and inexpensive. Click on the above link for a pattern to make a single white carnation nylon stocking flower(coming soon).
