Miscellaneous plants
Fern and Bamboo are indispensable in many Japanese
gardens. We have some of those in Tsubo-en.
Just to be complete we list the plants that not fit
any of the other categories.
Wisteria sinensis
Although Wisteria sinensis ( Fuji ) is a
woody, deciduous, perennial climbing vine,
in these pages we have placed it under
Deciduous trees .
Although not at all a tree as such, it gets
trained to stand solitary as a tree.
As it stands next to
Mt.Sumeru
on the
tsukiyama it can also be seen in that chapter.
"The wisteria maiden",
Fuji Musume' , is an
otsu-e
(Japanese Folk Painting) subject thought to
have been inspired by popular dances.
Paintings such as this were often sold as good-luck
charms for marriages.
Fuji Musume', is also a famous classical
dance out of the Kabuki theater in Japan.
If you are interested, see:
Fuji Musum√®, the Wisteria Maiden .
Fern
In Tsubo-en we have three species of fern. These can
be found in the main garden and in the front garden
compartment. These are purely used for the
sabi
wabi
aesthetics.
This fern next to the front garden
chozubachi
is a
Asplenum trichomanes ,
Maidenhair
Spleenwort
(Dutch:
Steenbreekvaren ).
It is a very easy and satisfying fern.
It is evergreen and needs no looking after
worth mentioning other then keeping out the
groundcover .
In the main garden we have this beautiful fern
growing in a corner of the veranda.
This
Dryopteris
atrata
has a half-shadow spot in that it
stands North of and close to the house.
It grows just left our child Buddha (see Bamboo
below) and serves as foreground for viewing the
garden from the veranda.
Placed close to the main garden
Tsukubai , we have an other
Asplenum trichomanes ,
Maidenhair
Spleenwort
(top-left) and the only
Asplenium scolopendrium ,
Hart's-tongue Fern
(Dutch:
Tongvaren )
(foreground).
Bamboo
In Tsubo-en we have few species of
bamboo .
These can be found in the main garden and in the
water front compartment.
Behind the Dryopteris fern and the child
Buddha, or better
Jizo bodhisattva , we have a
"Bamboo bush" of
Sasaella
masamuneana . This is a large-leaved, low
growing bamboo that we keep in the shape of a
small bush.
In the bottom-left the
Dryopteris
atrata
fern.
The bamboo
Pleioblastus
pygmaeus
is part of the main garden
Tsukubai
and stands next
to/behind the chozubachi.
It is a small-leaved, low growing bamboo that
shows well as part of the tsukubai
composition.
In front and to the right the two above
mentioned ferns.
Although the bamboo used at the water front
looks great its use is very much driven by
pragmatic reasons.
We did not like the reed (cane) that was
growing there and is uncontrollable.
Photo taken looking down from the wall behind
the house.
On the horizontal area behind the house we
planted both the bamboo specimen we had in the
upper garden already.
Reason for planting both the species is that if
one dies (following the natural cycle) we still
have the other to protect our waterside bank.
Hedgerows
Unfortunately we have had little success and luck
with our hedgerows or
Ikegaki
(lit, ike=live, kaki=fence).
We have one on the left and one
on the right of or lot and both need/needed to be
replaced.
Photo taken from the backside of the main
tsukiyama. This shows the utilitarian pathway
that runs behind the main
Tsukiyama .
Unfortunately the hedgerow (on the left) of
Taxus
baccata
that forms the backdrop of the main
garden
tsukiyama
does not perform
well.
This has our continued attention as we are
looking for a solution that will be acceptable
for all parties involved. This needs to be done
in close corporation with the neighbours.
To the right on this photo, the hedgerow in
the left side compartment .
Some fifty percent of the original
Ilex
(Dutch:
Hulst ), planted some eight years ago have
died in 2007/2008.
The hedgerow was replaced in July 2008, by some
hundred
Thuja occidentalis
"Braband" .
This new hedgerow of Thuja occidentalis will be
clipped to form a straight wall-like hedge.
Hedgerows examples
Some examples of hedges and hedgerows are included in
the examples on the subject "enclosures".
See:
Enclosures examples .
Other
Iris
"White Knight"
(Dutch:
Hoge bardiris ).
Abundantly growing on the waterside bank.
We also have a
Hosta
Sieboldiana . It is a potted version that
stands on the waterside bank. Photo to follow.
Not at all native to the Japanese garden as
such we have a vine growing to screen-off our
small out-door tool-shed.
Vitis
" vroege van der Laan ". Every autumn the
grapes are a nice treat for blackbirds and
starlings.

Lessons
learned and what did not work well
Here we document what went wrong with regard to the
shrubs that we used or wanted to use.
The hedgerow of Ilex (Dutch: hulst) in the
left-garden has died for some fifty percent in
2007/2008
After not having done very well in the previous
eight years. Conclusion: planted too deep !
The Ilex never did well and even when they did, the
fallen leaves where a nightmare.
