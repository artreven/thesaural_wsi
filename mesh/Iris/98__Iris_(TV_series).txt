Career
Debut with Big Bang
Main article:
Big Bang (band)
Although his parents were against the idea of him becoming a singer, Daesung pursued a career as a singer and was eventually recruited by YG Entertainment after auditioning. He later appeared on a documentary show following the potential members of what eventually became Big Bang. The singer was initially known as the “unpretty boy” but due to his vocal talents and his popularity with viewers, he was chosen to be part of the group.
Their first appearance as a group was on August 19, 2006 at YG Family’s 10th Anniversary concert. On September 23, 2006, they had their debut performance. The group had its first big hit with “Geojitmal” ( Korean : “거짓말”, “ Lies “) in 2007.
2008–present: Beginning of solo career
In between various albums and EPs as a group, the members were able to pursue solo activities. Daesung released his debut
trot
single “Nal Bwa Gwisun” ( Korean : “날 봐, 귀순”, “ Look at Me, Gwisun “) in 2008; he stated that although he was worried about dampening the group’s image, he wanted to try something different. The singer also joined the reality-variety show
Family Outing
as a permanent member. The show revealed that his
IQ
was 110.
He also joined the Korean production of
Cats , playing the role of Rum Tum Tiger.
In the midst of Big Bang’s break in early 2009, Daesung released his second trot single in early 2009, titled “Daebakiya” (“ Korean : 대박이야”, “ Big Hit “). [2]
He was also scheduled to join bandmate Seungri in the autobiographical musical
Shouting ; however, the singer was injured in a car accident before the musical’s run, and ultimately required surgery. The injuries forced Daesung to halt all activities; he eventually made his return in October 2009, joining his group for the Dream Concert.
According to his Agency, YG Entertainment, he is supposed to release his solo album during 2010 along with fellow bandmate T.O.P. Daesung’s new song, “Cotton Candy”, is set to be release at the end of January.

Despite having recorded several songs by himself, G-Dragon made his official debut as a solo artist via the release of
Heartbreaker
in August 2009. Propelled by the lead single
“Heartbreaker” , the album sold over 100,000 copies. Other songs such as “The Leaders”, “A Boy”, “Hello”, and “She’s Gone” also charted and went on to top various charts upon their release. In December 6, 2009, G-Dragon held his first solo concert, “Shine a Light”, which was met with criticism following complaints of obscenity
and suggestive content . Currently, the Korean Ministry of Health, Welfare and Family Affairs has asked government prosecutors to investigate if G-Dragon or YG Entertainment have violated laws on obscene performances in his concert. If found guilty, he may be charge with a fine and up to one year in prison.
Artistry
G-Dragon’s music is based on
Hip Hop
elements. Being inspired from music by
The Wu-Tang Clan , he also participated in the Hip Hop Flex album in 2001, when he was 12 years old.
Ever since his trainee years, Kwon Ji Yong trained in the Hip Hop genre.
Controversy
G-Dragon was accused of plagiarism by Sony Music, as his tracks “Heartbreaker” and “Butterfly” are similar to
Flo-Rida’s
“ Right Round ” and
Oasis’s
“She’s Electric”, respectively.EMI, who also has rights to “Right Round” said that they saw no similarities between these two songs. Sony Korea has denied G-Dragon the ability to promote the track any further without paying reparations. On September 21, 2009,
Sisa Magazine , a news program on MBC, stated that officials from Sony reportedly sent YG Entertainment warning letters about plagiarism. Sony’s legal representative stated, “It was a hard decision for the music critics.” However, they decided that there were similarities and accordingly issued a warning letter to the production company and composers. They have also denied YG Entertainment the permission to promote these songs. His group
Big Bang
and their labelmates
2NE1
are also under fire for similar plagiarism claims.However,
YG Entertainment
claims that nothing has been decided or legally determined and that the “letter” which YG received from Sony is not considered legal action; the company has also stated that they have not received a direct response from the American publishers regarding this matter.

Big Bang (band)
Big Bang
( Korean : 빅뱅,
Japanese : ビッグバン), commonly stylized as
BIGBANG , is a Korean hip-hop boyband made up of five Korean singers. Although their debut was somewhat successful, it was not until the release of “거짓말” (“Lies”) that the group gained mainstream success.
History
2005—2006: Formation
Before Big Bang’s major debut, each member had his own degree of success and popularity in the entertainment industry. Leader
G-Dragon
and lead vocalist Tae Yang had already been with
YG Entertainment
since they were both twelve years old, known as GD and YB back then. Member
T.O.P
was well known as T.E.M.P.O. when he was the well-known rapper working underground. Big Bang made their official debut at the YG Family concert, held on August 19, 2006 at the Gymnastics Arena in Seoul Olympic Park.
Prior to the release of their first album, the group had a unique release schedule, with three EPs released within a span of a few months. Their first EP was
The First Single Album , which spawned the top-ten hit single “This Love”, a remake of the American boy band
Maroon 5 ‘s
own single .The single debuted with over 17,000 copies sold in the month of Augustand later went on to sell approximately nearly 40,000 copies . The second EP
Big Bang is V.I.P.
was released a month later, selling 21,000 copies in that month.It finally netted sales of 32,000 copies. Their third and last EP,
B I G B A N G 0 3 , followed the success of their previous EPs with final sales nearing 30,000 copies.
Later in the year, Big Bang’s own official
fan club
was created, calling themselves the “V.I.P.” (in reflection of their second single “Big Bang is V.I.P.”). Unlike other fan clubs, Big Bang’s fans do not have a balloon color for showing support at concerts; instead, fans wave black and white BB (standing for Big Bang) handkerchiefs/bandannas until the First Season. After selection of Second Season V.I.P., their support items became a crown-shaped stick. At the end of December 2006, Big Bang held their very first concert titled
The Real . The following month, their first debut album
Since 2007,
which was essentially a compilation of songs from their previous singles, was released; it sold 48,009 copies by the end of February 2007.
2007—2008: Breakthrough success
On February 8, 2007, Big Bang released their live concert album entitled
The First / Real Live Concert , which sold almost 30,000 copies by the end of 2007. From May to July 2007, the group also held their first national tour concert in Korea, with the headline
Want You , touring a total of five cities:
Incheon ,
Daegu ,
Changwon ,
Jeonju
and
Busan .
In August, the group released what would become one of their Last mini albums
Always , with the group holding a Showcase/Fanmeeting for promotional activities. Taking control over their music, group-leader G-Dragon began producing and writing some of the songs on the album. The mini-album was released to positive reviews from fans and critics alike, especially the song “거짓말” (“Lies”).”Lies” became the group’s first song to be a breakout hit, reaching number-one on
SBS
Hit Songs , their first to do so, followed by
MBC’s
Music Core ,
KBS
Music Bank
and Mnet’s
Countdown
and numerous online and offline charts for many consecutive weeks.
The mini-album was successful enough for Big Bang to collect numerous awards by the end of 2007, including “Best Male Group” and “Song Of The Year” from the 2007 M.NET/KM Music Festival.Later in 2008, Big Bang also collected the prestigious “Dae Sung” from the 17th Seoul Music Awards.
Their second mini album,
Hot Issue,
was released a few months after
Always
and yielded another strong single for the group, “Last Farewell” (“마지막 인사”). It mirrored the success of “Lies,” topping various music charts, and winning “Song of the Month Digital Music Award” from
Cyworld . It also topped Juke-On’s chart for eight consecutive weeks. The group then held their second round of concerts from December 28 to 30, 2008, with the headline
Big Bang Is Great , where tickets were reportedly sold out in 10 minutes. Despite this, various members were hospitalized due to sickness and injuries from over performing and exhaustion,thus halting and limiting their promotional activities. A representative for YG Entertainment then addressed the issue by stating that though the group would perform at the MBC Music Festival on the 31st, they would cancel everything else on their schedule for the first week of next year. It was later reported in the year that Big Bang’s albums and singles had been in high demand, causing the record company to reprint and repackage it for re-releases.
After the success in South Korea, Big Bang ventured out overseas towards Japan. Kicking off 2008, their first Japanese album
For the World
was released, with previous Korean singles appearing on the album, in addition to a Japan-only song, “How Gee” (a new remix version from “How Gee” by the Japanese group Black Machine).
For The World
debuted at #14 on the
Oricon
chart and eventually crawled its way to #10, despite lack of promotions.On the 28th and 29th of March, Big Bang held a concert in
JCB Hall
in Tokyo Dome City. Additionally, the group also released a Japanese mini-album in late May titled
With U , with a corresponding single of the same name.
The group returned to Korea mid-2008 after their activities in Japan ended. Despite their activities being delayed several time due to solo activities, Big Bang eventually released their third mini-album
Stand Up
— which featured collaborations with the group Daishi Dance, and the Korean rock-band No Brain with their latest punk rock single
Oh My Friend . The band’s first release was “Day By Day” (“하루하루”). Like previous albums, leader G-Dragon was heavily involved with the production of the album, having composed and written a majority of the songs. The mini-album went on to exceed the 100,000 mark in sales and also yielded some of the group’s strongest singles, with the lead single “Day By Day” topping several online charts and staying at the number-one spot for 6 consecutive weeks.In addition, several of their songs also made it to the Top 20 of the charts, with “Heaven” at the number-two spot, “Oh My Friend” being ninth, “A Good Man” at twelfth and “Lady” being sixteenth — a total of five songs in the Top 20 for the group.
At the same time, Big Bang released the Japanese song “Number 1” from their
album of the same name
and introduced the song through Japanese radio programs and TV shows; the album peaked at #3 on the Japan’s
Oricon
daily album chart. Towards the end of 2008, Big Bang released their Korean follow-up album,
Remember , yielding the single “붉은노을 (“Sunset Glow”), which peaked at number-one on various charts in Korea. At the end of 2008, Big Bang collected their second “Artist of the Year” from the 2008 M.NET KM Music Festival award ceremony.At the end of 2008, it was reported that Big Bang earned a totaled of
₩ 36 billion ( USD$
24.5 million).
2009—present: Branching Out
The group went on a break in early 2009, with all of them pursuing solo activities. During this time, they collaborated with
2NE1 , a new
girl group
from their entertainment company and also being called “The Female Big Bang”, for the song “ Lollipop “; they filmed a music video for it as well. Although it was a song used to promote a cell phone, it has since hit #1 on various online charts.
After their success with “Lollipop”, the group released their first
Japanese
single named “My Heaven” in May 2009, their major debut in Japan. The song is a Japanese translation of their song “Heaven” from the
EP
Stand Up , and was composed by acclaimed Japanese composer
Daishi Dance . Due to an interesting promotional campaign in which the group performed on several Morning News programs, Big Bang’s single debuted at a surprisingly high no. 3 on the Oricon Charts.
Big Bang released their second Japanese single titled “ｶﾞﾗｶﾞﾗ GO!” (Gara Gara Go!) on July 8, 2009 which reached number 5 on the Oricon charts. “Gara Gara Go!!” marked the group’s first performances on some of Japan’s major music shows, like Hey!Hey!Hey! Music Champ and
Music Station . With the release of two successful Japanese singles, Big Bang released their
self-titled first full-length Japanese album
under Universal Music which charted in at No. 3.
Almost immediately after the release of their first album, Big Bang returned to Korea. On August 18, G-Dragon released his first solo album titled
Heartbreaker
which was, despite fair amounts of controversy, a great success. Fellow member Taeyang is set to release his second solo early next year and the music video of his single “Where U At” has been released with his track.
On October 15, 2009, Big Bang announced their first tie-up with a Japanese drama; they will be providing the theme song for TBS’s Friday night drama
Ohitorisama
starring Alisa Mizuki and
Teppei Koike . Then after that TOP joined a Korean drama called Iris. The official release of this new Japanese single entitled “声をきかせて” (Let Me Hear Your Voice) was on November 4, 2009 and peaked at number 4 on the Oricon charts.
Big Bang will kick off the year with their annual concert, “2010 Big Bang Concert Big Show.”The concert will be held on January 29th, 30th and 31st of 2010 in Seoul Olympic Stadium.Big Bang will have four concerts in Japan titled, Electric Love Tour 2010; February 10th & 11th @ Yokohama Arena, February 13th @ Kobe World Kinen Hall, February 16th @ Budokan.YG’s Yang Hyun Suk also revealed that Big Bang will return with an album in Korea this Summer.T.O.P,
Daesung
and Seungri will be working on solo projects this year and
Taeyang
will be continuing his promotions for his album.
Controversy
Big Bang was accused of plagiarism by Sony Music, as their track “With U” from album
Number 1
was alleged to sound similar to
Joe ‘s “Ride Wit U” from his
And Then…
Artistry and influences
Musical styles
Big Bang’s musical style can be classified for the most part as hip-hop (as seen with the songs “La, La, La” and “Goodbye Baby”), with a little vibe of R&B (as seen with the songs “We Belong Together” and “Forever With You”), mainstream (“This Love”) music, and rock with “Oh My Friend”. They also began experimenting with electronic with the release of “Lies”, “Last Farewell”, and “Haru Haru (Day By Day),” setting it as a new music trend in Korea.However, the members have branched out into different genres in their solo work, including singing ballads and mainstream pop music. Big Bang even once mentioned in an interview that if they want to, they might do
trot
someday. Daesung’s first digital single, “Look at Me, GwiSun” (“날 봐, 귀순”), was a trot song, which had been somewhat controversial considering Big Bang’s primary focus on hip-hop.
The members of Big Bang often contribute to writing lyrics for their own music as well as composing
despite only debuting in 2006. The most notable from the group to compose and write is leader G-Dragon, as he has composed and written numerous songs for the group, including “Lies” and “Last Farewell.” Aside from G-Dragon, the others members have contributed to writing lyrics as well. T.O.P has also written a song for their third mini album
Stand up , called “Good Man”. Taeyang, the lead vocalist, has written the lyrics for “Goodbye Baby”. On a whole, Big Bang has received praises from critics, fans, and other singers alike for contributions to their own materials.
Dance style
Big Bang often rely on free style and street dancing (as evidenced in their music video for “Good Bye Baby”). They are choreographed by world-class choreographer Shaun Evaristo, (as seen in “Number 1” and “With U” music videos) who also choreographs their concerts and Taeyang’s solo projects. Like the popular boy band
Shinhwa , Big Bang’s own unique style of dancing is credited to a member of theirs, Seungri. Seungri has choreographed some of Big Bang’s moves (such as the jump rope dance from “Last Farewell”) and has been noted for this.
Image and cultural impact
Big Bang adopted the “hip hop” image concept, with some of the members slanting their caps in many promotional photos, live performances, music videos, and even having
cornrows
(most notably Taeyang) during the early days of their career. The group continued this image concept for the rest of 2006 and into 2007 until the release of their mini-album
Always , which showcased the group in a more
preppy -ish
punk
style, sporting modern day fashion (such as the
skinny jeans
with
Converse
or high-top sneakers as seen within the
music video
of their song “Lies”). Moving further away from the “gangster” look, Taeyang also cut off his cornrows into a faux hawk. Additionally, Big Bang has been noted for being a fashionable group, inspiring teenagers with street-originated flamboyant style.
Big Bang’s unique and urban hip-up sense of style has quickly become popular in Korea as a result, known as the “Big Bang fashion”. Usually, the group prefers brands such as Bape, 10 deep,
Louis Vuitton , Phenomenon, and others and are often seen in customized printed hoodies. The group has been noted as well to have brought back the old school fashion, high-top shoes, such as the
Nike
and
Reebok
high-top shoes.
Leader
G-Dragon
is consider by many to be the most fashionable one of the group,where he tends to wear triangular scarves (shemagh/ keffiyeh ) around his neck, known as “Big Bang scarves”. Additionally, member T.O.P. is also seen sporting
sunglasses , most notably shutter shades, which are worn by American rapper
Kanye West . Big Bang’s fashion trends are well known throughout the internet fashion portals,thus making them one of the most sought after artists for endorsement products. The group’s unique imagery and fashion has led them to release their own fragrance, entitled “BB Bud’s My First Fragrance (나의 첫번째 향기)” in early 2007.
Big Bang endorsed a Korean online
FPS
titled
Sudden Attack . A 5 members will have their own characters with special dialogue and sound effects.
