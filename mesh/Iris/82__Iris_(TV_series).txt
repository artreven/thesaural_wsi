(born October 3, 1984) is a
South Korean
actress, singer, entertainer and model. She debuted as a member of
girl group

Princess Hours , as well as
The 1st Shop of Coffee Prince . In February 2007, she graduated from
Kyung Hee Cyber University , receiving a
Bachelor’s Degree
in
Business Administration , specializing in
Tourism Management .
Biography
1999-2005: Baby V.O.X days
Yoon Eun Hye debuted as a member of
Baby V.O.X
at the age of 15, replacing an ex-member (Lee Gai) in 1999. Yoon was
the sub-vocal in the group, known for her cuteness and child-like
traits. [1]
Being the youngest member of the group, she received little attention and was often overshadowed by her other four members. [2]
Following her replacement, the group released their third album
Come Come Come
in 1999. This album became their first major success, with their
singles “Get Up” and “Killer” reaching the number one spot on the Korean
music pop charts. [3]
Since then, the group released many hit albums which garnered them not just a large loyal fan base in
Korea , but also in
China ,
Thailand
and other
Asia
markets. [4]
Yoon was often the prey of anti-fans. One infamous incident was
during her debut year, she was shot in the eye by an anti-fan who tried
to make her blind with a mixture of soy sauce and vinegar using a water
gun. She was rushed to the hospital where the doctors confirmed that her
cornea was damaged. [5]
Following fellow member
Shim Eun Jin , Yoon Eun Hye ended her 6 years activities as a member of
Baby V.O.X
in July 2005 when her contract with DR Entertainment expired. [6]
2005: Establishing a solo career
After her departure from
Baby V.O.X ,
Yoon was left without a management company. However, this did not stop
her from establishing her career in the entertainment business. During
this period, Yoon continued to appear on many TV shows, doing
MC
hosting and taking up small role in several sitcoms. [7]
Yoon Eun Hye appeared as a regular guest on the variety show
X-Man
on
SBS , in which she was popular with audiences. [8]
Due to her astonishing strength in the variety shows, she was labelled as “Young Girl Warrior”. [9]
While on
X-Man , Yoon became involved in a romantic “scandal” with
K-pop
singer
Kim Jong Kook . [10]
Though the show raised her public profile, she left the show a year later in order to pursue an acting career. [11]
Yoon made her acting debut in the movie
Escaping Charisma
(also known as
The Legend of Seven Cutter ).
In this movie, Yoon plays a tom-boy high school student, Han Min Joo,
who is an ace boxer. It was reported that Yoon only took 2hrs to master
the basic boxing techniques which normally takes a person a week to
learn. Her athleticism was such that the boxing coach suggested a career
in professional boxing. [12]
Originally, the movie was planned to be released in November 2005, but it only hit theatres the following year. [13]
The success of her first drama
Princess Hours
aided in ticket sales for this movie. [14]
2006: Breakthrough success
By late 2005 Yoon Eun Hye signed on with a new management company,
Eight Peak, when she was offered her first major acting role in
Princess Hours . Yoon played the lead role as the crown princess Shin Chae Kyung, which shot her to instant fame throughout Asia. [15]
Initially, fans of
the
Goong
manhwa
questioned her acting ability, and the manhwa fans sent out petitions
against Yoon as the lead role, requesting her to be replaced. They even
bombarded her
Cyworld
minihompy with harsh words. [16]
Yoon had thoughts of giving up the role initially but she released a
statement not long after stating that she would ultimately do her best,
displaying her determination to prove herself. [17] [18]
The drama debuted with average ratings, but as it progressed,
viewership increased to 28.3% nationally. The popularity led to an
extension of additional episodes (from 20 to 24 episodes) and a “Special
1.5” episode on
MBC . [19]
Although Yoon and the other main casts were invited to work on a second
season, only one of them officially agreed. Eventually, a spin-off
series with brand new characters was filmed, known as
Goong S , which was not the actual sequel planned by the original director and company. [20]
Following the success of her first drama, Yoon took on her next leading role in
The Vineyard Man
which was aired on
KBS
in July 2006.
The Vineyard Man
initially suffered low ratings due to strong competition from
MBC
45 th
anniversary drama,
Jumong .
Nonetheless, the heart-warming storyline and Yoon’s convincing
portrayal as “Lee Ji Hyun” gradually won the hearts of audiences,
reaching a 15.6% on its finale. [21]
Yoon’s portrayal in
The Vineyard Man
won her not only “Best New Actress” in the
2006 KBS Drama Awards , but also “Best Actress” at
2006 Grime Awards
along with Song Il Kook as the “Best Actor”. [22]
2007: Continued success with
Coffee Prince
Yoon Eun Hye’s third lead role was for MBC’s Monday/Tuesday drama
The 1st Shop of Coffee Prince , which started airing in July 2007. She played Go Eun-Chan, an employee at a coffee shop, who was once a master of
Taekwondo .
With her short haircut and tomboyish manner, the character was presumed
to be a boy by the owner of the coffee shop, thus leading to romantic
complications. [23]
The drama enjoyed high ratings, where viewership ratings hit as high as 32.1% in
Seoul
and 29.9% nationwide, making it the highest rated show in its timeslot. [24]
The huge success of
Coffee Prince
made Yoon the highest paid actress,
MBC
paying her 20 million
won
per episode for the drama. [25] [26] For that matter, Yoon became the youngest actress to join
South Korea ‘s
A-list
of stars, the
20 million Won Club
which includes
Bae Yong-joon ,
Kwon Sang Woo ,
Ko Hyun Jung , and Song Il kook. [27]
Yoon successful performance in
Coffee Prince , put her in the list of being one of the best actresses in Korean entertainment. [28]
From 19-27 November 2007,
StarNews
carried out their own 2007 Acting Awards, combining all 3 stations.
StarNews
surveyed a total 17 Chief Producers (5 from
KBS , 7 from
MBC
and 5 from
SBS ) in nominating and selecting the winners. In this award, Yoon Eun Hye was named “Outstanding Actress” for her role in
Coffee Prince . The Chief Producers evaluated Yoon’s acting and assessed her as having great potential for success. [29]
The success of
Coffee Prince
earned Yoon Eun Hye a fan base not only in
Korea , but also in other countries. [30]
Riding the big success in her dramas, Yoon was crowned as “Drama Ratings Queen” by the media and netizens. [31]
Yoon’s growing popularity since
Princess Hours
and
Coffee Prince
resulted in many companies requesting her endorsement. Due to the
overwhelming invitations, Yoon even had to turn down several
advertisement requests. Consequently, Yoon was as the “CF Queen” in
South Korea . [32] [33]
During filming of
Coffee Prince , Yoon suffered symptoms of severe headache and had to be hospitalised. [34]
Yoon was later diagnosed with
pernicious anemia . [35]
Yoon Eun Hye received a personal invitation from
Italian
fashion house
Blufin
to attend the
Blumarine Spring 2008 Ready-to-Wear Collection
fashion show in
Milan
on 25 September. [36] Anna Molinari
even personally presented Yoon with a piece of dress as a gift. [37]
Change in management
In July 2007 conflicts with Yoon Eun Hye’s management Eight Peaks
surfaced; eventually Yoon filed a certification of contents (COC) to
cancel her contractual agreement with the company. [38]
In August, Yoon filed a second COC; when asked to reveal the information behind the second COC, Yoon’s counsel stated:
“If Eight Peaks refused to cancel the contract then they will not hesitate to file a lawsuit, suing them for their refusal.”
[39]
The contents of the first COC stated that in January 2007 Yoon was confirmed to star in the drama
Que Sera Sera
and had even completed the script reading and rehearsal for the
upcoming shoot. However, the company forced Yoon to withdraw in order
for Yoon to star in a company-produced drama. After her withdrawal, Yoon
took a two day vacation to
Gangwon-do
in March. Eight Peaks claimed that they had no knowledge of this
so-called incident and spread a rumour of Yoon’s irresponsibility online
which damaged her reputation. [40]
Yoon’s manager, Park Geun-Soo stated:
“The second COC includes evidence to support the disagreeable
actions made by Eight Peaks. These actions included the improper
handling and distribution/division of earnings and proceeds as well as
the unilateral (one-sided) manner of making and carrying out decisions
which caused immense problems”
[41]
Yoon Eun Hye and Eight Peaks finally came to a mutual agreement
through careful negotiations and settled their disputes peacefully. With
her contract dispute resolved, Yoon Eun Hye signed on with Kraze
Entertainment as her new management company in September. This placed
her in a positive environment where her activities as an actress was
Kraze Entertainment’s focal point of attention. [42]

Kim Hee Ae
and Park Jin Hee, making her the youngest actress ever to win “Best Actress Award” at
PaekSang Arts Awards . [43] [44]
Prior to this, Yoon also set the record as being the youngest actress ever to win “Best Actress Award” at
2006 Grime Awards
and “Top Excellence Actress Award” in
2007 MBC Drama Award . [45] [46]
After 3 years of absence from the
K-pop
scene, Yoon Eun Hye returned to her music roots in February, lending her vocals to the new
hip-hop
group, Mighty Mouth. [47] Yoon’s collaboration, titled “Saranghae” (“사랑해”,
I Love You ), received a lot of attention in the press and from netizens, and it topped various charts in South Korea. [48]
In April 2008,
Premiere Elle
published a list of the “Top 100
Most Powerful and Influential People in The Korean Entertainment
Industry”, where Yoon Eun Hye was ranked 44th. Interestingly, Yoon was
one of the only 5 actors (following behind
Bae Yong Joon ,
Rain ,
Jeon Do Yeon
and
Song Kang Ho )

writers, CEOs or presidents of media stations and entertainment
companies. [49] [50]

Chanel
Contemporary Art Project — Mobile Art
in
New York , where she stood shoulder-to-shoulder with many of the world’s
supermodels
and
Hollywood
stars. Yoon was the only

in September 2008 after her contract with Kraze Entertainment expired.
She led the founding of the company on her own, taking care of all the
details from planning the company, designing of company logo to the
interior of the company. Even though this is a “1-person Corporation”,
Yoon has plans to groom new talents. [52]
2009: Return to acting
In 2009, Yoon Eun Hye collaborated with Korean fashion house JOINUS to design a series of clothes named
Yoon Eun-Hye for JOINUS . Yoon was involved in the designing process whenever a new
season
came along until the end of 2009, and the clothes were sold as part of JOINUS catalogue. [53]
On 30 April 2009, Yoon Eun Hye was presented with the “2009 Best
Jewelry Lady” award. This award was recommended by representatives from
top brands, as well as famous designers and professionals in the jewelry
industry. Yoon was awarded a plague and a set of jewelry designed and
dedicated especially to her. [54] [55]
Concurrently,
Swarovski
took a deep interest on Yoon Eun Hye and was chosen as the actress who best suited
Swarovski .
Nathalie Colin, Swarovski’s Creative Director, personally designed the
“Swarovski Nirvanna Yoon Eun Hye Ring” and presented the ring to the
actress as a gift. On 21 July, Yoon Eun Hye graced the

business family living a “princess-like” life whose world revolved
around her. The pilot episode got off a good start by topping the
viewing chart among Wednesday-Thursday dramas with ratings of 17.4%. [57]
Yoon Eun Hye was nonetheless harshly criticized for her acting, which
surfaced as a hot issue as it seemed she regressed in her skills since
The 1st Shop of Coffee Prince .
Yoon’s pronunciation, in particular, was the topic of netizens’
concerns, which they felt hindered Yoon from successfully portraying her
character. In an interview Yoon stated:
“I thought of how upset my parents would feel to read all those
articles slamming my acting, and I felt like going crazy. There were a
lot of times when I endured through it and smiled as I filmed, only to
end up with tears trickling out. Now, I’m afraid of making
transformations. Each time, people grow familiar with the character, but
if it takes a long time and hurts me every time, I don’t know what to
do, and I feel afraid.”
”There are more voices joining in to encourage and praise me. I
take the viewers’ criticism to mean that I shouldn’t be arrogant. I’m
reaching that age where I mature as an actor and as a woman. I want to
show my talents little by little, but the unfortunate thing is that a
lot of people don’t give me time for failure. I like to learn more as I
experience failure too. I wish people would not brand an actor as a
failure through one mistake.”
[58] [59]
As the drama progressed, Yoon received more favourable appraisals, where the final episode of
My Fair Lady
drew a rating of 19% nationwide. [60]
During the wrap party for the drama, the director of the KBS Drama
Department spoke highly about the drama, stating that KBS was pleased
with the drama and its ratings. [61]
To show her appreciation for everyone on the production team, Yoon Eun Hye bought 112 pairs of
Puma
sneakers for the entire crew as a parting gift. It was reported that in
the middle of September, Yoon had secretly enquired the shoe sizes of
everyone on the production team before placing orders for the shoes.
After filming wrapped, Yoon personally handed the shoes one-by-one to
each production staff to show her appreciation for their hard work. [62]
2010: Charity works and drama
Love Song
n January 2010, Yoon kicked off her first charity project by working
with visually impaired children to create a unique line of hand painted
bags. This special project was sponsored by
ELBON , a chic boutique that carries branded goods, to whom Yoon was the brand ambassador. These bags were displayed in the store on
ELBON
opening day, to create public awareness about the visually impaired children.
In February 2010, Yoon Eun Hye became a goodwill ambassador for the “Pink Wings Campaign” by
Vogue Girl Korea .
This charity campaign was designed to help female teens that are head
of their household, where profits from the sales will go towards
scholarships and spending for these teens in need. [63]
In March, Yoon Eun Hye and
Kim Hyun Joong
of
K-pop
group
SS501
collaborated in Basic House’s “Never Alone Campaign” for
UNICEF
to help
African
children. Proceeds from the sale of the “Never Alone” T-shirts go to help the needy in
Africa . [64]
Concurrently, Yoon Eun Hye was the ambassador for another charity
campaign title, “Hope Angel”, a fundraising program for children
suffering from incurable diseases. Yoon’s goal was to raise 10 million
won and get 500 signatures from netizens to encourage these children not
to lose hope. This charity program powered by the
Make-A-Wish Foundation
which kicked off on March 2, attracted quick responses from the
netizens. Yoon achieved 82% of the 500 required signatures within 2
hours, with the target reached later on the same day. [65]
On May 1, the goal of raising 10 million won was reached, ending this fund raising program within 2 months. [66]
During her charitable activities, Yoon also continued to work. In
February, a 12 mintues long-form “music drama” commercial titled
Temptation
for
Cass Beer
was released. This commercial also featured
Taecyeon
and
Nichkhun
from
2PM .
Along with the commercial, a digital single was released, entitled “Tik
Tok”. Because of the single’s success in addition to her previous guest
appearance on Mighty Mouth’s “Saranghae”, Yoon was nicknamed the “Lucky
Magician” by the media. [67]
Yoon Eun Hye was chosen as the representative of
Cartier
to film a travel log for the newest
summer
series of
“La Besace Marcello de Cartier”
along with the
German
fashion editor of
Style
Proofed Pia Sundermann, Brazilian
Supermodel
Fernanda Motta
and
French
painter Ara Starck. Prior to this, Yoon modelled for Cartier’s “All About Trinity” jewelry line; [68]
she was then subsequently invited in April to visit
Cartier ’s flagship store and workshop in
Paris , in which she received royal treatment. [69]
In May 2010, The House Company introduced its first groomed artist,
Do.U. Yoon was also secretly involved in the production of the mini
album entitled
Do You Know Me?
In this album, Yoon’s vocals could be found on the last track, entitled “AM 5:00 Do.U-reul Mandeun Saramdeul (Outro)” ( AM 5:00 Do.U Production Crew (Outro) ). [70]
She is also the backup vocal for the first track of the album. Another song on the EP, “Gomdoli” ( Little Bear ), was featured in the official soundtrack of
Personal Taste , in which Yoon Eun Hye made a cameo appearance. [71]
It was announced on June 28, 2010 that Yoon would be starring in
Love Song , a drama remake of the 1996
Hong Kong
film
Comrades: Almost a Love Story .
In the drama, Yoon will portray Yu Chae-hwa, a woman who moves from
China to live in Korea. Yoon explained her decision to star by stating
that the script accurately portrayed the feelings in the original film
and hopes that it will become a big present not only for Koreans, but
for all the fans in
Asia . [72]
According to the production team, Yoon Eun Hye’s success in her
previous dramas throughout various Asian markets caused a stampede for
the purchase of broadcast rights for the drama since her involvement was
officially announced. They are currently negotiating with companies in
11
Asia
countries for the rights to broadcast
Love Song . Outside of
Asia , there is also demand in the
United States ,
Europe , and the
Middle East .
Warner Bros.
has also expressed interest in buying the
US
broadcast rights for
Love Song . [73]
The drama is scheduled to commerce filming once the remaining casts are confirmed.

Park Shin-hye
(born February 18, 1990) is a
South Korean
actress and model. [1]
Park is currently attending
Chung-Ang University .
She debuted first in the 2003 Lee Seung-Hwan music video “Ggot –
Flower.” In 2003 she received a Youth Award from the SBS Acting Awards.
She is best known for the role of “Go Mi Nam” in the popular television
drama
You’re Beautiful
. [2]
Acting career
Park’s fame came when she played the younger version of the character Han Jung-suh in the popular Korean drama,
Stairway to Heaven . She also starred in a drama series called
Tree of Heaven
which aired on
SBS , starring her former co-star in
Stairway to Heaven ,
Lee Wan . [1]
The show had decent ratings, and the reviews and criticism were mixed,
but mostly positive. Many critics keyed in on her portrayal of the
character Hana’s pain of loving her step brother Yoon-suh
Lee Wan
as brilliantly done. It should also be noted that due to the age
difference between her and Wan, romantic scenes such as kissing on the
lips could not occur, as seen in the scenes in the show, where had it
been an older actress, such scenes may have occurred.
Tree of Heaven
started with borderline mediocre ratings, as do many new Korean dramas
do, but went on to finish very respectably, and gained a fan base in
Korea, which further helped Park’s credibility and young career in
acting. Since then, Park has done many commercials (CF) and modeled for a
number of Asian companies. [2]
Through her roles and their requirements, Park has displayed an
instinctive talent for dancing and martial arts. She has also released a
digital single, “Prayer”, a song she used to sing in the drama
Tree of Heaven , however, the track was not released in the Official OST.
Current activities
Park recently made her big screen debut in the movie
Evil Twin ,
a summer horror flick where she had 2 roles; One is of the main
character, the other is of the ghost of the main character’s sister, who
haunts the other sister after her death. Park was extremely happy to
act in this movie, because she had always wanted to act in a period
setting drama or movie.
Park starred as one of the four main characters in
Goong S , a spin off (not the sequel) to the wildly successful
Goong .
The series did not match the success of its original, and received
borderline ratings. However, the drama was the most re-watched and
replayed series in the first half of 2007, gaining fame after the first
run. Park later gained more popularity through idol drama series
You’re Beautiful . [2]
As of now Park Shin Hye’s show You’re Beautiful has been airing on other countries.
Twitter appearance
Park Shin Hye has officially joined Twitter known as Ssinz (

) gaining over 18,000 followers in one night.

Moon Geun Young
(born May 6, 1987, in
Gwangju ,
South Korea )
is a South Korean actress, commercial (CF) star, and model.
Affectionately called “the nation’s little sister,” Moon started
modeling at the age of 12 and appeared in the documentary film
On the Way
(1999) the following year. She came into the spotlight through her role
as the young Eun-suh in the hugely popular television drama series
Autumn Tale
(2000). Her major breakthrough as a star was the horror film
A Tale of Two Sisters
(2003) directed by
Kim Ji-woon . Later, she starred in such hit films as
My Little Bride
in 2004 and
Innocent Steps
in 2005.
Personal Life and Education
Moon Geun-young has been loved as a proper and pure “younger sister
of the people” ever since she debuted as a child actress in the 2000 TV
drama
Autumn in My Heart .
Unlike other teenage celebrities who have already physically matured,
she had the look of a young girl, she studied hard and acted well.
People called her flawless and unspoiled.
[1]
Moon Geun-young read the eulogy to fellow actress,
Lee Eun-joo , on February 22, 2005. [2]
Moon was in the same management agency as Lee.
In May 2005, Moon Geun-young appeared onstage at the
Cannes International Film Festival
in France at the Palais de Festival. Moon’s film
Innocent Steps
was chosen to be shown at the 58th Cannes International Film Festival. [3]
Moon Geun-young ranked first on the star power list in 2005 among actresses in
Chungmuro ,
the Korean film industry, who can mobilize the greatest number of fans,
and sell tickets on the sole basis of the actor’s name alone. [4]
The Korea Advertisers Association voted Moon Geun-young the best
entertainer to sell products by advertisers. The Korea Advertisers
Association of 200 members awarded Moon and actor
Jo Seung-woo
as the winners of the 2005 Good Model Award. The winners were decided
by votes based on how much they contributed to boosting the sales of
products and enhancing the image of advertisers. [5]
Moon Geun-young graduated from Gwangju Gukje High School in February 2006. In March 2006, she entered
Sungkyunkwan University
in Seoul. Moon Geun-young has been devoted to her studies and has had a
solid attendance record ever since she entered Sungkyunkwan University
in 2006. [6]
Moon Geun-young and veteran actor Ahn Sung-ki hosted the 2006
Pusan International Film Festival
(PIFF), the biggest international film festival in South Korea. [7]
In 2008, she took a one-year leave from school to focus on the drama
The Painter of the Wind . [6]
Prior to and after signing her contract for
The Painter of the Wind , Moon Geun-young gave much thought about whether to apply for a leave of absence. [6]
She concluded that it would be virtually impossible to perform at the
best of her ability to both her studies and drama at the same time. Moon
Geun-young has shown strong determination to fulfill her
responsibilities as a student, and this application for a leave of
absence is also seen as her decision to keep her promise of valuing her
education. [6]
She is currently a junior majoring in Korean Literature at Sungkyunkwan University.
Career
Early career
Before her debut in a television drama series, Moon Geun-young filmed
several commercials and modeled for various magazines. She started
modeling at the age of 12, and appeared in the documentary drama
On the Road
by film director Choi Jae Eun in 1999. In 2000, Moon became the biggest
teen star in the country at the age of 13 playing a school girl in a
sentimental TV drama called
Autumn Tale . It was a hit in Korea
and won over viewers in other parts of Asia. She won the best young
actress award at the 2000 KBS Drama Awards for her role in
Autumn in My Heart . [8]
Following her early success, she returned to the screen in 2001 as
the young Empress Myung-sung (later played by Lee Mi-yeon) in the
popular historical (also known as “sa-geuk” in Korean) television drama
series
The Last Empress . During that year, she also made a cameo appearance in the SBS medical television series,
Medical Center .
Moon Geun-young’s debut film appearance was in a supporting role as
Cha Tae Hyun ‘s younger sister, Lee Ji-yoon, in
Lovers’ Concerto
(2002).
Stardom
In 2003 she was launched as a major star with her role in
Kim Ji Woon ‘s successful horror film
A Tale of Two Sisters
(2003). Moon Geun-young plays the role of the younger sister Su-yeon in
the film. It is both the highest-grossing Korean horror film and the
first to be screened in American theaters. [9]
In 2004, Moon Geun-young played the role of Suh Bo-eun in the popular film
My Little Bride . [10]
It was the second most popular Korean film in 2004, behind the
blockbuster hit Taegukgi. In the film, Suh Bo-eun is an ordinary high
school girl who worries about grades and has a crush on her school’s
baseball team ace. One day, Bo-eun’s grandfather orders her to marry
Sang-min (Kim Rae-won) because of a pact he made with Sang-min’s
grandfather during the Korean War. Despite the grandchildren’s
opposition, they are forced to marry because of Bo-eun’s grandfather’s
strong influence. Bo-eun’s undercover married life begins: She pretends
that she doesn’t have a husband and starts dating Jung-woo. Boeun
believes that she can manage both men and live a double life. Everything
goes smoothly until Sang-min visits Bo-eun’s school as a student
teacher.
Following the release of
My Little Bride
(2004), she became known as “the nation’s younger sister” (Gukmin yeo-dong-saeng”) [11]
for her cute younger sister-like image, in addition to her charitable
deeds and acting. Moon’s subsequent appearances have given her a
reputation as being one of Korea’s few genuine box office draws.
In 2005, Moon Geun-young starred in her subsequent film
Innocent Steps
where she plays the role of Jang Chae-ryn, an ethnic Korean living in
China, who finds herself to be a complete fish out of water after being
transplanted abroad to South Korea. [ citation needed ]
When her sister bows out of a dummy marriage to a champion dance
instructor, Chae-ryn decides to travel to Seoul herself and impersonate
her sister. Once in South Korea, she meets Na Young-sae (Park
Gun-hyung), who has agreed to the sham marriage for the sole purpose of
locating a new dance partner. But when Chae-ryn’s secret and her lack of
dancing experience is revealed, Young-Sae wants to send his new bride
back. Eventually, however, he has second thoughts and decides that his
only hope is to train this wide-eyed novice himself. Of course, the
practices start off as purely professional, but as Chae-ryn begins to
dedicate herself to the art of dancing, a connection between the
newlyweds begin to take shape. Chae-ryn’s youthful exuberance and folksy
way of speaking eventually charms Young-sae’s hardened heart.
In 2006, Moon Geun Young starred in the movie
Love Me Not , a Korean big-screen remake of popular Japanese TV drama
Ai nante iranee yo, natsu , where she plays the character of Ryu Min. [ citation needed ]
Min is a blind heiress, cold-hearted like Julian, who slowly opens
herself to Julian, and he, too, falls for Min. However, Julian has to
pay his creditor for his millions of debt and Min’s illness that took
her eyesight as a child relapsed, threatening her life.
In September 2008, Moon Geun-young made her return to the television screen with the epic drama
The Painter of the Wind , in which she played the lead role of Shin Yoon-bok, a painter who disguises herself as a man.
Shin Yoon-bok
is a painter who lived during the
Joseon Dynasty
(1392-1910) and was known for his realistic and delicate depictions of daily life.
Acting Acclaim
In December 2008, Moon Geun Young won the Best Actress Award for her
role as Shin Yoon-bok at the 2008 Grime Awards (pronounced gree-may)
presented by the Korean Television Directors of Photography Association. [12]
At the end of the year drama awards, Moon Geun-young won the Daesang
(Grand Prize) award, the Best Couple Award with Moon Chae Won, and the
Top 10 Star Award at the 2008 SBS Drama Awards held on December 31,
2008-January 1, 2009. [13]
In February 2009, Moon Geun-young won the Best Female Actress Award
in a TV Series at the 44th Baeksang Awards. She was also very close to
winning the popularity award by a very small margin (0.1%) to
Girls’ Generation ‘s
Yoona . [14]
Charity
Morning Reading
Moon Geun-young donated close to 100 million to Morning Reading, a non-profit organization that promotes reading books. [15]
She gave 4.3 million won in 2005, 4 million won in 2006 and 70 million
won in 2007. Moon made the contributions secretly through her mother,
Ryu Seon-young, but her good deeds became known when Morning Reading
revealed its 2007 account information online.
Haenam Children’s Center
Moon Geun-yeong donated about 300 million won in 2006 to a learning
center for poor children in Haenam, South Cholla Province, near her
hometown of Gwangju. [16] [17]
Bae Yo-seop opened an after-school study room for children from poor or
single-parent families to study there for free in 2002. The program was
facing closure in October 2006 when the landlord told Bae that the
house would be sold. [17]
A new building, equipped with library, computer room, bathhouse and
dining room was built on the land. The 200 million-won expense was also
covered by Moon. Moon also paid an unannounced visit to their
classrooms.
Community Chest of Korea
Moon Geun-young donated more than 850 million won over the last six
years to the Community Chest of Korea, a nationwide network of 16
nonprofit fundraising organizations, becoming the biggest individual
donor. She had wanted to remain anonymous. [18]
Moon Geun-young was also selected among 100 people that “lit up the
world” in 2008 in a survey conducted by the Korea Green Foundation. [19]
Han Geul Library in Sydney
Moon Geun-young again showed her generosity by building a Korean
library for young Korean expatriates in Australia. The actress is going
to support the library construction by helping out with the cost (100
million won), and donating books. Moon has been donating books with her
own money since 2006, when she saw during a visit to her relatives in
Australia how young Korean students there did not have enough books or
places to learn Korean. She worked with the Linfield Korean School in
Sydney to build a permanent Korean library called the Han Geul library. [20] [21]
Donated Haenam Children’s Center to NGO Group
In April 2009, Moon Geun-young donated the Haenam Children’s Center
used as a study room for poor students to an NGO group Good People, an
international charity group of UN UCOSCO special consultative status
aiming to improve self-sustainability and eradicate extreme poverty
through restoration of self-esteem using the principles of human dignity
and equality at a global level. [22] [23]

Choi Seung-hyun
(Korean: 최승현), born November 4, 1987), better known by his stage name
T.O.P
(Korean: 탑), is a South Korean recording artist and actor. Best known
as a member of the Korean boy band Big Bang, he has branched out to act
in various dramas and films, including
I Am Sam ,
Iris
and
71: Into the Fire .
History
2005–2006: Big Bang debut
Main article:
Big Bang (Korean band)
Prior to his involvement with YG Entertainment, Choi was an underground rapper and a childhood friend of
G-Dragon , another member of Big Bang. [2]
G-Dragon stated that the two were “neighborhood friend[s] from middle school” and would often dance and rap together. [3]
Although G-Dragon later moved away and the two “became distant”, he
contacted Choi again when YG Entertainment was scouting for candidates
to create a boy band. [3]
The pair recorded several demos and sent them to
Yang Hyun Suk , CEO of YG Entertainment, who later asked Choi to audition. [2]
Choi was initially rejected by the record label, which deemed him too “chubby” to fit the “idealistic version” of an idol. [2]
Choi later stated that he “went home and exercised really hard because I wanted to join YG Entertainment.” [2]
Six months later, he returned for another audition and was signed on. [2]
Choosing the stage name of T.O.P. (Korean: 탑), he became one of the
two rappers in the group Big Bang, alongside G-Dragon. The two were
paired with four others:
Taeyang ,
Daesung ,
Seungri
and So-1; a documentation of their training was aired to promote them. [4]
So-1 was dropped by the record label, and Big Bang made its official debut with five members. [5]
Their first album,
Since 2007 ,
was a fair success, [6]
and included T.O.P.’s first solo song “Big Boy.” The group achieved
mainstream success with the release of the song “Lie” (Korean: 거짓말;
Revised Romanization :
Geojismal ) from their 2007 mini-album
Always , which topped several charts upon its release. The singles, “Last Farewell” (Korean: 마지막 인사; Revised Romanization:
Majimak Insa ) from the mini-album
Hot Issue
and “Day by Day” (Korean: 하루하루; Revised Romanization:
Haru Haru ) from
Stand Up , became chart-toppers as well. [7] [8]
2007–present: Solo development
Following the release of the band’s albums and singles, T.O.P. began
working on his solo career. In April 2007, he was featured with fellow
Big Bang members Taeyang and G-Dragon on singer
Lexy ‘s single “Super Fly” for her album
Rush . Later that summer, he appeared as an actor in Red Roc’s “Hello” music video. [9]
He later became the first member of Big Bang to venture into acting, starring in the
KBS2
drama,
I Am Sam , . [1]
portraying the school’s top fighter, Chae Musin. He also took the role of MC of
MBC ‘s
Music Core
on November 10, 2007, only to resign in April of the following year. In 2008, he collaborated with
R&B
artist
Gummy
on the song “I’m Sorry” for her album
Comfort , and later with singer
Uhm Jung Hwa
for her single “D.I.S.C.O.”
T.O.P later put his solo career on hold while he joined his group for
their promotional activities. After more than a year of promoting Big
Bang’s materials, he returned to acting, playing the assassin Vick in
the critically acclaimed [10]
Korean television drama
Iris . [11]
T.O.P. also recorded the song “Hallelujah” for the drama’s soundtrack with Taeyang and G-Dragon. Following
Iris , T.O.P. and Seungri appeared in the teenage suspense drama,
My 19 . [12]
T.O.P filmed the movie
71: Into the Fire
which released in June 2010. He received many good critics and praise
for his acting; the movie hit 1 million views in a week, making it the
first movie of the 2010 to reach that number of views in South Korea. [13]
He is also in preparation for his solo debut. [14]
During Big Bang’s Big Show concert in January 2010, T.O.P. performed his new single “Turn It Up.”
YG Entertainment
released a music video teaser for “Turn It Up” on June 14, 2010 which
revealed the release date for the full music video to be June 21, 2010.
The teaser itself received over 200,000 views within 48 hours of its
original posting on
YouTube . The official music video was released at noon in South Korea, with over 1,000,000 views and comments in just a few minutes. [15]
He is also the first Korean artist to have his song release worldwide
on iTunes. On 29 October 2010, he won the Hallyu Popularity Award in the
47th Grand Bell Film Awards. [16]
In November 2010, YG Entertainment announced T.O.P and bandmate
G-Dragon
would release a collaboration album. [17]
Preceding the release of the album, the duo held a world-wide premiere
showcase for their album at Times Square in Yeongdeungpo of
Seoul, South Korea , [18]
which was also broad-casted live on
YouTube . [19]
To promote their album, the duo released three singles: “High High,” “Oh Yeah,” and “Knock out.” [20]
All three singles preceded the release of the album. The singles were commercial successes: “High High” was a chartopper [21]
while “Oh Yeah” and “Knock Out” both peaked at #2 and #3 respectively. [22] [23]
The album was released on
Christmas Eve , and debuted at number one [24]
with pre-orders of 200,000 copies. [25]
