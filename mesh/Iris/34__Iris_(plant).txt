Explanation:
Like delicate cosmic petals, these clouds of interstellar
dust and gas have blossomed 1,300 light-years away in the fertile
star fields of the
constellation Cepheus .
Sometimes called the Iris Nebula and dutifully
cataloged as
NGC
7023, this is not the only nebula in the
sky to evoke the imagery
of flowers .
Still, this
beautiful digital image
shows off the
Iris
Nebula's range of colors
and
symmetries in impressive detail.
Within the Iris,
dust y
nebular material surrounds a massive, hot,
young star in its
formative
years.
Central filaments of cosmic dust glow with a reddish
photoluminescence
as some dust grains
effectively
convert
the star's invisible
ultraviolet
radiation to visible red light.
Yet the dominant color of the central nebula is blue,
characteristic
of dust
grains
reflecting starlight.
Dark, obscuring clouds of dust and
cold molecular gas
are present
on the left of the image, and lead the eye to see other
convoluted
and
fantastic
shapes.
Infrared
observations
indicate that this nebula may contain complex carbon molecules known as
PAHs .
As shown here, the bright blue portion of the
Iris
Nebula
is about six
light-years
across.
