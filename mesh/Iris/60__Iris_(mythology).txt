How to paint an ancient goddess
You could see my
Greek goddesses
on Friday so I decided to draw another Greek goddess for a tutorial over at
The Butterfly Effect .
This is
Iris . She is a messanger of the gods and the goddess of rainbow. She is also know as the goddess of sea and sky and is represented as supplying the clouds with the water needed to flood the world, consistent with her identification with the rainbow.
There are 8 steps to drawing an ancient goddess and 7 of them happen before you actually start to draw. :) If you want to know what they are, you know where to go.

Donna Reply Delete craftattack 14 November, 2011 Lovely drawing! Valerie Reply Delete Sunshineshelle 14 November, 2011 Iris is gorgeous, loving the pure white on white & then the burst of colours, fantastic Natasha :) Reply Delete Diane 14 November, 2011 I think she's my favorite goddess so far--although they're all lovely.

ManonX Reply Delete Kathryn Dyche Dechairo 14 November, 2011 Beautiful drawing of the goddess. Reply Delete linda 14 November, 2011 Iris is so beautiful with lovely clean lines. Simple but very effective. Reply Delete Gina 14 November, 2011 Such a pretty goddess :D XXX Reply Delete pinkglitterfae 14 November, 2011 I'm enjoying your goddess series! especially love your Athena one :-) Reply Delete Cameron 14 November, 2011 Makes you wonder, doesn't it...what our "goddeess thing" would be if we were to be described and drawn? No, you didn't wonder that? Just me, then...haha! I really like this one....her rainbow colored staff is perfect :) Reply Delete Leovi 14 November, 2011 Delicious, sweet ... Nice paint, Reply Delete amy 14 November, 2011 :)) i so enjoyed the butterfly effect post that you put up.
i really liked the 'pre-emptive' steps. you are wonderful. xxa Reply Delete Paper Pad Challenge 15 November, 2011 She is an amazing Goddess xxx Reply Delete - T.W - 15 November, 2011 Adorable goddess, love her posture. And that rainbow staff looks awesome! I imagine her swinging it like a brush across the sky to paint a rainbow~ // -T.W- Reply Delete Magic Love Crow 16 November, 2011 Beautiful Natasha ;o)) Reply Delete Fallingladies 16 November, 2011 I hadn't ever heard about Iris before, I love what she represents! Thanks so much for sharing!!!! Reply Delete amy 16 November, 2011 natasa! this came up in google on the first page when i typed in ancient goddesses. !!! cool. xxa Reply Delete Linda Starr 17 November, 2011 I'm enjoying reading about Greek mythology as it has been years since I studied it in school but so enjoyed it then; love Hera below, must be the peacock feathers behind her as I am drawn to color recently. Reply Delete Cindy D. 20 November, 2011 All the goddesses are really great. I love the write-up on Athena, Hera and Nike (let's definitely call her Victoria since those sneaker people stole her name). Iris is really great, too, but a bit softer (pastels?) She has a lovely expression on her face and I love the dress and scepter. Reply Delete Add comment Load more...
