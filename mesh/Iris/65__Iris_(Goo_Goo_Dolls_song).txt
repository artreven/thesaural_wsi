Avril Ramona Lavigne  ( pronunciation:   / ˈ æ v r ɨ l   l ə ˈ v i ː n / ;  av -ril   lə- veen ;
born 27 September 1984) is a Canadian  singer-songwriter . She was born in  Belleville ,
Ontario, but spent most of her youth in the small town of  Napanee . By the age of 15, she had appeared on
stage with  Shania Twain ; by
16, she had signed a two-album recording contract with  Arista Records  worth more than
$2 million. In 2002, when she was 17 years old, Lavigne broke onto the
music scene with her debut album  Let Go .
Let Go  made
Lavigne the youngest female soloist to reach No. 1 in the UK, and the album was
certified  four-times
platinum  by the  Recording
Industry Association of America . By 2009, over 16 million copies had
been sold worldwide. Her breakthrough single, " Complicated ",
peaked at No. 1 in many countries around the world, as did the album  Let
Go . Her second album,  Under
My Skin , was released in 2004 and was her first album to peak at
No. 1 on the U.S.  Billboard 200 ,
eventually selling more than 10 million copies worldwide.  The Best Damn Thing ,
Lavigne’s third album, was released in 2007, becoming her third No. 1 album in
the  UK Albums Chart  and
featuring her first U.S.  Billboard   Hot
100  No. 1 single, " Girlfriend ".
Lavigne has scored five number-one singles worldwide, including
"Complicated", " Sk8er Boi ",
" I'm with You ",
" My Happy Ending "
and "Girlfriend". With more than 30 million copies of her albums sold
worldwide, Lavigne is one of the top-selling artists releasing albums in the
U.S., with over 10.25 million copies certified by the RIAA. Her fourth
studio album,  Goodbye Lullaby ,
was released in March 2011.  Goodbye Lullaby  gave Lavigne her
fourth top 10 album on the U.S.  Billboard  200 and the UK
Albums Chart and her third No. 1 album in both Japan and Australia. Three
months after the release of  Goodbye Lullaby , Lavigne began work on
her fifth album, which will be released on  Epic Records  following her departure
from  RCA Records .
Lavigne branched out
from recording music, pursuing careers in feature film acting and designing
clothes and perfumes. She voiced a character in the animated film,  Over the Hedge ,
in 2006. That same year, she made her on-screen feature film debut in  Fast Food Nation .
In 2008, Lavigne introduced her clothing line,  Abbey Dawn , and in 2009, she released her
first perfume,  Black Star ,
which was followed by her second perfume,  Forbidden Rose , in 2010 and her third perfume,
Wild Rose, in 2011. In July 2006, Lavigne married her boyfriend of two
years,  Deryck Whibley ,
lead singer and guitarist for  Sum 41 . The marriage
lasted a little over three years, and in October 2009, Lavigne filed for
divorce. Whibley and Lavigne continued to work together, with Whibley producing
her fourth album, as well as Lavigne's single, " Alice ",
written for  Tim Burton 's
film  Alice in
Wonderland .
Early life
Avril Ramona Lavigne
was born in  Belleville ,
Ontario. Her father, Jean-Claude Lavigne, named her "Avril" after the
French word for the month of April. At the age of two, she began singing church
songs with her mother, [1]  Judith-Rosanne "Judy"
(née Loshaw). Judy recognized her two-year-old daughter's talents after hearing
her sing " Jesus Loves Me "
in church. [2]  Lavigne has an older brother,
Matthew, and a younger sister, Michelle, [3]  both of whom teased her when
she sang. "My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing
myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying." [2]
When Lavigne was five
years old, the family moved to  Napanee , Ontario, [1]  a town with a population of
approximately 5,000. [4] [5] [6]  Although she struggled to pay
attention in school, sometimes being kicked out of class for misbehaving, her
parents supported her singing. Her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit,
a keyboard, and several guitars, and converted their basement into a studio.
When Lavigne was 14, her parents would take her to karaoke sessions. [7]  Lavigne also performed at
country fairs, singing songs by  Garth Brooks ,  The Dixie Chicks , and Shania Twain. She also
began writing her own songs. Her first song was called "Can't Stop
Thinking About You", about a teenage crush, which she described as
"cheesy cute". [8]
“
I’ve known all my life that this is what I was
supposed to do.... Visualizing like what it would be like to be famous with
my music. And always just dreaming, always daydreaming.
”
In 1999, [9]  Lavigne won a radio contest to
perform with fellow Canadian singer Shania Twain at the Corel Centre (now  Scotiabank Place ) in Ottawa, before an
audience of 20,000 people. [1] [4]  Twain and Lavigne sang " What Made You Say
That ", [1]  and Lavigne told Twain that she
was going to be "a famous singer". [4]  During a performance with the
Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd.
He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, "Touch the Sky", for
his 1999 album, Quinte Spirit . She later sang on "Temple of
Life" and "Two Rivers" for his follow-up album,  My
Window to You , in 2000. In December 1999, Lavigne was discovered by her
first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing  country  covers at a  Chapters  bookstore in Kingston , Ontario. [1] [4]  Fabri sent out VHS tapes of
Lavigne's home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was
visited by several executives. [10]  Mark Jowett, co-founder of the
Canadian management firm  Nettwerk , received a copy
of Lavigne's karaoke performances recorded in her parents' basement. [11]  Jowett arranged for Lavigne to
work with  Peter Zizzo  during
the summer of 2000 in New York, where she wrote the song "Why".
Lavigne was noticed by  Arista Records  on a subsequent trip to
New York. [10]
Lavigne would go on
to sell more than 30 million copies of her albums worldwide, [12]  becoming one of the
top-selling artists releasing albums in the U.S., with over 10.25 million
copies certified by the RIAA. [13]  In 2009,  Billboard  named
Lavigne the No. 10 pop artist in the "Best of the 2000s" chart. [14]  She was listed as the 28th
overall best act of the decade based on album and single chart performance in
the U.S. [15]
Music career
2000–03:  Let Go
Main
article:  Let Go (Avril
Lavigne album)
In November 2000, [5]  Ken Krongard, an  A&R  representative, invited Antonio
"L.A." Reid, then head of Arista Records, to producer Peter Zizzo's
Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne sing. Her 15-minute audition "so
impressed" Reid that he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth
$1.25 million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing
advance. [6] [1]  By this time, Lavigne had found
that she fit in naturally with her hometown high school's skater clique, an
image that carried through to her first album, but although she enjoyed  skateboarding , school left her feeling
insecure. Armed with a record deal, she dropped out to focus on her music
career, [5]  but she still had to inform her
parents of her decision. "I wasn't going to turn [the record deal] down.
It's been my dream all my life. They knew how much I wanted this and how much
I've put into it." [16] [8]
Reid gave A&R
Joshua Sarubin the responsibility for overseeing Lavigne's development and the
recording of her debut album. [17]  They spent several months in
New York working with different co-writers trying to forge an individual sound
for her. Sarubin told  HitQuarters  that
for while they struggled finding her sound and although early collaborations
with songwriter-producers including Sabelle Breer, Curt Frasca and Peter Zizzo
resulted in some good songs, they didn't match her and her voice. [17]  It was only when Lavigne then
went to Los Angeles in May 2001 and created two songs with  The Matrix  production
team – including "Complicated" – that the record company felt she had
made a major breakthrough. [17]  Lavigne then worked further
with The Matrix and also with singer-songwriter Cliff Magness. Recording
finished in January 2002. [17]
Lavigne released her
debut album,  Let Go , on 4 June 2002 in the U.S., where it reached
No. 2 on the  Billboard  200. It peaked at No. 1 on the
Australian, Canadian, and UK charts. This made Lavigne, at 17 years old, the
youngest female soloist to have a No. 1 album in the UK until that time. [18]  By the end of 2002, the album
was certified four-times platinum by the RIAA, making her the bestselling
female artist of 2002 and  Let Go  the top-selling debut of the
year. [19]  By May 2003,  Let Go  had
accumulated over 1,000,000 sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification
from the  Canadian
Recording Industry Association . [20]  As of 2009, the album has sold
over 16 million units worldwide, [21]  and the RIAA has certified the
album six-times platinum, denoting shipments of over six million units in the
U.S. [22]
“
I don't get overwhelmed, just because I feel like
I've kind of prepared myself for it. All my life this is what I've wanted,
what I've dreamed about, and I knew this would happen. I've been singing ever
since I was really young and I've wanted this so bad, and I told myself I
would do it.
”
Lavigne's debut
single and the album's  lead single ,
"Complicated", peaked at No. 1 in Australia and No. 2 in the U.S.
"Complicated" was one of the bestselling Canadian singles of 2002,
and it was also featured on the teen television show,  Dawson's Creek . "Complicated"
later ranked on the  Hot 100 Singles of the Decade  list at No.
83. [23]
Subsequent singles,
"Sk8er Boi" and "I'm With You" reached the top ten in the
U.S. [24]  Thanks to the success of her
first three singles, Lavigne was the second artist in history to have three No.
1 songs from a debut album on the  Billboard   Mainstream Top 40 . [25]  For the music video to
"Complicated", Lavigne was named  Best
New Artist  at the 2002  MTV Video Music
Awards . [26]  She won four  Juno Awards  in 2003 out of six nominations, [27]  received a  World Music Award  for "World's
Bestselling Canadian Singer", and was nominated for eight  Grammy Awards , including  Best New
Artist  and  Song of
the Year  for "Complicated" (2003). [28]
In 2002, Lavigne made
a cameo appearance in the music video to " Hundred Million " by the  pop punk  band  Treble Charger . [29]  In March 2003, Lavigne posed
for the cover of  Rolling Stone  magazine [30] and, later in May, [31]  performed " Fuel " during MTV's Icon tribute to  Metallica . [32]  During her first headlining
tour, the  Try To Shut Me Up
Tour , Lavigne covered  Green Day 's " Basket Case ". [33]
Lavigne was featured
in the 2003 game,  The Sims: Superstar ,
as a  non-playable
celebrity . [34]
2004–05:  Under My Skin

My Skin (Avril Lavigne album)
Lavigne
in  Vancouver, Canada during
the Live and By Surprise mall tour
Lavigne co-wrote
" Breakaway "
with Matthew Gerard, which was recorded by  Kelly Clarkson  for the soundtrack to the
2004 film  The
Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement . [35]  "Breakaway" would
later be included on Clarkson's  second
album  and released as the album's lead single. Lavigne covered
the Goo Goo Dolls song "Iris", performed with the band's lead
singer  John Rzeznik  at  Fashion Rocks , [36]  and she posed for the cover
of  Maxim  in
October 2004. [37]  She also recorded the theme
song for  The
SpongeBob SquarePants Movie . "I made the song a little more
edgy", Lavigne said. "There are a lot of loud guitars, and we picked
the tempo up a little and sang it with a little more attitude." Lavigne
rearranged the song with the help of producer Butch Walker. [38]
Lavigne's second
studio album,  Under My Skin , was released on 25 May 2004, debuting
at No. 1 in several countries, including Australia, Mexico, Canada, Japan, the
UK, and the U.S. [39]  The album has sold more than
10 million copies. Lavigne wrote most of the album's tracks with Canadian
singer-songwriter  Chantal Kreviazuk .
Kreviazuk's husband,  Our Lady Peace  front
man  Raine Maida , co-produced the album, along
with  Butch Walker  and
Don Gilmore. Lavigne went on the Live and By Surprise twenty-one-city mall tour
in the U.S. and Canada to promote the album, accompanied by her
guitarist,  Evan Taubenfeld .
Each performance consisted of a short live acoustic set of songs from the new
album. At the end of 2004, Lavigne embarked on her first world tour, the  Bonez Tour , which had stopovers in almost
every continent and lasted for the entire 2005 year.
“
This record definitely proves that I'm a writer and
people can't knock that, because each song comes from a personal experience
of mine, and there are so much emotions in those songs.
”
" Don't
Tell Me ", the lead single of the album, went to No. 1 in
Argentina and Mexico and reached the top five in the UK and Canada and the top
ten in Australia and Brazil. "My Happy Ending", the album's second
single, went to No. 1 in Mexico and the top five in the UK and Australia. In
the U.S., it reached the top ten of the  Billboard  Hot 100 and
went to No. 1 in the Mainstream Top 40, making it her fourth-biggest hit there.
The third single, " Nobody's
Home ", did not make the top 40 in the U.S., reaching No. 1 only
in Mexico and Argentina. The fourth single from the album, " He Wasn't ", reached top 40 positions in
the UK and Australia and was not released in the U.S. [41]
Lavigne won two World
Music Awards in 2004 for "World's Best Pop/Rock Artist" and
"World's Bestselling Canadian Artist". She received five Juno Award
nominations in 2005, and picked up three, including "Artist of the
Year". She won the award for "Favorite Female Singer" at the
eighteenth annual  Nickelodeon
Kids' Choice Awards [42]  and was nominated in every MTV
Award show shown around the world.

On 26 February 2006,
Lavigne represented Canada at the  closing
ceremony of the Torino Olympics , performing her song "Who
Knows" during the eight minute  Vancouver 2010  portion. [43]
While Lavigne was in
the studio for her third studio album,  Fox Entertainment
Group  approached her to write a song for the soundtrack to the
2006 fantasy-adventure film  Eragon . She wrote and recorded two
"ballad-type" songs, but only one, " Keep Holding On ", was used for the film. [44]  Lavigne admitted that writing
the song was challenging, making sure it flowed with the film. She emphasized
that "Keep Holding On", which later appeared on the album, was not
indicative of what the next album would be like. [45] [46]
Lavigne
in 2008 performing in the Netherlands.
Lavigne's third
album,  The Best Damn Thing , was released on 17 April 2007, which
Lavigne immediately promoted with a small tour. Its lead single, " Girlfriend ",
topped the  Billboard  Hot 100 the same week  The Best
Damn Thing  debuted at No. 1 on the  Billboard  200
chart. "Girlfriend" was Lavigne's first single to reach this No. 1
position. [47]  The single was a worldwide
hit; it also peaked at No. 1 in Australia, Canada, Japan, and Italy and reached
No. 2 in the UK and France. "Girlfriend" was recorded in Spanish,
French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Japanese, and Mandarin. The  International
Federation of the Phonographic Industry  ranked
"Girlfriend" as the most-downloaded track worldwide in 2007, selling
7.3 million copies, including the versions recorded in eight different
languages. [48] [12]  "Girlfriend" ranked
on the  Hot 100 Singles of the Decade  list at No. 94. [49]
" When
You're Gone ", the second single, went to No. 3 in the UK, the
top five in Australia and Italy, the top ten in Canada, and was close to
reaching the top twenty in the U.S. In December 2007, Lavigne, with annual
earnings of $12 million, was ranked number eight in the  Forbes  "Top 20 Earners Under 25". [50] " Hot "
was the third single and has been Lavigne's least successful single in the
U.S., charting only at No. 95. In Canada, "Hot" made the top ten, and
in Australia, the top 20.  The Best Damn Thing  has sold over 6
million copies worldwide.
During this era,
Lavigne won nearly every award she was nominated for, including two  World Music Awards  for
"World's Bestselling Canadian Artist" and "World's Best Pop/Rock
Female Artist". She took her first two  MTV Europe Music
Awards , received one  Teen Choice Awards  for
"Summer Single", and was nominated for five Juno awards.
In mid-2007, Lavigne
was featured in a two-volume  graphic novel ,  Avril
Lavigne's Make 5 Wishes . She collaborated with artist  Camilla D’Errico  and
writer Joshua Dysart  on the  manga ,
which was about a shy girl named Hana who, upon meeting her hero Avril Lavigne,
learned to overcome her fears. Lavigne said, "I know that many of my fans
read manga, and I'm really excited to be involved in creating stories that I
know they will enjoy." The volumes were released on 10 April (one week
prior to the release of  The Best Damn Thing ) and in July,
respectively. The publication  Young Adult
Library Services  nominated the series for "Great
Graphic Novels for Teens". [51]
In March 2008,
Lavigne undertook a world tour named The Best Damn Tour to support the album.
In that same month, she also appeared on the cover of  Maxim  for
the second time of her career. [52]  In mid-August, Malaysia's
Islamic opposition party, the  Pan-Malaysian
Islamic Party , attempted to ban Lavigne's show in  Kuala Lumpur , judging her stage moves
"too sexy". Her concert on 29 August was considered as promoting
wrong values ahead of Malaysia's independence day on 31 August. [53]  On 21 August 2008, MTV
reported that the concert had been approved by the Malaysian government. [54]
2009–11:  Goodbye Lullaby
Main
article:  Goodbye Lullaby
Lavigne
singing in Florida during her  Black Star Tour , May 2011.
Only a month after
completing The Best Damn Tour, Lavigne began recording in her home studio in
November 2008 with the song "Black Star", [55]  written to help promote her
first fragrance of the same name. [56]  By July 2009, nine tracks had
been recorded for the new album, [55]  including the songs
"Fine", "Everybody Hurts" and "Darlin". Several
of the tracks were written in Lavigne's youth. "Darlin" was the
second song Lavigne wrote as a 15-year-old while living in Napanee, Ontario.
Lavigne described the album as being about "life". She stated,
"It's so easy for me to do a boy-bashing pop song, but to sit down and
write honestly about something that's really close to me, something I've been
through, it's a totally different thing." [56]  With the exception of the
album's lead single, " What the Hell ",
Lavigne described the songs on the album as different from her earlier
material: "I'm older now, so I think that comes across in my music, it's
not as  pop-rock ". [57]
In January 2010,
while simultaneously writing and recording for her new album, Lavigne worked
with  Disney  clothing designs inspired by  Tim Burton 's feature film,  Alice in
Wonderland . She asked the executives if she could write a song
for the film. The result was the song " Alice ", [58]  which was played over the end
credits [59]  and included on the
soundtrack,  Almost Alice . [60]
On 28 February,
Lavigne gave a performance at the concert portion of the Vancouver  2010
Winter Olympics closing ceremony , performing "My Happy Ending"
and "Girlfriend". [61]  Lavigne was honoured to
perform at the ceremonies, but she regretted not being able to attend the U.S.
vs. Canada hockey match. "They had us on lockdown. We weren't allowed to
leave our trailers, for security purposes." [62]
In September 2010,
Lavigne's third single from her debut album, "I'm With You", was sampled
by  Rihanna  on the track " Cheers (Drink to
That) ", which is featured on Rihanna's fifth studio
album,  Loud . [63] [64]  In August 2011, she was
featured in the music video for Cheers (Drink To That). "It's exciting to
me because that was always one of my favorite songs, and for it to come out 10
years ago and so now to have it sampled and back out on the radio is pretty
dope". [65]  In December 2010, American
singer  Miranda Cosgrove  released
" Dancing Crazy ", a song written by
Lavigne,  Max Martin  and  Shellback .
It was also produced by Martin. [66]  On 23 September 2011, Lavigne
appeared in the  Hub network  show  Majors & Minors  as a guest
mentor, alongside other singers including  Adam Lambert  and  Leona Lewis . About the show, Lavigne stated,
"I sang for them, and they performed for me. I was just blown away. I got
to talk to them about music and the music industry, and they were all just so
excited". [65]
The release dates
for  Goodbye Lullaby  and its lead single were pushed back
several times. In response to these delays, Lavigne said, "I write my own
music and, therefore, it takes me longer to put out records 'cause I have to
live my life to get inspiration", [67]  and that she had enough
material for two records. [67]  In November, Lavigne was
featured in  Maxim ,
where she revealed that  Goodbye Lullaby took two and a half years to
complete, [68]  but she cited her record company
as the reason for the album's delays, stating that the album had been completed
for a year. [69]   Goodbye Lullaby  was
released on 8 March. [70] [57]  The lead single, "What
the Hell", premiered on  Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve  on
31 December. [70]
2011–present: Fifth studio album
Three months after
the release of  Goodbye Lullaby , Lavigne announced that work on her
fifth studio album had already begun, with eight songs written so far. The new
album will musically be the opposite of  Goodbye Lullaby . Lavigne
explained, "[ Goodbye Lullaby ] was more mellow, [but] the next one
will be pop and more fun again. I already have a song that I know is going to
be a single, I just need to re-record it!" [71] [72] [73]  Later, in July 2011, Lavigne
revealed the title of two of the songs from her fifth album as "Fine"
and "Gone". The tracks were originally recorded for  Goodbye
Lullaby  but never made the final cut. It has also been confirmed that
Lavigne is working with music production duo  The Runners  on the upcoming album.  [74]  In March 2012, Lavigne was in
the studio, working with Chad Kroeger ,
member of rock band  Nickelback , and  David Hodges , former member of rock band  Evanescence .  [75]
Lavigne's fifth album
is rumoured to be released in 2012; however, no release date has yet been
confirmed by Lavigne or her record label. [76]  In October 2011, Lavigne
stated in an interview with  Virgin Radio 96  that
she would begin production on the album by January 2012. [65]  In late 2011, Lavigne
confirmed that she had moved to  Epic Records , which is now headed by  L.A. Reid . [77] [78]
Musical style and songwriting
Themes in Lavigne's
music include messages of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view. [79]  Lavigne believes her
"songs are about being yourself no matter what and going after your dreams
even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going
to come true." [80]  On her debut album,  Let
Go , Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as " Losing Grip ", instead of her more
radio-friendly singles, such as " Complicated ",
saying that "the songs I did with  the
Matrix ... were good for my first record, but I don't want to be that
pop anymore." [81]  Lavigne's second album,  Under
My Skin , had deeper personal themes underlying each song. Lavigne
explained, "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about....
Like boys, like dating or relationships". [82]  In contrast, her third
album,  The Best Damn Thing , was not personal to her. "Some of
the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal
thing I'm going through." [83]  Her objective in writing the
album was simply to "make it fun". [84]   Goodbye Lullaby ,
Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records, [55]  with Lavigne describing the
album as "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very
emotional". [85]
Growing up, Lavigne
listened to  Blink-182 ,  Goo Goo Dolls ,  Matchbox Twenty  and  Shania Twain , [81]  and her influences
include  Courtney Love  and  Janis Joplin . [82] Because of these influences, musical
genres, and her personal style, the media often defined her as  punk , something she denied being. Lavigne’s
close friend and guitarist,  Evan Taubenfeld , said, "It's a very
touchy subject to a lot of people, but the point is that Avril isn't punk, but
she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk
music and the media ended up doing the rest". [86]  Lavigne also commented on the
matter: "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [a] rebel... punk,
and I am  so  not any of them." [40]
“
I know my fans look up to me and that's why I make
my songs so personal; it's all about things I've experienced and things I
like or hate. I write for myself and hope that my fans like what I have to
say.
”
Most of critics
identify Lavigne as some form between teen pop and pop-punk: Publications such
as  The New York Times ,  Rolling Stone ,  NME ,  MusicMight ,  IGN  and  Popmatters  have identified Avril
Lavigne as a mix of  rock ,  teen pop  and  pop-punk . [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92]
While Lavigne denied
being angry, her interviews were still passionate about the media's lack of
respect for her songwriting. "I am a writer, and I won't accept people
trying to take that away from me", adding that she had been writing
"full-structured songs" since she was 14. [40]  Despite this, Lavigne’s songwriting
has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio, the Matrix,
with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, claimed that they were the
main songwriters of Lavigne’s singles, "Complicated", " Sk8er Boi " and " I'm with You ".
Lavigne denied this, asserting that she was the primary songwriter for every
song on the album. "[N]one of those songs aren't from me". [81]  In 2007,  Chantal Kreviazuk , who wrote with Lavigne on
her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism [93]  and criticized her
songwriting. "Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or
anything". [94]  Lavigne also disclaimed this,
and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for "clear
defamation" against her character. [94]  Kreviazuk later apologized:
"Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work
with her". [93]  Shortly after that, Tommy
Dunbar, founder of the 1970s band, the  Rubinoos , sued Lavigne, her publishing
company, and  Lukasz "Dr. Luke"
Gottwald  for allegedly stealing parts of "I Wanna Be Your
Boyfriend" for her song "Girlfriend". [95] Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating,
"me and Avril wrote the song together…. It has the same chord progressions
as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you'd find in a  Sum 41  song. It's the  Sex Pistols , not the Rubinoos." [94]  In January 2008, the lawsuit
was closed after a confidential settlement had been reached. [96]
Other work
Film career
Lavigne became
interested in appearing on television and in feature films. The decision, she
said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos
would be to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed
any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video
"Nobody's Home" involved the most "acting". [80]  Her first television
appearance was in a 2002 episode of  Sabrina,
the Teenage Witch , [97]  performing "Sk8er
Boi" [98]  with her band in a nightclub. [99]  She later made a cameo
appearance in the 2004 film  Going the
Distance . The main characters bump into her backstage at
the  MuchMusic Video
Awards [100]  after her performance of
"Losing Grip". [101]
Lavigne
at the Los Angeles premiere of  Over the Hedge  on
30 April 2006.
She moved into
feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin
with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role,
Lavigne travelled to  New Mexico [102]  to film a single scene in the
2007 film,  The Flock . [103]  She starred as Beatrice Bell,
the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside  Claire Danes  and  Richard Gere . Gere gave Lavigne acting tips
between takes. [103]  On her role in  The
Flock , Lavigne said, "I did that just to see how it was and to not
jump into [mainstream acting] too fast". [80]   The Flock  would
not be released in American theatres, and because it would not be released in
foreign markets until late 2007, it would not be considered Lavigne's debut.
The film made $7 million in the foreign box office. [104]
Lavigne's feature
film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film  Over the Hedge ,
based on the  comic strip of the same name .
She voiced the character Heather, a  Virginia Opossum . Recording the characters'
voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, "All
the actors went in individually, and [director]  Tim  and
[screenwriter  Karey ] and
directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so
smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part,
going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of." [105]  Lavigne found the recording
process to be "easy" and "natural", but she kept hitting
the microphone as she gestured while acting. "I'd use my hands constantly
and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to
tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs
and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body
still." Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her
rock-star status. "[The director] thought I'd give my character... a bit
of attitude". [80]  The film opened on 19 May
2006, making $38 million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross
$336 million worldwide. [106]
In December 2005,
Lavigne signed on to appear in  Fast Food Nation , based on the
book  Fast Food Nation: The Dark
Side of the All-American Meal . [107]  The fictionalized adaptation,
directed by  Richard Linklater ,
traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the
slaughterhouses. [108]  Lavigne starred in her
on-screen acting debut [109]  as a high school student
intent on freeing the cows. [110]  The film opened on 17
November 2006 and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2 million
worldwide. [111]
Both  Over the
Hedge  and  Fast Food Nation  opened at the 2006  Cannes Film Festival ,
which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was
proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that
she wanted to take her time and wait for the "right parts and the right
movies." Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. "I wanted to
start off small and to learn [that] I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a
big part." [80]  In August 2006,  Canadian Business  magazine ranked her
as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking
Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet
hits, TV mentions, and press hits. [112]
Fashion design
In July 2008, Lavigne
launched the clothing line  Abbey Dawn , featuring a back-to-school
collection. [12]  It is produced by  Kohl's , which is the brand's exclusive U.S.
retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by
Lavigne herself. [113] [114]  Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn
as a "juniors lifestyle brand", [12]  which incorporates skull,
zebra, and star patterns, purples and "hot pinks and blacks".
Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various
concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely
licensing her name to the collection. "I actually am the designer. What's
really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try
everything on and approve it all." [115]  The clothing line
incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, "after the release of my
first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical
career". [65]
“
I just love clothes and colors and patterns. I'm
very visual and very hands-on.
”
—Avril Lavigne,  Billboard [116]
The designs were also
featured on the Internet game  Stardoll , where figures can be dressed up
as Avril Lavigne. [117]  On 14 September 2009, Lavigne
took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the  New York Fashion Week , [118]  returning in 2011. [65]  In December 2010, the clothing
line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official
website. [119] [85]  "It's fun to be a chick
and design clothes and things I'd like for myself. I design things I [can't]
find." [62]  At the end of 2008, Lavigne
signed a contract with  Canon  Canada to appear in advertising
campaigns and commercials to promote the latest line of cameras and a full
range of other accessories. [120]
Lavigne released her
first fragrance,  Black Star ,
created by  Procter & Gamble  Prestige
Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on 7 March
2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark
chocolate, was released in summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the U.S. and
Canada. [121]  When asked what the name
meant, Lavigne replied, "I wanted [the bottle] to be a star, and my colors
are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out
in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about
following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are." [122]  Black Star won the 2010 Best
"Women's Scent Mass" by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW). [123]  Black Star was followed by a
second fragrance in July 2010, [124]   Forbidden Rose , which took two years to
develop. [125]  It features notes of red
apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline
agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla. [124]  Its message is an extension
of Black Star's "follow your dreams", [126]  though the tagline for the
new perfume is "Dare to Discover". [127]  The commercial takes place in
a  gothic  garden
setting, [126]  where Lavigne, upon entering
the garden, finds a single, purple rose. [127]  Lavigne launched a third
fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late
2010. [85]  The tagline for the fragrance
is "Dare to discover more". [128]  It features notes of
mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk,
sandalwood and crème brûlée. [129]
In January 2010,
Lavigne began working with Disney to incorporate  Alice in Wonderland -inspired
designs into her Abbey Dawn line of clothing. [58]  Her designs were exhibited at
the  Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising  in
California beginning in May through September, alongside  Colleen Atwood 's costumes from the 2010 film. [130]
Philanthropy
Lavigne has been
involved with many charities, including  Make
Some Noise, Amnesty International , Erase MS, AmericanCPR.org, Camp
Will-a-Way, Music Clearing Minefields,  U.S. Campaign for
Burma ,  Make-a-Wish
Foundation  and  War Child .
She has also appeared in  ALDO  ads with
YouthAIDS to raise money to educate people worldwide about HIV/AIDS. Lavigne
took part in the Unite Against AIDS concert presented by ALDO in support of
Unicef on 28 November 2007 at the  Bell Centre  in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. [131]  In November 2010, Lavigne
attended the  Clinton Global
Initiative . [132]
Lavigne worked
with  Reverb , a
non-profit environmental organization, for her 2005 east coast tour. [133]  She covered " Knockin' on
Heaven's Door " for War Child's  Peace Songs  compilation,
and she recorded a cover of the  John Lennon  song " Imagine " as her contribution to the
compilation album  Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save
Darfur . Released on 12 June 2007, the album was produced to
benefit  Amnesty International 's
campaign to alleviate the  crisis in Darfur . [134]
On 5 December 2009,
Lavigne returned to the stage in  Mexico City  during the biggest charity
event in Latin America, " Teleton ".
She performed acoustic versions of her hits "Complicated" and
"Girlfriend" with Evan Taubenfeld and band member,  Jim McGorman . [135]  In 2010, Lavigne was one
of  several artists who
contributed their voices to a cover of  K'naan 's "Wavin' Flag" as a benefit
single to help raise money for several charity organizations related to the
2010 Haiti earthquake. [136]
On 14 September 2010,
Lavigne introduced her charity, "The Avril Lavigne Foundation". The
next day, the foundation's official website was launched. The foundation aims
to help young people with serious illnesses and disabilities [132] [137]  and works with leading
charitable organizations; [119]  The foundation partners with
the  Easter Seals ,
Make-A-Wish foundation and Erase MS, [138]  the latter two being
charities Lavigne has previously worked with. Her work with the Make-A-Wish
foundation was the inspiration behind her own charity, with Lavigne stating,
"I just really wanted to do more". [137]  Lavigne said on the
foundation's website, "I have always looked for ways to give back because
I think it’s a responsibility we all share". [139]  Philanthropist Trevor
Neilson's 12-person firm, " Global
Philanthropy Group ", advises Lavigne with her foundation as
well as several other celebrities, including musician  John Legend . [132]
Personal life
Public image
“
I have to fight to keep my image really  me ....
I rejected some gorgeous publicity shots because they just didn't look like
me. I won't wear skanky clothes that show my booty, my belly or my boobs. I
have a great body.
”
When Lavigne first
gained publicity, she was known for her  tomboyish  style, [140]  in particular her
necktie-and-tank-top combinations. [141] [142]  She preferred baggy clothes,
skater shoes or  Converses , [62]  wristbands, and sometimes
shoelaces wrapped around her fingers. [7]  During photo shoots, instead of
wearing "glittery get-ups", she preferred wearing "old, crumpled
T's". [5]  In response to her fashion and
musical influences, the media would call her the " pop
punk princess ". [143] [144]  Press and fans regarded her
as the  "anti-Britney" ,
in part because of her less commercial and "real" image, but also
because she was noticeably headstrong. "I’m not made up and I’m not being
told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which
I’m not." [7]  By November 2002, however,
Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was "wearing a
costume". [6]  Lavigne made a conscious effort
to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career. "I'm
just saying, I don't want to sell sex. I feel that's sort of lame and low. I've
got so much more to say." [145]
Lavigne eventually
took on a more  gothic  style
as she began her second album,  Under My Skin , trading her skating
outfits for black  tutus [144]  and earning an image marked
by  angst . [146]  During  The Best Damn
Thing  years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with
a pink streak, wore feminine outfits, [147]  including "tight jeans
and heels", [62]  and modelled for magazines
such as Harper's Bazaar . [140]  Lavigne defended her new
style: "I don't really regret anything. You know, the ties and the
wife-beaters and all... It had its time and place. And now I'm all grown up,
and I've moved on". [147]  She now tries to eat healthy
foods and practises yoga, soccer, surfing, rollerblading, and street hockey. [62]
Tattoos
Only a few of
Lavigne's tattoos are unique to her; the rest are matched with those of her
friends. [62]  Lavigne had a star tattooed on
the inside of her left wrist that was created at the same time as friend and
musical associate  Ben Moody 's identical
tattoo. [148]  In late 2004, she had a small
pink heart around the letter "D" applied to her right wrist, which
represented her then-boyfriend, Deryck Whibley. [62] [149]  Lavigne and then-husband
Whibley got matching tattoos in March 2010, in celebration of his 30th
birthday. [62]  In April, Lavigne added
another tattoo on her wrist: that of a lightning bolt and the number 30. [150]
“
Everything is always spur-of-the-moment. All of my
tattoos, I decide that second and do it.
”
Her love of tattoos,
however, gained media attention in May 2010, after Lavigne and Jenner each got
matching tattoos of the word "fuck" on their ribs. [151] [152]  Lavigne appeared in the
June/July cover story for  Inked   magazine ,
where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an "Abbey
Dawn" on her left forearm and an "XXV" and star on her right.
Although she confirmed the "fuck" tattoo verbally in the article
(calling it her "favorite word" [62] ) she had it applied after the
magazine's photo shoot. [153]  She added that she eventually
wanted to get a "big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name.... I'm
going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait
for that special someone to come back into my life." [62] In July 2010, Lavigne had her
boyfriend's name, "Brody", tattooed beneath her right breast. [154]
Marriage to Deryck Whibley
Lavigne's
ex-husband, Deryck Whibley
Lavigne and  Deryck Whibley , lead singer and guitarist for
the band  Sum 41 , began dating when she was 19 years
old, after being friends since she was 17. [155]  Only a few weeks before they
met, Lavigne admitted that she was not meeting boys because her bodyguards were
frightening them away. In June 2005, Whibley surprised Lavigne with a trip
to  Venice , including a  gondola  ride and a romantic picnic, and
on 27 June, he proposed to her. [156]
She at first wanted
to have a "rock n' roll, goth wedding", but she admitted to having
doubts about going against tradition. "I've been dreaming about my wedding
day since I was a little girl. I have to wear the white dress.... People
thought that I would [wear a] black wedding dress, and I would have. But at the
same time, I was thinking about the wedding pictures, and I wanted to be in
style. I didn't want to be thinking, 20 years later, 'Oh, why did I wear my
hair like that?'" [157]
The wedding was held
on 15 July 2006. About 110 guests attended the wedding, which was held at a
private estate in  Montecito, California . [158]  Lavigne, wearing a gown
designed by  Vera Wang  walked
down the aisle with her father, Jean-Claude, to  Mendelssohn 's " Wedding March ".
Lavigne chose a colour theme of red and white, including red rose petals and
centrepieces of distinctly coloured flowers. The wedding included cocktails for
an hour before the reception and a sit-down dinner. The song " Iris ",
by the  Goo Goo Dolls , was
played during Lavigne and Whibley's first dance. [159]
Seven months into
their marriage, Lavigne stated that she was "the best thing that's ever
happened to him", and suggested that she helped Whibley stay off drugs
since they had begun dating. "He doesn't do drugs. Clearly, he used to,
because he talked about it, but I wouldn't be with someone who did, and I made
that very clear to him when we first started dating. I've never done cocaine in
my life, and I'm proud of that. I am 100 percent against drugs." [157]  The marriage lasted a little
more than three years. It was announced on 17 September 2009 that Lavigne and
Whibley had split up and that divorce papers would soon follow. [160]  On 9 October 2009, Lavigne
filed for divorce, releasing the statement, "I am grateful for our time
together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship." [155]  The divorce was finalized on
16 November 2010, officially ending the marriage. [161]
