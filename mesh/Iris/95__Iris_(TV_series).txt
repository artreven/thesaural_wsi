VIP, here is your lovely BIG BANG's Profile..^^
Big Bang
( Korean :
빅뱅 ), commonly stylized as
BIGBANG , is a
South Korean
hip-hop
boy band . The group's formation was chronicled on the television series
Big Bang Documentary ,
from July to August 2006. The show was also aired online on GomTV and
on MTV Korea. Initially a six-member group, one member got eliminated
out during the airing of the show before the official debut leading to
their current line-up of
G-Dragon ,
T.O.P ,
Taeyang ,
Daesung
and
Seungri . Signed to
YG Entertainment , Big Bang went on to release successful singles and
EPs . Their first release, the EP
Always
(2007), spawned the number-one single "Lies" ( Korean :
거짓말 ;
Revised Romanization :
Geojitmal ). Their follow-up EPs
Hot Issue
and
Stand Up
were similarly successful.After they received the "Artist of the Year" award from the
M.net KM Music Festival
and the Seoul Gayo Daesang Award, the group expanded their activities
into Japan, releasing mini-albums and airplay singles. Their material
would not receive major promotion until the following year with the
release of their first physical Japanese single, " My Heaven ". By the end of 2009, Big Bang became the most searched artist in South Korea.
They also became the first foreign group in Japan to receive the Japan
Cable Broadcasting Award for "Best Newcomer", and the first from Korea
to receive the Japan Records award.
In recent years, the members have
branched out to do solo activities:
Taeyang and G-Dragon have released
solo materials while T.O.P, Daesung
and Seungri have started acting. 2005–2006: Formation and Early projects Before the group's debut, several members already had exposure in the entertainment industry. Leader
G-Dragon
and lead vocalist
Taeyang , signed with
YG Entertainment
since they were both thirteen years old, were known as GD and YB.
T.O.P
was an underground rapper
under the stage name T.E.M.P.O. Big Bang made their debut on August
19,
2006 at the Gymnastics Arena in Seoul Olympic Park during the YG
Family
concert. Following the performance, the group's first single, " Bigbang ", was released. It contained the songs "We Belong Together," "A Fool's Only Tears" (Korean:
눈물뿐인 바보 ; Revised Romanization:
Nunmulppunin Babo ), and "This Love", a cover of the
American
rock band
Maroon 5
song . The single debuted with over 17,000 copies sold in the month of August and later went on to sell nearly 40,000 copies. The second single, " BigBang Is V.I.P ", was released in September, selling 21,000 copies that month, and eventually topping 32,000 copies sold. The last single, " Bigbang 03 ", followed, with final sales nearing 40,000 copies. At the end of December 2006, Big Bang held their first concert,
The Real . The following month, their debut album,
Since 2007 , was released, selling 48,009 copies by the end of February 2007.
2007–2008: Breakthrough success On February 8, 2007, Big Bang released their live concert album,
The First / Real Live Concert , which sold 30,000 copies by the end of the year. The group also began their
Want You
tour, visiting five cities:
Incheon ,
Daegu ,
Changwon ,
Jeonju
and
Busan . Their first mini-album,
Always ,
was also released in 2007, and marked several changes for the group.
Though previously already writing and composing, the group has decided
to take more control over their music. G-Dragon composed and wrote most
of the tracks included in their first mini album release including the
title hit single Lies.  The mini-album also saw the introduction of
electronic music
for Big Bang. Receptions were fairly positive, most notably in regards to the song "Lies" (Korean:
거짓말 ; Revised Romanization:
Geojitmal ). Released as the lead single, it became their first #1 hit. Their second mini album,
Hot Issue , released that same year, was also fairly successful: the lead-single, "Last Farewell", (Korean:
마지막 인사 ; Revised Romanization:
Majimak Insa )
topped various charts, including the Juke-On's chart for eight
consecutive weeks. It also won the "Song of the Month Digital Music
Award" from
Cyworld . Tickets for their
Big Bang Is Great
concert were also reportedly sold out in 10 minutes. Near the end of 2007, it was reported that members of the band were hospitalized from over-performing and exhaustion,
halting their promotional activities. Reports were later released that
Big Bang's albums and singles were in high demand, causing the record
company to reprint and repackage them for re-release.
Riding on the
success of their mini-album, the group collected numerous
awards
towards the end of the year, including "Best Male Group" and
"Song Of
The Year" from the 2007 M.NET/KM Music Festival. They later received the "Artist of the Year" award from the 17 th
Seoul Music Awards. As 2007 came to a close, Big Bang ventured overseas to
Japan . Their first Japanese
EP ,
For the World , released in early 2008, charted at #10 on the
Oricon
chart with little promotion. The group also held a concert at the
JCB Hall
in
Tokyo Dome City .
Big
Bang returned to Korea after promotions in Japan ended. Although
group
activities were delayed due to solo projects, their third
mini-album
of 2008,
Stand Up , was released. Featuring
Daishi Dance
and the Korean rock-band
No Brain
for several songs,
Stand Up
exceeded the 100,000 mark in sales. "Day By Day" (Korean:
하루하루 ; Revised Romanization:
Haru Haru ),
the lead single, topped several online charts and held the #1 position
for six consecutive weeks. Following the lead single's success, other
songs also charted within
the Top 20, with "Heaven" reaching #2, "Oh My
Friend" hitting #9, "A
Good Man" at #12, and "Lady" peaking at #16 — a
total of five songs in
the Top 20 for the group. During the release of their Korean materials, Big Bang released the Japanese song, "Number 1", from their
album of the same name , performing the song on Japanese radio programs and TV shows; the album peaked at No.3 on the Japan's
Oricon
daily album chart. Their Korean follow-up album,
Remember , also released in 2008, yielded the #1 single, "Sunset Glow" (Korean:
붉은노을 ; Revised Romanization:
Byulkeun Noeul ).
Strong Baby, Seungri's solo track and composed/written by fellow band
mate G-Dragon, was promoted in the first quarter of 2009. Though not
originally planned for promotion, it has garnered much popularity,
winning the maximum number of 3 wins in SBS Inkigayo, a weekend music
show, consecutively. It has also received awards in M Countdown and KBS
Music Bank. Big
Bang received their second "Artist of the Year" award from the 2008
M.NET KM Music Festival award ceremony. At the end of 2008, it was
reported that Big Bang earned a total of
₩ 36 billion ( USD$
24.5 million).
2009–2010: Solo and Japanese activities With the group on break in early 2009, the members pursued solo
activities. They later reunited to collaborate with their label's new
girl group
2NE1 , who had been dubbed "The Female Big Bang", for the song " Lollipop ".
A music video was also filmed for promotion. Initially used to promote a
cell phone, "Lollipop" reached the #1 spot on various online charts.
Their first
self-titled full-length Japanese album
was released under
Universal Music
in August 2009 and was promoted with two singles: " My Heaven " and " Gara Gara Go!! "
( ガラガラ GO!! ? ) .
"My Heaven", a Japanese translation of their Korean single, "Heaven", (Korean:
천국 ; Revised Romanization:
Cheonguk ) from
Stand Up , was composed by Japanese composer
Daishi Dance ,
and debuted at #3 on the Oricon Chart.
"Gara Gara Go!" charted at #5.
The album itself peaked at #3.
After their return to Korea, the members went back to their solo activities. On August 18, G-Dragon released his debut album,

title track .

Artistry and Influences
Throughout their career, Big Bang has received both praise and criticism.
Time
magazine described them as one of the "most promising" South Korean acts to venture into Japan,
while the
Korea Times
called them "the icons of Korean pop [music]".
Bill Lamb of
About.com
also list them as one of the "top 10 Asian boy bands".
Their contribution to their materials early in their career, most notably by G-Dragon, has garnered praises; singer
Baek Jiyoung
has state that she "like[s] idol singers if they are like Big Bang".
The group has been criticize for their over-use of electronic music.
Musical styles During the early days of their career, Big Bang's music was predominately
hip hop ,
although they incorporated R&B songs into their albums as well. A
writer for Yahoo! Japan once compared their early materials to that of
American
hip-hop artists such as the
Black-Eyed Peas , stating that their material included "catchy vocals, [...] rap and characters".
Always
was noted for its change of musical styles from their previous efforts, with the group experimenting with
electronic music
and setting it as the new music trend in Korea.
G-Dragon later stated that they hoped "to reach even more fans" with the new direction.
In 2008, they recorded "Oh My Friend", a
rock-based
song, with the Korean rock-band
No Brain .
In an interview, the group also expressed interests in covering the music genre
trot .
Members of the band have branched out to other styles for solo projects,
thus the group has been described as "rich in variety" for their fans.
Taeyang's mini-album,
Hot , was mainly a collection of R&B songs, with the singer stating that the genre was his "main focus".
Daesung's first digital single, "Look at Me, GwiSun" (Korean:
날 봐, 귀순 ), was a trot song, which drew criticisms due to Big Bang's image as "hip-hop artists". For his debut album,
Heartbreaker , G-Dragon incorporated a mix of
dance , hip-hop, and R&B songs.
Following the release of
Always , G-Dragon began involving himself with the production of the group's materials,
penning the lyrics and composing the songs "Lie", "Last Farewell", and "Day By Day". His involvement was praised by the
Korea Times , who described him as a "genius singer-songwriter". G-Dragon himself described the group as "an idol group not born of talent but through effort".
A writer for Yahoo! Japan complimented the group for their involvement
in their work, stating that "perhaps by [each of the members']
contributing to their own materials, not only do they become in sync
with one another, but each person's personality stands out."   Dance style Big Bang is
choreographed
by Shaun Evaristo.
While they once relied heavily on
street dancing
for their moves, Big Bang have made a transition towards more
choreography. Their dance moves have been widely copied and covered. One
of the moves, which incorporates the group lifting their shirts to
expose their abdomens, quickly gained popularity online and became one
of the top searches on the internet.
Another one, in which the group incorporates the idea of "jump roping" as a dance move, also gained attention from fans.
Image and cultural impact Big Bang's influence extends beyond the music industry, shaping major trends in the fashion industry.
Dubbed as "Big Bang fashion", their style has gained a following throughout Asia.
The group first adopted the "hip-hop" image concept for their debut. The release of
Always
in 2007 was accompanied by a change in image, with the group leaning towards a more
preppy - punk
style, including
skinny jeans
with
Converse
or high-top sneakers which became a still ongoing trend in South Korea. Taeyang also traded his
cornrows
for a
faux hawk .
Seen wearing brands such as
Bape , 10 deep,
Louis Vuitton , Jeremy Scott, and Phenomenon, Big Bang also wear custom printed
hoodies
for many of their performances and music videos.
They were also credited for bringing back "old school" fashion into the mainstream, such as
Nike
and
Reebok
high-top shoes. Described as the "most fashionable" one in the group,
G-Dragon is known to sport triangular scarves that were later nicknamed "Big Bang scarves".
T.O.P also gained a following for wearing
sunglasses
during performances.
The clothes that the members donned on stage have gained a cult among their fans and are sold in
boutique
stores such as DongDaeMun.
Big Bang have been endorsing
Fila
products since 2006,
as well as the Korean online
FPS
video game
Sudden Attack .
Other products and/or label that the group have been affiliated with is
Baskin Robbin’s, Skoolooks, LG CYON, and NII among others.
The group also released their own fragrance, "BB Bud's My First Fragrance" (Korean:
나의 첫번째 향기 ), in early 2007.
In 2009, they released their autobiography book
Shouting to the World , which became a best-seller.
Big Bang influenced the creation of the Chinese boy band OkBang, who
were described as having "many similarities to Big Bang in terms of
musical style, wardrobe and hairstyles".
In 2010, the group's
Big Show
concert was chosen by the South Korean Touristic Committee for their
Visit Korea from 2010—2012
campaign, stating that they will "have a big economic impact on the country".
In 2011, Big Bang collaborated with Japanese clothing retailer
Uniqlo
to create t-shirts in promotion of their Japanese comeback. It was
reported that the items were "sold out within 15 minutes of the store's
opening."
