Death, Dying and Life
Life seldom thinks of Death.
When it does, it often views the possibility as if it were a movie. And somehow we personally see ourselves as immune — unless, of course, we find ourselves actually dying. Humans live in the moment, and normally feel as though they are going to live forever. We all know that we are someday ''supposed'' to die, but we live as though death will never happen.From my personal view of the human spirit, life is eternal. We just change forms — or move into no form at all — but we continue. From Alpha to Omega, from the beginning to the end, we continue. And in the end there is always the beginning. Uroborus. [1] ''Continuing,'' however, can have many implications. Often, people — especially ill and depressed people — think only of dying itself and how it will affect them personally. They don't see the bigger picture of their lives. The Religious/Spiritual ViewAll over the world there are diverse religions and spiritual pathways which hold that death is not the end. Christians believe that Jesus realized he was the Son of God, and in so doing used a path of consciousness that resurrected his body from the dead. According to Christianity, Jesus consciously walked into the higher dimensions of life, where he remembered His immortality. We are invited to follow.Many other religions, such as Tibetian Buddism and most Hindu religions, believe in reincarnation, where the person who dies is reborn, entering a cycle that leads back to Earth — back into other human experiences where more is learned. The cycle continues until the disciple realizes Self and finds resurrection or ascension. In the Spirit of TruthIs it true, what so many billions of humans have believed from the beginning, that immortality is real?Some people believe the answer is no. They are certain that the ideas we are going to be discussing in this issue are the thoughts of crackpots. They think that ''immortality'' and ''God'' are concepts created by the human mind to give hope to a world that is actually controlled only by what they understand as ''cause and effect.''The spiritual worldview, the skeptics hold, gives hope and reason — but there is no proof. And so in their minds they see this manifestation that we call Reality as something that simply exists. It just ''is.'' There is no God to blame it on.But in fact there are no ''scientific'' proofs that affect the nature of Reality. Even hard science consists of theories. And yet, as we have put forth in past issues, even hard science now finds that its attempts to understand Reality come closer to the spiritual view than to any mechanistic explanation.So in this issue and the next, we are going to explore the possibilities, asking many well-known authors and personalities to share their beliefs and experiences, to open their hearts and give us the wisdom that they have learned and lived.This August issue will center on death, dying, and after-death experiences that are still linked to this plane. These are the aspects of death and dying that are actually part of this life, that are known and have been experienced by many. Unfortunately, however, these aspects are often regarded with fear. But it is my knowing that if dying were truly understood, it would be seen as beautiful, simply a transition to another birth in another world.Continuing next month, in September, we will gaze beyond the veil that soon falls when earthbound spirits leave this plane. We will listen to people from around the Earth to hear the wisdom they have learned about the cycles of rebirth, and what exists on the ''other side.'' This will include the ideas of reincarnation, resurrection, and ascension.Seeing through others' eyes can help prepare us, so that the journey we all must take will be lit with Love, rather than darkened in fear.Facing our fears may be one of the greatest first steps we can ever take. And Love just may be the greatest wisdom.
In love and service,Drunvalo read more:

And, upon the Earth the licking flames of the Wind dost consume all that which need not be any longer.
Tate is the Sacred Breath.
And this Rainbow Wind carries the power of Heyoka.
For with the Whirling Waters of Cosmic Breath dost come the Lightning Waters - the Coyote Kin, as well. Aquarius is here!
Therefore, Peoples, you must learn how to breathe with the Wind.
Prepare yourselves for the Lightning Waters.
These are Great Powers of Old that are now visiting the lands around the globe.
They are Fires of Spirit’s Breath - Silver Dragon of Wisdom--the Universal Breath.
[Whispered:]
Skan.
You must learn to breathe in a new way within thy Mind’s eye.
The Wind is here to open your True Sight.
The Wind is blowing down that straw that ties the Eye of forehead’s vision to the Well of Dreams of Grandmother Mystery and ties your medulla to your Heart.
This is your Sacred Breath, O Peoples, for you shall learn to breathe as the Wind.
This breath shall draw the fires from Heart into Grandmother’s presence, Unci, at the back of your head, and willst - through that sacred channel that dost awaken your Mind within - go forth to Eye of True Sight that is alive when your eyes close their lids.
Understand that the Sacred Breath of the Eye is the Vision of the Future; this is the Grandfathers’ Ways.
And so, from your Heart to the back of your head and through to the vision place of the Future Fathers, the Tunkasinas, breathe the Sacred Wind. So, too, let the Fire Breath of the Cosmic Winged Serpent - the Star Relations of galactic Love - breathe from ear to ear so that that which is Maka (to your left) - Mother and Woman and Holy - may touch and be one with the Wakan (that which is to your right)--the Father’s Law that teaches the Children well.
Thus, do breathe the Winds from ear to ear that that which is gentle is that which is strong.
Do breathe from the top of your head - the Kopavi - straight down into the Heart of Hearts that the airs of the Spirit - the thoughts of the Universe - may through your Mind circulate and into your thymus, Sacred Heart gravitate:

Dance of The Seven Veils
Dance of the Seven Veils What has been called a
Descent into the Underworld
is best defined as the seeking of wisdom and growth through a deep inner quest.
Many of those who have managed to (grudgingly) adapt themselves to our patriarchal society (and those who have been unable or refused to adapt), have repudiated their inherent feminine instincts and energy patterns, even as the culture has maimed most of the rest.
What is needed is a return to and the redemption of what the patriarchy has seen only as a dangerous threat.
The process requires both a sacrifice of our identity as spiritual daughters and sons of the patriarchy, and a descent into the spirit of the goddess.
The Biblical story of the Dance of the Seven Veils is, not surprisingly, a bastardization of the concept.
What was and is in all respects a non-sexual dance, was treated as such, and once again the stupidity of a male’s arrogance was ignored, while the blame was placed on a female and her feminine, bewitching, and irresistible wiles.
The fact that Adam could have refused Eve’s offering, so also could any king worthy of the name (other than perhaps Bill Clinton) have also refused a female’s attempt at sexual manipulation.
Instead, it needs to be recognized that the shedding of seven veils, even those strategically placed, is not a strip tease, but rather a letting go of outdated baggage.
To find sexual stimulation is to admit to being so sexually deprived and/or prudish as to find the nude body of a marble classic sculpture unaccountably arousing.
Get over it.
The more relevant “dance” is seeing through the veils and the illusions that separate us from knowledge, understanding, and wisdom.
The dropping of the veils one at a time is merely a device in which we can focus on different aspects of the overall illusions and weird
Paradigms , of which we would otherwise be blissfully ignorant.
This is especially important in terms of our world and society quite possibly making its own descent into Hades -- a scenario mentioned in the
Descent into the Underworld
essay.
Apparently, for whatever aim or purpose we may as a collective have unwittingly leaped, we seem to be barreling down a road with some fascinating speed bumps and other “traffic calming devices”.
Thus a “dance” with mundane applications is particularly relevant.
And in that category, Tom Robbins has done a notable service.
A significant portion of any Descent is the shedding of illusions.
This is described rather brilliantly by Tom Robbins in his book, Skinny Legs and All [Bantam Books, New York, 1990], specifically in what he calls The Dance of the Seven Veils.
The
illusion-destroying reality that Robbins describes in his version of the seven-veils-falling are:

Buoyancy. by Rumi
Love had taken away my practices and filled me with poetry. I tried to keep quietly repeating, No strength but yours, but I couldn't. I had to clap and sing. I used to be respectable and chaste and stable, but who can stand in this strong wind and remember those things? A mountain keeps an echo deep inside itself. That's how I hold your voice. I am scrap wood thrown in your fire, and quickly reduced to smoke. I saw you and became empty. This emptiness, more beautiful than existence, it obliterates existence, and yet when it comes, existence thrives and creates more existence! The sky is blue. The world is a blind man squatting on the road. But whomever sees your emptiness sees beyond blue and beyond the blind man. A great soul hides, like Muhammad, or Jesus, moving through a crowd in a city where no one knows him. To praise is to praise how one surrenders to the emptiness. To praise the sun is to praise your own eyes. Praise, the ocean. What we say, a little ship. So the sea-journey goes on, and who knows where? Just to be held by the ocean is the best luck we could have. It's a total waking up! Why should we grieve that we've been sleeping? It doesn't matter how long we've been unconscious. We're groggy, but let the guilt go. Feel the motions of tenderness around you, the buoyancy. ~ RUMI

Star, Sun, Sea ... Earth, Moon, Me
Star Sun, Sea … Earth, Moon, Me … David, Joyce, and Jan singing like Gypsies at the dinner table, and me like a Gypsy Ma Ma, who was happily drinking the wine with her loved ones, while her blood dancing the fire for this blissful moment -- After the workshop, David came to tell me -- That is total mastery.
“Yap! I am not afraid to go where it is needed! “ I answered in my usual confidence that sometimes made some “nice people” really, really mad. Why should I care about the opinions from "nice people? " They have never been through what I have been through, and they have to be political correct all the time ... Well, I know too much to be politically correct. It is good just be confident with what I know from my soul. David was used to my boldness. In some level he also knows that I just refuse to perform those social ritual of predictability.
Then I looked into David’s eyes, hard to believe that we have many years not seeing each other. I feel that we are still lived close by, that he and Joyce in 14 street E. and I lived in 9th street E, NYC. They have moved many times from NY to CT to CO ... and I? hum--- I don't even remember where was I, or who was I most of the time. When we leap in consciousness, we just don't live in yeasterday's realty any more. No matter how much we grow, or how fast we shifting our consciousness awareness, we have always been so close in our hearts, dimensionally.
“ Thank you for trusting me so much, David. “
“ Yes, I do trust you. There was a moment, I told myself -- gee, I have no idea what she is going to say, or going to do … “
I laughed too, because I had no ideas either. All I know was to be in the moment, to address what is hidden in the collective humanity, and to dance it out. I have seen too many spiritual people holding tears from the past that trapped them in the past. I was one of them.
David is the one who invited me to give a workshop for Emissaries of Divine Light. My heart is still beating with those amazing human beings, who are focused, caring, sincere, and devoted their lives to the spiritual growth of all beings ... My heart is still beating with their dance of facing the hidden selves in humanity, and the tears from the birth pain ... my heart ... is still beating ... with the cry of goddess and the screams from the wounded hero ... my heart ... is still beating ... with our pearly wisdom that used to be the bitter tears and sandy irritation ... My heart ... is still beating. Energy transmute itself, so there is no need to be afraid of our hidden selves. Anger, hatred, prejudice, self-righteous ... are all attitudes from repressed energy. When we dance, all is energy in motion, and we rebirth ourselves to be free like a child again. From this state, our intent is clear, and the manifestation is clear. This sounds very simple, like watching someone else dancing ballet. If it is really this simple, then everybody should be enlightened just by reading these words. In a way, it IS. A seed is a seed ... Dance is none verbal. Energy never lies, the same with body languages.
That was actually the best workshop I have ever given in my whole life, and I am amazed that I made it so simple after four years' disappered from a world that was only one of the infinite.
“ Can I have some wine? “ I ask David. “ Yes, we are going to have dinner together, and have some wine ..”
Wine, wine, divine. Star, Sun, Sea … Earth, Moon, Me …
This was the song David wrote years ago, and Joyce sang it in a concert we produced together. So good to be together, from the stars to the heart of every living wisdom.
Here we are together again -- Joyce sat like Mother Earth, Jan had much stories to tell … David had to make a phone call to another his loved one to share this moment in spirit. Jan was so beautiful and wise, I had such a great time laughing with her, even though I did not remember when she left. Joyce began looked like a moon to me, and David was still David. Before I put my boots on for my room, I asked --- “ hum!!! Where is my hat?” David and Joyce both said together: “ You just gave it to Jan. “ This time, even David looked like a moon, I saw two moon smiling at me, like twins … Love, it is all about love, not necessary lovers, but love ...
Oh, my eternal beloved, I am deeply in love with whatever is in front of me ...
Star, Sun Sea ... Earth, Moon, Me ... So good to be together,
Heart of Mine ...

Bloodline of the Holy Grail by Sir Laurence Gardner
Today we shall embark upon the time-honoured Quest for the Holy Grail. Some have called it the Ultimate Quest, but the Christian Church has condemned it as a heresy. A Christian heresy is described as 'an opinion which is contrary to the orthodox dogma of the Christian bishops' and, in this regard, those other quests which comprise much of today's scientific and medical research are equally heretical. The word 'heresy' is, in essence, nothing more than a derogatory label - a tag used by a fearful Church establishment that has long sought to maintain control of society through fear of the unknown. A heresy can therefore define those aspects of philosophy and research which quest into the realms of the unknown and which, from time to time, provide answers and solutions that are quite contrary to Church doctrine. In Christian terms, most of the world's population is heretical, because the Christian Church (which defines its own heresies) represents little more than a quarter of that population. As for the remaining three-quarters - the Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and others - they are all, by definition, heretics and infidels. Only 365 years ago, the Italian scientist Galileo announced that the Earth was in motion around the sun (a discovery by the Polish astronomer, Copernicus) and for this the Church proclaimed him a heretic. As a result, Galileo was hauled before the Catholic Inquisition and kept under house arrest for ten years until he died. Soon afterwards, Isaac Newton pursued the concept of orbital force, but he too was condemned and it was not until recently, in 1992, that the Church finally admitted that the Earth was in solar orbit. Indeed, it was not until the summer of 1996 that the notion of Hell was abolished by the General Synod of the Anglican Church, and it was this very notion which had caused such problems for Galileo, Newton and others. The Catholic Church, on the other hand, maintains the notion of Hell - and so, in the eyes of Rome, the Anglican Protestants have now become heretics in this regard. Historically, as far as the Christian Church was concerned, the Earth was flat and at the centre of the Universe. Heaven was above the Earth and Hell was below. Consequently, the Earth had to be motionless and could not possibly be in orbital motion unless Heaven and Hell moved as well - which, it was maintained, they did not. 1996 was also the year when Pope John Paul formally acknowledged Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution - proclaiming it to be 'quite compatible' with the Christian faith. But, hitherto, all scientists and scholars who upheld the principles of evolution were classified as heretics. Additionally, the Vatican has now established a Miracles Council, consisting of scientists, medical men and theologians. Their brief is straightforward: to investigate ancient and modern miracles so as to determine what does and what does not fall into the category. If a plausible and acceptable reasoning can be found for a said miracle, then it is taken off the miracles list. If not, then it stays on the list until such time as a logical explanation is put forward by the Council. And so, one by one, yesterday's heresies (for which so many have been persecuted and executed) are being accepted by the Church's more rational members. But there is, nevertheless, a significant element that prefers to retain the old dogma - creating a modern schism in the very structure of the Church itself. As the years progress, it is evident that scientific and medical discovery must overturn much of the medieval religious dogma that has persisted to modern times. And, in this regard, some previously cited heresies are already being taken on board by a Church that has little option to do otherwise. But there are also other forms of heresy: heresies with an essentially spiritual base - the heresies which may be called pagan or occult and those which form the very roots of religions other than Christianity. Then there are the historical heresies: those which do not immediately fall within the realms of science, medicine or philosophy, but whose testing and questing fall mainly to historians, linguists and theologians. It is in this particular category that we find the Quest for the Holy Grail and, in pursuing the Quest, it becomes increasingly apparent why the Church pronounced Grail lore to be a heresy when society at large perceives the Grail to be a thoroughly Christian relic. Quests are, by their very nature, intriguing and historical research is enlightening, but the findings from neither are of any use whatever unless there are present-day applications which, like science and medicine, can sow the seeds of a better future. History is no more than recorded experience - generally the experience of its winners - and it is common sense to learn from the experience of yesterday. Indeed, it is that very experience which holds the moral, cultural, political and social keys of tomorrow - and it is in this context that the Holy Grail supports its own Messianic code. This is the code of social practice instituted by Jesus when he washed his apostles' feet at the Last Supper. It pertains to the obligations of giving and receiving 'service'. It determines that those in positions of elected authority and influence should always be aware of their duties as 'representatives' of society, obligated to Serve society, not to presume authority over society. The Grail Code is the essential key to democratic government. This is defined as government BY the people FOR the people. Without the implementation of the Code, we experience the only too familiar government OF the people. This is not democratic government. In the course of our journey, we shall discuss many items which are thoroughly familiar, but we shall be looking at them from a different perspective to that normally conveyed. In this regard it will appear that we are often treading wholly new ground, but it was, in fact, only the ground that existed before it was carpeted and concealed by those with otherwise vested interests. Only by rolling back this carpet of purposeful concealment can we succeed in our quest for the Holy Grail. Our quest will begin in the Holy Land of Judaea in the time of Jesus, and we shall spend a good while there so as to set the emergent scene. We shall then progress through 2000 years of history to the present day - travelling through the Dark Ages to spend some time in medieval Europe. The Grail mystery will then be followed into King Arthur's Britain and, eventually, even to the United States, where the American fathers were among the greatest exponents of the Grail Code. Eminent Americans such as George Washington, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Charles Thompson and Thomas Jefferson were as much champions of the Holy Grail as were King Arthur, Sir Lancelot and Galahad. Bloodline of the Holy Grail has been described as The Book of Messianic Descent and it carries the subtitle The Hidden Lineage of Jesus Revealed. This of course indicates that Jesus had children and, by implication therefore, that he was married. So was he married? Did he have children? If so, do we know what became of them? Are their descendants alive today? The answer to each of these questions is 'yes'. We shall be looking at the emergent family in some detail, following their story, century by century - the story of a resolute royal dynasty: the descendant heirs of Jesus, who struggled against all odds to preserve the Messianic initiative of the Holy Grail. Our story is one of conspiracy; of usurped crowns, persecutions, assassinations and the unwarranted concealment of information from the people of the Christian world. It is an account of good government and bad government; about how the patriarchal kingship of people was supplanted by dogmatic tyranny and the dictatorial lordship of lands. It is a compelling journey of discovery: a view of past ages, but with its eye firmly set upon the future. This is history as it was once written, but has never been told. Let us begin with the most obvious of all questions: What is the Holy Grail? How is the Holy Grail connected with the descendant heirs of Jesus? The fact that Jesus had descendants might come as a surprise to some, but it was widely known in Britain and Europe until the late Middle Ages. In medieval times, the line of Messianic descent was defined by the French word Sangréal - deriving from the two words Sang Réal, meaning 'Blood Royal'. This was the Blood Royal of Judah: the kingly line of David which progressed through Jesus and his heirs. In English translation, the definition Sangréal became 'San Graal' (as in San Francisco). When written more fully it was 'Saint Grail' - the word 'saint', of course, relating to 'holy'. Then, by a natural linguistic process, came the more romantically familiar term, 'Holy Grail'. From the Middle Ages there were a number of chivalric and military orders specifically attached to the Messianic Blood Royal in Britain and Europe. They included the Order of the Realm of Sion and the Order of the Sacred Sepulchre. But the most prestigious of all was the Sovereign Order of the Sangréal - the Knights of the Holy Grail. This was a dynastic Order of Scotland's Royal House of Stewart. In symbolic terms the Grail is often portrayed as a chalice that contains the blood of Jesus; alternatively as a vine of grapes. The product of grapes is wine, and it is the chalice and the wine of Grail tradition that sit at the very heart of the Holy Communion (the Eucharist). In this sacrament, the sacred chalice contains the wine that represents the perpetual blood of Jesus. It is quite apparent that, although maintaining the ancient Communion custom, the Christian Church has conveniently ignored and elected not to teach the true meaning and origin of the custom. Few people even think to enquire about the ultimate symbolism of the Chalice and Wine sacrament, believing that it comes simply from some Gospel entries relating to the Last Supper. What is the significance of the perpetual blood of Jesus? How is the blood of Jesus (or of anyone else for that matter) perpetuated? It is perpetuated through family and lineage. So why was it that the Church authorities elected to ignore the 'bloodline' significance of the Grail sacrament? Indeed, why was it that they went so far as to denounce Grail lore and Grail symbolism as heretical? The fact is that every Government and every Church teaches the form of history or dogma most conducive to its own vested interest. In this regard we are all conditioned to receiving a very selective form of teaching. We are taught what we are supposed to know, and we are told what we're supposed to believe. But, for the most part, we learn both political and religious history by way of national or clerical propaganda, and this often becomes absolute dogma: teachings which may not be challenged for fear of reprisals. With regard to the Church's attitude towards the chalice and the wine, it is blatantly apparent that the original symbolism had to be reinterpreted by the bishops because it denoted that Jesus had offspring and, therefore, that he must have united with a woman. But it was not only sacraments and customary ritual that were reinterpreted; the very Gospels themselves were corrupted to comply with the 'male-only' establishment of the Church of Rome - much like a modern film editor will adjust and select the takes to achieve the desired result. We are all familiar with the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John - but what about the other Gospels: those of Philip, of Thomas, of Mary and of Mary Magdalene? What of all the numerous Gospels, Acts and Epistles that were not approved by the Church councils when the New Testament was compiled? Why were they excluded when the choices were made? There were actually two main criteria for selection, and these (from an earlier short-list prepared by Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria) were originally determined at the Council of Carthage in the year AD 397, to be finally ratified in the later Renaissance era. The first criterion was that the New Testament Gospels must be written in the names of Jesus’ own apostles. Matthew was, of course, an apostle, as was John - but Mark was not an apostle of Jesus as far as we know; neither was Luke; they were both colleagues of the later St Paul. Thomas, on the other hand, was one of the original twelve, and yet the Gospel in his name was excluded. Not only that but, along with various other texts, it was sentenced to be destroyed. And so, throughout the Mediterranean world, numerous unapproved books were buried and hidden in the 5th century. Only in recent times have some of these early manuscripts been unearthed, with the greatest of all discoveries made (after 1500 years) in 1945 at Nag Hammadi in Egypt. Although these books were not rediscovered until this present century, they were used openly by the early Christians. Certain of them, including the Gospels mentioned, along with the Gospel of Truth, the Gospel of the Egyptians and others, were actually mentioned in the 2nd-century writings of early churchmen such as Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus of Lyon and Origen of Alexandria. So, why were these and other apostolic Gospels not selected? Because there was a second, far more important criterion to consider - the criterion by which, in truth, the Gospel selection was really made. It was, in fact, a wholly sexist regulation which precluded anything that upheld the status of women in Church or community society. Indeed, the Church's own Apostolic Constitutions were formulated on this basis. They state, 'We do not permit our women to teach in the Church, only to pray and to hear those who teach. Our master, when he sent us the twelve, did nowhere send out a woman; for the head of the woman is the man, and it is not reasonable that the body should govern the head'. This was an outrageous statement with no apparent foundation, but it was for this very reason that dozens of Gospels were not selected, because they made it quite clear that there were many active women in the ministry of Jesus: women such as Mary Magdalene, Martha, Helena-Salome, Mary-Jacob Cleophas and Joanna. These were not only ministering disciples, but priestesses in their own right, running exemplary schools of worship in the Nazarene tradition. In his Epistle to the Romans, St Paul makes specific mention of his own female helpers: Phoebe, for example, whom he called a 'sister of the Church' - along with Julia, and Priscilla who 'laid down her neck for the Cause'. Writings of the Gospel era are simply alive with women disciples, but the Church ignored them all. When the Precepts of Ecclesiastical Discipline were drawn up, they stated, 'It is not permitted for a woman to speak in Church, nor to claim for herself a share in any masculine function'. The Church of Rome was so frightened of women that it implemented a rule of celibacy for its priests - a rule that became a law in 1138: a rule that persists today. But this rule has never been quite what it appears on the surface, for it was never sexual activity as such that bothered the Church. The more specific problem was priestly intimacy with women. Why? Because women become wives and mothers - and the very nature of motherhood is a perpetuation of bloodlines. It was this that bothered the Church: a taboo subject which, at all costs, had to be separated from the necessary image of Jesus. However, it was not as if the Bible had said any such thing. In fact, quite the reverse was the case. St Paul had actually said in his first Epistle to Timothy that a bishop should be married to one wife and that he should have children, for a man with experience in his own family household is actually far better qualified to take care of the Church. But, even though the Roman Church authorities claimed to uphold the teaching of St Paul in particular, they chose completely to disregard this explicit directive to suit their own ends, so that Jesus’ marital status could be strategically ignored. Notwithstanding this, the Church's celibate, unmarried image of Jesus was at variance with other writings of the Gospel era, and it was openly contradicted in the public domain until the perpetuation of the truth was proclaimed a punishable heresy (only 450 years ago) at the Italian Council of Trento in 1547 (the year that Henry VIII Tudor died in England). It is, however, not just the Christian New Testament which suffers from these sexist restrictions. A similar editing process was applied to the Hebrew Old Testament, making it conveniently suitable to be added to the Christian Bible. This is made particularly apparent by a couple of entries that bypassed the editors' scrutiny. The books of Joshua and 2-Samuel both refer to the importance of the more ancient book of Jasher. But where is this book? Like so many others of equal importance, it is not to be found in the Bible! Does the book of Jasher still exist? It certainly does. The nine-foot Hebrew scroll was a jewel of the Court of Emperor Charlemagne and the translation of the book of Jasher was the very reason that the University of Paris was founded in the year 800 - more than a century before the now familiar version of the Old Testament was compiled. Jasher was the personal staff-bearer to Moses, and the writings attributed to him are of enormous significance. The accounts relate to the Israelite sojourn in Egypt and tell of their exodus into Canaan. But they differ considerably from the version of the story that we know today. They explain that it was not Moses, but Miriam who was the spiritual leader of the tribes who crossed the Red Sea to Mount Sinai. At that time, the Jews had never heard of Jehovah; they worshipped the goddess Asherah and their spiritual leaders were largely female. Indeed, Miriam posed such a problem for Moses in his attempt to create a new environment of male dominance that he imprisoned her, whereupon the Israelites rose up against Moses to secure Miriam's release. This is in the book of Jasher, but it is not in the Bible. Let us now move to where the Christian story began - to the Gospels themselves. And, in doing this, let us first consider what the Gospels actually tell us, against what we perhaps think they tell us. We have all learned to go along with what we are taught about the Gospels in schoolrooms and churches. But is the teaching correctly related? Does it always conform to the written scriptures? It is actually quite surprising how much we learn from pulpits or picture-books without checking the biblical text. The Nativity story itself provides a good example. It is widely accepted (as the Christmas cards keep reminding us) that Jesus was born in a stable - but the Gospels do not say that. In fact, there is no 'stable' mentioned in any authorised Gospel. The Nativity is not mentioned at all in Mark or John, and Matthew makes it quite plain that Jesus was born 'in a house'. So where did the stable idea come from? It came from a misinterpretation of the Gospel of Luke which relates that Jesus was 'laid in a manger' (not 'born', as often misquoted, but 'laid') and a manger was, and still is, nothing more than an animal feeding-box. In practice, it was perfectly common for mangers to be used as emergency cradles and they were often brought indoors for that very purpose. So why has it been presumed that this particular manger was in a stable? Because the English translations of Luke tell us that there was 'no room in the inn'. But the old manuscript of Luke did not say that. In fact, there were no inns in the region - travellers lodged in private houses and family hospitality was a normal way of life in those days. In fact, if we are really going to be precise, there were no stables in the region either. 'Stable' is an English word that specifically defines a place for keeping horses. But few (apart from some Roman officers) ever used horses in 1st-century Judaea - they mainly used mules and oxen which, if kept under cover at all, would have been in some type of outhouse - certainly not a stable. As for the mythical inn, the original Greek text of Luke does not relate that there was 'no room in the inn'. By the best translation it actually states that there was 'no provision in the room' (i.e. 'no topos in the kataluma'). As previously mentioned, Matthew states that Jesus was born in a house and, when correctly translated, Luke reveals that Jesus was laid in a manger (an animal feeding box) because there was no cradle provided in the room. While on the subject of Jesus’ birth, we ought to look at the chronology here, because the two Gospels which deal with the Nativity actually give different dates for the event. According to Matthew, Jesus was born in the reign of Herod the Great, who debated the event with the Magi and apparently ordered the slaying of the infants. King Herod died in the notional year 4 BC - so we know from Matthew that Jesus was born before that. Indeed, because of this, most standard concordance Bibles give 5 BC as Jesus' date of birth. In Luke, however, a completely different date is given. This Gospel states that Jesus was born while Cyrenius was Governor of Syria - the same year that Emperor Augustus implemented the national taxing census which caused Joseph and Mary to go to Bethlehem. There are two relevant points to mention here, both of which are recorded in the 1st-century Jewish annals (such as The Antiquities of the Jews). Cyrenius was not appointed Governor of Syria until AD 6, and this was the very year that Emperor Augustus implemented the census, which was supervised by Cyrenius himself. So Jesus appears to have been born on two separate occasions: 'before 4 BC' and again 'in AD 6'. Is there a mistake in one of the Gospels? Not necessarily - at least not in the way things were originally portrayed. We are actually looking at two quite specific births: Jesus's 'physical' birth and his 'community' birth. These were defined as the 'first' and 'second' births - the second being an initiation into society by way of a ritual ceremony of rebirth. Second births for boys took place at the age of twelve (a ceremony in which they were ritualistically born again from their mother's womb). And so we know from Luke that Jesus was twelve in AD 6. Unfortunately, the latter-day Gospel translators and transcribers completely missed the significance of this, while subsequent Church teachings combined the Matthew and Luke accounts into one, giving rise to the spurious nonsense about a Nativity scene in a stable. Since Jesus was twelve in AD 6 (as given in Luke), then he was actually born in 7 BC, which was indeed during the late reign of Herod the Great as related in Matthew. But we now discover what appears to be another anomaly. The Luke Gospel then says that when Jesus was twelve years old, his parents, Mary and Joseph, took him to Jerusalem for the day - only to walk homewards for a full day's journey with their friends before they realised that Jesus was not in their party. Then they returned to Jerusalem to find him at the temple discussing his father's business with the doctors. In reality, what sort of parents would wander for a whole day in the desert, without knowing their twelve-year-old son was not with them? The fact is that the whole point of the passage has been lost in the translation, for there was a wealth of difference between a twelve-year-old son and a son in his twelfth year. When a son, on completing his initial twelve years (that is to say, on reaching his thirteenth birthday) was initiated into the community at the ceremony of his Second Birth, he was regarded as commencing his first year. It was the original root of the modern bar mitzvah. His next initiation - the initiation of manhood in the community - took place in his ninth year, when he was twenty-one (the root of the age-twenty-one privilege). Various 'degrees' then followed and the next major test was at the end of his twelfth year: at the age of twenty-four. It is, therefore, apparent that when Jesus remained at the temple in his twelfth year, he was actually twenty-four years-old - not twelve. As for his discussion with the doctors, this would have related to his next degree - the degree set by his spiritual father, whose business he discussed. At that time, his spiritual father (the overall patriarch) was Simeon the Essene - and we see, in Luke, that it was precisely this man (the 'just and devout Simeon') who had legitimated Jesus under the law. So, can we trust the Gospels? The answer to this question is 'yes', we can trust them to a point, but we cannot trust the convoluted and distorted versions which are published and presented to us today. Subsequent to the original apostolic writings, the Gospels of the early Church were written in 2nd and 3rd century Greek. Along with the Bible as a whole, they were translated into Church Latin in the 4th century, but it was then to be more than a thousand years before any English translation was made. The present English-language Gospels date back to the Authorized Bible compiled for King James VI Stuart of Scots (James I of England) in the early 17th century. This was published and set into print no more than 165 years before America's Declaration of Independence - only a few years before the first Pilgrim Fathers set sail from England. Bible translation was, however, a risky business in those days. For daring to translate the Bible into English, the 14th-century reformer John Wycliffe was denounced as a heretic and his books were burned. In the early 16th century William Tyndale was executed by strangulation in Belgium, and then burned just to ensure his death, for translating the Bible into English. A little later, Miles Coverdale (a Tyndale disciple) made another translation but, at that stage, the Church had split into two main factions. As a result, Coverdale's version was accepted by the Protestant Church, although he remained a heretic in the eyes of Rome. The problem was that, for as long as the printed text remained in an obscure form of Church Latin which only the bishops could understand or interpret, they could teach whatever they wanted. But if it were translated into popular languages that people could read for themselves, the Church teachings would doubtless be open to question. It is the Bible translated for King James upon which the majority of subsequent English-language editions have been based. But, in practice, this 17th-century Authorized Version was not a direct translation from anything; it was mostly translated from the Greek, partly from the Latin and, to some extent, from the works of others who had made previous illegitimate translations. In their rendering of the New Testament, King James's linguists endeavoured to appease both the Protestants and the Catholics. This was the only way to produce a generally acceptable text, but their ambition was not entirely successful. The Catholics thought the translators were siding with the Protestants and tried to blow up King James in the Houses of Parliament (the famous Gunpowder Plot), while the Protestants maintained that the King was in league with the Catholics! The translators were not only concerned with denominational appeasement; they also tried for something that we would today call 'political correctness'. In one instance the direct translation referred to a group of people called 'heavenly soldiers', but this was crossed out and 'heavenly army' was inserted instead. This, however, was deleted yet again (since the concept of an armed unit was not acceptable) to be replaced with 'heavenly host'. The problem was that no one knew precisely what a 'host' was; the word had been resurrected after centuries of obscurity to enter the dictionaries of the era with the vague description: 'a lot of people'. It is actually quite surprising how many ambiguous words were brought back into use to facilitate political correctness for the King James Bible while, at the same time, William Shakespeare was doing likewise in his plays. Indeed, the English-language vocabulary was increased by more than fifty percent as a result of words invented or brought back from the mists of time by the writers of the period. So, although eminently poetic, the language of the Authorized English Bible is quite unlike that ever spoken by anyone in England or anywhere else but, from this approved canonical interpretation, all other English-language Bibles have emerged in their various forms. However, for all its faults and its beautifully designed verse pattern, it remains the closest of all translations from the original Greek manuscripts. All other Anglicised versions (Standard, New English, Revised, Modern, Good News, etc.) have been significantly corrupted and they are quite unsuitable for serious study because they each have their own specific agenda. An extreme version of how this works in practice is found in a Bible presently issued in Papua, Pacific New Guinea, where there are tribes who experience familiarity on a daily basis with no other animal but the pig. In the current edition of their Bible, every animal mentioned in the text, whether originally an ox, lion, ass, sheep or whatever, is now a pig. Even Jesus, the traditional 'lamb of God', in this Bible is 'the pig of God'!

Sovereign lady, all that you see is yours ...
While her eyes were thus occupied, a voice addressed her, though she saw no one, uttering these words: "Sovereign lady, all that you see is yours. We whose voices you hear are your servants and shall obey all your commands with our utmost care and diligence. Retire, therefore, to your chamber and repose on your bed of down, and when you see fit repair to the bath. Supper awaits you in the adjoining alcove when it pleases you to take your seat there." Psyche gave ear to the admonitions of her vocal attendants, and after repose and the refreshment of the bath, seated herself in the alcove, where a table immediately presented itself, without any visible aid from waiters or servants, and covered with the greatest delicacies of food and the most nectareous wines. Her ears too were feasted with music from invisible performers; of whom one sang, another played on the lute, and all closed in the wonderful harmony of a full chorus ... These few lines have become my only “Bible” since the first time I read them. As a child, I was innocent enough to totally identify myself with Psyche. Her blessings have always been my blessings, and her trials have always been my trials unto this day. The love story of Psyche and Eros is the love story between human soul and eternal Bliss. The child in me made a brilliant choice to know the truth in this story instead of believing in original sin or eternal hell fire. We shall live in a different world when people begin to replace the original sin with the original grace, and replace the eternal punishment with the eternal bliss. Yes, all we need is to replace complex ignorance with simple truth.. This is the truth of Kingdom of Heaven. Psyche knew it, so did the little girl-I. This is not unlike what Jesus taught in the mountain, except Psyche’s encounters were more romantic for me. Can you see the same quantum reality in both? Check this out -- Matt. 6:26-34.
"Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life? And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you - [O] you of little faith? Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?' For it is the Gentiles who strive for all these things; and indeed your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But strive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today's trouble is enough for today."
When people ask me - what do you do for a living? I would say - why must we do something for a living? Can we just be the living truth ourselves without made ourselves some nice package for the "slave market?" Well, I am exaggerating just to make a point. When we are too unaware to be programmed into consummers instead of being creators of our realities, we then need to cut ourselves small just to fit in. This is not the choice of Jesus, nor choice of mine, nor choice of Psyche. Jesus was a carpenter, I am an artist, Psyche was a lover. A love is a lover ... when a lover become a professional lover, we call that prostitution. That is that. You and I, and our loved ones are all dancing in the quantum field, with invisible friends around us, serving us with fine food and music, that set the wings of our spirits free. We are the invisible servants, we are the music and fine food, we are the wine and living truth … we are the gift, the giver and the receiver ... We are Children of the Timeless Divine. I know this from my soul and I hope you know this as well. Omni Particle

While Psyche stood on the ridge of the mountain
... While Psyche stood on the ridge of the mountain, panting with fear and with eyes full of tears, the gentle
Zephyr
raised her from the earth and bore her with an easy motion into a flowery dale. By degrees her mind became composed, and she laid herself down on the grassy bank to sleep. When she awoke refreshed with sleep, she looked round and beheld near by a pleasant grove of tall and stately trees. She entered it, and in the midst discovered a fountain, sending forth clear and crystal waters, and fast by, a magnificent palace whose august front impressed the spectator that it was not the work of mortal hands, but the happy retreat of some god. Drawn by admiration and wonder, she approached the building and ventured to enter. Every object she met filled her with pleasure and amazement. Golden pillars supported the vaulted roof, and the walls were enriched with carvings and paintings representing beasts of the chase and rural scenes, adapted to delight the eye of the beholder. Proceeding onward, she perceived that besides the apartments of state there were others filled with all manner of treasures, and beautiful and precious productions of nature and art. While her eyes were thus occupied, a voice addressed her, though she saw no one, uttering these words: "Sovereign lady, all that you see is yours. We whose voices you hear are your servants and shall obey all your commands with our utmost care and diligence. Retire, therefore, to your chamber and repose on your bed of down, and when you see fit repair to the bath. Supper awaits you in the adjoining alcove when it pleases you to take your seat there."

Her ears too were feasted with music from invisible performers; of whom one sang, another played on the lute, and all closed in the wonderful harmony of a full chorus ... [see source:

Who is he?
"The virgin is destined for the bride of no mortal lover. Her future husband awaits her on the top of the mountain. He is a monster w hom neither gods nor men can resist." What would it be like for a young girl who could not have a normal life, and her beauty had become a bitter curse? Who is he -- a monster, whom neither gods nor men can resist? The match of this story is that they both were exiled … by others or by themselves. They did not fit into a nicely made box called social norm, that simply means stability and worldly concern. Why a god of love would be “a monster whom neither gods nor men can resist?” Would it be possible that this “monster” carries the power to shatter the old for the unknown? Perhaps this monster has the power to make people changed forever and there is no return; Perhaps this monster bring death to the “us” that we and everyone else perceived that as the ultimate identity ... Perhaps after our rebirth, we find those who vowed to love us forever would just walk away … simply because they could not relate to this new reality. And Ironically, we might do the same to those whom we just could not relate. The “worst” of all is that this monster transforms himself/herself all the time, that nobody could control him/her into some fixed ideals. This monster has no yesterday, has no tomorrow, but this moment.
This monster is constantly transforming, transmitting, transmuting, transcending ... Psyche is ready for this. Her beauty became a bitter curse only because there was no way for her to fit into any small box. Awakened by a deep yearning for perfect union, all souls, gods or mortals, could not resist this
"monster" for the quest of eternity. This is how the journey begins ... Omni particle

Eros
In
Greek mythology , Eros was the god responsible for
lust ,
love , and
sex ; he was also worshipped as a fertility deity. His name is the root of words such as erotic. His
Roman
equivalent was
Cupid , "desire", also known as Amor, "love". He was often associated with
Aphrodite . He was, like
Dionysus , sometimes referred to as Eleutherios, "the liberator". Conceptions of Eros Throughout Greek thought, there appear to be two sides to the conception of Eros; in the first, he is a primeval deity who embodies not only the force of erotic love but also the creative urge of ever-flowing nature, the first-born Light that is responsible for the coming into being and ordering of all things in the cosmos. In
Hesiod's
Theogony , the most famous Greek
creation myth , Eros sprang forth from the primordial
Chaos
together with
Gaia , Earth, and
Tartarus , the underworld; according to
Aristophanes ' play
The Birds , he burgeons forth from an egg laid by Night conceived with Darkness. In the
Eleusinian Mysteries , he was worshipped as Protogonus, the first-born. Alternately, later in antiquity, Eros was the son of
Aphrodite
and either
Ares
or
Hephaestus , or of
Porus
and
Penia , or sometimes of
Iris
and
Zephyrus ; this Eros was an attendant to Aphrodite, harnessing the primordial force of love and directing it into mortals, an apt role for the issue of a union between "Love" and either "War" or "Fire." In some myths, he is portrayed as being playful, frequently causing trouble for gods and mortals; in others, he is mindful of the power he wields, sometimes refusing the entreaties of his mother and other gods to interfere in the course of some mortals' lives. In some versions he had brothers named
Anteros , the embodiment and
Himerus . In art, Eros was usually depicted as a winged young boy or infant, with his bow and arrows in hand. He had two kinds of arrows: one was golden with dove feathers that caused instant love; the other was lead with owl feathers that caused indifference. The poet
Sappho
described him as "bittersweet" and "cruel" to his victims; he was also unscrupulous, mischievous and charismatic. In his ancient identification with Protogones and Phanes he was adorned represented as a bull, a serpent, a lion, and with the heads of a ram. But of course Eros is not always percieved as a child; that was more of "Cupid" based off the Roman belief system. In the Greek religion he was a young man; a teenager as opposed to a baby in a diaper. Worship of Eros was uncommon in early Greece, but eventually became widespread. He was fervently worshipped by a fertility cult in
Thespiae , and played an important role in the Eleusinian Mysteries. In
Athens , he shared a very popular cult with Aphrodite, and the fourth day of every month was sacred to him. Myths associated with Eros Eros, angry at
Apollo
for making fun of his
archery
skills, caused him to fall in love with the
nymph
Daphne , daughter of
Ladon , who had scorned him. Daphne prayed to the river god
Peneus
to help her and was changed into a
laurel tree , which became sacred to Apollo. The story of
Cupid and Psyche , first attested in
Apuleius '
Latin
novel,
The Golden Ass , recounts the love between Cupid and Psyche, whose name means "soul". Aphrodite was jealous of the beauty of Psyche, a mortal, and asked Cupid to make her fall in love with the ugliest man on earth; instead, Cupid fell in love with her himself and spirited her away to his home. Their peace was ruined by the jealousy of Psyche's sisters, and Psyche was forced to complete a number of trials, including descending to the underworld, in order to be reunited with Cupid. Eventually, she bore him a daughter, Voluptas, whose name means "pleasure", and became immortal herself. Psyche's visit to and return from the underworld made her an object of some devotion, like Dionysus and
Persephone . She was an object of some
mystery religions
and was occasionally mentioned in connection with the popular Eleusinian mysteries. source

The Transformation of Psyche
While psyche was commonly known as the ancient Greek word for "soul", it is rooted in psychein, "to breathe". In the western cultures particularly, we have forgotten this ancient understanding of the intertwining of breath and feeling. Yet every culture has acknowledged (some quite sophisticatedly) this common observation: if you are feeling bad, take a breath or two, it will help; if you are feeling fine, take a breath or few and you will magnify your happiness. To transform feeling, use the breath.
In Hellenic mythology Psyche was a royal daughter who, on account of her vanity, was severely tested by the goddess of beauty, Aphrodite. The princess went beyond the unattainable, by virtue of higher "help", barely and gracefully passed the test of Hades, and was given to the son of Aphrodite, Eros, the god of love. Psyche was at last given to love. In marrying the god of love, Psyche became immortal in the Court of Olympia, where Zeus (lit. "brightness") reigns. Her story reflects the ordeal and promise of learning to feel freely.
The link between "soul" (the feeling-being), breath, and freedom points to a transformation hidden in us all.
In the same transformative light, the word psyche anciently was also used to indicate a "butterfly". This referred to flying insect, but implied the caterpillar and cocoon prior to flight. The Princess, the feeling, the breath, the Psyche, and the butterfly are all hinged upon a metamorphysis. Transformation is the key to psyche. (And having learned to feel beyond the vanity of mentality, perhaps some "psychic" abilities are found to be natural.) The deep meaning and intertwining of breath and feeling can be found in direct knowledge; the wisdom of experience. Use the breath, pscyhein, to fortify and magnify the feeling, psyche. Until the psyche can rest in unthreatenedness and be transformed forever, it must persist and let go, bit by bit, breath by breath, metamorphysis. The social importance of the myth of Psyche, however, is psyche-logical. Psychological health is in the free exercise of the feeling psyche. Direct, explicit attentiveness to feeling is a necessity to character and education; the feeling dimension is the actual substance of character development and psychological health. Though the story of Psyche is more pertinent to adults than to children, it nevertheless contains images useful for emotional communication. This emotional wisdom is the primary function of all myths, thus giving the myth of Psyche a paradigm for all myths, the transformation of self.
Direct emotional education has always been recommended in every great culture, but in our society, obsessed with mind, caught in the liability of thought, we have forgotten our totality and think that character is "just going to happen" somehow. Children need occasion and guidance to exercise feeling. Natural expressions such as music, dance, the arts, and athletics serve this process of attention and feeling naturally. Encourage them wholeheartedly.
Anciently, an educated man or woman was referred to as musika (here meaning not only the art we call music, but the courting of all the muses and thus all the arts). A scholia without music is not a school, and students not given musical influence will bear a greater burden in life. Cultural forms, like music, art and design infuse our society and provide an inheritance of character. But apart and above these forms, attention to feeling must become more primary than its extensions in human expressions, such as arts and the like. Direct education relative to human emotions can become a rosetta stone to all other creative expressions.

God's Girl Friend
“Danae is one of the major sources of mainly medieval and modern art. As seen from the pictures, she is presented as nude, lying on her bed, the window open so that Zeus comes in in the form of a golden shower. Her maid is mostly in the pictures, either helping her by making Zeus' entrance easier, or by advising her. [ source
http://www.ecsel.psu.edu/~rreynold/Danae.htm ..] As a little girl, I was fascinated with people whom had been chosen by “God.” I was not that crazy about Moss or Jesus. They were nice but they were boys ... Virgin Mary was nice too, but her life was too tragical for me.
I did not even want to see an archangel because it might end my childhood too soon. Then, there were some ladies who seemed to have somewhat different relationship with “God.” These ladies were some kind of girl-friend for God. I was too young to see the difference between which god was the real God, and which one was the false God. They all seemed the same to me. They were powerful and worshipped by humans. They had power to bring almost equal horrors and happiness to people, if not more. They loved to be pleased, and they would love you only if you were doing the right things … They also had special power to punish and to kill their enimies ... so if you were smart, you might want to be on their side .. even though they were moody and changing "side" all the time.
Then my other books said that some blessed ladies were extremely beautiful and God chose them to be someone special. “Wow!!! Being beautiful and being chosen, then you got a nice chance to play with God because you were " his girl-friend.” This idea seemed to suit me very well. Then, I had to decide which lady I would like to be.
Leda was beautiful, but Zeus turned into a swan to made her laid four eggs. From these eggs came the immortals Polydeuces and Helenn, and the mortals Castor and Clytaemnestra. I was not too sure whether I wanted to lay eggs … plus that god seemed not romantic enough for me. I did not want my boyfriend looked like a swan.
Danae was beautiful too. Zeus turned into golden shower to make her bear children. That was not too romantic either. First, I was still a girl, I did not want to become a mom. Golden shower sounded nice but that was really no difference then sunshine. I knew how much God loved me because the sun was always showering me with golden rays. I would not be stupid enough to be naked like Danae, simply because I knew better. Europa was a princess, her father was the king of Trye. Zeus turned into a white bull to seduce her, and she was not smart enough to run away ... I would not want my boyfriend looked like a bull either, even if a continent was named after me.
Zeus had too many girl friends and most of them were not that happy. Maybe he was too old for me... I would like to have a boyfriend who could play with me nicely in some future years. More important, he should have respect for me, and have better forms than swan or bull.
One day I read the story of Cupid and Psyche. Wow!!! That was true love. He loved her. Well, Psyche had some hard time too, but it was not because of her husband but because of her mother-in-law … I was pretty sure that I could handle that well. Finally, I got very clear about which kind of lady I would like to be when I grew up. I shall tell you more about Psyche when I write again. Now, it is time for me to grow more beautiful and more brilliant. Good Night!

Mary, the mother of Jesus
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
(Redirected from
The Virgin Mary )
In
Christianity
and
Islam , Mary ( Judæo-Aramaic
מרים Maryām "Bitter";
Septuagint
Greek
Μαριαμ, Mariam, Μαρια, Maria;
Arabic : Maryem, مريم) is the mother of
Jesus
and the
betrothed
of
Joseph . Islamic theology also posits that Jesus was the result of a
virgin birth . The Quran tells the story of Maryam (Mary) in two places, 3:35-47 and 19:16-34, but goes into much less detail than the Bible. It says that Maryam (Mary) was dedicated to God's service by her mother while still in the womb (Quran 3:35), that she was cared for by Zakariya (Zecharias) (3:36), and that in her childhood God provided for her to help her grow strong and pious (3:37). He then sent an angel to announce that she could shortly expect to bear a son, specifying that "O Mary! Allah hath chosen thee and purified thee - chosen thee above the women of all nations." (Qur'an 3:42). It specifies that she conceived Jesus despite being a virgin: "She said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man hath touched me?" He said: "Even so: Allah createth what He willeth: When He hath decreed a plan, He but saith to it, 'Be,' and it is!" (3:47). from

Ethnocentrism
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
Ethnocentrism ( Greek
ethnos nation + -centrism) is a set of beliefs or practices based on the view that one's own group is the center of everything. The term was popularized by the
sociologist
William Graham Sumner
and often entails the belief that one's own race or ethnic group is the most important and/or that some or all aspects of its culture are superior to those of other groups. Within this ideology, individuals will judge other groups in relation to their own particular ethnic group or culture, especially with concern to
language , behaviour, customs, and
religion . These ethnic distinctions and sub-divisions serve to define each
ethnicity 's unique
cultural identity .
The reasons for maintaining an ethnicity or culture are often personal, and relate to the cohesion of familiar personal and social elements; that is,
attachment
or custom. We all are born into a human
culture , and it is the culture that shapes our self-awareness and understanding of other individuals. It also reflects, depending on the cultural teaching, customs or patterns of behaviour in relating to other cultures. This behaviour can range from universal acceptance or feelings of inferiority compared with other cultures, to
racism , which many consider an aspect of
xenophobia . Some examples of ethnocentric behaviours are represented by such social phenomena as economic isolationism, counter-cultures, anti-establishmentism, and widespread social patterns of interpersonal abusive behaviours as ostracization, prejudice, and discrimination.
A
paradigm
of the academic community in the
United States , particularly among
anthropologists , is that enthnocentrism adversely affects one's understanding and assessment of
culture , and therefore should always be avoided. However, the extent to which
education
can engage enthnocentrism is debated, because education by definition is a cultural construct. Moreover, many anthropologists contend that almost every opinion and insight held by an individual is influenced by their culture, hence ethnocentrism cannot always be avoided.
In theory, however, the
anthropology
and
sociology
fields advocate a removal of the unique cultural lens of researchers studying culture and adherence to the
academic
tenet of
cultural relativism . This theory is illustrated by anthropologist Phillippe Bourgois in his book In Search of Respect: Selling Crack in El Barrio, which states that "cultures are neither good nor bad; they simply have an internal logic" (15).
In the modern world, a global economy has resulted in a great increase in inter-cultural contact. Technological advances in communication have progressively overcome previous obstacles to communication - physical obstacles that once helped to keep ethnic distinctions distinct. Ethnic lines still exist, and co-exist, and cultures of the world often find that their central concern, that of maintaining an identity despite rapid
transculturation , or a merging between cultures, is still possible.
Ethnocentric ideology still exists throughout the world, however, and influences group policy and diplomacy between cultures - often resulting in
war ,
genocide , or
slavery . More often than not, the underlying cause of conflict between
nations , ethnic groups, or cultures is ethnocentrism. There are many current and historical examples of this, such as African
Slavery , the
Holocaust , the
Rwandan Genocide , and the current conflict between
Catholics
and
Protestants
in
Ireland .

About the " Chosen People "
Chosen people
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
Throughout history, various groups have considered themselves chosen by
God
for some purpose. Sometimes this chosenness is viewed as marking them as superior; other times it is viewed as giving this group a special responsibility or purpose ...
Types of purposes
The sense of being a chosen people occurs in both religious and nonreligious contexts. The
Communists , for instance, were atheist, but considered themselves chosen by fate to liberate the world proletariat. The
Abolitionists , who were largely
Christian , considered themselves chosen by God to bring freedom and equal rights to the slaves. The
Nazis
considered the Aryan race to be superior, and believed it was their mission to eliminate all races they considered "inferior." Many religious and charitable organizations consider themselves to be chosen by God to care for the sick and the suffering.
Manifest Destiny
drove Americans across the continent.
The sense of being a "chosen people" is therefore often associated with a particular ideological movement -- it is a sense of importance which drives people to further the ends of their ideology.
However, it is important to distinguish between the self-importance of a movement and the truth of its message. Movements of all types consider themselves to be "chosen" in one way or another to change the course of history. Some movements may prove to be true, and some movements may prove to be false. The truth of their message and their confidence in their message are entirely separate questions ... read more:

Danae was a legendary princess of Argos.
Her father, Acrisius, who had been warned by an oracle that her son would one day kill him, had decided to keep her locked her in a bronze tower away from any male company.
Zeus, who loved Danae, turned himself into a shower of gold and came to the despondent princess through the roof.
The shower of gold poured down into her lap; as a result she had a son. When Acrisius discovered Perseus, he locked both mother and son in a chest, and set it adrift on the sea. Eventually Danae and Perseus were rescued.

Cupid and Psyche by Lucius Apuleius
... When she awoke refreshed with sleep, she looked round and beheld near a pleasant grove of tall and stately trees. She entered it, and in the midst discovered a fountain, sending forth clear and crystal waters, and fast by, a magnificent palace whose august front impressed the spectator that it was not the work of mortal hands, but the happy retreat of some god. Drawn by admiration and wonder, she approached the building and ventured to enter.
Every object she met filled her with pleasure and amazement. Golden pillars supported the vaulted roof, and the walls were enriched with carvings and paintings representing beasts of the chase and rural scenes, adapted to delight the eye of the beholder. Proceeding onward, she perceived that besides the apartments of state there were others filled with all manner of treasures, and beautiful and precious productions of nature and art.
While her eyes were thus occupied, a voice addressed her, though she saw no one, uttering these words, "Sovereign lady, all that you see is yours. We whose voices you hear are your servants and shall obey all your commands with our utmost care and diligence. Retire, therefore, to your chamber and repose on your bed of down, and when you see fit, repair to the bath. Supper awaits you in the adjoining alcove when it pleases you to take your seat there."
Psyche gave ear to the admonitions of her vocal attendants, and after repose and the refreshment of the bath, seated herself in the alcove, where a table immediately presented itself, without any visible aid from waiters or servants, and covered with the greatest delicacies of food and the most nectareous wines. Her ears too were feasted with music from invisible performers; of whom one sang, another played on the lute, and all closed in the wonderful harmony of a full chorus.
She had not yet seen her destined husband. He came only in the hours of darkness and fled before the dawn of morning, but his accents were full of love, and inspired a like passion in her. She often begged him to stay and let her behold him, but he would not consent. On the contrary he charged her to make no attempt to see him, for it was his pleasure, for the best of reasons, to keep concealed ...
Source: Thomas Bulfinch, The Age of Fable; or, Stories of Gods and Heroes (1855). Bulfinch's source is The Golden Ass (books 4-6) by the Roman writer Lucius Apuleius.
Lucius Apuleius was born about 124 in northern Africa and was educated in Carthage and Athens. The account of Cupid and Psyche is presented in his novel The Golden Ass (also titled The Metamorphoses) as an "old wive's tale" told by an old woman to comfort a young woman who has been abducted by a band of robbers and is being held for ransome.
In the main Bulfinch retells Apuleius' story with accuracy and sensitivity, but he does omit a few important details, for example:
Psyche is pregnant with Cupid's child throughout her search for her lost husband, a fact emphasized by Apuleius.
The cruel treatment meted out to Psyche by her mother-in-law Venus is substantially understated in Bulfinch's account.
