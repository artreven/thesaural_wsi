The Flash #8

Title:
The Flash #8
Comic Vine:
link
Writers:
Francis Manapul ,
Brian Buccellato
Artist:
Francis Manapul
Following the events of the last issue
the Flash
finds himself in the void of the
Speed Force . Unable to find
Iris
or the other people plucked out of time, the Flash’s only companion is
Turbine , an insane WWII pilot who has been trapped in the void for 70 years.
Although the idea of Turbine is an intriguing one, how writers Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato play out the tale leaves something to be desired. We do get an explanation for the time rifts and how the Flash is connected to the Speed Force. However, everything feels rushed and not quite as well thought-out as I’d like. It doesn’t quite stumble, but this is definitely the weakest issue of the title so far.
That doesn’t mean the comic doesn’t have its bright spots. Manapul’s art is again terrific, and even if the ideas aren’t as well fleshed-out as I’d like they do open the doors for further discovery down the line. I’m less pleased with the new
Grodd
and
New 52
version of
Gorilla City
both of which were going to get plenty of in next month’s issue. Worth a look.
[DC, $2.99]
