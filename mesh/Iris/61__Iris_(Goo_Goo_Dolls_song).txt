Δηλώσεις
''Θεωρώ σέξι γυναίκα εκείνη που δεν φορά μέικ-απ, αλλά δείχνει φυσική. Που ξέρει οτι είναι όμορφη αλλά δεν ανάβει φωτιές με το ντύσιμο της και δεν επιδεικνύει την ομορφιά της. Είμαι άνθρωπος που κοιτάζει βαθύτερα, που ψάχνει να βρεί κάτι περισσότερο πίσω από αυτό που βλέπει. Προτιμώ τις απλές προσωπικότητες από τις προβληματικές.''

Personal Quotes

Personal Quotes
My favorite subject was English or creative writing. We did poems and making a magazine and I did one on celebrities. I called it Celebrity Life Magazine. I interviewed my good friend
Kaley Cuoco .
I love Christmas, not just because of the presents but because of all the decorations and lights and the warmth of the season.
I'm happy that i was able to experience a normal life besides show business, because it gives you something to draw from.
My agent didn't want me on Disney because I'm older. But honestly, I'm not ready for older roles yet, or even the things older girls do. I am still young.
I love change, and I love changing my hair. But it was strange to look in the mirror and think 'Who is this girl?'
I loved my long brown curls, but most mean girls look like this, don't they?...The blond thing...it's the stereotype of a popular mean girl.
I feel like people expect a lot out of girls, like you're supposed to know who you are and what you want out of life right now. Some girls know. I did. But lots of people don't know. You have to try a lot of things and not worry about what people are thinking. Fans might think I'm mean or shallow, like Sharpay, in real life, but I don't care. The mean girl is in every school. People relate to her even if they don't like her.
I helped put together Sharpay's look, and I wanted it to be over-the-top, flashy, attention-getting, because that's her. But she has a heart. You never know what someone is about. People look at me and think I'm a young teen. I'm 21!
I moved from New Jersey to California, so I know what it feels like being the new girl trying to figure it all out. There was this girl in the popular group who was jealous of me, even though I bought my own clothes and car-my parents didn't give them to me. I never told people in school I was an actress. I am a girl, and acting is my job.
The best thing that could happen is people get to see me as the smart and nice girl again, not as the mean or ditsy character. Hollywood makes brainiac girls sort of plain but, in
High School Musical
(2006) (TV), they're gorgeous. I'm glad girls get to see that it's not one or the other. They get to see that they can be pretty and smart...There's a saying - 'I have the looks but I don't have the books' - that captures the whole idea of expectations, especially in high school. You can be plain and smart, or pretty and smart. You can even be plain and dumb! You just have to be yourself. What do people see when they see me? I'm comfortable with myself, so I really don't care. People seem surprised to discover that I worked hard to be here.
You never know what's going to be big. It's the fans. It was just a Disney Channel Movie and the kids made it huge... For
High School Musical 2
(2007) (TV), we just wanted to have fun and make something together (On
High School Musical
(2006) (TV)).
In real life, I'm shy. I never played a mean girl before. (On playing Sharpay, in
High School Musical
(2006) (TV)).
I'm not into clubbing. I want to be known for my work.
I didn't do this because I believe in plastic surgery. I did this to help my health. I literally almost could not breathe out of the right side of my nose. I want my fans to know the truth. I'm not someone who is going to act like I had nothing done. I just want to be honest because my fans are everything to me.
I can only be myself. That person has to love you for who you are and everything that you are. I am not fake. I know who I am. At the end of the day, I just want to be a good person. I'm not trying to be perfect.
I'm not just the young girl everybody thinks I am. I'm actually a woman.

High School Musical 3
earned $42 million in its domestic opening weekend, which became the biggest opening for a musical film. [ 34 ]
Her second studio album,

Described by Tisdale as a "rocker and edgier" album, [ 36 ]
it generated mixed reviews, with a 54% rating on

and
Billboard
claimed the album "doesn't give the singer room to comfortably let loose". [ 38 ]

Personal Quotes
"I liked being a minor because you can't get into trouble. Now I just have to try and behave myself."
"I might look like a tough chick - and I am - but I'm also a hopeless romantic inside."
"Why should I care what other people think of me? I am who I am. And who I wanna be."
"I'd like to be a little more hard-rocking on my next album. But I hate the whole label thing."
People ask me if I regret wasting my last teen years on becoming a singer. You know something? I don't. Because singing is my life. When and if you want something so badly you'll see. I mean, I'm just so blessed to be doing what I love to do and to have been given this opportunity. I thank God because there are so many more talented people out there that will never even come close to getting a record deal.
"To understand me, you have to meet me and be around me. And then only if I'm in a good mood - don't meet me in a bad mood."
"My mom wouldn't let me sing 'Strawberry Wine' because it had 'wine' in it."
"When I was 2 my mom said she knew I was going to be a singer. I've been performing ever since I was a young kid. So I've known I wanted to do this for awhile. I always knew in my heart that I'd be singing."
"I'm just coming out and I'm going to clearly be myself - I write what I feel, I never worry what others think."
I can write a song a day.
"My dream was always to hop up on stage in front of my fans every night and perform."
"Actually, I know for a fact there are some young female artists who don't even sing on their own records and who don't sing live. And that is pathetic." (about lipsynching)

Avril Lavigne's Bio
Όταν η τραγουδίστρια, συνθέτρια και μουσικός Avril Lavigne πρωτοεμφανίστηκε στη μουσική σκηνή σε ηλικία 17 ετών, ήταν γνωστή ως ένα pop-punk αγοροκόριτσο που προτιμούσε να δελεάσει το αγοραστικό κοινό με την δυναμική φωνή της, τις υπέροχες μελωδίες της και τους πολύ «χύμα» στίχους. Παραμένοντας ειλικρινής προς τον εαυτό της και βάζοντας τη μουσική πάνω από την εικόνα πέτυχε τόσο όσον αφορά τις κριτικές αλλά και όσον αφορά το εμπορικό κομμάτι. Το 2002, η Avril σημείωσε τεράστια επιτυχία με τον 6 φορές πλατινένιο δίσκο «Let Go» και συνέχισε το 2004 με τον 3 φορές πλατινένιο «Under My Skin» και το 2007 με τον πλατινένιο δίσκο «The Best Damn Thing». Κέρδισε οκτώ υποψηφιότητες βραβείων Grammy, επτά καναδικά Βραβεία Juno και πούλησε περισσότερα από 30 εκατομμύρια άλμπουμ και σχεδόν 20 εκατομμύρια κομμάτια σε όλο τον κόσμο τα τελευταία οκτώ χρόνια.
Η Lavigne ξεκίνησε επίσης μια δεύτερη καριέρα ως επιχειρηματίας με τη δημιουργία μιας lifestyle αλυσίδας σχετικής με τη μόδα, AbbeyDawn, δύο αρωμάτων (Black Star και Forbidden Rose), ενώ επεκτάθηκε επίσης στον χώρο του κινηματογράφου (Over the Hedge, Fast FoodNation). Επιπλέον, έχει αφοσιωθεί σε φιλανθρωπικές ενέργειες δημιουργώντας το ίδρυμα Avril Lavigne, το οποίο λειτουργεί σε συνεργασία με κορυφαίες φιλανθρωπικές οργανώσεις με σκοπό να σχεδιάσουν και να εφαρμόζουν προγράμματα, να ευαισθητοποιούν και να κινητοποιούν κόσμο, για την υποστήριξη των παιδιών και των νέων που ζουν με σοβαρές ασθένειες ή αναπηρίες.
Με τις πολλαπλές δημιουργικές προσπάθειές και την εντυπωσιακή μουσική επιτυχία της, αξίζει να σημειωθεί ότι η Avril Lavigne είναι μόνο 26. Μπορεί να είναι νέα, αλλά έχει εξελιχθεί ως άτομο και ως καλλιτέχνης μετά την κυκλοφορία του «The Best Damn Thing». Η Lavigne δείχνει την ωριμότητα και διορατικότητα που έχει αποκτήσει από τις εμπειρίες της στην επόμενη αγάπη-δουλειά της, το τέταρτο album της, «Goodbye Lullaby», το οποίο κυκλοφορεί από το Μάρτιο του 2011. «Εγώ η ίδια πίεσα τον εαυτό μου και δεν δίστασα καθόλου», λέει η Lavigne για το «Goodbye Lullaby» στο οποίο έγραψε ή συνέγραψε τους στίχους κάθε κομματιού και ήταν παραγωγός των δύο από αυτά («4 Real» and «Goodbye»). «Επέτρεψα στον εαυτό μου να είμαι ευάλωτη. Νομίζω ότι κατά τη διάρκεια των πραγματικών στιγμών οι άνθρωποι μπορούν να συνδεθούν περισσότερο. Όσοι έχουν ακούσει το άλμπουμ είχαν πολύ έντονες συναισθηματικές αντιδράσεις στα κομμάτια, οπότε και συνειδητοποίησα ότι όταν κάτι είναι τόσο αληθινό το πιο πιθανό είναι ότι θα αγγίξει κάποιους ανθρώπους. Η ομορφιά της μουσικής είναι ότι είναι ανοιχτή σε ερμηνείες".
Γραμμένο σε διάφορες στιγμές των περασμένων ετών, το «Goodbye Lullaby» είναι γεμάτο με όμορφα, αφηγηματικά, θερμά τραγούδια που μεταδίδουν μία ποικιλία συναισθημάτων και αντανακλούν μια γλυκόπικρη διάθεση που γενικά δεν συνδέεται με τα πιο γνωστά κομμάτια της Lavigne. Εκτός από τα «What The Hell» και «Smile», που δημιουργούν ένα τέλειο πέρασμα από την προηγούμενη δουλειά της, το υπόλοιπο του «Goodbye Lullaby» βρίσκει την Avril να εξερευνά τι σημαίνει να ξεπερνάς τις δύσκολες στιγμές και να βγαίνεις πιο δυνατός από αυτές - ένα θέμα εμφανές σε τραγούδια όπως τα "Everybody Hurts", "Push", "Remember When" και "Wish You Were Here".
«Συνολικά, το άλμπουμ είναι για το πώς ο κόσμος περνάει δύσκολες εμπειρίες, είτε είναι το τέλος μιας σχέσης, ή χάνοντας μια θέση εργασίας, ή απλά όταν κάποιος είναι απών», λέει η Lavigne. «Έχουμε περάσει από αυτό και μεγαλώνουμε.» Πουθενά δεν έχει εκφραστεί καλύτερα αυτό το συναίσθημα πέρα από το "Goodbye", μια ευαίσθητη piano-and-string μπαλάντα, που κλείνει το άλμπουμ. Το "Goodbye" είναι το πιο ακατέργαστο και ευάλωτο κομμάτι που γράφτηκε και ηχογραφήθηκε στην καριέρα μου», λέει η Lavigne. «Είναι ένα πολύ ιδιαίτερο τραγούδι, γιατί το έγραψα και παρήγαγα η ίδια. Είναι τόσο πραγματικό και αληθινό. Δεν είναι προσποιητό ».
Η ένταση του Goodbye Lullaby είναι ισορροπημένη από την ενορχήστρωσή του: φωτεινή, πλούσια ακουστική κιθάρα, πιάνο, καθώς και μία ορχήστρα στο "Darlin", "Remember When" και "Goodbye" . Σε όλα, από το αισιόδοξο ποπ τραγούδι μέχρι τις μπαλάντες, η φωνή της Lavigne είναι μπροστά και κέντρο, ενώ «εκτινάσσεται» αναλόγως μέσα από την συγκίνηση που απαιτούν οι στίχοι της.
«Αυτό το άλμπουμ είναι ότι είμαι εγώ.. τραγουδίστρια, συνθέτρια και μουσικός», λέει η Lavigne. «Συνήθως, ο κύριος τραγουδιστής θάβεται στο κομμάτι και δεν μπορείτε να αντιληφθείτε πάντοτε την ποιότητα, τον χαρακτήρα, ή τη συγκίνηση μετά από ένα ορισμένο σημείο. Ήθελα η φωνή μου να είναι το βασικό μέσο. Αυτό με ανάγκασε να ρίξω τον εαυτό μου πραγματικά εκεί έξω. Αγαπώ ακόμα τη ροκ, αλλά θα ήθελα να δείτε μια διαφορετική πλευρά μου. Γι 'αυτό παρήγαγα μερικά τραγούδια, κάτι που ποτέ δεν φανταζόμουν ότι θα κάνω ... »
Για τα υπόλοιπα κομμάτια του άλμπουμ, η Lavigne στράφηκε στους πολύχρονους φίλους της και συνεργάτες Evan Taubenfeld και Butch Walker, καθώς και Max Martin. Μια άλλη σημαντική επιρροή ήταν ο τραγουδιστής των Sum 41, Deryck Whibley, που δανείζει τις δεξιότητες του στην παραγωγή, σε διάφορα τραγούδια, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των "Darlin", ένα τραγούδι που η Lavigne έγραψε στην ηλικία των14. « Όποτε ακούω το Darlin' σκέφτομαι το οικογενειακό δωμάτιο όπου το έγραψα και το έπαιζα για τη μαμά μου», λέει. «Έτσι είναι πραγματικά ξεχωριστό για μένα να το έχω στο album.»
Ένα μικρό κορίτσι από το Napanee του Ontario, είχε ήδη γράψει, τραγουδήσει και εκτελέσει για κάποια χρόνια πριν από την κυκλοφορία του album, Let Go, όπου ξεχώρισαν τα "Complicated" και "Sk8r Boi" και πούλησε πάνω από 16 εκατομμύρια μονάδες παγκοσμίως. Το δεύτερο album της "Under My Skin", το 2004 , έκανε το ντεμπούτο του στο νούμερο 1 στο Billboard Top 200, και πούλησε περισσότερα από οκτώ εκατομμύρια αντίτυπα σε όλο τον κόσμο και περιέχει τα hit singles "Don't Tell Me" και "My Happy Ending". Τέσσερα χρόνια αργότερα ήρθε το "The Best Damn Thing", το οποίο χαρακτηρίστηκε από το νούμερο 1 single "Girlfriend" όπου ήταν το μεγαλύτερο ρεκόρ της Lavigne μέχρι σήμερα. Το "Girlfriend" ήταν η κορυφαία ψηφιακή τροχιά από το 2007, κάνοντας περισσότερα από 7,3 εκατομμύρια downloads σε οκτώ γλώσσες. Το The Best Damn Thing περιλαμβάνει την επική μπαλάντα "Keep Holding On," την οποία η Lavigne έγραψε μετά από αίτηση της 20th Century Fox για την ταινία Eragon. Τραγούδια της Lavigne έχουν συμπεριληφθεί επίσης σε soundtracks ταινιών μεγάλου μήκους, όπως το Sweet Home Alabama, Bruce Almighty, Legally Blonde 2, The Princess Diaries 2 και The House Bunny.
Το 2010, η Lavigne έγραψε το "Alice" για την ταινία φαντασίας του Τιμ Μπάρτον «Αλίκη στη Χώρα των Θαυμάτων», η οποία είχε συμπεριληφθεί στο album συλλογή «Almost Alice», που κυκλοφόρησε το Μάρτιο. Το βίντεο για το Alice, σε σκηνοθεσία David Meyers, απεικονίζει την περιπέτεια της Lavigne στην τρύπα του κουνελιού. Έφερε, επίσης, το εμπορικό σήμα της στο μίγμα, σχεδιάζοντας κομμάτια "Alice in Wonderland" για την Abbey Dawn που πωλήθηκαν σε καταστήματα σε συνδυασμό με την κυκλοφορία της ταινίας.
Ήταν ένα ταξίδι ανεμοστρόβιλος για την Avril, η οποία δηλώνει ότι το πιο σημαντικό πράγμα που περιμένει με την κυκλοφορία του Goodbye Lullaby είναι να έχει την ευκαιρία να βγει στον δρόμο και να τραγουδήσει για τους θαυμαστές της σε όλον τον κόσμο. «Οι θαυμαστές μου είναι φανατικοί», λέει η Lavigne. «Είναι πολύ αφοσιωμένοι και πραγματικά πολύ υποστηρικτικοί - είναι από αυτούς που μένουν μαζί σου. Είναι απίστευτη εμπειρία να τους γνωρίζω μετά τα show και να διαβάζω τα γράμματα τους, γιατί τα πράγματα που θα μου πουν είναι πολύ ξεχωριστά και σημαντικά για μένα. Είναι ότι χρειάζομαι να ακούσω. Αν μπορώ να δώσω έστω σε ένα άτομο δύναμη μέσα από τη μουσική μου είναι τέλειο!!»

Early life
Avril Ramona Lavigne was born in
Belleville , Ontario. Her father, Jean-Claude Lavigne, named her "Avril" after the French word for the month of April. At the age of two, she began singing church songs with her mother, [ 1 ]
Judith-Rosanne "Judy" (nιe Loshaw). Judy recognized her two-year-old daughter's talents after hearing her sing " Jesus Loves Me " in church. [ 2 ]
Lavigne has an older brother, Matthew, and a younger sister, Michelle, [ 3 ]
both of whom teased her when she sang. "My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying." [ 2 ]
When Lavigne was five years old, the family moved to
Napanee , Ontario, [ 1 ]
a town with an approximate population of 5,000. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
Although she struggled with paying attention in school, sometimes being kicked out of class for misbehaving, her parents supported her singing. Her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, several guitars, and converted their basement into a studio. When Lavigne was 14, her parents would take her to karaoke sessions. [ 7 ]
Lavigne also performed at country fairs, singing songs by
Garth Brooks ,
The Dixie Chicks , and Shania Twain. She also began writing her own songs. Her first song was called "Can't Stop Thinking About You", about a teenage crush, which she described as "cheesy cute". [ 8 ]
"
I've known all my life that this is what I was supposed to do.... Visualizing like what it would be like to be famous with my music. And always just dreaming, always daydreaming.
"
Avril Lavigne, NBC News [ 7 ]
In 1999, [ 9 ]
Lavigne won a radio contest to perform with fellow Canadian singer Shania Twain at the Corel Centre (now
Scotiabank Place ) in Ottawa, before an audience of 20,000 people. [ 1 ] [ 4 ]
Twain and Lavigne sang " What Made You Say That ", [ 1 ]
and Lavigne told Twain she was going to be "a famous singer". [ 4 ]
During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, "Touch the Sky", for his 1999 album,
Quinte Spirit . She later sang on "Temple of Life" and "Two Rivers" for his follow-up album,
My Window to You , in 2000. In December 1999, Lavigne was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing
country
covers at a
Chapters
bookstore in
Kingston , Ontario. [ 1 ] [ 4 ]
Fabri sent out VHS tapes of Lavigne's home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was visited by several executives. [ 10 ]
Mark Jowett, co-founder of the Canadian management firm
Nettwerk , received a copy of Lavigne's karaoke performances recorded in her parents' basement. [ 11 ]
Jowett arranged for Lavigne to work with
Peter Zizzo
during the summer of 2000 in New York, where she wrote the song "Why?". Lavigne was noticed by
Arista Records
on a subsequent trip to New York. [ 10 ]
Lavigne would go on to sell more than 30 million copies of her albums worldwide, [ 12 ]
becoming one of the top-selling artists releasing albums in the U.S., with over 10.25 million copies certified by the RIAA. [ 13 ]
In 2009,
Billboard
named Lavigne the No. 10 pop artist in the "Best of the 2000s" chart. [ 14 ]
She was listed as the 28th overall best act of the decade based on album and single chart performance in the U.S. [ 15 ]

In November 2000, [ 5 ]
Ken Krongard, an
A&R
representative, invited Antonio "L.A." Reid, then head of Arista Records, to producer Peter Zizzo's Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne sing. Her 15-minute audition "so impressed" Reid, he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth $1.25 million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing advance. [ 6 ] [ 1 ]
By this time, Lavigne had found that she fit in naturally with her hometown high school's skater clique, an image that carried through to her first album, but although she enjoyed
skateboarding , school left her feeling insecure. Armed with a record deal, she dropped out to focus on her music career, [ 5 ]
but she still had to inform her parents of her decision. "I wasn't going to turn [the record deal] down. It's been my dream all my life. They knew how much I wanted this and how much I've put into it." [ 16 ] [ 8 ]
Reid gave A&R Joshua Sarubin the responsibility for overseeing Lavigne's development and the recording of her debut album. [ 17 ]
They spent several months in New York working with different co-writers trying to forge an individual sound for her. Sarubin told
HitQuarters
that for while they struggled finding her sound and although early collaborations with songwriter-producers including Sabelle Breer, Curt Frasca and Peter Zizzo, resulted in some good songs, they didn't match her and her voice. [ 17 ]
It was only when Lavigne then went to Los Angeles in May 2001 and created two songs with
The Matrix
production team - including "Complicated" - that the record company felt she had made a major breakthrough. [ 17 ]
Lavigne then worked further with The Matrix and also with singer-songwriter Cliff Magness. Recording finished in January 2002. [ 17 ]
Lavigne released her debut album,
Let Go , on 4 June 2002 in the U.S., where it reached No. 2 on the
Billboard
200. It peaked at No. 1 on the Australian, Canadian, and UK charts. This made Lavigne, at 17 years old, the youngest female soloist to have a No. 1 album in the UK until that time. [ 18 ]
By the end of 2002, the album was certified four-times platinum by the RIAA, making her the bestselling female artist of 2002 and
Let Go
the top-selling debut of the year. [ 19 ]
By May 2003,
Let Go
had accumulated over 1,000,000 sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification from the
Canadian Recording Industry Association . [ 20 ]
As of 2009, the album has sold over 16 million units worldwide, [ 21 ]
and the RIAA has certified the album six-times platinum, denoting shipments of over six million units in the U.S. [ 22 ]
"
I don't get overwhelmed, just because I feel like I've kind of prepared myself for it. All my life this is what I've wanted, what I've dreamed about, and I knew this would happen. I've been singing ever since I was really young and I've wanted this so bad, and I told myself I would do it.
"
Avril Lavigne on her success, MTV [ 5 ]
Lavigne's debut single and the album's

Dawson's Creek . "Complicated" later ranked on the
Hot 100 Singles of the Decade
list at No. 83. [ 23 ]
Subsequent singles, "Sk8er Boi" and "I'm With You" reached the top ten in the U.S. [ 24 ]

Vancouver, Canada
during the Live and By Surprise mall tour
Lavigne co-wrote " Breakaway " with Matthew Gerard, which was recorded by
Kelly Clarkson
for the soundtrack to the 2004 film
The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement . [ 35 ]
"Breakaway" would later be included on Clarkson's
second album
and released as the album's lead single. Lavigne covered the Goo Goo Dolls song "Iris", performed with the band's lead singer
John Rzeznik
at
Fashion Rocks , [ 36 ]
and she posed for the cover of
Maxim
in October 2004. [ 37 ]
She also recorded the theme song for
The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie . "I made the song a little more edgy", Lavigne said. "There are a lot of loud guitars, and we picked the tempo up a little and sang it with a little more attitude." Lavigne rearranged the song with the help of producer Butch Walker. [ 38 ]
Lavigne's second studio album,
Under My Skin , was released on 25 May 2004, debuting at No. 1 in several countries, including Australia, Mexico, Canada, Japan, the UK, and the U.S. [ 39 ]
The album has sold more than 10 million copies. Lavigne wrote most of the album's tracks with Canadian singer-songwriter
Chantal Kreviazuk . Kreviazuk's husband,
Our Lady Peace
front man
Raine Maida , co-produced the album, along with
Butch Walker
and Don Gilmore. Lavigne went on the Live and By Surprise twenty-one city mall tour in the U.S. and Canada to promote the album, accompanied by her guitarist,
Evan Taubenfeld . Each performance consisted of a short live acoustic set of songs from the new album. At the end of 2004, Lavigne embarked on her first world tour, the
Bonez Tour , which had stopovers in almost every continent and lasted for the entire 2005 year.
"
This record definitely proves that I'm a writer and people can't knock that, because each song comes from a personal experience of mine, and there are so much emotions in those songs.
"
Avril Lavigne,
The Ledger [ 40 ]
" Don't Tell Me ", the lead single of the album, went to No. 1 in Argentina and Mexico and reached the top five in the UK and Canada and the top ten in Australia and Brazil. "My Happy Ending", the album's second single, went to No. 1 in Mexico and the top five in the UK and Australia. In the U.S., it reached the top ten of the
Billboard
Hot 100 and went to No. 1 in the Mainstream Top 40, making it her fourth-biggest hit there. The third single, " Nobody's Home ", did not make the top 40 in the U.S., reaching No. 1 only in Mexico and Argentina. The fourth single from the album, " He Wasn't ", reached top 40 positions in the UK and Australia and was not released in the U.S. [ 41 ]

The Best Damn Thing
On 26 February 2006, Lavigne represented Canada at the
closing ceremony of the Torino Olympics , performing her song "Who Knows" during the eight minute
Vancouver 2010
portion. [ 43 ]
While Lavigne was in the studio for her third studio album,
Fox Entertainment Group
approached her to write a song for the soundtrack to the 2006 fantasy-adventure film
Eragon . She wrote and recorded two "ballad-type" songs, but only one, " Keep Holding On ", was used for the film. [ 44 ]
Lavigne admitted that writing the song was challenging, making sure it flowed with the film. She emphasized that "Keep Holding On", which later appeared on the album, was not indicative of what the next album would be like. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]
Lavigne in 2007 at a press conference in Hong Kong, promoting
The Best Damn Thing
Lavigne's third album,
The Best Damn Thing , was released on 17 April 2007, which Lavigne immediately promoted with a small tour. Its lead single, " Girlfriend ", topped the
Billboard
Hot 100 the same week
The Best Damn Thing
debuted at No. 1 on the
Billboard
200 chart. "Girlfriend" was Lavigne's first single to reach this No. 1 position. [ 47 ]
The single was a worldwide hit; it also peaked at No. 1 in Australia, Canada, Japan, and Italy and reached No. 2 in the UK and France. "Girlfriend" was recorded in Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Japanese, and Mandarin. The
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry
ranked "Girlfriend" as the most-downloaded track worldwide in 2007, selling 7.3 million copies, including the versions recorded in eight different languages. [ 48 ] [ 12 ]
"Girlfriend" ranked on the
Hot 100 Singles of the Decade
list at No. 94. [ 49 ]
" When You're Gone ", the second single, went to No. 3 in the UK, the top five in Australia and Italy, the top ten in Canada, and was close to reaching the top twenty in the U.S. In December 2007, Lavigne, with annual earnings of $12 million, was ranked number eight in the
Forbes
"Top 20 Earners Under 25". [ 50 ]
" Hot " was the third single and has been Lavigne's least successful single in the U.S., charting only at No. 95. In Canada, "Hot" made the top ten, and in Australia, the top 20.
The Best Damn Thing
has sold over 6 million copies worldwide.
During this era, Lavigne won nearly every award she was nominated for, including two
World Music Awards
for "World's Bestselling Canadian Artist" and "World's Best Pop/Rock Female Artist". She took her first two
MTV Europe Music Awards , received one
Teen Choice Awards
for "Summer Single", and was nominated for five Juno awards.
In mid-2007, Lavigne was featured in a two-volume
graphic novel ,
Avril Lavigne's Make 5 Wishes . She collaborated with artist
Camilla D'Errico
and writer
Joshua Dysart
on the
manga , which was about a shy girl named Hana who, upon meeting her hero Avril Lavigne, learned to overcome her fears. Lavigne said, "I know that many of my fans read manga, and I'm really excited to be involved in creating stories that I know they will enjoy." The volumes were released on 10 April (one week prior to the release of
The Best Damn Thing ) and in July, respectively. The publication
Young Adult Library Services
nominated the series for "Great Graphic Novels for Teens". [ 51 ]
In March 2008, Lavigne undertook a world tour named The Best Damn Tour to support the album. In that same month, she also appeared on the cover of
Maxim
for the second time of her career. [ 52 ]
In mid-August, Malaysia's Islamic opposition party, the
Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party , attempted to ban Lavigne's show in
Kuala Lumpur , judging her stage moves "too sexy". Her concert on 29 August was considered as promoting wrong values ahead of Malaysia's independence day on 31 August. [ 53 ]
On 21 August 2008, MTV reported that the concert had been approved by the Malaysian government. [ 54 ]

Lavigne singing in Florida during her
Black Star Tour , May 2011.
Only a month after completing The Best Damn Tour, Lavigne began recording in her home studio in November 2008 with the song "Black Star", [ 55 ]
written to help promote her first fragrance of the same name. [ 56 ]
By July 2009, nine tracks had been recorded for the new album, [ 55 ]
including the songs "Fine", "Everybody Hurts" and "Darlin". Several of the tracks were written in Lavigne's youth. "Darlin" was the second song Lavigne wrote as a 15-year-old while living in Napanee, Ontario. Lavigne described the album as being about "life". She stated, "It's so easy for me to do a boy-bashing pop song, but to sit down and write honestly about something that's really close to me, something I've been through, it's a totally different thing." [ 56 ]
The album is expected to be a return to Lavigne's older musical style and may be largely
acoustic . [ 57 ]
With the exception of the album's lead single, " What the Hell ", Lavigne described the songs on the album as different from her earlier material: "I'm older now, so I think that comes across in my music, it's not as
pop-rock ". [ 58 ]
In January 2010, while simultaneously writing and recording for her new album, Lavigne worked with
Disney
clothing designs inspired by
Tim Burton 's feature film,
Alice in Wonderland . She asked the executives if she could write a song for the film. The result was the song " Alice ", [ 59 ]
which was played over the end credits [ 60 ]
and included on the soundtrack,
Almost Alice . [ 61 ]
On 28 February, Lavigne gave a performance at the concert portion of the Vancouver
2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony , performing "My Happy Ending" and "Girlfriend". [ 62 ]
Lavigne was honoured to perform at the ceremonies, but she regretted not being able to attend the U.S. vs. Canada hockey match. "They had us on lockdown. We weren't allowed to leave our trailers, for security purposes." [ 63 ]
In September 2010, Lavigne's third single from her debut album, "I'm With You", was sampled by
Rihanna
on the track " Cheers (Drink to That) ", which is featured on Rihanna's fifth studio album,
Loud . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]
In August 2011, she was featured in the music video for Cheers (Drink To That). "It's exciting to me because that was always one of my favorite songs, and for it to come out 10 years ago and so now to have it sampled and back out on the radio is pretty dope". [ 66 ]
In December 2010, American singer
Miranda Cosgrove
released " Dancing Crazy ", a song written by Lavigne,
Max Martin
and
Shellback . It was also produced by Martin. [ 67 ]
On 23 September 2011, Lavigne appeared in the
Hub network
show
Majors & Minors
as a guest mentor, alongside other singers including
Adam Lambert
and
Leona Lewis . About the show Lavigne stated "I sang for them, and they performed for me. I was just blown away. I got to talk to them about music and the music industry, and they were all just so excited". [ 66 ]
The release dates for
Goodbye Lullaby
and its lead single were pushed back several times. In response to these delays, Lavigne said, "I write my own music and, therefore, it takes me longer to put out records 'cause I have to live my life to get inspiration", [ 68 ]
and that she had enough material for two records. [ 68 ]
In November, Lavigne was featured in
Maxim , where she revealed that
Goodbye Lullaby
took two and a half years to complete, [ 69 ]
but she cited her record company as the reason for the album's delays, stating that the album had been completed for a year. [ 70 ]
Goodbye Lullaby
was released on 8 March. [ 71 ] [ 58 ]
The lead single, "What the Hell", premiered on
Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve
on 31 December. [ 71 ]
2011-present: fifth studio album
Three months after the release of
Goodbye Lullaby , Lavigne announced that work on her fifth studio album had already begun, with eight songs written so far. The new album will musically be the opposite of
Goodbye Lullaby . Lavigne explained, "[ Goodbye Lullaby ] was more mellow, [but] the next one will be pop and more fun again. I already have a song that I know is going to be a single, I just need to re-record it!" [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ]
Later, in July 2011, Lavigne revealed the title of two of the songs from her fifth album as "Fine" and "Gone". The tracks were originally recorded for
Goodbye Lullaby
but never made the final cut.
Lavigne's fifth album is rumoured to be released in 2012, "far earlier than imagined". However, nothing has been confirmed by Lavigne or her record label as to when the album will be released. [ 75 ]
In September 2011 Lavigne stated that she had a "few" tracks ready for the record, before stating a month later in an interview with
Virgin Radio 96
that she would begin production on it by January 2012. [ 66 ]
In a recent interview, Lavigne confirmed that she has moved to
Epic Records
which is now headed by
L.A. Reid .

Musical style and songwriting
"
I know my fans look up to me and that's why I make my songs so personal; it's all about things I've experienced and things I like or hate. I write for myself and hope that my fans like what I have to say.
"
Avril Lavigne, Girl.com.au [ 78 ]
Themes in Lavigne's music include messages of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view. [ 79 ]
Lavigne believes her "songs are about being yourself no matter what and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true." [ 78 ]
On her debut album,
Let Go , Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as " Losing Grip ", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as " Complicated ", saying that "the songs I did with
the Matrix ... were good for my first record, but I don't want to be that pop anymore." [ 80 ]
Lavigne's second album,
Under My Skin , had deeper personal themes underlying each song. Lavigne explained, "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about.... Like boys, like dating or relationships". [ 81 ]
In contrast, her third album,
The Best Damn Thing , was not personal to her. "Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through." [ 82 ]
Her objective in writing the album was simply to "make it fun". [ 83 ]
Goodbye Lullaby , Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records, [ 55 ]
with Lavigne describing the album as "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional". [ 84 ]
Growing up, Lavigne listened to
Blink-182 ,
Goo Goo Dolls ,
Matchbox Twenty
and
Shania Twain , [ 80 ]
and her influences include
Courtney Love
and
Janis Joplin . [ 81 ]
Because of these influences, musical genres, and her personal style, the media often defined her as
punk , something she denied being. Lavigne's close friend and guitarist,
Evan Taubenfeld , said, "It's a very touchy subject to a lot of people, but the point is that Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest". [ 85 ]
Lavigne also commented on the matter: "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [a] rebel... punk, and I am
so
not any of them." [ 40 ]
Most of critics identify Lavigne as some form between teen pop and pop-punk: Publications such as
The New York Times ,
Rolling Stone ,
NME ,
MusicMight ,
IGN
and
Popmatters
have identified Avril Lavigne as a mix of
rock ,
teen pop
and
pop-punk . [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ]
While Lavigne denied being angry, her interviews were still passionate about the media's lack of respect for her songwriting. "I am a writer, and I won't accept people trying to take that away from me", adding that she had been writing "full-structured songs" since she was 14. [ 40 ]
Despite this, Lavigne's songwriting has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio, the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, claimed that they were the main songwriters of Lavigne's singles, "Complicated", " Sk8er Boi " and " I'm with You ". Lavigne denied this, asserting that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album. "[N]one of those songs aren't from me". [ 80 ]
In 2007,
Chantal Kreviazuk , who wrote with Lavigne on her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism [ 92 ]
and criticized her songwriting. "Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything". [ 93 ]
Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for "clear defamation" against her character. [ 93 ]
Kreviazuk later apologized: "Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her". [ 92 ]
Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the 1970s band, the
Rubinoos , sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and
Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald
for allegedly stealing parts of "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" for her song "Girlfriend". [ 94 ]
Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, "me and Avril wrote the song together ...;. It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you'd find in a
Sum 41
song. It's the
Sex Pistols , not the Rubinoos." [ 93 ]
In January 2008, the lawsuit was closed after a confidential settlement had been reached. [ 95 ]
Other work
Film career
Lavigne became interested in appearing on television and in feature films. The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos would be to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video "Nobody's Home" involved the most "acting". [ 78 ]
Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of
Sabrina, the Teenage Witch , [ 96 ]
performing "Sk8er Boi" [ 97 ]
with her band in a nightclub. [ 98 ]
She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film
Going the Distance . The main characters bump into her backstage at the
MuchMusic Video Awards [ 99 ]
after her performance of "Losing Grip". [ 100 ]
Lavigne at the Los Angeles premiere of
Over the Hedge
on 30 April 2006.
She moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to
New Mexico [ 101 ]
to film a single scene in the 2007 film,
The Flock . [ 102 ]
She starred as Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside
Claire Danes
and
Richard Gere . Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes. [ 102 ]
On her role in
The Flock , Lavigne said, "I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into too fast". [ 78 ]
The Flock
would not be released in American theatres, and because it would not be released in foreign markets until late 2007, it would not be considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7 million in the foreign box office. [ 103 ]
Lavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film
Over the Hedge , based on the
comic strip of the same name . She voiced the character Heather, a
Virginia Opossum . Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, "All the actors went in individually, and [director]
Tim
and [screenwriter
Karey ] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of." [ 104 ]
Lavigne found the recording process to be "easy" and "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. " thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". [ 78 ]
The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38 million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336 million worldwide. [ 105 ]
In December 2005, Lavigne signed on to appear in
Fast Food Nation , based on the book
Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal . [ 106 ]
The fictionalized adaptation, directed by
Richard Linklater , traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses. [ 107 ]
Lavigne starred in her on-screen acting debut [ 108 ]
as a high school student intent on freeing the cows. [ 109 ]
The film opened on 17 November 2006 and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2 million worldwide. [ 110 ]
Both
Over the Hedge
and
Fast Food Nation
opened at the 2006
Cannes Film Festival , which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the "right parts and the right movies." Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. "I wanted to start off small and to learn [that] I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part." [ 78 ]
In August 2006,
Canadian Business
magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits. [ 111 ]
Entrepreneurship
In July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line
Abbey Dawn , featuring a back-to-school collection. [ 12 ]
It is produced by
Kohl's , which is the brand's exclusive U.S. retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself. [ 112 ] [ 113 ]
Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a "juniors lifestyle brand", [ 12 ]
which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and "hot pinks and blacks". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. "I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all." [ 114 ]
The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, "after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career". [ 66 ]
"
I just love clothes and colors and patterns. I'm very visual and very hands-on.
"
Avril Lavigne,
Billboard [ 115 ]
The designs were also featured on the Internet game
Stardoll , where figures can be dressed up as Avril Lavigne. [ 116 ]
On 14 September 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the
New York Fashion Week . [ 117 ]
Lavigne returned to the New York Fashion Week once again in 2011 with
Kylie Jenner ,
half sister
to Lavigne's boyfriend Brody Jenner, making her runway debut modelling Abbey Dawn. [ 66 ]
In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official website. [ 118 ] [ 84 ]
"It's fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I'd like for myself. I design things I [can't] find." [ 63 ]
At the end of 2008, Lavigne signed a contract with
Canon
Canada to appear in advertising campaigns and commercials to promote the latest line of cameras and a full range of other accessories. [ 119 ]
Lavigne released her first fragrance,
Black Star , created by
Procter & Gamble
Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on 7 March 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, was released in summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the U.S. and Canada. [ 120 ]
When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, "I wanted to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are." [ 121 ]
Black Star won the 2010 Best "Women's Scent Mass" by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW). [ 122 ]
Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, [ 123 ]
Forbidden Rose , which took two years to develop. [ 124 ]
It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla. [ 123 ]
Its message is an extension of Black Star's "follow your dreams", [ 125 ]
though the tagline for the new perfume is "Dare to Discover". [ 126 ]
The commercial takes place in a
gothic
garden setting, [ 125 ]
where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose. [ 126 ]
Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010. [ 84 ]
The tagline for the fragrance is "Dare to discover more". [ 127 ]
It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and crθme brϋlιe. [ 128 ]
In January 2010, Lavigne began working with Disney to incorporate
Alice in Wonderland -inspired designs into her Abbey Dawn line of clothing. [ 59 ]
Her designs were exhibited at the
Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising
in California beginning in May through September, alongside
Colleen Atwood 's costumes from the 2010 film. [ 129 ]
Philanthropy
Lavigne has been involved with many charities, including
Make Some Noise, Amnesty International , Erase MS, AmericanCPR.org, Camp Will-a-Way, Music Clearing Minefields,
U.S. Campaign for Burma ,
Make-a-Wish Foundation
and
War Child . She has also appeared in
ALDO
ads with YouthAIDS to raise money to educate people worldwide about HIV/AIDS. Lavigne took part in the Unite Against AIDS concert presented by ALDO in support of Unicef on 28 November 2007 at the
Bell Centre
in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. [ 130 ]
In November 2010, Lavigne attended the
Clinton Global Initiative . [ 131 ]
Lavigne worked with
Reverb , a non-profit environmental organization, for her 2005 east coast tour. [ 132 ]
She covered " Knockin' on Heaven's Door " for War Child's
Peace Songs
compilation, and she recorded a cover of the
John Lennon
song " Imagine " as her contribution to the compilation album
Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur . Released on 12 June 2007, the album was produced to benefit
Amnesty International 's campaign to alleviate the
crisis in Darfur . [ 133 ]
On 5 December 2009, Lavigne returned to the stage in
Mexico City
during the biggest charity event in Latin America, " Teleton ". She performed acoustic versions of her hits "Complicated" and "Girlfriend" with Evan Taubenfeld and band member,
Jim McGorman . [ 134 ]
In 2010, Lavigne was one of
several artists
who contributed their voices to a cover of
K'naan 's "Wavin' Flag" as a benefit single to help raise money for several charity organizations related to the 2010 Haiti earthquake. [ 135 ]
On 14 September 2010, Lavigne introduced her charity, "The Avril Lavigne Foundation". The next day, the foundation's official website was launched. The foundation aims to help young people with serious illnesses and disabilities [ 131 ] [ 136 ]
and works with leading charitable organizations; [ 118 ]
The foundation partners with the
Easter Seals , Make-A-Wish foundation and Erase MS, [ 137 ]
the latter two being charities Lavigne has previously worked with. Her work with the Make-A-Wish foundation was the inspiration behind her own charity, with Lavigne stating, "I just really wanted to do more". [ 136 ]
Lavigne said on the foundation's website, "I have always looked for ways to give back because I think it's a responsibility we all share". [ 138 ]
Philanthropist Trevor Neilson's 12-person firm, " Global Philanthropy Group ", advises Lavigne with her foundation as well as several other celebrities, including musician
John Legend . [ 131 ]
Personal life
Public image
"
I have to fight to keep my image really
me .... I rejected some gorgeous publicity shots because they just didn't look like me. I won't wear skanky clothes that show my booty, my belly or my boobs. I have a great body.
"
Avril Lavigne, MTV [ 5 ]
When Lavigne first gained publicity, she was known for her
tomboyish
style, [ 139 ]
in particular her necktie-and-tank-top combinations. [ 140 ] [ 141 ]
She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or
Converses , [ 63 ]
wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers. [ 7 ]
During photo shoots, instead of wearing "glittery get-ups", she preferred wearing "old, crumpled T's". [ 5 ]
In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media would call her the " pop punk princess ". [ 142 ] [ 143 ]
Press and fans regarded her as the
"anti-Britney" , in part because of her less-commercial and "real" image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. "I'm not made up and I'm not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I'm not." [ 7 ]
By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was "wearing a costume". [ 6 ]
Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career. "I'm just saying, I don't want to sell sex. I feel that's sort of lame and low. I've got so much more to say." [ 144 ]
Lavigne eventually took on a more
gothic
style as she began her second album,
Under My Skin , trading her skating outfits for black
tutus [ 143 ]
and earning an image marked by
angst . [ 145 ]
During
The Best Damn Thing
years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits, [ 146 ]
including "tight jeans and heels", [ 63 ]
and modelled for magazines such as
Harper's Bazaar . [ 139 ]
Lavigne defended her new style: "I don't really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wifebeaters and all... It had its time and place. And now I'm all grown up, and I've moved on". [ 146 ]
She now tries to eat healthy foods and practises yoga, soccer, surfing, rollerblading, and street hockey. [ 63 ]
Tattoos
Lavigne's XXV and star tattoos on her right forearm, and 30, lightning bolt, and star tattoos on her left wrist.
Only a few of Lavigne's tattoos are unique to her: the rest are matched with friends'. [ 63 ]
Lavigne had a star tattooed on the inside of her left wrist that matched the style of the one used for her first album artwork. It was created at the same time as friend and musical associate
Ben Moody 's identical tattoo. [ 147 ]
In late 2004, she had a small pink heart around the letter "D" applied to her right wrist, which represented her then-boyfriend, Deryck Whibley. [ 63 ] [ 148 ]
Lavigne and then-husband Whibley got matching tattoos in March 2010, in celebration of his 30th birthday. [ 63 ]
In April, Lavigne added another tattoo on her wrist: that of a lightning bolt and the number 30. Her boyfriend,
Brody Jenner , had a matching lightning bolt tattooed under his ear. [ 149 ]
"
Everything is always spur-of-the-moment. All of my tattoos, I decide that second and do it.
"
Avril Lavigne,
Inked [ 63 ]
Her love of tattoos, however, gained media attention in May 2010, after Lavigne and Jenner each got matching tattoos of the word "fuck" on their ribs. [ 150 ] [ 151 ]
Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for
Inked
magazine , where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an "Abbey Dawn" on her left forearm and an "XXV" and star on her right. Although she confirmed
the "fuck" tattoo
verbally in the article (calling it her "favorite word" [ 63 ] ) she had it applied
after
the magazine's photo shoot. [ 152 ]
She added that she eventually wanted to get a "big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name.... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that special someone to come back into my life." [ 63 ]
In July 2010, Lavigne had the name "Brody" tattooed beneath her right breast. [ 153 ]
Marriage to Deryck Whibley
Lavigne's ex-husband, Deryck Whibley
Lavigne and
Deryck Whibley , lead singer and guitarist for the band
Sum 41 , began dating when she was 19 years old, after being friends since she was 17. [ 154 ]
Only a few weeks before they met, Lavigne admitted that she was not meeting boys because her bodyguards were frightening them away. In June 2005, Whibley surprised Lavigne with a trip to
Venice , including a
gondola
ride and a romantic picnic, and on 27 June, he proposed to her. [ 155 ]
She at first wanted to have a "rock n' roll, goth wedding", but she admitted to having doubts about going against tradition. "I've been dreaming about my wedding day since I was a little girl. I have to wear the white dress.... People thought that I would black wedding dress, and I would have. But at the same time, I was thinking about the wedding pictures, and I wanted to be in style. I didn't want to be thinking, 20 years later, 'Oh, why did I wear my hair like that? ' " [ 156 ]
The wedding was held on 15 July 2006. About 110 guests attended the wedding, which was held at a private estate in
Montecito, California . [ 157 ]
Lavigne, wearing a gown designed by
Vera Wang
walked down the aisle with her father, Jean-Claude, to
Mendelssohn 's " Wedding March ". Lavigne chose a colour theme of red and white, including red rose petals and centrepieces of distinctly coloured flowers. The wedding included cocktails for an hour before the reception and a sit-down dinner. The song " Iris ", by the
Goo Goo Dolls , was played during Lavigne and Whibley's first dance. [ 158 ]
Seven months into their marriage, Lavigne stated that she was "the best thing that's ever happened to him", and suggested that she helped Whibley stay off drugs since they had begun dating. "He doesn't do drugs. Clearly, he used to, because he talked about it, but I wouldn't be with someone who did, and I made that very clear to him when we first started dating. I've never done cocaine in my life, and I'm proud of that. I am 100 percent against drugs." [ 156 ]
The marriage lasted a little more than three years. It was announced on 17 September 2009 that Lavigne and Whibley had split up and that divorce papers would soon follow. [ 159 ]
On 9 October 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce, releasing the statement, "I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship." [ 154 ]
The divorce was finalized on 16 November 2010, officially ending the marriage. [ 160 ]

Megan Megan, what did you do? I can see a nose job, chin and Botox are definitely on your plate. Your mouth has gotten a LOT fuller, you've gotten
breast implants
and a lift, and it looks like you have been
airbrushed
to death. You went from a
natural beauty
to
just another
*starlet* who has overdone it with
plastic surgery
(see Heidi Montag).
Here the nose work is most obvious
And the 2 pictures above conclude the horrible saga for me. Here, what once was gold has been rendered ordinary. The rest of the "work" I am not concerned about one way or another but the chin and more so the cheeks have delivered a fatal blow to her looks. She has crossed the border into the badlands of
plastic surgery and
there may not be a road home. I can no longer say that I find this face attractive.
Now that she looks *just like everyone else* she'll have to rely on her talent for jobs. When has she last worked anyway? Hmmmmmmmmmm.
What will we see after the next round?
Holy Cow! I can't believe we let this story go without posting an update, because this is headline news for a
celebrity plastic surgery
site. This is one of the utter tragedies of the glamour world. We posted a single before after
photo
in January (although the surgeries started long before that) and then forgot to look closely and follow the terrible progression of a plastic disaster. This will be the first in a series documenting the sad story.
You all know I am speaking of
Megan Fox
right? She went from a
natural beauty
to a platicized version of herself. With all the work she, and some of these Hollywood people are doing, Madame Tussaud will no longer NEED to create wax figures. They'll be able to just snap a picture and hang it!
So, what happens when you're told over and over and over again that you are one of
the most beautiful women in the world , that your body and face are close to perfect? Why, you get plastic surgery of course!
And the story needs little commentary about the specifics because the pictures make it quite clear and you can see what has been happening. Let's start with some of young to middle transformation period comparison pictures. This part is fairly tame but you can see the changes beginning and it just looks like a slightly different face, for the shameful conclusion, see
Megan Fox Before and After II
Megan Fox appears well and truly fed up with the rumours that she has had Botox. So what's a girl to do?
The actress has silenced the whispers by posting a series of pictures on her Facebook page in an album entitled 'Things You Can't Do with Your Face when You Have Botox.'
Megan proves her forehead muscles are not frozen by pulling an number of facial expressions.
The former Transformers star scrunches her face into a deep frown in one shot, creating frown lines.
In another she wears a worried expression, and points to the lines on her forehead.
In an interview last year with Allure magazine, Megan denied she had any fillers in her famous pout.
'My lips are my lips,' she said, but didn't necessarily condemn plastic surgery.
She added: 'I would encourage anyone to first speak with a therapist, to try and figure out where this want comes from, because a lot of times it's not related to your teeth or your nose or your chin - the surgery is not going to alleviate that insecurity for you.
I've never been as interested in
Megan Fox
as to look into her (past or present). But something has caught my attention while doing my daily blogosphere reading.
In Touch Magazine
published a story about
Megan Fox
and her
Transformers
ways. And no, there was hardly any reference to Megan's movie roles! It was all about creating beauty. The Nip/Tuck way! (the story continues right after the jump!)
A la base, Megan Fox is just a regular girl, like all of us. Before hitting stardom (and slightly after), Megan was skillfully improved to fit an
Angelina Jolie
perfect pattern. Spicing everything up with infamous declarations about how and who she really is, Megan Fox got into many heads as the picture of very physical perfection.
She was no ugly duck, that's for sure, but I seeing these photos I realize the huge ingenuity percent flooding my perception over the world. Especially the entertainment world. Were you suspicious that Megan was somewhat
surgically enhanced ? (is it all just a lie to draw even more attention in Megan's direction?) Who surprised you the most when insights surfaced about him/her having had plastic
surgery ? (it was Michelle Pfeiffer who opened my eyes on the lies beneath beauty) (photos
via )

[on being asked if she had a crush on
Angelina Jolie ] Absolutely. Every time a relationship ends, I say, 'If I could just be Angelina's girlfriend, I would be so happy.' I love Angelina Jolie. She's someone I admire and look up to. She's my favorite actress in Hollywood. I just love that she's incredibly honest, and I feel that she's not afraid to be herself. She tells you exactly what's on her mind.
Look, I'm not a lesbian, I just think that all humans are born with the ability to be attracted to both sexes. I mean, I could see myself in a relationship with a girl.

Personal Quotes
[on working with
Michael Bay ] Michael Bay's name, if it's attached to a script, you know it's going to be a huge blockbuster released in the summer, with jets flying over at the premiere and all that kind of stuff. So, I knew it was going to be a huge movie.
[on
George Clooney ] He's sarcastic, and he has a different girlfriend constantly. It's considered charismatic. He's like this James Bond, sexy dude. The older he gets, the better he gets. It's a double standard. To be outspoken, or different at all, is a problem for women. As soon as you curse or, God forbid, make some sort of sexual reference that's a joke, you're labeled a party girl. They don't do that with men, so I feel it would be a lot easier.
[Director
Michael Bay ] doesn't like really skinny actresses. He's been traumatized by them for some reason in the past. So I always try to put on eight to ten pounds before [filming], and I'm always the fattest I've ever been when making a
Transformers
(2007) movie.
[on her
Marilyn Monroe
tattoo] I committed to having her face on my arm for the rest of my life, so I have to be a pretty big fan.
Wonder Woman is lame. She flies around in an invisible jet, but she's not invisible. I don't get it.
Look, I'm not a lesbian, I just think that all humans are born with the ability to be attracted to both sexes. I mean, I could see myself in a relationship with a girl.
Olivia Wilde
is so sexy she makes me want to strangle a mountain ox with my bare hands. She's mesmerizing.
Zac Efron
is my obsession, we're the same person. We're not actually here, it's like [ Janet Jackson ] and
Michael Jackson . He just puts on his wig and a dress, and it's me, and you don't know that. It's one of the greatest mysteries of all time.
Boys in their twenties are a waste of time. They have nothing to offer conversationally; they're immature. I feel like I have a better shot with someone in his thirties.
When I go to a party, I always feel like I'm chum. Like my agent is just chumming the waters until I'm circled by all these dudes.
People assume that I'm really promiscuous. There's a difference between being very sexual and being promiscuous. I'm not promiscuous. I'm extraordinarily sexual within a monogamous relationship. Nothing's off-limits. But that has nothing to do with experiencing a lot of people. I've only had two boyfriends my whole life.
If I ever lose a role because of my tattoos, I'll quit Hollywood and go to work at Costco.
[on
Shia LaBeouf ] He probably is my favourite person in the entire world. Shia makes me laugh harder than anybody I've ever known in my life. I end up crying or almost peeing myself every time I'm with him. So he's just my favourite - I love you, Shia! And he's really super-handsome!
[on
Angelina Jolie ] I'm actually frightened of her, I haven't had the opportunity to meet her and I try to avoid that because I'm afraid. Angelina's a powerful person and I bet she would eat me alive. I guess that is why I'm afraid of her. There have been a lot of films I've had to pass on because I don't want people thinking I'm trying to emulate her.
When I moved to Los Angeles I had no money. I remember needing to shave my legs, and I didn't even have enough money to buy disposable razors. So I'd wear pants all the time.
Women are expected to be conformist automatons in L.A. but in Britain you can be more yourself and people will take you on face value.
I don't trust male intentions, usually, because they don't approach me for intellectual conversation.
Hollywood is the most superficial thing you could possibly be a part of and if I weren't attractive I wouldn't be working at all.
I'm definitely labelled in the pin-up category. I haven't given people a reason to take my work seriously yet, which is my responsibility. I think the expectation for me, as far as my ability as an actress goes, is very low. I feel like that means I can only ever be an over-achiever when people expect so little from me.
I was with someone from the time I was 18 and I've never been my own independent adult. Right now there's no space in my head for who's going to be next or how I need to fill my time. I'm trying to expand myself and grow and be comfortable with who I am before I get into another relationship where I'll just repeat a cycle. Otherwise I will have ten failed relationships. I will be
Elizabeth Taylor
by the time I am 60 and I don't want that.
I'm kind of a recluse. I'm a hermit and it's because I do have a great fear of Hollywood, just watching what it does to people. You have to be a really strong human being to survive it, as a girl especially. So I try to avoid the Hollywood scene as much as possible and people who enjoy the Hollywood scene -- that's usually a red flag to me. Some people might think my life is boring, but I haven't been to rehab yet, so I think I'm doing something right!
I didn't decide I'm gonna be an actress cause I wanna be respected for how I play chess.
I do have a 22-inch waist, I will say that.
[on
Marilyn Monroe ] I just had an incredible amount of empathy for her my whole life. I cry when I see her on camera.
I worked at a Tropical Smoothie in Florida when I was 15. I would sometimes have to go out by the street in a gigantic banana costume and dance to try to get customers to come in. There was no anonymity - the costume had a big hole cut out so that everyone could see your face. My friends from school would drive back and forth and yell all kinds of awesome obscenities at me.
I grew up craving the spotlight and once it happened I immediately recoiled. It just always seemed really glamorous. As a child you think everyone who's famous is very wealthy and powerful. I thought my internal issues would be solved and I would be this really confident person. And I'm not.
[on giving male writers an amped-up version of her past] They're boys; they're easily toyed with. I tell stories and have them eating out of my hand.
Sex and the City
(2008), the movie, was so tragic. Costume dramas bore me and Hollywood comedies are total garbage, not funny at all. Fame doesn't mean anything because anyone can be famous, and TV news is mindless.
I have no friends and I never leave my house. You just have to make a choice to just refuse to be involved with things that could get you in trouble. It's easy when you feel upset or depressed about something to want to go to a club and want to drink, but instead I just force myself to sit and feel it and deal with it, and try to grow from it, because I don't want to go down that path. I'm one of the most isolated people in existence right now, but it's worth it because if I wasn't making that decision I would be throwing away my career.
[on
Angelina Jolie ] She always seems otherworldly in her power and her confidence. I'm sure she has no idea who I am.
[on
Transformers
(2007)] I'm terrible in it. It's my first real movie and it's not honest and not realistic. The movie wasn't bad, I just wasn't proud about what I did.
I think one day I could be a very good actress. But so far, I haven't done anything.
I'm not going to win an Oscar anytime soon. I'm not
Meryl Streep .
[on being asked if she had a crush on
Angelina Jolie ] Absolutely. Every time a relationship ends, I say, 'If I could just be Angelina's girlfriend, I would be so happy.' I love Angelina Jolie. She's someone I admire and look up to. She's my favorite actress in Hollywood. I just love that she's incredibly honest, and I feel that she's not afraid to be herself. She tells you exactly what's on her mind.
I am not a
Jennifer Aniston
or a
Britney Spears
or even a
Lindsay Lohan , you know? My pictures don't sell for that kind of money. But [of] the small level that I do deal with it, it is hard and there have been times [when] people don't want to hang out with me because they don't want to end up on the Internet. I sometimes just turn around and go back home and don't do anything and have to have someone go do my grocery shopping.
[on her childhood playtime] I played with Barbies but I used to decapitate them. I used to take their heads off then dye their hair and do weird things.
[on rumours that she will star in a new Lara Croft movie] I think that's a role that
Angelina Jolie
mastered, and I would never attempt to take that over from her.
When you think about it, we actors are kind of prostitutes. We get paid to feign attraction and love. Other people are paying to watch us kissing someone, touching someone, doing things people in a normal monogamous relationship would never do with anyone who's not their partner. It's really kind of gross.
[on her role in
Jonah Hex
(2010)] I'm sort of a tough, no-nonsense prostitute, like, she'll shoot you in the head if she has to. And she does. Actually not in the head but I get to shoot someone somewhere. It's a lot of fun.
I like to cut through the BS. I don't like small talk and I don't like to have to be a cookie cutter. That's a quality I started to develop as a kid in middle school. You know how everybody goes into cliques and you all talk behind everyone's back? I thought it was so ignorant. So I just really started being completely honest with everybody all of the time. It gets me into trouble often, but, at the end of the day, I think it's a good quality to have. I have become a little more aware of the media's tendency to twist things that I say.
If you know how to take control of being a sex symbol, then it can be powerful. But I have no idea how to handle it yet, how to deal with it.
If your idea of a role model is somebody who's gonna preach to your kids that sex before marriage is wrong and cursing is wrong and women should be this and be that, then I'm not a role model. But if you want your girls to feel strong and intelligent and be outspoken and fight for what they think is right, then I want to be that type of role model, yeah.
[on rumors she turned down the role of the girl in the 23rd James Bond movie] No one ever talked to me about doing that movie. I would never turn something like that down.
[on getting down to 99 pounds while shooting
Jennifer's Body
(2009)] I decided I would turn myself into a zombie. I got super, super skinny, stayed out of the sun for four months, and got to where I was losing my eyelashes and my eyebrows.
[on the possibility of making a sex tape] Ugh, never! That's the last thing I want to see - what I look like having sex. It would take one shot of me not looking good and I would not be able to have sex ever again, as I would always just see myself looking like a hippo having sex. It lives forever, especially now, with the Internet. I just can't. I just can't. Everything you say gets judged, everything you do gets judged. Literally all I have left are my private parts and I don't want to also share them with the world. I'd like to keep them private. That's why they're called that.
I was never a bad girl and still not. I challenged authority in school a little bit. Now I just speak my mind openly. That's who I am.
I like someone who has a super gentle spirit and energy, who's funny and has a good sense of humour - I'm really gentle, and so I like a boy who will treat me that way. I don't like boys who are mean to their mummies. That's a real turn off for me. And I don't like boys who aren't chivalrous. To me, not being respectful is a big deal.
I think that God or the universe, or whatever you believe in, gave men brute physical strength and gave women their sexuality. It's so easy to control men with it, so I don't know why I wouldn't embrace it and allow myself to be empowered by it.
I personally always find something really scary about watching little girls learning to manipulate their dads by baby talking. Then they grow up and use the same technique on their boyfriends or husbands. That scares me because it's just so sick on so many levels.
My sense of humor doesn't translate well into print, some of the things I say can be offensive or found offensive even though I don't mean them that way. So I have been told to try and censor myself here and there. I'm trying, but I'm not really succeeding at it.
I have no idea about my future career. I just hope that I can still be working in 10 years. When you're in something as successful as
Transformers
(2007), you can't use it as a sales piece for your ability as an actress because it's all about the special effects.
I am very vulnerable. But I can be aggressive, hurtful, domineering and selfish, too. I'm emotionally unpredictable and all over the place. I'm a control freak.
I was not 'the slut' in high school. I was not an outcast but I didn't have a ton of friends. I got picked on, and I ate lunch in the bathroom because I was afraid of being picked on in the cafeteria. I was a loner, and I think that's okay. I think it's perfectly acceptable not to run with cliques.
Little girls are very much exposed to sexuality through the media and the entertainment industry and advertisements. So when you realise that you have the same power that you've watched women who've come before you have, it is frightening and you don't know what to do with it. I don't think you ever get comfortable with it. It's a strange, almost supernatural thing.
I have nine tattoos. All my boyfriends are required to have one and if they don't have one yet, I make them get a tattoo of my name or my face.
I don't like dry paper. Scripts, newspapers or anything that's not laminated, I have to keep licking my fingers. If I'm reading I have a cup of water to dip my fingers in. I'm really neurotic.
I've been afraid of the dark all my life. I leave the lights on all the time and if the light is off, I have to run across the room to get to the switch. I can't walk through a dark room. I'm afraid of what I can't see.
There were some evil girls in my school and I went to Christian high school. I was fifteen and everybody knew that my aspiration in life was to become an actress. One girl came to school on Halloween in a black leather catsuit and everyone thought she was Catwoman. She answered, 'No I am 'Megan Fox.' She was making fun of me. I didn't say anything to her. I was really shy. I've always gotten along better with boys. That rubbed some people the wrong way. I was not, ever for a second, popular. Everyone hated me, and I was a total outcast, my friends were always guys, I have a very aggressive personality, and girls didn't like me for that. I've had only one great girlfriend my whole life.
There are those who have a Google Alert on themselves and read everything everyone says and then there are those who pretend it isn't happening. I'm one of the latter. I could never pore over what's said about me. It wouldn't work. I'd be a complete lunatic, drug-addled and out of my mind. Instead I stay in and ignore it all. I'm actually kind of a recluse.
... I've learned that being a celebrity is like being a sacrificial lamb. At some point, no matter how high the pedestal that they put you on, they're going to tear you down. And I created a character as an offering for the sacrifice. I'm not willing to give my true self up. It's a testament to my real personality that I would go so far as to make up another personality to give to the world. The reality is, I'm hidden amongst all the insanity. Nobody can find me.
If I had been a typical starlet and said all the right things, I wouldn't have escalated to this level. I sit down and do an interview and I talk like a person and that, for some reason, is shocking. All women in Hollywood are known as sex symbols. You're sold, and it's based on sex. That's O.K., if you know how to use it.
Sometimes I so desperately want to clarify. I recently had an urge to get a Twitter account to explain myself. But me contradicting a news story is not going to make my words fact. It will just create a new news story. There's no solving this: it's completely its own monster. You have to come up with clever ways of getting your control back.
I know that the things they said about me in the crew letter were not true, but
Michael Bay
is not happy with some of the things I've said about him. I was waiting for someone to defend me, to say, "That's not accurate", but nobody did. I think it's because I'm a girl. They left me out there to be bludgeoned to death -- on the letter that some of the crew of
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
(2009) sent out.
When I sit down to talk to men's magazines, there's a certain character that I play. She's not fully fleshed out -- she doesn't have her own name -- but she shows up to do men's magazine interviews. There's something so ridiculous about always being in your underwear in those magazines, and you know the interview is going to run opposite those pictures. So, there's a character that talks to all of them.
People compare me to Angelina Jolie, and she's so serious and stoic. I'm the opposite. When I do interviews, I say things that I think are hysterical. But because we live in a world of sound bites, you're not allowed to have a sense of humor. Sarcasm doesn't translate in print at all. And neither does self-deprecating humor. I'm not a tigress like Angelina. Of course, people want me to be. But I want to be the contradiction of that.
I feel like that's my purpose in life, to do charity work and help people around the world on a global level. Being part of this business, you have so much influence and you can really make a difference. I'm drawn towards the idea of somehow helping children.
[on her classic red 1966 Mustang Fastback Christmas present from
Brian Austin Green ] We were going through cars on eBay and I found one in really good condition that was beautiful and for a good price.
[on her height] I'm tiny, and people think that I'm 5' 10" or that I'm big. They think celebrities are larger than life, and I'm really short. I'm 5' 4".
[on her dream role] I like playing psychos, so any kind of mentally-disturbed female is fun for me.
There are some women you could put in underwear and photograph them, and it looks really classy and it doesn't necessarily provoke a pinup image. But with me it does, immediately, as soon as I'm in underwear. I'm a Vargas girl.
I feel intimidated by fashion. I hate doing photo shoots.
I don't trust people in this industry. But I especially don't trust girls in this industry, because it's incredibly competitive, and I'm just not interested.
No one believes me when I talk about this, but I'm really maternal. I worry that because I've always wanted [kids] so much, as the world goes sometimes, I won't be able to have them. Even though I would be able to provide them with such an amazing environment.
I am a stepmother to the fullest extent. I have looked after Kassius since he was three and he has no memory of life without me. For some reason, no one wants to look at me that way, but I am responsible for him and I've never struggled with that, from bedtime stories to the school run.
I've only been with two men my entire life. My childhood sweetheart and Brian. I can never have sex with someone that I don't love, ever. The idea makes me sick. I've never even come close to having a one-night stand.
I think people are born bisexual and they make subconscious choices based on the pressures of society. I have no question in my mind about being bisexual. But I'm also a hypocrite. I would never date a girl who was bisexual, because that means they also sleep with men, and men are so dirty that I'd never want to sleep with a girl who had slept with a man.
I've lived the life of a 35-year-old since I was 18. I'm so suspicious of boys-slash-men. I just don't like them or trust them.
Daniel Day-Lewis
is incredibly successful, and he's not being followed by the paparazzi. You put yourself in that position. You never see
Nicole Kidman
in the tabloids like you see
Britney Spears
and
Jessica Simpson . If I were to go out and make a scene in every club in New York and LA, eventually I would start getting a lot of press in the tabloids. But is that something I want?
[on her fear of flying] I developed that when I turned 20. All of a sudden I got really afraid to get on airplanes. I had to come up with a way to deal with it because I didn't want to have panic attacks every time I get on a plane. I know for a fact it's not in my destiny to die listening to a
Britney Spears
album, so I always put that on when I'm flying because I know it won't crash if I've got Britney on.
[on skin tone in
Transformers
(2006)] I had been tanning a lot so that [director
Michael Bay ] would be happy with my skin tone. Every spare moment of sun that was outside, I had to be in it. It's not going to happen again because of the damage and the possible skin cancer.
I'm wary of doing romantic comedies; you could end up doing them all the time. Business-wise, those movies are very safe. They're tailored to Middle America. But I'm 24, I don't belong in a romantic comedy yet. A black comedy like
Jennifer's Body
(2009) maybe, but I don't know if I could do
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
(2005) or something.
[on what movie she would remake] Well, they couldn't remake it because it would destroy it, but I've always loved
The Lost Boys
(1987). The female character in it is not really amazing, but if you were to turn one of the male characters into a female, I would love to do that. That movie has stuck with me my whole life. There's something magic about it to me.
When I talk about my husband, I feel as if people roll their eyes. It's like when you're 16 and order a martini, and the waiter says, 'Do you think I'm stupid?' They can't grasp that I'm old enough to be married.
Getting married was the best thing I've ever done.
I've been a stepmother for six years and it's amazing...I really enjoy it. It's a lot of work but I like it. It grounds me. I like being domestic. I would love to be a biological mommy some day. That would make me very happy.
I have a really offbeat, weird, dark sense of humor. My sense of humor doesn't really mesh well with sitcom television.
I've done
drugs , and that's how I know I don't like them. I tried several things in order to make an informed decision, but I didn't enjoy anything other than marijuana.
I've met endless so-called beautiful people who don't seem to have personalities or a direction in life. They've never been forced to develop their characters because they're viewed as being so attractive. So I think beauty can be a mask.
I'm horrible to live with. I don't clean. My clothes end up wherever I take them off. I forget to flush the toilet. Friends will tell me, "Megan, you totally pinched a loaf in my toilet and didn't flush."
You won't believe this, but I never go out. I don't like drunk, sweaty people whose only goal is to have sex. I stay home and play computer backgammon. Every once in a while, I go to Color Me Mine to do pottery.
I've worked with people who have been difficult to work with, but have been male. And there is never a complaint made about them. There is never an issue made about them. I have friends who are actresses, who if they go to work one day and they show up on set and they don't have a smile on their face they're tagged a bitch and that is really unfortunate. But I can't single-handedly change that process, but I'm trying.
[on director
Michael Bay ]: He's like Napoleon and he wants to create this insane, infamous mad-man reputation. He wants to be like Hitler on his sets, and he is.
I always wanted to be blonde when I was little, like Barbie and Pamela Anderson, but it would really damage my hair. It was exotic to me, as my entire family has dark hair. If I did it, I would go white blonde - really platinum.
I try to keep my make-up fresh, clean and pretty on the red carpet. My signature look is red lipstick worn with plain eyes, so I apply a light foundation, then on my cheeks I use blush or sometimes the same lipstick that I'm wearing. Giorgio Armani Rouge d'Armani Lipstick in 400, contrasts well with my pale complexion and dark hair.
[on her naval piercing] I did it when I was 16-years-old because I was a fan of
Britney Spears . The only time I tried to imitate someone else. But then I thought it was tacky and so I removed it when I turned 20.
Mickey [Rourke] is such a beautiful, wonderful human being. He's so genuine and so sweet and so talented. I just love him to death. I actually got a tattoo that is sort of in honor of him. It's on my ribs. (The tattoo is on the right side of her rib cage and reads: 'Those who danced were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.')
[on her
Marilyn Monroe
tattoo] I'm removing it. It is a negative character, as she suffered from personality disorders and was bipolar. I do not want to attract this kind of negative energy in my life.
Of course, I have a lot of flaws. But I do not tell them - ever.
[When asked on what she would say to Transformer Megatron to keep him from destroying the world] I'd barter with him and say, "Instead of the entire planet, can you just take out all of the white trash, hillbilly, anti-gay, super bible-beating people in Middle America?"
I think that I'm so psychotic and so mentally ill that if I could tap into that I could do something really interesting.
I haven't gone completely insane, but it might happen soon.
I'm not kidding when I say that if I ever lose a role because of my tattoos, I'll quit Hollywood and go to work at Costco.
Really my only job is to look attractive.
Any casting couch shit I've experienced has been 'since' I've become famous.
I absolutely want biological children. I've always wanted kids. It's just about the timing. I have it in my mind about what amount of money I want in the bank so that I can protect that child's future, and really protect it, so that kid never struggles. Once I feel safe with that, then I'll have kids.
I don't want to have to be like a
Scarlett Johansson
- who I have nothing against - but I don't want to have to go on talk shows and pull out every SAT word I've ever learned to prove, like, "Take me seriously, I am intelligent, I can speak." I don't want to have to do that. I resent having to prove that I'm not a retard - but I do. And part of it is my own fault
If you eat Chinese food, your farts come out like Chinese food. If you eat Mexican food, your farts come out like Mexican food. And milk, it's like - you can smell the warmth in the fart.
[In the 2009 September/October issue of Wonderland on mental illness] I basically read every book ever written about
Marilyn Monroe . I could end up like that because I constantly struggle with the idea that I think I'm a borderline personality - or that I have bouts of mild schizophrenia. I definitely have some kind of mental problem and I haven't pinpointed what it is.
I have a really badass personality. I'm smart and I can be really funny and interesting and I can go toe-to-toe with anybody in a conversation. So I'm not afraid to speak, and I think that's what people read as this όberconfidence. I have a mouth and I'm not afraid to use it.
(on being fired from Transformers and on
Shia LaBeouf ) I didn't want to talk about it while they're on the press tour because I didn't want to try to throw mud at them. I didn't want that movie to suffer. Especially because I love Shia. I wanted that movie to do well for him. I didn't want to have this big media war over something that really was so silly and it would have just been my ego needing to engage in a war, at that point. Of course, there will be a time when I want to tell my side of the story. I just don't feel it was appropriate while they were promoting the movie.
I'm so suspicious of all boys-slash-men. I just don't like them or trust them. They're boys, they're easily toyed with. I tell stories and have them eating out of my hand. Not all of it is true. In fact, most of it is bullshit.
[on removing her Marilyn Monroe tattoo] You outgrow things that you love when you were a child. I got it when I was 18 and now I'm 25 and it just doesn't make sense anymore. [The removal process] is a hundred times worse than the tattoo itself. I've only done one [session] so I probably have three or four left. I think it will come off completely because I have the right skin type to remove ink. The more fair skinned you are the easier it is to remove dark ink, and I'm as fair as it gets.

Early life
Fox is of Irish, French and Native American ancestry, [ 6 ]
and was born in
Oak Ridge , Tennessee to Darlene and Franklin Fox. She was raised Roman Catholic and attended Catholic school for 12 years. [ 7 ]
Fox's parents divorced when she was young and she and her sister [ 8 ]
were raised by her mother and her stepfather, Tony Tonachio. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
She said that the two were "very strict" and that she was not allowed to have a boyfriend [ 12 ]
or invite friends to her house. [ 8 ]
She lived with her mother until she made enough money to support herself. [ 12 ]
Fox began her training in drama and dance at age five, in
Kingston , Tennessee. [ 13 ]
She attended a dance class at the community center there and was involved in Kingston Elementary School's chorus and the Kingston Clippers swim team. At 10 years of age, after moving to
St. Petersburg , Florida, Fox continued her training. [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
When she was 13 years old, Fox began modeling after winning several awards at the 1999 American Modeling and Talent Convention in Hilton Head, South Carolina. [ 16 ]
At age 17, she tested out of school via correspondence in order to move to Los Angeles. [ 8 ] [ 12 ]
Fox has spoken extensively of her time in education; that in middle school she was bullied and picked on and she ate lunch in the bathroom to avoid being "pelted with ketchup packets". She said that the problem was not her looks, but that she had "always gotten along better with boys" and that "rubbed some people the wrong way". [ 17 ]
Fox also said of high school that she was never popular and that "everyone hated me, and I was a total outcast, my friends were always guys, I have a very aggressive personality, and girls didn't like me for that. I've had only one great girlfriend my whole life". [ 17 ]
In the same interview, she mentions that she hated school and has never been "a big believer in formal education" and that "the education I was getting seemed irrelevant. So, I was sort of checked out on that part of it". [ 17 ]
Career
At 16, Fox made her acting debut in the 2001 film
Holiday in the Sun , as spoiled heiress Brianna Wallace and rival of Alex Stewart ( Ashley Olsen ), which was released direct-to-DVD on November 20, 2001. In the next several years she guest-starred on
What I Like About You
and
Two and a Half Men , as well as being an uncredited
extra
in
Bad Boys II
(2003). In 2004, she made her film debut in
Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen
co-starring opposite
Lindsay Lohan , playing the supporting role of Carla Santini, a rival of Lola (Lohan). Fox was also cast in a regular role on the ABC sitcom

Nicole Paggi . Fox appeared in seasons 2 to 3, until the show was cancelled in 2006. [ 18 ]
In 2007, Fox won the lead female role of
Mikaela Banes
in the 2007 live-action film
Transformers , based on the toy and cartoon saga of the same name. Fox played the love interest of

Fox with
Jonah Hex
co-stars
Josh Brolin
and Michael Fassbender at the 2009 San Diego
Comic Con
on July 28, 2009, promoting the film.
Fox reprised her role as Mikaela Banes in the
Transformer
sequel,
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen . There was some controversy surrounding Fox's appearance while filming the sequel of
Transformers
when
Michael Bay , the film's director, ordered the actress to gain 10 pounds. [ 23 ]
The film was released worldwide on June 24, 2009. [ 24 ]
Fox was to star in the third installment,
Transformers: Dark of the Moon , but was not included because of her statements comparing working under director Bay to working for
Hitler
( see below ). Co-star
Shia LaBeouf
said, "Criticism is one thing. Then there's public name-calling, which turns into high-school bashing. Which you can't do." [ 25 ]
Bay similarly amended his previous statements of support of Fox, and told
GQ
in June that Fox was fired on orders of executive producer
Stephen Spielberg . [ 26 ]
In between
Revenge of the Fallen
and
Dark of the Moon , Fox had her first lead role playing the title character in
Jennifer's Body , written by
Academy Award -winning screenwriter
Diablo Cody . [ 27 ]
She played Jennifer Check, a mean-girl cheerleader possessed by a demon who begins to feed off the boys in a
Minnesota
farming town. [ 28 ]
The film was released on September 18, 2009, [ 29 ]
and co-stars
Amanda Seyfried
and
Adam Brody .
In April 2009, Fox began filming
Jonah Hex , in which she portrayed Leila, a gun-wielding beauty and Jonah Hex's ( Josh Brolin ) love interest. The film was released on June 18, 2010 and co-starred
Will Arnett ; [ 30 ]
Despite receiving top billing, Fox has described her role in the film as being a
cameo . [ 31 ]
Jonah Hex
was universally panned by critics and was a box office bomb in the U.S., having its international distribution cancelled after its poor performance. [ 32 ]
The film was named the "worst picture of the year by the
Houston Film Critics Society . [ 33 ]
Fox next starred alongside
Mickey Rourke
in
Passion Play . The film received such bad reviews after its screening at the Toronto Film festival that its plans for a conventional theatrical distribution were withheld for a direct-to-video release with only two screens briefly showing the film to fulfill contractual obligations. [ 34 ]
Mickey Rourke remarked that
Passion Play
was "terrible. Another terrible movie." [ 35 ] [ 36 ]
In early April 2009, Fox signed on to star as the lead female role in the upcoming 2011 film
The Crossing , about a young couple who get caught up in a drug trafficking scheme during their vacation to Mexico. [ 37 ]
In March 2009,
Variety
reported that Fox was set to star as the lead role of
Aspen Matthews
in the film adaption of the
comic books
Fathom
which she will also co-produce with
Brian Austin Green . [ 38 ]
Fathom
is currently in
pre-production . [ 39 ]
Fox appeared with
Dominic Monaghan
in the music video for
Eminem
and
Rihanna 's single " Love the Way You Lie ". [ 40 ]

Fox, at the Seventh Annual Hollywood
Life
magazine
"Breakthrough of the Year" Awards, December 9, 2007
During an interview with
The Times , on the topic of being a role model, Fox stated: "It depends on what your idea of a role model is," and continued with, "If your idea of a role model is somebody who's gonna preach to your kids that sex before marriage is wrong and cursing is wrong and women should be this and be that, then I'm not a role model. But if you want your girls to feel strong and intelligent and be outspoken and fight for what they think is right, then I want to be that type of role model, yeah." [ 41 ]
Fox said in the same interview, on the topic of being typecast that: "Getting typecast as what? Attractive? How bad is that?" She feels that it isn't a bad thing to be typecast in this way and considers it to be flattering. She also believes that it gives her an advantage because people will not expect her to be more than simply attractive and when she does give a good performance, people will be surprised. [ 41 ]
Fox has shown interest in portraying a character less sexualized than that of
Mikaela Banes , whom she portrays in the
Transformers
film series . [ 42 ]
Fox said of being a popular media topic that, though she is not on the same level as
Jennifer Aniston ,
Britney Spears , or
Lindsay Lohan , she does find it difficult and that there have been times when people have avoided being around her because they do not want to end up in the media's spotlight. "I need to behave in a way and handle myself in a way that will cause people to take me seriously," she said, "[and] you can be sexy and be intelligent and be taken seriously, or you can be sexy and you can be out at clubs every night and not be " but that she has not gone "completely insane". [ 42 ]
Fox also said of going from being "relatively unknown" to her current celebrity status that: "I definitely feel ill-prepared; I mean, I don't know if anyone ever sits back and goes, 'Now is the moment that I think I should be a famous celebrity,' - but I definitely feel it's premature. I mean, I was in one movie that people have seen." [ 42 ]
Fox has appeared on the covers of many magazines. In 2007, she appeared in
Maxim ; [ 43 ]
in 2008, the list had grown to include
Cosmo Girl , [ 44 ] [ 45 ]
Paw Print , [ 46 ]
Jack
(ITALY), [ 47 ]
FHM
(UK), [ 48 ]
and
GQ . [ 49 ] [ 50 ]
In 2009, the list includes,
USA Weekend , [ 51 ]
Esquire , [ 52 ]
Empire , [ 53 ]
Maxim , [ 54 ]
GQ
(UK), [ 55 ]
Entertainment Weekly [ 56 ]
and
ELLE . [ 12 ]
Fox was ranked No.17 on interview magazines Hollywood faces to watch "Future Stars of Tomorrow", ranked No.16 on the
Maxim
magazine Hot 100 of 2008 list, named No.68 in
FHM
magazine's "100 Sexiest Women in the World 2006" supplement, ranked No.18 on the
Maxim
magazine Hot 100 of 2007 list, she was ranked No.1 on Moviefone's 'The 25 Hottest Actors Under 25' in 2008, and was ranked No.2 on the
Maxim
magazine Hot 100 of 2009 list in 2009.
FHM
readers voted her the "Sexiest Woman in the World" in 2008. [ 5 ] [ 57 ]
In late July 2009, Fox's overexposure in parts of the media caused several men's websites to boycott her. [ 58 ]
AOL 's man-blog Asylum dubbed August 4, 2009 "A Day Without Megan Fox" with the promise that the site would not mention or feature her on this day; they asked other men's sites to copy this stance, and several (such as
AskMen.com , Just a Guy Thing, and Banned in Hollywood) complied. "Listen, we love Megan," Eric Rogell of TheBachelorGuy.com told
New York Daily News . "She's responsible for driving more eyeballs to our sites - just by getting photographed walking down the street in a white T-shirt - than any other celeb alive. [But] it's time to give another young actress a shot at the attention." [ 58 ]
Other sites, however, refused to boycott Fox, with Asylum's sister site Popeater declaring "we're posting things about Megan Fox that aren't even news, just because we know you want it, whether you'll admit it or not" [ 59 ]
and Coedmagazine calling the boycott a "publicity stunt" and "hypocritical", saying that they were the home of "The Megan Fox Boycott Boycott". [ 60 ]
The British newspaper
The Sun
declared August 4 to be "Megan Fox Day", saying that "She deserves a day dedicated to her". [ 61 ]
In response to the boycott, Fox told magazine
Nylon , in a September 2009 interview, that "the media blitz" for
Transformers
resulted in an over-extension of her welcome in the media. "I was part of a movie that wanted to make sure would make $700 million, so they oversaturated the media with their stars," she said. [ 62 ]
"I don't want to have people get completely sick of me before I've ever even done something legitimate." [ 62 ]
Fox in October, 2007 with two of her tattoos visible
On September 11, 2009, an unsigned letter from crew members of
Transformers
defended Michael Bay against accusations reportedly made by Fox about his on-set behavior, including a comparison with
Adolf Hitler . The letter alleges that Fox is unpleasant to work with on set and makes several accusations of ungracious behavior that are at variance with her public persona. Bay defended Fox and has said that he does not "condone" the letter. Anthony Steinhart, a production assistant who worked on
Transformers , also came out in her defense, stating that he had never "...witnessed Ms. Fox being rude or inconsiderate of people's feelings or the work to be done". [ 63 ]
Fox has often been compared to actress
Angelina Jolie , with the media dubbing her as the "next Angelina Jolie". [ 64 ] [ 65 ]
Fox has been compared to Jolie because they each have a "tattoo collection", and status as a "built in sex-symbol". [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
Fox commented that the comparisons indicate a lack of creativity on the part of the media, and are simply due to the dark hair and tattoos that she and Jolie have, and that both have been in action movies. There were several unconfirmed rumors that Fox was to replace Jolie in the next
Lara Croft
film. [ 66 ] [ 67 ]
Fox also said of the comparisons that: "I am a brunette with tattoos, I curse and I have made mention of sex before. I joked about it which people find outrageous so they want to constantly compare that to her." [ 68 ]
Fox remarked, "I'm sure she has no idea who I am. But if I were her, I'd be like, 'Who the fuck is this little bullshit brat who was in
Transformers
that's going to be the next me?' I don't want to meet her. I'd be embarrassed." [ 2 ] [ 69 ]
Fox has eight known tattoos, [ 70 ]
including her husband's name "Brian" on her lower hip, a picture of
Marilyn Monroe 's face on her right forearm, which she is now getting removed, [ 71 ] [ 72 ]
and a crescent moon overlapping a five-pointed star above her right ankle. [ 73 ]
This tattoo is the only known colored tattoo that Fox has. [ 74 ]
Personal life
Fox has been involved with actor
Brian Austin Green
since 2004, having first met on the set of
Hope & Faith
when she was 18 and he was 30. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]
In 2006, they became engaged, and then broke it off in February 2009. Some time later in 2009, Fox was targeted by a group of fashion-motivated criminals known as "The
Bling Ring ", who robbed Green's home because she was living with him. [ 77 ]
Fox and Green were engaged again in June 2010, [ 76 ] [ 78 ]
and on June 24, 2010, the two wed in a private ceremony at the Four Seasons Resort on the Big Island of Hawaii. [ 79 ] [ 80 ]
Fox is a fan of comic books,
anime , and video games, [ 17 ]
and her favorite artist is
Michael Turner , whose
Fathom
comic she describes as a longtime obsession. [ 12 ]
She has two dogs, including a
Pomeranian
named after
Sex Pistols
bassist
Sid Vicious . [ 12 ]
She has stated that she supports the legalization of
marijuana , openly admitting to smoking it, and saying that she does not consider it a drug and would be first in line to buy a pack of joints. [ 81 ]
Additionally, Fox has expressed a distrust of "all boys-slash-men" in general, [ 82 ]
as well as women in the industry. "I especially don't trust girls in this industry, because it's incredibly competitive, and I'm just not interested," she stated. [ 83 ]
In September 2008, Fox alluded to being
bisexual
in an interview with
GQ
magazine. She said that, when she was 18 years old, she fell in love with and sought to establish a relationship with a female stripper. She used this experience to illustrate her belief that "all humans are born with the ability to be attracted to both sexes" and additionally showed interest in
Olivia Wilde . [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ]
In May 2009, she confirmed her bisexuality. [ 87 ]
In the June 2009 issue of
ELLE , however, she stated that she somewhat distorted the events of her relationship with the stripper, saying she has given certain male writers "an amped-up version" of her past. "They're boys; they're easily toyed with," she said. "I tell stories and have them eating out of my hand. Not all of it is true. In fact, most of it is bullshit." [ 82 ]
Fox said, "I never said she was my girlfriend! I just said that I loved her, and I did love her. The real story is more sobering. It's not a sexy, fun-time, fantasy story. But that's not the story you tell
GQ ." [ 82 ]
Fox developed a fear of flying at the age of 20 and revealed that she listens to
Britney Spears
songs while flying to overcome the fear. [ 88 ] [ 89 ]
She also has
brachydactyly
("shortness of the fingers and toes"), [ 90 ]
and has additionally been open about her insecurities and self-harming, acknowledging that she has low
self-esteem :
... I don't want to elaborate. I would never call myself a cutter. Girls go through different phases when they're growing up, when they're miserable and do different things, whether it's an
eating disorder
or they dabble in cutting. I'm really insecure about everything. I see what I look like, but there are things that I like and things that I dislike. My hair is good. The color of my eyes is good, obviously. I'm too short. But overall, I'm not super excited about the whole thing. I never think I'm worthy of anything... I have a sick feeling of being mocked all the time. I have a lot of self-loathing. Self-loathing doesn't keep me from being happy. But that doesn't mean I don't struggle. I am very vulnerable. But I can be aggressive, hurtful, domineering and selfish, too. I'm emotionally unpredictable and all over the place. I'm a
control freak . [ 91 ]
