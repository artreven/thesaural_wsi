Man Without Arms Plays Guitar Onstage with Goo Goo Dolls

George Dennehy was born without arms but amazingly has learned to play the guitar using only his feet. On June 2, the 18-year-old performed a cover of the song “ Iris ” by the band
Goo Goo Dolls
at the  Ashland Strawberry Faire  in Ashland, Va.  Video of that performance  has been viewed by nearly half a million people on
YouTube
alone and caught the attention of the band members, who invited Dennehy to performed live with them at the
Musikfest
2012 festival in
Pennsylvania
this past weekend.
“I think people see the willpower and determination and how much that performance meant to me and that song. I guess it touches people’s hearts,” Dennehy said of his
Virginia
performance during an  interview  with
What’s Trending
host
Shira Lazar .
And as if that weren’t amazing enough, Dennehy tells Lazar that he’s actually a
multi-instrumentalist , playing the piano, bass and cello — all with his feet.
“Every person has their purpose here,” Dennehy said. “We’re all here for a reason. Don’t let anything get in someone’s way to do what they feel called to do. I just want people to see that even though I don’t have arms I’m still striving to do what I want to do in my life.”
Here’s a video of Dennehy’s performance with the Goo Goo Dolls:

to go. JUST TO LET YOU KNOW
Since 2005 we've been an unbiased, non-political, non-religiously affiliated organization. We do not allow any political, social, sexual orientation or religious preferences to determine which stories get posted.
Many ARCHIVE stories have been weeded out because this host site once had a limit to how much stuff you can post, so we deleted some of the least interesting stories from 2005-2010. Apparently they've increased that limit size and now we're screwed out of posting some of those stories.
