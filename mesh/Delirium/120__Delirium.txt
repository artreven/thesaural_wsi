rhinitis
(11% vs 8% placebo),
pharyngitis
(6%), lung disorder (4%),
dyspnea
(2%),
asthma
(1%), and
epistaxis
(1%) have been reported. Serious rash, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported.
Some cases were serious or life-threatening requiring hospitalization and discontinuation of treatment.
Some cases have occurred after prolonged treatment (e.g., 3 months), while others have been reported within 1 to 5 weeks of initiation of treatment.
Although benign rashes may also occur, modafinil should be discontinued at the first sign of rash unless the rash is definitely not drug-related.
Rare instances of
hypersensitivity reactions
including
angioedema
have been observed in patients treated with the racemic mixture of modafinil.
Although no such cases were observed in modafinil clinical trials, angioedema has been reported in postmarketing experience.
Patients should be advised to immediately discontinue therapy and promptly report any signs or symptoms suggesting
angioedema
or
anaphylaxis
to their physician (e.g.,
swelling
of face, eyes, lips,
tongue
or
larynx ;
difficulty
in swallowing or
breathing ;
hoarseness ).
Signs and symptoms including
chest pain, palpitations ,
dyspnea , and transient ischemic T-wave changes on ECG have been reported in three subjects in association with mitral valve prolapse or left ventricular hypertrophy.
Modafinil is not recommended for use in patients with a history of left ventricular hypertrophy or ischemic ECG changes, chest pain, arrhythmia or other clinically significant manifestations of mitral valve prolapse in association with CNS stimulant use.
Patients should be instructed to stop taking modafinil and to notify their physician if they develop a
rash ,
hives ,
mouth sores, blisters ,
peeling skin ,
trouble swallowing
or
breathing
or a related
allergic
phenomenon.

Note: Original Source for Medical Professionals
Patients should be warned of the sedative effects of diphenhydramine, and advised not to take this drug with alcohol.
Because of the potential to cause
dizziness ,
sedation ,
hypotension , and its potent anticholinergic properties, diphenhydramine meets the Beers criteria as a medication that is potentially inappropriate for use in older adults.
It should not be used as a hypnotic.
Nonanticholinergic antihistamines are preferred in elderly patients when treating
allergic reactions .
Hypersensitivity side effects
have
included rash ,

Nervous system side effects have been reported frequently.
These have included depression with drowsiness and sedation in nearly all patients treated.
Motor skills may be impaired.
Dystonic reactions have been reported after single doses of diphenhydramine. The
CNS depressant effect
of diphenhydramine parallels its plasma concentrations.
The plasma concentration threshold for
sedation
is 30 to 42 ng/mL, and to cause
mental impairment
is 58 to 74 ng/mL.
Patients should be warned against
driving
while taking diphenhydramine.
Dystonic reactions
have been accompanied by
dizziness ,
mental confusion ,
rigidity ,
lip and tongue protrusion ,
trismus ,
torticollis , and
swallowing difficulties
and generally resolve spontaneously.
Toxic encephalopathy
has been reported in a child with chicken pox treated generously with topical diphenhydramine.
Delirium
has been reported in elderly patients with mild dementia following a small oral dose of diphenhydramine.
