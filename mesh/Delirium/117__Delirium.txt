Medical Source Information Yellow
highlights indicate symptoms related to
anxiety . Because of the possibility of respiratory depression, equipment and personnel necessary for resuscitation should be immediately available when midazolam is administered.
Midazolam should not be discontinued abruptly in patients who have received the medication for long periods.
Abrupt discontinuation may
result in
symptoms
of
withdrawal .
Delirium
may be associated with postoperative exposure to benzodiazepines.
It has been recommended that clinicians caring for patients at risk for
delirium
carefully evaluate the need for benzodiazepines in the postoperative period and consider alternative therapies whenever possible.
Other side effects including cases of benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms ( myalgias ,
tachycardia , and
anxiety ) have been reported in patients who have received multiple or continuous doses of midazolam.
In such patients, abrupt discontinuation is not recommended. Psychiatric side effects have included a variety of adverse behavioral
effects such as disinhibition
(especially sexual disinhibition),
hostility ,
rage
reactions,
restlessness ,
aggressiveness , and paroxysmal
excitement . Cardiovascular side effects including alterations in blood pressure,
arrhythmias , and
ventricular irritability
have been reported.
Hypotension
and decreases in systemic vascular resistance have been reported most frequently; however many investigators have reported minimal cardiovascular effects following administration of midazolam.
