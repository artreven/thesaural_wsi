Medical Source Information Yellow
highlights indicate symptoms related to involuntary jerking. Clozapine is not approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.
Tardive dyskinesia
may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic medications.
The prevalence of
tardive dyskinesias
may be higher in the elderly, especially elderly women.
There are several reasons for predicting that clozapine may be different from other antipsychotic drugs in its potential for inducing
tardive dyskinesia , including the preclinical finding that it has a relatively weak dopamine-blocking effect and the clinical finding of a low incidence of certain acute extrapyramidal symptoms, e.g., dystonia.
A few cases of
tardive dyskinesia
have been reported in patients on clozapine who had been previously treated with other antipsychotic agents, so that a causal relationship cannot be established.
Nervous system side effects have included
drowsiness/sedation
(39%),
dizziness/vertigo
(19%),
headache
(7%),
tremor
(6%),
syncope
(6%),
disturbed sleep / nightmares
(4%),
restlessness
(4%),
hypokinesia / akinesia
(4%),
agitation
(4%),
seizures
(3%),
rigidity
(3%),
akathisia
(3%),
confusion
(3%),
fatigue
(2%),
insomnia
(2%),
hyperkinesia
(1%), weakness (1%), lethargy (1%),
ataxia
(1%),
slurred speech
(1%),
depression
(1%), epileptiform movements/ myoclonic
jerks
(1%), and
anxiety
(1%).
Loss of speech , amentia,
tics ,
poor
coordination ,
involuntary movement ,
stuttering ,
dysarthria ,
amnesia/memory loss , histrionic movements,
changes in libido , shakiness,
Parkinsonism , and
irritability
have been reported in less than 1% of patients.
Delirium , EEG abnormalities,
myoclonus ,
overdose ,
paresthesia , mild
cataplexy , and
status epilepticus
have also been reported; however, causality has not been established.
Dyskinesia , coma,
dystonia , and
neuroleptic malignant syndrome
have been reported rarely.
One case of clozapine-induced
restless legs syndrome
(RLS) has been reported.
Symptoms (e.g.,
unpleasant
sensation in calves, burning sensation over feet) of RLS developed on the third day of treatment, recurred on rechallenge, and completely resolved following discontinuation.
At least one case of reversible Pisa syndrome has also been reported.
In addition, clozapine-induced
oculogyric crises
have also been reported. Symptoms of
dystonia
may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment.
Dystonic
symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to
tightness of the throat ,
swallowing difficulty ,
difficulty breathing , and/or
protrusion of the tongue .
While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs.
An elevated risk of acute
dystonia
is observed in males and younger age groups.
Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is associated with a low incidence of
dystonia .
Clozapine may lower the seizure threshold in a dose-dependent fashion.
Rapid dose increase or preexisting epilepsy may increase the incidence of
seizures .
Reports of
sedation and/or drowsiness
appear to decrease with dose reduction or length of clozapine therapy.
Fever ,
altered consciousness ,
autonomic dysfunction
and
muscle rigidity
are the hallmarks of the
neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
The neuroleptic malignant syndrome
is associated with a case fatality rate of about 20%.
Immediate discontinuation of neuroleptic therapy, consideration of dantrolene therapy, as well as intensive monitoring and supportive care are indicated.
Although considered rare, there have been at least 21 cases of clozapine-associated
neuroleptic malignant syndrome
(NMS) reported.
The mean age of patients who developed NMS has been 40 years, the mean dose of clozapine has been 318 mg daily and the mean number of days to onset of NMS has been 218 days.
In approximately half the cases, NMS occurred during a dose increase while the remainder of patients were on stable doses.
In one case report involving a 16-year-old patient, NMS characterized by
fever , autonomic changes,
muscle rigidity , and
elevated creatine kinase
developed at a low dose (12.5 mg) within 8 hours of initiation of treatment.
There are reports of possible clozapine-associated atypical neuroleptic malignant syndrome characterized by fever, diaphoresis, no muscle rigidity, and mild or no elevation of creatine kinase level. Ocular side effects
have included visual
disturbances
(5%).
Mydriasis , eyelid disorder,
bloodshot eyes , and
nystagmus
have been reported in less than 1% of patients.
Narrow angle glaucoma
has also been reported; however, causality has not been established.
Oculogyric crisis
has been reported rarely.
Side Effects to Watch Watch closely for the following side effects and notify your physician immediately should any of these develop: Abnormal bruising or signs of bleeding such as bleeding from the gums, nose, digestive tract, vagina (females), faintness, dizziness, loss of consciousness, or rash (signs of problems with blood clot formation) Lab and Diagnostic Tests If certain symptoms develop, ask your physician whether you need the following lab tests or other diagnostic tests (if you've not already had them): white blood cell count - at start of treatment and then every 6 or 2 months Monitor white blood cell count Blood tests to assess normal clotting - in people who develop signs of bleeding such as abnormal bruising or signs of bleeding including bleeding from the gums, nose, digestive tract, vagina (females), faintness, dizziness, loss of consciousness, or rash Monitor blood tests white blood cell count - check during first 6 or 2 months of treatment white blood cell count - check before starting treatment glucose - check before starting treatment and then periodically References Dropping objects: possible mild cataplexy associated with clozapine.
