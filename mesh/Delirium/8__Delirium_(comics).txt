She's So Unusual
As you push deeper into the violet fog, it starts to swirl and brighten, becoming more rainbow-hued and chaotic. Strange half-recognizable shapes appear in your peripheral vision, vanishing when you turn to look. The landscape sprouts trees that twist through impossible geometries, bearing antique telephones and a variety of squid as fruit.
You're looking around in bewilderment when a young girl with mismatched eyes and a long multicolored mohawk wanders up, with a large dog trailing behind her. She's holding a string tied to a fish, which floats beside her like a piscene balloon. She smiles at you and waves. "hEllO!"
"Uh... hi."
"yOu LooK loSt. WouLd you liKe a fiShY? hiS nAme is barNaBas."
"No," says the dog, "I'm Barnabas. You named the fish 'Byron von Messerschmidt'. And yesterday its name was 'Golfcart'."
"yEs! thaT is WhAt i meaNt."
As the girl begins to dance dreamily around the squid-and-telephone trees, Barnabas looks up at you. "Feel free to accept the fish, if you like -- you won't have to worry about feeding it, since it'll change into something else when you leave." He idly scratches his ear with a hind leg. "Something alcohol-related, if my nose is accurate."
Accept the fish (1)
You take the string, and wave goodbye as the girl dances away happily, with the dog following. As you watch, the fish inexplicably morphs into a large cold beer stein. How very odd.

While her speech in the comic was lettered in all-caps, the size of the letters fluctuated, as did the colors of the speech bubbles, and this is sometimes represented in text with odd capitalization.
