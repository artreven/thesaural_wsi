Metabolic side effects have included
hypoglycemia .
Severe
hypoglycemia
(requiring assistance in ingestion of oral carbohydrate, administration of glucagon, intravenous glucose, or other medical intervention) was reported in up to 8.2% of patients in long-term studies. Pramlintide is not intended for all patients with
diabetes .
Pramlintide is used with insulin and has been associated with an increased risk of insulin-induced severe
hypoglycemia , particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes.
When severe
hypoglycemia
associated with pramlintide use occurs, it is seen within 3 hours following a pramlintide injection.
If severe
hypoglycemia
occurs while operating a motor vehicle, heavy machinery, or while engaging in other high-risk activities, serious injuries may occur.
Appropriate patient selection, careful patient instruction, and insulin dose adjustments are critical elements for reducing this risk.
