Medical Source Information Yellow
highlights indicate symptoms related to confusion/disorientation. Diazepam is contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis, severe respiratory insufficiency, severe hepatic insufficiency, and sleep apnea syndrome.
Although this antiepileptic drug was not one of the ones included in the analysis, the FDA expects that an increased risk of
suicidality
is shared by all antiepileptic drugs and anticipates that class labeling changes will be applied broadly.
The FDA has informed healthcare professionals that the agency has analyzed reports of
suicidality
( suicidal behavior or ideation ) from placebo controlled clinical studies of eleven drugs used to treat epilepsy as well as psychiatric disorders, and other conditions.
In the FDA's analysis, patients receiving antiepileptic drugs had approximately twice the risk of
suicidal
behavior or ideation (0.43%) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.22%).
The increased risk of suicidal behavior and
suicidal ideation
was observed as early as one week after starting the antiepileptic drug and continued through 24 weeks.
The results were generally consistent among the eleven drugs.
The relative risk for
suicidality
was higher in patients with epilepsy compared to patients who were given one of the drugs in the class for psychiatric or other conditions.
Healthcare professionals should closely monitor all patients currently taking or starting any antiepileptic drug for notable changes in behavior that could indicate the emergence or worsening of
suicidal thoughts
or behavior or
depression .
Diazepam may
impair
the
mental
abilities necessary for potentially hazardous tasks such as
driving
or operating machinery.
Delirium
appears to be significantly associated with postoperative exposure to benzodiazepines.
It has been recommended that clinicians caring for patients at risk for
delirium
carefully evaluate the need for benzodiazepines in the postoperative period and consider alternative therapies whenever possible.
Psychiatric side effects have included stimulation,
restlessness , acute hyperexcited states,
anxiety ,
agitation ,
aggressiveness ,
irritability ,
rage ,
hallucinations ,
psychoses ,
delusions ,
insomnia, sleep disturbances , and
nightmares .
Inappropriate behavior and other adverse behavioral effects have been reported when using benzodiazepines. Nervous system side effects are common and include
drowsiness ,
fatigue ,
confusion ,
depression ,
psychomotor
impairment ,
cognitive
impairment ,
headache ,
syncope ,
slurred speech ,
tremor ,
vertigo ,
dysarthria ,
dizziness , and
ataxia .
Acute
dystonic reactions
and
coma
have been rarely reported. One study has suggested that the acute pharmacodynamic profile of diazepam with respect to euphoria and subject liking is similar to barbiturates.
Another study has suggested that long-term benzodiazepine therapy may be associated with significant
cognitive
impairments
which may persist following benzodiazepine withdrawal.
Cases of paradoxical reactions to diazepam (increased agitation and
hyperactivity ) have been reported rarely.
Lab and Diagnostic Tests If certain symptoms develop, ask your physician whether you need the following lab tests or other diagnostic tests (if you've not already had them): blood counts and liver function tests - check periodically References Clinical toxicity of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam in relation to serum albumin concentration: a report from the Boston collaborative drug surveillance program.
