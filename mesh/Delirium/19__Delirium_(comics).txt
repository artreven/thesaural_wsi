Chronos: A
Wow!
Reflection on Devouring Time
Posted on

“Formation, transformation, the eternal mind’s eternal recreation.”
–  Goethe
Reflections on time, change, and eternity can result in profound
Wow!
moments and states. The 1985 film
Chronos
offers just such an experience of devouring time, if you relax and allow it to play out.
As you watch and listen to
Chronos , remember the phrase
Sum quod eris : “I am what you will be.” For it speaks of continuous change, of eternal transformation, the one constant of life on this Earth. As our planet cycles through the days, years, centuries, millennia, and aeons, change remains the one constant. One after another, the skeletal ruins of past civilizations and empires call out to ours from across the ages:
Sum quod eris : “I am what you will be.”
No one knows this better than
Destruction of the Endless , one of seven super-supernatural beings featured in
Neil Gaiman’s
The Sandman
graphic novel series.
Destruction of the Endless
Destruction, pony-tailed and lantern-jawed, is a personification of devouring time, of the endless stream which one can never step into twice, for the stream and the person are never the same twice ( Heraclitus ). Ironically, Destruction would like to pretend that there is some permanence in the Cosmos, so he abandons his post, though the universe still changes and evolves toward its ultimate destiny. In
The Sandman
volume
Brief Lives , Destruction of the Endless walks the Earth under a clear night sky in the company of his brother
Dream
and his sister
Delirium , “I like the stars,” says Destruction…
“It’s the illusion of permanence, I think. I mean, they’re always flaring up and caving in and going out. But from here, I can pretend…I can pretend that things last. I can pretend that lives last longer than moments. Gods come, and gods go. Mortals flicker and flash and fade. Worlds don’t last; and stars and galaxies are transient, fleeting things that twinkle like fireflies and vanish into cold and dust. But I can pretend.”
Enjoy the film…
I believe if this film had a written narrative, it would be this brief excerpt from the Roman poet
Ovid’s
Metamorphoses
“Full sail, I voyage
Over the boundless ocean, and I tell you
Nothing is permanent in all the world.
All things are fluid; every image forms,
Wandering through change. Time is itself a river
In constant movement, and the hours flow by
Like water, wave on wave, pursued, pursuing,
Forever fugitive, forever new.
That which has been, is not; that which was not,
Begins to be; motion and moment always
In the process of renewal…
Time devours all things…
Nothing remains the same: the great nenewer,
Nature, makes form from form, and, oh, believe me
That nothing ever dies. What we call birth
Is the beginning of a difference,
No more than that, and death is only ceasing
Of what had been before. The parts may vary,
Shifting from here to there, hither and yon,
And back again, but the great sum is constant…”
“Everything changes, nothing perishes.”
– Ovid
