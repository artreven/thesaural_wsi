Medical Source Information Yellow
highlights indicate symptoms related to muscle twitching. Nervous system side effects are among the most common.
Drowsiness, dizziness,
sedation
and
fatigue
occur commonly.
Delirium ,
tinnitus ,
sleep abnormalities ,
cognitive impairment
(especially in the elderly), a
tardive dyskinesia - like syndrome,
dystonic reactions
and
seizures
have also been reported. Nervous system effects
including
extrapyramidal reactions
such as
opisthotonus ,
trismus ,
torticollis ,
retrocollis ,
aching
and
numbness of the limbs , motor
restlessness ,
oculogyric crisis ,
hyperreflexia ,
dystonia , including
protrusion ,
discoloration ,
aching
and rounding of the
tongue , tonic
spasm
of the
masticatory
muscles,
tight feeling in the throat ,
slurred speech ,
dysphagia ,
akathisia ,
dyskinesia ,
parkinsonism , and
ataxia
have been reported.
Persistent and sometimes irreversible
tardive dyskinesia , cerebral edema,
abnormality
of cerebrospinal fluid proteins,
convulsive
seizures , drowsiness , and headaches have also been reported.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been reported in patients treated with neuroleptic drugs. The incidence and severity of
extrapyramidal reactions
have been reported to increase with an increase in dosage.
Extrapyramidal reactions
have been reported to usually be controllable by concomitant use of an antiparkinsonian drug such as benztropine mesylate and/or by a reduction in dosage.
Risk of developing
tardive dyskinesia
has been reported to be greater in elderly patients on high-dose therapy, especially females.
In some patients, the symptoms are irreversible. Children, adolescents, and young adults (18 to 24 years of age) with major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders may be at an increased risk of suicidal thinking and suicidality with antidepressant use, particularly during the first few months of treatment.
Medical evidence has not shown this increased risk to exist in adults older than 24 years of age, but adults 65 years of age and older taking antidepressants appear to have a decreased risk of suicidality.
The results of a meta-analysis indicate an overall favorable risk-to-benefit profile for the use of antidepressants (i.e., selective serotonin and/or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) in the treatment of pediatric patients (less than 19- years- old) with major depressive disorders (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or non- OCD anxiety disorders.
Although this study also reports an overall increased risk of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt associated with the use of antidepressants in pediatric patients, the risk may be less than originally estimated.
Additional prospective studies are warranted in order to confirm these findings.
Amitriptyline should not be discontinued abruptly in patients who have received high doses for long periods.
Abrupt discontinuation may
result in
symptoms
of
withdrawal
(such as
nausea ,
headache ,
malaise ,
irritability
and
generalized CNS stimulation ).
Tardive dyskinesia
has been reported most frequently in the elderly, especially in elderly females.
The risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that the syndrome will become irreversible have been reported to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose increase.
Therefore, the smallest dose and shortest duration of treatment necessary to produce a satisfactory clinical response is recommended.
For patients receiving long term therapy, it is recommended that the clinician keep in mind the possibility of
liver damage , corneal and lenticular deposits, and irreversible
dyskinesias .
Withdrawal symptoms , including
nervousness ,
anxiety ,
restlessness, akathisia ,
nausea ,
malaise ,
sweating
and
salivation
have been reported after abrupt discontinuation of other tricyclic antidepressants. Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an
allergic reaction :
hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
Call your doctor at once if you have any new or worsening symptoms such as:
