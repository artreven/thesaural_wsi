Bookish Birthdays: Kathy Acker
18th Apr 2012
An underground icon equal parts lauded and overlooked, today would have been Kathy Acker's 65th birthday. Beloved in the US by a host of famous faces, from academic luminaries to musicians, authors, artists and activists, in the UK she is still seen by many as peripheral to the literary canon; a cult heroine who remains conspicuously absent in mainstream academia and public recognition.
Born in
New York City
in
1947
and published by a variety of independent presses until her breakthrough 1984 novel,
Blood and Guts in High School , Kathy was a renegade who unapologetically embodied the New York punk movement.
Blood and Guts in High School
was the first of her writing to be published in Britain, and caused controversy far and wide for its explicit sexual content and central themes of incest, paedophilia, abortion and prostitution.
Featuring several graphic sex scenes between Janey, the novel’s ten-year-old protagonist, and her father, the book was banned as pornographic in several countries.
But as well as being criticised, it was original and innovative, cementing Acker’s reputation as a ‘literary terrorist’. Appropriating the work of
Jean Genet ,
Georges Bataille
and the
Marquis de Sade , it used journal entries, dreams, drawings, letters and poetry to form a textual collage, similar to the cut-up techniques that made
William Burroughs
so famous.
Acker’s texts are renowned for being challenging reads; exploring alternative identities for characters from fact and fiction, they’re almost always abstract and non-linear in nature, with disjointed imagery and fantasy sequences of violence, sex and apocalyptic environments that bear similarities to
Patti Smith ‘s spoken word and poetry.
Yet despite being dismissed by some as inaccessible, Acker’s influence remains undeniable and far-reaching.
Kathleen Hanna
and
Kim Gordon , of
Bikini Kill
and
Sonic Youth , have acknowledged Acker’s strong influence on them (according to Kathleen Hanna, Acker is the one who told her to start a band).
She is also credited as an influence and inspiration by other contemporary experimental authors, including
Stewart Home
and
Dennis Cooper . Even
Delirium , the popular comic book character by
Neil Gaiman , is partly based on Acker.
Diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996, Kathy Acker died the following year in
Room 101
of a Mexican clinic. In
a Bookslut interview
with Neil Gaiman, comic book king
Alan Moore
is credited with quipping “there was nothing that woman couldn’t turn into a literary reference.”
A literary pirate and pioneer, we salute her, and will be celebrating her 65th birthday today.
Not sure where to start? Try
Essential Acker , which has extracts from
Blood and Guts in High School ,
Pussy, King of the Pirates
and numerous other works, and includes an introduction from
Jeanette Winterson .
