(18%),
insomnia
(up to 15%),

(2%), and
yawning
(2%) have been reported.

psychosis
have been reported infrequently.
Catatonic
reaction,
withdrawal syndrome
and
melancholia
have been reported rarely.
Delirium
has been reported to be temporally associated with citalopram treatment. Nervous system side effects including
headache
(26%),
dry mouth
(20%),
increased sweating
(11%),
tremor
(8%),
dizziness
(2%), and
sleep
abnormalities
have been reported.
Paresthesia , and
migraine
have been reported frequently.
Hyperkinesia ,
vertigo ,
hypertonia ,
extrapyramidal
disorder,
leg cramps ,
involuntary muscle contractions ,
hypokinesia ,
neuralgia ,
dystonia , abnormal gait,
hypesthesia
and
ataxia
have been reported infrequently.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome ,
serotonin syndrome ,
abnormal coordination ,
hyperesthesia ,
ptosis ,
stupor , and
choreoathetosis
have rarely been reported.
Akathisia ,
dyskinesia , and
grand mal convulsions
have been reported to be temporally associated with citalopram treatment. Nearly all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mixed serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants cause
sleep
abnormalities
to some extent.
These antidepressants have marked dose-dependent
effects
on
rapid eye movement
( REM )
sleep , causing
reductions
in the overall
amount
of
REM
sleep
over the night and
delays
the first entry into
REM
sleep
( increased
REM
sleep onset
latency
(ROL)), both in healthy subjects and depressed patients.
The antidepressants that increase serotonin function appear to have the greatest
effect
on
REM
sleep .
The
reduction
in
REM
sleep
is greatest early in treatment, but gradually returns towards baseline during long-term therapy; however, ROL remains long.
Following discontinuation of therapy the amount of REM sleep tends to rebound.
Some of these drugs (i.e., bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, trazodone, trimipramine) appear to have a modest or minimal
effect
on
REM
sleep . Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an
allergic reaction : skin rash or hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
Call your doctor at once if you have any new or worsening symptoms such as:
mood or behavior changes ,
anxiety ,
panic attacks ,
trouble
sleeping , or if you
feel impulsive ,
irritable ,
agitated ,
hostile, aggressive ,
restless,
hyperactive
(mentally or physically), more depressed, or have
thoughts about suicide or hurting yourself .
Call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects:
very stiff ( rigid ) muscles,
high fever, sweating , fast or uneven heartbeats,
tremors ,
overactive reflexes ;
nausea ,
vomiting ,
diarrhea ,
loss of appetite , feeling
unsteady ,
loss of coordination ; or
headache ,
trouble concentrating ,
memory problems ,
weakness ,
confusion ,
hallucinations ,
fainting ,
seizure ,
shallow breathing
or
breathing that stops .
Less serious side effects may include:
drowsiness ;
sleep
problems
( insomnia );
mild
nausea ,
gas ,
upset stomach ;
weight changes;
urinating more than usual;
decreased sex drive ,
impotence , or difficulty having an orgasm;
dry or watery mouth ,
yawning ; or
cold symptoms
such as
stuffy nose ,
sneezing ,
sore throat .
This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.
You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.
Other side effects occurring upon discontinuation of citalopram have been reported, particularly when the discontinuation has been abrupt.
These withdrawal effects have included
dysphoric
mood ,
irritability ,
agitation ,
dizziness ,
sensory disturbances
including unfavorable smell,
anxiety ,
confusion ,
headache ,
lethargy ,
emotional lability ,
insomnia , and hypomania. The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, including citalopram, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists.
Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).
Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes.
Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms.
Worsening of depression
and/or increased
suicidal thinking
or behavior may always be a possibility in patients treated with antidepressant medications, particularly those being treated for depression.
Anxiety ,
agitation ,
panic attacks ,
insomnia ,
irritability ,
hostility , impulsivity,
akathisia
(severe
restlessness ),
hypomania , and
mania
have been reported in patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric.
It is unknown if these symptoms are a precursor to either worsening of depression or the emergence of suicidal impulses; however, there is concern that patients who experience one or more of these symptoms may be at increased risk for worsening
depression
or
suicidality .
Although the FDA has not concluded that antidepressant drugs cause worsening depression or suicidality, health care providers should be aware that worsening of symptoms could be due to the underlying disease or might be a result of drug therapy.
Because antidepressants are believed to have the potential for inducing
manic
episodes in patients with bipolar disorder, there is a concern about using antidepressants alone in this population.
Therefore, patients should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for
bipolar
disorder before initiating antidepressant treatment so that they can be appropriately monitored during treatment.
Such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of
suicide ,
bipolar
disorder, and
depression .
Activation of
mania / hypomania
has been reported in 0.2% of citalopram treated patients.
The manufacturer recommends that citalopram be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania.
.
Adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of citalopram have been reported, particularly when the discontinuation has been abrupt.
These adverse events have included
dysphoric
mood ,
irritability ,
agitation ,
dizziness ,
sensory disturbances, anxiety ,
confusion ,
headache ,
lethargy ,
emotional lability ,
insomnia , and
hypomania .
Theses events are generally self-limiting.
However, there have been reports of
serious discontinuation symptoms .
Patients should be monitored for withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing treatment with citalopram.
Gradual reduction of the dose is recommended whenever possible.
If intolerable symptoms occur due to a decrease in dosage or discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be appropriate.
This may be followed by a more gradual reduction in dosage.
