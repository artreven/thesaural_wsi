Cuco vs The Internet
Many moons ago I had a crazy roommate. By crazy, I mean someone that had to spend several weeks in a mental hospital and was heavily medicated after that. If he forgot to take his pills, he would become more loud and destructive than a gremlin that had food after midnight. There are uncountably many stories about him, Turbo, but I will not talk about them now. I will talk about his friend, whom I will refer to as
Cuco
(not his real name, in order to protect his identity). Cuco was visiting us, and crashing in the
chichacatre
(a mattress we had in the living room). Turbo was out of town, while I was studying, and Cuco got bored, so he wanted to use my laptop and browse
the internet . Fine, as long as he lets me study. This was back in the day where
the
search engine was yahoo. So, he decided to go to yahoo, and instead of doing a search, starts browsing the categories. I have never seen anyone actually browsing them for so long, after all, they just sucked. Somehow he got into the "Jokes" subsection, and I thought that should entertain him for some time. I didn't hear him type or click for quite some time (15 minutes or so), and I turn around and see him staring at the screen. The screen contained
something like this : the image of a half-way done progress bar that had a caption that read "How to keep an idiot waiting."
This is a true story. I was going to explode laughing, when he turns to me and says "There is something wrong with your internet." My previously contained laughter conventional explosion drove his statement into critical mass creating in me a nuclear explosion of laughter. I spent quite some time trying to pull myself together, but whenever I would start explaining him that it was a joke I would start laughing again. I even remember how much my stomach hurt of laughing so hard. Then, he decided to check his email. He would click on the address bar, and the current address would get highlighted and selected as normal. That confused him quite a bit, and told me that he wanted to get rid of the "blue thing". I told him just to delete it and write the address. He looked very confused, so I said "just type www...". And he did, effectively overwriting the previous address and typing his own. "WOW, your computer can DELETE with the 'w' key!!!".
Oh my
flying spaghetti monster .

Why students evaluations can be the most horrible thing ever
My department has been hit particularly hard with all the science funding cuts (money that has been used towards the war). This means that several research groups lost their grants, leaving their students without jobs. This had a huge impact on TAships, as an unprecedented amount of grad students were requesting positions. Many of them didn't get any sort of funding, and were notified late into the semester. I have friends that had to change advisors to prevent being deported (they would lose their student visas). Others just left the country, leaving housing contracts behind.
The department has announced that the situation next semester will be even worse. And, to decide who will get a TAship, they will take into consideration the student evaluations. The premise is that good TAs should stay, while bad TAs shouldn't. Are student evaluations a good measure of how good a TA is? The evals have a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being "disagree" or "bad", to 5 being "good" or "agree". The questions are usually in the form of "Was the work load reasonable?" The statistics in campus say that the average score is 4, and that most scores actually land either in the 5s or 1s. That is, the students evals are very polarized. If you are funny and entertaining, regardless of how good of an educator you are, you get good scores. If you go easy on them, regardless of how valuable the course is to them, you get good scores.
If you end up teaching a class like Physical Science, were all the students have problems with elementary school level math, no matter how hard you try to make them learn something, they had decided a long time ago that the class was too hard, useless and too much work. You get bad scores no matter what, with very little noise to distinguish among good and bad instructors.
It can be very challenging. So, an instructor can decide among several paths. The most extreme ones would be:
1) Teach them Physical Science. Try to remedy their lack of math background by giving them supplemental material. Ask them to work hard in this challenging class to see if they can get something out of it. After all, science is around us all the time.
2) Be "the nice guy". Make it easy. After all, they will never see science in their life.
Guess who will get good evaluations? Guess who would be a better educator? Guess who will get a TAship next semester? Are students evaluations a bad thing? No. They are
a
form of feedback, not a very good one. I, personally, don't care too much about the numbers. I think I tend to get pretty high ones mostly due to the fact that I teach a class with excellent students with a solid background, and that I am a dork and they enjoy making fun of me. I don't think the raw scores give me any useful feedback on how good I was as an educator, but they do say how entertaining I was. To fix this, I do ask them to
write
comments on their evaluation forms. You know, the comments that nobody reads. They tend to be honest, critical and much more meaningful. They are the ones that help me to improve as an instructor. They are the ones that they don't consider when assigning TAships.
I have met so many TAs that were very committed to teaching that now are very scared that the TAships will become a competition based on the eval scores. They are smart enought to understand the game and have decided to take approach (2).
Hi ho.

More about the ACL
My friends have posted their ACL reviews. They are much more detailed than mine, and even include pictures! One is
in English , the
other one is in Spanish . On a related note, the third day of the ACL Festival also was the hottest day ever recorded in Austin during the fall:
108F . Recall that this numbers are measured in the shade, and that in the direct sun (like the festival was) it can easily be 10 or 20 degrees higher. After talking to some other friends that went to the ACL, it seems that everyone agrees that The Arcade Fire put up the best concert. Many of them did like me and went ahead and bought their CD. They were that good.

filiberto no murio en pr
Filiberto murio en macondo. Murio desangrado despues de recibir un balazo que le perforo el pulmon. Nadie le ofrecio ayuda. Le dispararon a alguien que robo 7 millones de dolares para regalarle juguetes a los niños pobres. Despues lo dejaron desangrar. No me sorprendio que rapido hicieran marchas y pintaran paredes para demostrar su sentir. Despues de todo, el derecho a la libre expresion mejor se manifiesta a traves del vandalizmo.
Estos son varios pensamientos relacionados. El recinto de Rio Piedras amanecio todo vandalizado y hoy hicieron una marcha que paso a traves del centro de estudiantes. El departamento de Ciencias Naturales esta todo pintado. No he visto ninguna pintura en el colegio, pero si he visto muchas cosas escritas en tiza. Como consecuencia del asesinato de Filiberto, la compañia Glidden obtendra ganancias de miles de dolares.
Mientras tomaba clases, escuche a un tipo hablando con un altavoz: Hay que paralizar el recinto y movernos al frente de la oficina del registrador. Hay que denunciar el asesinato Filiberto Aqui la gente cree que derecho a expresarse es hacer lo que les da la gana. No comprendo todavia que tiene que ver la Universidad con el asesinato de Filiberto, pero por alguna razon a los estudiantes les hace logica. Como si parando el colegio fueran a revivirlo. Hace un tiempo un profesor hizo una huelga de hambre porque lo despidieron, los estudiantes detuvieron las clases como muestra de solidaridad. Esta noticia
del mural que hicieron en Rio Piedras es muy contradictoria. Una de las fotos dice: El Burguer King del alfrente de la UPR recinto de Rio Piedras fue vandalizado por un grupo de activistas. Pq no solo el FBI mato a Filiberto, tambn fueron los intereses capitalistas de las multinacionales y transnacionales.
Sin embargo, uno de los comentarios dice: Han bandalizado el dibujo de Filiberto Ojeda Rios (Líder del Ejercito Popular Boricua "Macheteros" ) realizado en Rio Piedras. Aquí sencilamente nos podemos dar cuenta de la falta de tolerancia de algunas personas fanáticas en cuanto a los ideales y sentimientos de otros individuos que no tienen los mismos interes que ellos.
Vandalizar Burguer King es derecho a libre expresion. Pero vandalizar el afiche de Filiberto es opresion.

The Kiddie Pool
At the last few hours of the ACL, the wind created a dust storm. I was all covered with dirt, tired and craving a cold beer and a shower. I decided to leave the festival grounds before the last concert was over, and on my way to the car there were these guys that had parked their mobile home down the street, and had an awesome setup of a kiddie pool, beer and a water hose. These guys knew that most of the 60,000 people from the concerts would walk by there, and they were waiting to spray them with the water hose. As I walked down, they sprayed me. It was exactly what I needed, so I asked them to spray me with some more refreshing water. Then, I thanked them for the public service they were performing, and they offered me some beer. So, I spent 6 beers hanging out with them, spraying people with water and listening to good punk music. It was so much fun! Finally, my friends walked by, and they were surprised to see me drinking beer there with these strangers.
It gave some awesome closure to an awesome weekend.

Austin City Limits Festival
I have seen a lot of live music in the past four days, and now I am catching up on the blogging. The ACL Festival was even better than last years. At first it was thought that the hurricane might ruin it, but the weekend was dry and sunny, up to 104 degrees F on Sunday. The concerts are outdoors, in a park with very little shade, and can be very rough on you. Water is very precious, and so are the few spots with shade. At several times, under the abrasive sun I asked myself "why the hell am I here?". But, there were these jewels that made it all worth it. I got to see a lot of concerts, but will just comment on the highlights (and
lowdarks (?)). On Friday I started with the Morgan Heritage concert, that was just really fun reggae. Like my friend observed, you cannot beat a rasta on stage. Reggae concerts are all about interaction with the crowd. Then, we got to see Thievery Corporation (again), they were really good, but not as good as the night before. Many people thought that it was the best concert at the festival. On Saturday, we started early with Aqualung: good fun rock music. Built to Spill is one of those classic indie bands that have been around forever, and they can show their experience on stage with some really cool jamming. I have heard before that Death Cab for Cutie had a good live show, and it was true. Their music is just too catchy. Bloc Party was a well engineered act, that had everyone jumping and singing along. Oasis sucked. Let me say that again. Oasis sucked. The arrogance of the band was too much too take, and we ended up leaving early. Oasis, if your music isn't good, it isn't your audience's fault. Assholes. Sunday was the longest and hottest day of the whole weekend. It started with Ambulance LTD. I have never heard those guys before, and wow, I need to get their music ASAP! M83 was a good show, they sounded just like in their albums, which is very challenging considering the electronic nature of their music. Rilo Kiley was as good as last time I saw her: a fun, very melodic show. The Bravery had horrible technical problems, and they sounded just awful. It was one of those concerts that you end up liking their music less after it. But, it was promptly forgotten with the best concert of the Festival:
The Arcade Fire . 11 people, with tons of instruments from xylophones to violas to french horns. They looked like they were all nerds, rejects and outcasts in highschool. And that due to their lack of social skill, they went crazy. Their music can be anything from soothing to harsh, from order to chaos, and from rock to I don't know what it was. Their energy lifted my mood (the sun can have a strong effect on it) and made me dance and jump with them. They went crazy throwing stuff around and beating the shit out of several instruments. They were just un-fucking-believable. The only bad thing was that I wanted to see more of them. I can't wait to see if they will come to Austin again.
After the concert, I went and bought their CD. Franz Ferdinand had a good show, just like the previous year, and I hear that Coldplay had a Johnny Cash cover. I say I heard, because I am not a big fan of Coldplay, and since by then I had lost contact with my friends, I decided to beat the crowd and leave after a few songs.
Which turned out to be a really good decision.

Thievery Corporation
Last Thursday I went to see
Thievery Corporation . I can't describe their genre, they incorporate sounds from everything from reggae to bosa nova, and their very original but accessible music had everyone dancing. I couldn't have imagined that what sounded like a studio band was a really good live one, with 7 singers, and like 8 musicians. Their sounds was impeccable. Don't miss them out if you have a chance to see them.

salsoul killed salsa
I love salsa music... True, fat, hardcore salsa music. Z93 has always been my favorite radio station because that's what they give. Good salsa all the time. However, about 2 years ago Salsoul copied Z93 and removed all of their non-salsa music. Sadly, Salsoul won and they stole a lot of public from Z93.
I still preferred Z93 because they had better salsa. However, they started to lose ratings and began to include crappy radio shows. That's when I stopped listening to Z93 and started listening Salsoul. But my father, who was the one to introduce me to the station, continued to listen to Z93 faithfully. Now, Salsoul is playing reggaeton and merengue. Reggaeton!!! A salsa station is playing reggaeton!!! There's no good salsa station anymore. Last weekend, I saw some Hector Lavoe cd's in my home. My father bought them because z93 is not good anymore. Salsa is dead. Salsoul killed it.

bioluminiscence and some stuff.
I went today to the bioluminiscent lagoon in Fajardo. Awesome!!! Nature can be soooo cool. Anyway, when we were leaving, we heard some people saying that they killed
Filiberto Ojeda Rios.
I do not share Ojeda's ideologies or anything like it, but I still can't believe that they got him. Few people in Puerto Rico manage to escape from the police for so much time. Kind of like the day that they killed
Toño Bicicleta.
Something that you knew had to come some day, but then when it does it impresses you..

Rita in Austin
Hurricane Rita caused the massive evacuation of Houston; I am sure you have seen the visuals. Several people I know have family there, and all of them share stories along the lines of "What should have take 30mins driving took them 7.5 hours".
In Austin, that is several hundred miles away from the coast, people were freaking out. There was no bottled water in the city by Wednesday (the hurricane was predicted to strike on Saturday). Most gas stations were out of gas by Thursday.
I was forced to get some gas that day (I was running low), and had to wait behind this old lady's car that was blocking two pumps while she pumped gas. It took her quite some time to be done with her car, and then go inside the station and pay. Then, she opens the trunk, and takes out some portable gas container. And starts pumping gas in it. Then she goes inside again. From her trunk, she pulls out
another , smaller, gas container, and starts putting gas in it. And then another, smaller one. And then another, even smaller one.
It was like she had a
Matriochka
of gasoline containers. I was expecting the last container to be the size of a shot glass. It seems like Austin will not be under the direct effects of Rita.
ACL , here I come.

Peer Review
Journal publications that go through peer review are the bread and butter of modern science. As an aspiring physicists, I started the process a few months ago. It has been longer than I thought it would be. I finally (finally!!!) got the reviews from the referees. One,
really
liked it, but considers it more appropiate for a sister publication of the journal. That referee also didn't quite get some fundamental concepts. In a nutshell, he liked the paper a lot, but wants me to expand it, making it more suitable for the sister journal that has no lenght constraints. The second referee didn't like some things, and in fact, confused my example for my general procedure. I am not discouraged, the editor suggested the sister publication (that is a very good one too), and I can see how I can incorporate some of the criticisms into making it more clear. But, the most infuriating thing is that it is obvious that the referees didn't read the references, or they would have found answers to their questions. So it goes. On the other hand,
papers with very funny titles get published . I wish I was
that
clever.

sleep is so unnecessary
I have so much work to do these days, there's no possible way that I can finish this and still sleep more than 3 hours a day. I've heard too many coffee jokes lately. I can't even keep a conversation for too long.
Since I don't drink coffee, I have been substituting meals with Pepsi and Mountain Dew. The guy that stocks the soda machines over here always throws some products in the wrong place, so you end up getting "Chocolate Moose" instead of Pepsi. I got really pissed off when I needed a Pepsi at 3:00 am and got a stupid Nestea.... I hate that guy. I wrote a petition and collected signatures to tell the soda machine guy to do his work correctly... I have some pictures, but I am too tired to upload them, so I will just translate the petition here... Mr. Soda putter: Please stock the machines correctly. It's really sad to wish for a refreshing Pepsi and receive instead a Chocolate Moose.

Delirium
A few days ago I received my
new laptop ,
Delirium . I have spent some time doing the usual "lets get to know each other", and there is much more to configure. It is much lighter than my old laptop Gitana, and the fingerprint reader is just sweet. So far, I am very happy with my purchase, and after several name changes, settled down on this one.

Why I am Bokonist
Kurt Vonnegut Jr.
is my favorite author from the US. His simple and captivating language makes his literature pieces flow as fast as most pulp, while leaving you with a new perspective about the absurdity of the universe that we live in. The war comedy
Slaughterhouse-Five
had me laughing out loud at the crimes against humanity committed by the Allies. So it goes. Listen: Breakfast of Champions left me in awe after the author himself appears in the book to tell to one of the characters that his suspicion is true: he
is
a character in a book. And so on. I just finished reading his
Cat's Cradle , a book that has everything a Mad Scientist must have: a tropical island, an evil dictator, and an apocalyptic weapon. The outlawed religion taught by Bokonon is the only escape against the oppressive scientific totalitarianism. "See the cat? See the cradle?" is the phrase that reminds us about the absurdity of the complicated mechanism of self-deception that we use to carry on with our lives.
Check the book out; it is short, fun and a good first book to get to know Vonnegut. But, most importantly, this book introduced me to
The Books of Bokonon , the first religious book that resonates with my own spiritual needs. If you think you aren't a Bokonist, just read Cat's Cradle, you
will
think differently by the end. The Books of Bokonon start with the following warning:
Don't be a fool! Close this book at once! It is nothing but foma! Where foma is the word for lies and deception. All of the true things that I am about to tell you are shameless lies. is how Bokonon continues his seminal, continuously growing religious testament.
Man blinked. "What is the purpose of all this?" he asked politely.
"Everything must have a purpose?" asked God.
"Certainly," said man.
"Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this," said God.
And He went away. Bokonon teaches us in his religion. But, he has his own opinion about religions: Of course it's trash! Can religion fill the void? Can it give meaning to our existence?
Bokonon's Fourteenth Book has the answer. I won't try to paraphrase or edit the answer, so I will just include here the
total
contents of the book:
Title: What Can a Thoughtful Man Hope for Mankind on Earth, Given the Experience of the Past Million Years?
Only verse: Nothing. I can now say that I
am
a bokonist, and I have always been one. I am convinced that you will find out that you have always been one too, you just don't know it. I will now finish this post with a verse from The Books of Bokonon: Someday, someday, this crazy world will have to end, And our God will take things back that He to us did lend. And if, on that sad day, you want to scold our God, Why just go ahead and scold Him. He'll just smile and nod.

Why I am not buying an Apple
My 3 year old Gitana has given me enough problems already that it deserves to be replaced, or demoted to a headless file server. Maybe it is time to switch... The serpent said to the woman, "You surely will not die! For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil. "When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings. I wanted to replace it with something light, powerful, and solid. I wanted a good arquitecture, I wanted something fast with good battery life. I wanted something that will let me do hardcore scientific computations, and that I didn't have to worry about its security. If it looked as good as my iPod, and was as easy to use, even better.
I wanted OSX running on PowerPC. I wanted what a Powerbook used to stand for. I wanted to be an Apple fan boy. I really wanted to get a Powerbook because they are just plain cool. But I can't. I am sorry, but I just can't. The LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, Cursed are you more than all cattle, And more than every beast of the field; On your belly you will go, And dust you will eat All the days of your life; OSX is even better than ever: the beatiful *nix I always wanted to have for an OS. So, what happened to Apple? PowerPC failed, it wasn't able to keep up with the processor speed race. "I want a Powerbook, but I want it now." I have been saying for the past few months. But, Apple hasn't upgraded their Powerbook lineup in a long time, and I refuse to pay full price for an old processor. I want to give Steve Jobs my money, my loyalty and my soul. But I can't wait anymore. With the announcement of Intel architecture and all the rumors around it, it is hard to tell when will a new Powerbook come out: maybe next month, maybe next year. And, no matter how smooth the architecture transition is for the OS and the applications, they are always somewhat painful. The truth is that OSX running on Intel makes Apple a less attractive now. It is being hacked to run on most Intel systems, and the hacks will get better with time. So, why pay the premium Apple hardware prize? The quality of Apple's product is better than average, but it is not as good as their marketing genius makes us believe. The iPods have their battery problems. I know several people with problems with drives in their computers. They are good, but not perfect. I wanted to switch. I really did. But, looking at my budget, looking at the problems Apple has been having with their processors (IBM and Freescale, I'm looking at you two), and looking at the short term future for Apple, I decided to buy Wintel one more time.

The Best Part of Teaching
The best part of being a TA is sharing experiences with other TAs about how bad some students can be. I am lucky to have pretty smart and hardworking students all the time, but some others TA, well, they have students that would make
sea cucumbers
seem as smart as
Dirac . A physical science TA (the easiest science class in the university) was telling us about how he had the worst students ever. He caught
two
(2) football players cheating during a test; and he decided to wait until next class before telling them. Next class he started by telling the whole class how he caught some students cheating, and that they had two options. One, to turn themselves in, and they get a zero in the test. Or two, not do anything, and the TA would report them to the academic dishonesty forum, and let them process the situation; if found guilty, it would go in their permanent record.
Twelve
(12) students came after the class to confess that they had cheated. Another TA was saying how she once taught math for poets (the easiest math course in the university), and how she had the dumbest student ever, some football player (why is it always football players? I really don't want to judge...). He couldn't add 1/2 + 1/4. Seriously. So, during a test he asks for help with that question. The TA being nice, decided to give him a hint: "Imagine that you run a distance of half a football field. Then you run one quarter of a football field. How much of the football field did you run?" "Oh yes! Got it! Thanks!!!!"
And of course, he answered in his test that 1/2 + 1/4 = 75 yards.

Nyquil might be my favorite drug
Listen: I am still having some problems with the jet-lag, and was taking naps starting at hours that corresponded to prime numbers and lasted for a prime number of hours. My cold also has taken more time to heal than it should have. All these things were predicted by my wise
Sempai . Although I hate medicines that have strong side effects, I felt I had no other option than to resolve all my problems under the umbrella medicine called
Nyquil . Active Ingredients (in each 15 ml tablespoon) : Acetaminophen 500mg (pain reliever/fever reducer)
Dextromethorphan HBr 15mg (cough suppressant)
Doxylamine succinate 6.25mg (antihistamine)
Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride 30mg (nasal decongestant)
Inactive Ingredients: alcohol, citric acid, D&C Yellow No. 10, FD&C Green No. 3, FD&C Yellow No. 6, flavor, high fructose corn syrup, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, purified water, saccharin sodium, sodium citrate These permited me to sleep like a baby last night, for 9 hours straight (note how this is
not
a prime number of hours) With 10% alcohol, it has to be good for you
somehow . And so on. I was still a bit sleep at 11am, but at least I feel less tired and with a better mood. Nyquil can be the best thing invented by medical science. I am finally home for real, and started cleaning up my mess. After I sort out my life a little bit better, I will try to post some pics from my trip to Tokyo.

Mayor Ray Nagin
Here is the unedited version of the interview
to the Mayor Ray Nagin. The most powerful political speech I have ever heard. Scratch political, this is a speech about honest compassion. Some rough transcripts: "I don't know what they are doing, their air conditioners must be good, some good smoke coming out of it" "B S , where is the beef?" "He flying over in his Air Force 1 don't do it justice?" "feeding the public a line of bull and they are DYING" "Did the Iraqi people asked us to go there?" "After 9/11 we gave the president unprecedented powers... Now you need to tell ME that a place where the oil comes in... 10000 that have died... We can't figure out how to authorize the money? ... Man, I am not on of those drug addicts. My mind is very clear." "GET OFF YOUR ASSES AND DO SOMETHING AND FIX THE BIGGEST GODDAMN CRISIS IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY!!!" The interview ends with the mayor and the news reporter crying. Please, listen to this interview, all the way to the end. I have heard the edited version, but this is much better. Listen to it. It will be worth it. This could have been prevented. This is not being addressed with as much impetus as 9/11 or Iraq. Why are the poor black democrats dying?

Academic research scientists . So it goes.

The World is not Enough
Bush has been quoted saying
over and over:
"I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees." I remember talking to a friend of mine from Louisiana about this a year ago, in particular about how the funding to maintain and upgrade the levees was being cut because of the
O peration
I raqi
L iberty. In fact, he said that everyone in the state knew that without that money, under a strong Cat3 hurricane, the whole city will go the same way Atlantis went. You don't believe me, or him? Well, read
any
of
these
instead . [...] On June 8, 2004, Walter Maestri, emergency management chief for Jefferson Parish, Louisiana; told the Times-Picayune: It appears that the money has been moved in the president's budget to handle homeland security and the war in Iraq, and I suppose that's the price we pay. Nobody locally is happy that the levees can't be finished, and we are doing everything we can to make the case that this is a security issue for us. [...] "The system is in great shape, but the levees are sinking. Everything is sinking, and if we don't get the money fast enough to raise them, then we can't stay ahead of the settlement," he said. "The problem that we have isn't that the levee is low, but that the federal funds have dried up so that we can't raise them." Why are threats based on lies and moved by economical interests of the presidents friends taken as true and acted upon? Why are threats well studied and document by scientists and engineers pissed all over killing more Americans in the U.S. than Saddamm could have ever killed? Why are so many Americans fine with this? I'm all in favor of the democratic principle that one idiot is as good as one genius, but I draw the line when someone takes the next step and concludes that two idiots are better than one genius. - Leó Szilárd I just came back from a country whose history was full of natural disasters. The National Museum had a whole wing showing that even before the
Tokugawa shogunate , the country as a whole started to get orgazined against them. Their buildings are flexible. Their bridges (and they have
many
in Tokyo) are built on ball-joints to make them earthquake proof. Their water and electrical system are typhoon proof too. Is this crazy? Maybe, just maybe, I am not crazy, and a big part of the world is. Or maybe the whole world is crazy. Or maybe the world is not enough.

hurricane katrina
I haven't posted in a while because I've been busy with college.
I've been looking around for pictures of hurricane Katrina and found some amazing (and high quality) satellite pictures of the storm. Nasa picture. 6200 * 8000 pixels. 8.1 MB Same picture, lower quality. 775 * 1000 pixels. 257KB No wonder they got beaten so bad. That thing was huge.
T-Mobile is
giving free wireless access
to certain areas to let people communicate. That is a really good idea.
