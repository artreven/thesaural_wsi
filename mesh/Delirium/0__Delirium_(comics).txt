Inappropriate Unicorn does Halloween
1 November, 2010
I was a unicorn. An inappropriate unicorn, drinking wine out of plastic cups and quoting Jay Z lyrics at inopportune times! This was the first time I’ve ever really dressed up for Halloween because it’s not really a thing in Australia, but my friend Heather organised a huge party so I thought I should put in some effort.
[Warning: There is an animated gif down below!]
The lovely
Zoe
and
Sonya
also attended as
Delirium
and
Medusa
and of course we couldn’t let an opportunity to
Awkward Lean
pass us by.
Nick was on photo duties and figured out how to photograph bokeh… oh no, A MONSTER HAS BEEN MADE!
The ice cream cone was the headpiece I made for Nick, who went as Ralph Wiggins. Unfortunately I used the wrong glue and the ice cream detached from the headband. Sad story :(
It wouldn’t be a proper party if no one ever photobombed. I looove the second photo just because the werewolf and Grudge costumes were so freaky!
Thank you Heather (as Roxie Richter from Scott Pilgrim) for a great party! I think we look like kick ass superheroes here :D

Now that’s a party worth dressing up for! I love the mighty unicorn – though I don’t know if even a unicorn could beat Roxie Richter in a fight! She’s a half-ninja, you know!
(and thank you for the animated .gif warning – I really appreciate it!)
