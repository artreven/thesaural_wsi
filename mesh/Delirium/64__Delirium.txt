oral moniliasis ,
pancreatic pseudocyst , rectal disorder, and

have been reported less frequently. Hepatic side effects
have included
elevations in liver function tests
in up to 36% of patients.
More serious
hepatotoxicity , including
jaundice ,
cholestatic jaundice ,
granulomatous hepatitis ,
hepatitis , have been uncommon. Nervous system side effects including headache (22% to 64%), tremors (24% to 56%), and paresthesias or dysesthesias (21% to 40%) have been reported.
More serious nervous system effects have included posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML),
mental status changes, seizures, encephalopathy, coma, dysarthria, aphasia, akinetic mutism, and neuropathy.
In addition, dizziness, fatigue, incoordination, and hypertonia have also been reported.
Abnormal dreams, agitation, amnesia, anxiety, confusion, convulsion, crying, depression, dizziness, elevated mood, emotional lability, encephalopathy, hemorrhagic stroke, hallucinations, hypertonia, incoordination, monoparesis, myoclonus, nerve compression, nervousness, neuropathy, flaccid paralysis, impaired psychomotor skills, psychosis, quadriparesis, somnolence, abnormal thinking , and impaired writing have been reported less frequently. In 61 patients receiving tacrolimus for orthotopic liver transplantation, moderate to severe
CNS toxicity
in the early post-op course occurred in 21% of patients. Late toxicity occurred in 13% of patients. Most patients recovered following drug withdrawal or dose reduction. However, late
neurotoxicity
was highly associated with severe
infections
and
multi-organ failure . Intravenous or high levels of tacrolimus may contribute to drug-associated
neurotoxicity , but this remains to be confirmed.
Leukoencephalopathy has been reported in 3 patients receiving liver or lung transplants.
Headaches,
nausea ,
vomiting
and fever accompanied by generalized
seizures
were thought to be due to an immunosuppression related
demyelinating
syndrome caused by tacrolimus toxicity.
Another report details a patient who was switched from tacrolimus to cyclosporine therapy but developed the same syndrome.
Neurological signs and symptoms should resolve within 1 to 2 weeks after discontinuation or dose reduction of tacrolimus.
The mechanism by which tacrolimus (and cyclosporine) result in CNS
demyelination
is unknown, but may involve binding to intracellular protein ligands and inhibition of calcineurin activity. Renal side effects have included elevations in serum creatinine (up to 39%) and blood urea nitrogen (up to 30%), and renal failure (up to 20%), sometimes requiring hemodialysis.
In addition, oliguria and hematuria have been reported. Nephrotoxicity
has been reported in approximately 52% of kidney transplantation patients and in 40% and 36% of liver transplantation patients receiving tacrolimus in the U.S. and European randomized trials, respectively, and in 59% of heart transplantation patients in a European randomized trial.
Use of tacrolimus with sirolimus in heart transplantation patients in a US study was associated with increased risk of
renal function impairment , and is not recommended.
More overt
nephrotoxicity
is seen early after transplantation, characterized by
increasing serum creatinine
and a
decrease in urine output .
In 61 patients receiving tacrolimus for orthotopic liver transplantation, early postoperative
renal insufficiency
(as defined by creatinine 1.5-3.0 mg/dl occurring between post-op day 0 and 30) was observed in 43% of patients.
Early
acute renal failure
(as defined by creatinine greater than 3.0 mg/dL) was observed in 18% of patients treated with tacrolimus.
Approximately 8% of patients with
acute renal failure
required hemodialysis.
New onset of late
renal failure
(as defined by creatinine greater than 3.0 mg/dl occurring between post-op day 30 to 365) was observed in 7% of patients receiving tacrolimus.
The late onset
renal failure
seemed to occur as a result of severe
infection
with concomitant
multi-organ failure
syndrome.
These data suggest that the etiology of early and late renal failure associated with tacrolimus therapy may be different.
The mechanism of tacrolimus-induced renal dysfunction is not well established.
Animal data indicate that tacrolimus may cause efferent arteriolar
vasoconstriction
which leads to a reduction in glomerular filtration rate.
Renal toxicity
appears to be dose-related, although toxicity may still occur even at suggested therapeutic concentrations.
The use of a 24 hour continuous intravenous infusion as opposed to a short intravenous infusion may reduce the incidence and severity of
renal toxicity . Oncologic side effects , or the development of
new malignancies , are of particular concern in post-transplant patients.
Lymphoproliferative disorders
are most commonly encountered.
Lymphadenopathy
and monoclonal and polyclonal B cell hyperplasia as well as malignant, often fatal, B cell
lymphomas
have been reported. In one study of 936 transplant patients receiving tacrolimus as primary immunosuppressive therapy, post-transplant
lymphoproliferative disease
(PTLD) occurred in 15 (1.6%) patients.
Serologic evidence of Epstein-Barr
virus infections
was found in all 15 patients.
The median time between transplant and diagnosis of PTLD was 4.4 months.
Disseminated PTLD was associated with a poor prognosis.

Endocrine side effects have included glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia.
Diabetes-like symptoms may develop in some individuals.
Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity may be suppressed for up to 12 months following long-term therapy with prednisone.
Cushingoid appearance commonly has occurred with chronic therapy.
In addition, hirsutism or virilism, impotence, and menstrual irregularities may occur with chronic therapy. Corticosteroid therapy may induce
glucose intolerance
by reducing the utilization of glucose in tissues and
increasing
hepatic
glucose output.
Patients on alternate day therapy may exhibit significantly
higher serum glucose
on the day prednisone is taken.
Diabetes mellitus
requiring therapy with diet modifications and hypoglycemic agents has developed in some patients.
Adrenal suppression
may persist up to twelve months after long-term corticosteroid therapy.
Adrenal suppression
may be reduced by giving corticosteroids once a day or once every other day.
After corticosteroid therapy has been tapered, supplemental corticosteroid therapy during times of stress (illness, surgery, trauma) may be required.

Hepatic side effects
including a case of mycophenolate sodium-induced
hepatotoxicity
have been reported. Oncologic side effects
including
lymphoma
and
lymphoproliferative disease
(1%) and
non-melanoma skin carcinoma
(2% to 4%) have been associated with therapy. Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents.
The mechanism for mycophenolate mofetil induced PRCA is unknown.
The relative contribution of other immunosuppressants and their combinations in an immunosuppression regimen are also unknown.
In some cases, PRCA was found to be reversible with dose reduction or cessation of mycophenolate mofetil therapy.
In transplant patients, however, reduced immunosuppression may place the graft at risk.
Lymphoproliferative disease
or
lymphoma
developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients.

Musculoskeletal side effects have included myopathy, osteoporosis, vertebral compression fractures, and aseptic necrosis of bone.
Aseptic necrosis has been reported most often to affect the femoral head. Corticosteroid myopathy has presented as
weakness
and
wasting of the proximal limb and girdle
muscles
and generally has been reversible following cessation of therapy.
Corticosteroids inhibit intestinal calcium absorption and increase urinary calcium excretion leading to
bone resorption
and
bone loss .
Bone loss
of 3% over one year has been demonstrated with prednisolone 10 mg per day.
Postmenopausal females are particularly at risk of
loss of bone density .
Sixteen percent of elderly patients treated with corticosteroids for 5 years may experience vertebral compression fractures.
One author reported measurable
bone loss
over two years in women on concomitant therapy with prednisone 7.5 mg per day and tamoxifen. Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an
allergic reaction :
hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

Immunologic side effects
have included
immunosuppression.
Immunosuppression
associated with therapy has resulted in
sepsis
(primarily
cytomegalovirus
viremia) in approximately 20% of patients.
Other
opportunistic infections
have included
herpes simplex virus
(18%),
herpes zoster
(7%), and invasive
candidal
infections (1%).
On a positive note, mycophenolate has been found to delay the recurrence of
hepatitis C
in liver transplant recipients. Hematologic side effects have included dose-related
leukopenia
(11% to 35%),
anemia
(25%), and
thrombocytopenia
(9%).
Severe
neutropenia
has occurred in up to 2% of patients.
Cases of
pure red cell aplasia
( PRCA ) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents.
A case in of mycophenolate mofetil causing
deep venous thrombosis
has also been reported. A well designed, placebo-controlled study noted that hematologic adverse events resolved within one week.
Hematologic side effects tend to occur early in the course of treatment and be dose-related.
Careful monitoring of hematologic parameters may be warranted early in the course of therapy.
A well designed, placebo-controlled study of mycophenolate mofetil (2 or 3 grams daily) combined with cyclosporine and corticosteroids versus cyclosporine and corticosteroids alone for prevention of acute renal allograft rejection reported a similar frequency of adverse events.
A trend towards higher frequencies of
leukopenia
(11% to 14%) and
anemia
(4% to 7%) were reported in the active groups.
Pancytopenia
and
agranulocytosis
occurred rarely.
The proportion of patients with leukopenia between 31 and 180 days after transplantation was 3 times higher in the mycophenolate mofetil group.
All observed hematologic effects resolved within one week.
Adverse effects occur with a higher frequency as the dose exceeds 2 grams/day. Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an
allergic reaction :
hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
Stop using mycophenolate mofetil and call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects:
fever ,
chills ,
body aches ,
flu symptoms ;
pale skin , easy
bruising or bleeding , unusual
weakness ,
trouble breathing ,
