Graphic Novels...Adults for Comic books
So I have reverted back to one of my childhood past time, and started reading comic books, I mean graphic Novels, again. I do blame Matt Loewen and the guys from Head for the Hills for this resurgence.  With the help of the
Poudre River Public Library , formally the Fort Collins Public Library, and
Prospector
I have gotten my hands on tons of wonderful graphic novels.  Here is what I have read so far...
Alan Moore's & Gene Ha's Top 10 Book 1 & 2-  A very interesting story of parallel earths. Top 10 is a police precinct on parallel earth 10 where superhuman, gods, machines, and humans inhabit the earth.  The books take you through the exploits of Top 10's finest.  The books also take every chance they can to poke fun at the DC and Marvel universes.  You will find all sorts of cameos in the margins of the scenes (like Doctor Doom as a little kid).  I enjoyed these two books, and would suggest them to anyone who like Alen Moore and comic books.
Neil Gaiman's & Yoshitaka Amano's Sandman: The Dream Hunters- Not your typical comic book.  The Dream Hunters is more like and illustrated novel.  In this book, Gaiman focus on a very Buddhist view of the world and dreams.  Amano's Japanese influence is felt through out the whole book both in his illustrations and the way Gaiman handles ideas of life, love, the world, and dreams.  I enjoyed this book.  It forces the reader to take a look at life and love via the thought process of a Buddhist.  Amano's illustrations are amazing and look like a dream.  Gaiman's story evolves past the focus of The Sandman however adds to legend of The Sandman.
Neil Gaiman's The Sandman: Volume One- First published in 1989, Gaiman's The Sandman brought new life to DC's original
Sandman
from the 70's.  Unlike the sleeping gas emitting crime fighter, Gaiman's The Sandman is actually Dream of the Endless (The Endless Family includes
Destiny ,
Death ,
Dream ,
Destruction ,
Despair ,
Desire
and
Delirium ).  Gaiman's story became the flagship comic of DC's
Vertigo
comic and set the mood for what was to come from this offshoot from the motherhsip.  Gaiman wields his story to open up a new world inside the DC Universe.  Like Alan Moore before him, Gaiman tests and pushes the limits of the hokie DC Universe where death was off limits.  Gaiman does not shy away from the Universe, he uses it to his advantage and includes the Justice League in the first book.   Although the cover illustration look amazing, the comic illustration is straight out of the late 80's early 90's; however, this takes nothing away from the story.  I would suggest getting into the series if you like Alan Moore, or have ever wondered about Dream.
Neil Gaiman's The Sandman: Endless Nights- In this book Gaiman provides a story for each of The Endless Family-
Destiny ,
Death ,
Dream ,
Destruction ,
Despair ,
Desire
and
Delirium .  I liked all of the stories except Despair and Delirium.  They were just a little too messy for me.  I understand why they were set up this way, but for me it made them almost impossible to read.  Other than that, I enjoyed the way they provided insight into the world of The Endless Family.  If you get into The Sandman series, I would suggest giving this book a read.
Paul Jenkins' & Paolo Rivera's Mythos-  Mythos rehashes the introductions of
six of Marvels most famous comic book(movie) character/groups-
X-Men,
Hulk,
Ghost Rider,
Spider-Man,
Fantastic Four, and Captain America.  Jenkins updates the stories based on their original appearances, and Rivera paints the comics in beautiful detail.  I love the way Rivera's brush seems to add emotion and depth to stories told by greats like Lee, Kirby, and Simon.  I grew up reading these characters books, and thoroughly enjoy the new artistic take on these Marvel classic.  I would suggest this book to anyone who loves the Marvel Universe, or wants an updated take on the origins of these Marvel classics.    G.I. Joe Origins Vol. 1- To be honest, not my favorite book that I read in the last week.  I grew-up watching G.I. Joe and have re-watched the series and the movie since (I know I am a nerd).  This books was a major let down to me.  I hated the story of Snake-eyes, and Cobra Commander(Chimera in the book).  It replaces a good story with blood and gore.  The book adds nothing to the origins of the characters and make assumptions about the development of the team.  If you like G.I. Joe go read GI. Joe #21- "Silent Interlude" (i am guessing if you like G.I. Joe you have already read it) and do not waste your time with this book.
Justice Society of America: The Next Age Vol 1-  This book links the original Justice Society with The Next Age Justice Society.  The Next Age is created at the request of the Justice League by original Justice Society members: The Flash, Green Lantern, and Wildcat.  The Flash and Green Lantern put together a team from the decedent of original members for Wildcat to train.  However, The Fourth Reich controlled by Vandal Savage tries to sever all family ties.   I would suggest this book to a fan of the DC Universe.  It is not your father's DC comic where death is nonexistent; however, it is still a comic book.  The art is modern but still comic based and so is the dialogue.  It brushes over the heavy things, and focuses on the the superpowers that be.  Do not expect a book that get into the human condition, but just enjoy another story of good superheros versus bad supervillains.
