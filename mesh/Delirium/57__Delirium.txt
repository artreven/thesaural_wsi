Medical Source Information Yellow
highlights indicate symptoms related to restlessness. The FDA has informed healthcare professionals that the agency has analyzed reports of suicidality (suicidal behavior or ideation) from placebo controlled clinical studies of eleven drugs used to treat epilepsy as well as psychiatric disorders, and other conditions.
In the FDA's analysis, patients receiving antiepileptic drugs had approximately twice the risk of suicidal behavior or ideation (0.43%) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.22%).
The increased risk of suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation was observed as early as one week after starting the antiepileptic drug and continued through 24 weeks.
The results were generally consistent among the eleven drugs.
The relative risk for suicidality was higher in patients with epilepsy compared to patients who were given one of the drugs in the class for psychiatric or other conditions.
Although this antiepileptic drug was not one of those specifically included in the analysis, the FDA expects that an increased risk of suicidality is shared by all antiepileptic drugs and anticipates that class labeling changes will be applied broadly.
Healthcare professionals should closely monitor all patients currently taking or starting any antiepileptic drug for notable changes in behavior that could indicate the emergence or worsening of suicidal thoughts or behavior or depression.
Use of benzodiazepines including lorazepam may lead to physical and
psychological dependence .
Lorazepam should not be discontinued abruptly in patients who have received the medication for long periods.
Abrupt discontinuation may
result in
symptoms
of
withdrawal .
Delirium
appears to be significantly associated with postoperative exposure to benzodiazepines.
It has been recommended that clinicians caring for patients at risk for
delirium
carefully evaluate the need for benzodiazepines in the postoperative period and consider alternative therapies whenever possible.
Other
side effects have included withdrawal symptoms
after abrupt cessation of lorazepam.
Withdrawal symptoms
have included
agitation ,
restlessness ,
anxiety ,
