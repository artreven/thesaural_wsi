General side effects including
insomnia
(8% to 13%),
fatigue
(2% to 15%),
decreased appetite
(3% to 11%),
asthenia
(2% to 8%),
anorexia
(3% to 5%),
pyrexia
(1% to 3%), gait disturbance, and excessive
yawning
have been reported.
Initial
insomnia
has been reported frequently. Nervous system side effects including somnolence (7% to 21%), dizziness (6% to 17%), headache (13% to 20%), tremor (up to 5%), paraesthesia (4%), dysgeusia (3%), restless legs syndrome, seizures, and sleep abnormalities have been reported. Dizziness
(1.6%),
somnolence
(1.6%), and
fatigue
(1.1%) were the common adverse events reported as reasons for discontinuation and considered to be drug related in trials of patients treated for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain.
Nearly all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mixed serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants cause
sleep abnormalities
to some extent.
These antidepressants have marked dose-dependent
effects on rapid eye movement ( REM) sleep , causing reductions in the overall amount of REM sleep over the night and
delays
the first entry into
REM sleep (increased REM sleep onset latency
(ROL)), both in healthy subjects and depressed patients.
The antidepressants that increase serotonin function appear to have the greatest
effect on REM sleep .
The reduction in REM sleep is greatest early in treatment, but gradually returns towards baseline during long-term therapy; however, ROL remains long.
Following discontinuation of therapy the amount of REM sleep tends to rebound.
Some of these drugs (i.e., bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, trazodone, trimipramine) appear to have a modest or minimal
effect on REM sleep .
Seizures have been reported upon treatment discontinuation. The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, including duloxetine, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists.
Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).
Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes.
Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms.
There have been reports of
hepatic failure , sometimes fatal, in patients treated with duloxetine.
These cases have presented as
hepatitis
with
abdominal pain ,
hepatomegaly
and
elevation of transaminase
levels to more than twenty times the upper limit of normal with or without
jaundice , reflecting a mixed or hepatocellular pattern of
liver
injury .
Duloxetine should be discontinued in patients who develop
jaundice
or other evidence of clinically significant liver dysfunction and should not be resumed unless another cause can be established.
Cases of
cholestatic jaundice
with minimal
elevation of transaminase
levels have also been reported.
Other postmarketing reports indicate that
elevated transaminases, bilirubin
and
alkaline phosphatase
have occurred in patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis.
If the decision is made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered as rapidly as feasible, but with the recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be
associated with withdrawal symptoms .
Discontinuation of duloxetine has been associated with symptoms including
dizziness ,
nausea ,
headache ,
fatigue ,
paresthesia ,
vomiting ,
irritability , and
nightmare
in at least 2% of patients.
Other SSRIs and SNRIs have been
associated with discontinuation symptoms
(particularly when the discontinuation was abrupt), including
dysphoric
mood ,
irritability ,
agitation ,
dizziness ,
sensory disturbances, anxiety ,
confusion ,
headache ,
lethargy ,
emotional lability ,
insomnia ,
hypomania ,
tinnitus , and
seizures .
While discontinuation symptoms have generally been self-limiting, some have been severe.
Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an
allergic reaction : skin rash or hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
Call your doctor at once if you have any new or worsening symptoms such as:
mood or behavior changes ,
anxiety ,
panic attacks ,
trouble sleeping , or if you
feel impulsive ,
irritable ,
