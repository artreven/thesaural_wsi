Medical Source Information Yellow
highlights indicate symptoms related to
mania . The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, including citalopram, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists.
Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).
Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes.
Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms.
Worsening of depression
and/or increased
suicidal thinking
or behavior may always be a possibility in patients treated with antidepressant medications, particularly those being treated for depression.
Anxiety ,
agitation ,
panic attacks ,
insomnia ,
irritability ,
hostility , impulsivity,
akathisia
(severe
restlessness ),
hypomania , and
mania
have been reported in patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric.
It is unknown if these symptoms are a precursor to either worsening of depression or the emergence of suicidal impulses; however, there is concern that patients who experience one or more of these symptoms may be at increased risk for worsening
depression
or
suicidality .
Although the FDA has not concluded that antidepressant drugs cause worsening depression or suicidality, health care providers should be aware that worsening of symptoms could be due to the underlying disease or might be a result of drug therapy.
Because antidepressants are believed to have the potential for inducing
manic
episodes in patients with bipolar disorder, there is a concern about using antidepressants alone in this population.
Therefore, patients should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for
bipolar
disorder before initiating antidepressant treatment so that they can be appropriately monitored during treatment.
Such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of
suicide ,
bipolar
disorder, and
depression .
Activation of
mania / hypomania
has been reported in 0.2% of citalopram treated patients.
The manufacturer recommends that citalopram be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania.
.

These adverse events have included
dysphoric
mood ,
irritability ,

dizziness ,
sensory disturbances, anxiety ,
confusion ,
headache ,
lethargy ,
emotional lability ,
insomnia , and
hypomania .
Theses events are generally self-limiting.
However, there have been reports of
serious discontinuation symptoms .
Patients should be monitored for withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing treatment with citalopram.
Gradual reduction of the dose is recommended whenever possible.
If intolerable symptoms occur due to a decrease in dosage or discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be appropriate.
This may be followed by a more gradual reduction in dosage.
