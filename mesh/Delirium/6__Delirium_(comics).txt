My Neighbor
Totoro Wiki
My Neighbor Totoro
( となりのトトロ ,
Tonari no Totoro ? ) , is a
1988
Japanese
anime film
written
and
directed
by
Hayao Miyazaki
and produced by
Studio Ghibli .
The film follows the two young daughters of a professor and their
interactions with friendly wood spirits in postwar rural Japan. The film
won the
Animage
Anime Grand Prix prize and the
Mainichi Film Award
for Best Film in 1988.
The film was released on VHS and laserdisc in the
United States
by
Tokuma Japan Communications ' US subsidiary in 1993 with the title,
My Friend Totoro . [ 1 ]
Streamline Pictures
produced an exclusive dub for
Japan Airlines ' transpacific flights in 1988.
Troma Films , under their 50th St. Films banner, distributed the dub of the film co-produced by
Jerry Beck . It was released on VHS and DVD by
Fox Video . Troma's and Fox's rights to this version expired in 2004. The film was re-released by
Disney
on March 7, 2006. [ 2 ]
It features a new dub cast. This DVD release is the first version of
the film in the United States to include both Japanese and English
language tracks, as Fox did not have the rights to the Japanese audio
track for their version. Plot
Satsuki and Mei's house ( ja:サツキとメイの家 ) at the
Expo 2005
site
Closeup view of Satsuki and Mei's house
In 1958, the Kusakabe family reunites when a university professor and
his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei (approximately ten and four years
old, respectively) move into an old house in rural Japan to be closer to
the hospital where their mother is recovering from an unnamed,
long-term illness. The daughters find that the house is inhabited by
tiny animated dust creatures called
susuwatari —
small house spirits seen when moving from light to dark places. When
the girls become comfortable in their new house and laugh with their
father, the soot spirits (identified as "black soots" in early subtitles
and "soot sprites" in the later English dubbed version) leave the house
to drift away on the wind.
While she is playing outside one day, Mei sees two white, rabbit-like
ears in the grass. She follows the ears under the house where she
discovers two small magical creatures, who lead her through a briar
patch, and into the hollow of a large
Camphor tree .
She meets and befriends a larger version of the same kind of spirit,
which identifies itself by a series of roars she interprets as "Totoro"
(in the original Japanese dub, it stems from Mei's mispronunciation of
the Japanese pronunciation of the word "troll"). [ 3 ]
Her father later tells her that this is the "keeper of the forest".
One rainy night the girls are waiting for their father's bus and grow
worried when he does not arrive on the bus they expect him on. As they
wait, Mei eventually falls asleep on Satsuki's back and Totoro appears
beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. He only has
a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, so Satsuki offers
him the umbrella she had taken along for her father. Totoro is delighted
at both the shelter and the sounds made upon it by falling raindrops.
In return he gives her a bundle of
nuts
and
seeds . A
bus-shaped giant cat
halts at the stop, and Totoro boards it, taking the umbrella. Shortly after, their father’s bus arrives.
The girls plant the seeds. A few days later they awaken at midnight
to find Totoro and his two miniature colleagues engaged in a
ceremonial dance
around the planted nuts and seeds. The girls join in, whereupon the
seeds sprout and then grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes his
colleagues and the girls for a ride on a magical flying top. In the
morning, the tree is gone, but the seeds have indeed sprouted.
The girls find out that a planned visit by their mother has to be
postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Satsuki takes this very
hard, having reached the age where she fully understands the concept of
death. Frustrated and frightened, she yells at Mei, then stomps away.
Mei, believing that her mother can be cured by healthy food, sets off on
foot to the hospital with an ear of corn.
Her disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her; eventually Satsuki returns in desperation to the
Camphor tree
and pleads for Totoro's help. Delighted to be of assistance, he summons
the Catbus, which carries her to where the confused Mei sits. Having
rescued her, the Catbus then whisks her and Satsuki over the countryside
to see their mother in the hospital. The girls perch in a tree outside
of the hospital, overhearing a conversation between their parents and
discovering that she has been kept in hospital by a minor cold and is
otherwise doing well. They secretly leave the ear of corn on the
windowsill, where it is discovered by the parents, and return home on
the Catbus. When the Catbus departs, it fades away from the girls'
sight.
The closing credits show Mei and Satsuki's mother returning home and
feature scenes of Satsuki and Mei playing with other children, with
Totoro and his friends as unseen observers.

Production
The
art director
was
Kazuo Oga , who was drawn to the film when Hayao Miyazaki showed him an original image of Totoro standing in a
satoyama . The director challenged Oga to raise his standards, and Oga's experience with
My Neighbor Totoro
jump-started the artist's career. Oga and Miyazaki debated the palette of the film, Oga seeking to paint black soil from
Akita Prefecture
and Miyazaki preferring the color of red soil from the
Kantō region . The ultimate product was described by
Studio Ghibli
producer Toshio Suzuki: "It was nature painted with translucent colors." [ 4 ]
Oga described his approach to painting background art: "I appreciate
my role and I draw with the feeling that if I don't make a good effort, I
will be somehow punished." Oga's conscientious approach to
My Neighbor Totoro
was a style that the
International Herald Tribune
recognized as "[updating] the traditional Japanese animist sense of a
natural world that is fully, spiritually alive". The newspaper described
the final product, "Set in a period that is both modern and nostalgic,
the film creates a fantastic, yet strangely believable universe of
supernatural creatures coexisting with modernity. A great part of this
sense comes from Oga's evocative backgrounds, which give each tree,
hedge and twist in the road an indefinable feeling of warmth that seems
ready to spring into sentient life." Oga's work on
My Neighbor Totoro
led to his continued involvement with Studio Ghibli. The studio
assigned jobs to Oga that would play to his strengths, and Oga's style
became a trademark style of Studio Ghibli. [ 5 ]
Release
After writing and filming
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind
(1984) and
Castle in the Sky
(1986), Hayao Miyazaki began directing
My Neighbor Totoro
for
Studio Ghibli . Miyazaki's production paralleled his colleague
Isao Takahata 's production of
Grave of the Fireflies . Miyazaki's film was financed by executive producer Yasuyoshi Tokuma, and both
My Neighbor Totoro
and
Grave of the Fireflies
were released on the same bill in 1988. The dual billing was considered
"one of the most moving and remarkable double bills ever offered to a
cinema audience". [ 6 ]
In 1993,
Tokuma Japan Communications ' US subsidiary released the first English-language version of
My Neighbor Totoro , with the title
My Friend Totoro . It was produced by
John Daly
and Derek Gibson, with co-producer
Jerry Beck , and was available on
VHS
and
laserdisc . This was the only United States home video release of the film from Tokuma ( 20th Century Fox
would release all upcoming English-language releases of the film until
Fox and Troma's rights to the film expired in 2004). Disney's
English-language version premiered on October 23, 2005; it then appeared
at the 2005 Hollywood Film Festival. The
Turner Classic Movies
cable television network held the television premiere of Disney's new
English dub on January 19, 2006, as part of the network's salute to
Hayao Miyazaki. (TCM aired the dub as well as the original Japanese with
English subtitles.) The Disney version was initially released on DVD on
March 7, 2006, but is now out of print. A reissue of
Totoro ,
Castle in the Sky , and
Kiki's Delivery Service
featuring updated cover art highlighting its Studio Ghibli origins was
released on March 2, 2010, coinciding with the US DVD and Blu-Ray debut
of
Ponyo .
As is the case with Disney's other English dubs of Miyazaki films, the Disney version of
Totoro
features a star-heavy cast, including
Dakota
and
Elle Fanning
as Satsuki and Mei,
Timothy Daly
as Mr. Kusakabe,
Pat Carroll
as Granny,
Lea Salonga
as Mrs. Kusakabe, and
Frank Welker
as Totoro and
Catbus . The songs for the new dub retained the same translation as the previous dub, but were sung by
Sonya Isaacs .
Critical reception
Rotten Tomatoes
reported that 89% of critics gave the film positive write-ups, based upon a sample of 28, with an
average
score of 8.1/10. [ 7 ]
Film critic
Roger Ebert
of the
Chicago Sun-Times
identified
My Neighbor Totoro
as one of his "Great Movies", calling it "one of the lovingly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki". Ebert reviewed the film, " My Neighbor Totoro
is based on experience, situation and exploration—not on conflict and
threat," and described its appeal: "...it would never have won its
worldwide audience just because of its warm heart. It is also rich with
human comedy in the way it observes the two remarkably convincing,
lifelike little girls... It is a little sad, a little scary, a little
surprising and a little informative, just like life itself. It depends
on a situation instead of a plot, and suggests that the wonder of life
and the resources of imagination supply all the adventure you need." [ 8 ]
Leonard Klady of the entertainment trade newspaper
Variety
wrote that
My Neighbor Totoro
demonstrated "adequate television technical craft" that was
characterized by "muted pastels, homogenized pictorial style and [a]
vapid storyline". Klady described the film's environment, "Obviously
aimed at an international audience, the film evinces a disorienting
combination of cultures that produces a nowhere land more confused than
fascinating." [ 9 ]
Stephen Holden of
The New York Times
described
My Neighbor Totoro
as "very visually handsome", and believed that the film was "very
charming" when "dispensing enchantment". Despite the highlights, Holden
wrote, "Too much of the film, however, is taken up with stiff,
mechanical chitchat." [ 10 ]
Matthew Leyland of
Sight & Sound
reviewed the DVD released in 2006, "Miyazaki's family fable is
remarkably light on tension, conflict and plot twists, yet it beguiles
from beginning to end... what sticks with the viewer is the every-kid
credibility of the girls' actions as they work, play and settle into
their new surroundings." Leyland praised the DVD transfer of the film,
but noted that the disc lacked a look at the film's production, instead
being overabundant with storyboards. [ 11 ]
Ranked #41 in
Empire
magazines "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema" in 2010. [ 12 ]
Cultural impact
Totoro as seen in
Toy Story 3 .
My Neighbor Totoro
helped bring Japanese animation into the
global spotlight, and set its writer-director Hayao Miyazaki on the road
to success. The film's central character, Totoro, is as famous among
Japanese children as
Winnie-the-Pooh
is among British ones. [ 13 ]
The Independent
recognized Totoro as one of the greatest cartoon characters, describing
the creature, "At once innocent and awe-inspiring, King Totoro captures
the innocence and magic of childhood more than any of Miyazaki's other
magical creations." [ 14 ]
The
Financial Times
recognized the character's appeal, "[Totoro] is more genuinely loved than
Mickey Mouse
could hope to be in his wildest—not nearly so beautifully illustrated—fantasies." [ 13 ]
The environmental journal
Ambio
described the influence of
My Neighbor Totoro , "[It] has served as a powerful force to focus the positive feelings that the Japanese people have for
satoyama
and traditional village life." The film's central character Totoro was
used as a mascot by the Japanese "Totoro Hometown Fund Campaign" to
preserve areas of satoyama in the
Saitama Prefecture . [ 15 ]
The fund, started in 1990 after the film's release, held an auction in
August 2008 at Pixar Animation Studios to sell over 210 original
paintings, illustrations, and sculptures inspired by
My Neighbor Totoro . [ 16 ]
A main-belt asteroid was named
10160 Totoro
after the film's central character Totoro. [ 17 ]
Totoro has made cameo appearances in multiple Studio Ghibli films, including
Pom Poko ,
Kiki's Delivery Service , and
Whisper of the Heart . Additionally, various other anime series and films have featured cameos, including one episode of the
Gainax
TV series
His and Her Circumstances ; director
Hideaki Anno
worked as a key animator on
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind
in 1984 and considers Miyazaki a mentor. [ 18 ] [ 19 ]
Totoro has also had cameo appearances in various non-Japanese works, including on
Comedy Central 's
Drawn Together
and in the " Imaginationland " episodes of
South Park
as a background character, in
Neil Gaiman 's
The Sandman: Brief Lives
in which
Delirium
blows bubbles into a number of impossible shapes, including a Totoro
holding an umbrella. Miyazaki also uses Totoro as a part of his Studio
Ghibli company logo. Volume 9 of the
Gin Tama
manga has a spoof of the film entitled "My Neighbor Pedro". Also, the episode of
Samurai Jack
entitled "Jack and the Creature" pays homage to this film. A Totoro plush makes an appearance in
Pixar 's
Toy Story 3 .
Media
Books
A four-volume series of
ani-manga
books, which use color images and lines directly from the film, were published in Japan in May 1988 by
Tokuma . [ 20 ] [ 21 ]
The series was licensed for English language release in North America by
Viz Media , which released the books from November 10, 2004 through February 15, 2005. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]
A 112-picture book based on the film and aimed at younger readers was released by Viz on November 8, 2005. [ 24 ]
On the same day, Viz released a 176 page art book containing conceptual
art from the film and interviews with the production staff. [ 25 ]
Anime short
Mei and the Kittenbus
( めいとこねこバス ,
Mei to Konekobasu ? )
is a thirteen minute sequel to
My Neighbor Totoro , written and directed by Miyazaki. [ 26 ]
Chika Sakamoto , who voiced Mei in
Totoro ,
returned to voice Mei in this short. Hayao Miyazaki himself did the
voice of the Neko Ba-chan as well as Totoro. It concentrates on the
character of Mei Kusakabe from the original film and her adventures one
night with the Kittenbus (offspring of the
Catbus
from the film) and other cat-oriented vehicles.
Originally released in Japan in 2003, the short is regularly shown at the
Ghibli Museum , [ 27 ]
but has not been released to home video. It was shown briefly in the
United States in 2006 to honor the North American release of fellow
Miyazaki film
Spirited Away [ 28 ]
and at a
Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation
fundraiser a few days later. [ 29 ]
Soundtrack
The
Tonari no Totoro
Soundtrack was originally released in Japan on May 1, 1988 by
Tokuma Shoten . The CD primarily features the musical score used in the film composed by
Joe Hisaishi , except for five vocal pieces performed by
Azumi Inoue . [ 30 ]
It has since been re-released twice, once on November 21, 1996 and again on August 25, 2004.
