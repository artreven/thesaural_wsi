Killing is a natural function.
I would easily kill you to save my life.
But yeah killing randomly is definitely wrong.

A leader deciding to overturn the ruling of the people is wrong.

There is a lot of controversy over the lethal injection method they had planned to use. Given the cost of the drugs, they could just lock him up with a pound of heroin and a bottle of jack....
Behind execution of Gary Haugen, controversy swirls around the drugs used and who administers them | OregonLive.com
Oregon, preparing to execute convicted murderer Gary Haugen on Dec. 6, uses this three-drug lethal injection, as do nearly all of the 34 death penalty states. But the killing method remains controversial. Critics say poor understanding of the drugs' effects and executioners' lack of medical training has led to botched cases and a likelihood of extreme suffering in some instances.
"A firing squad probably causes less pain and suffering," says Dr. Jonathan Groner, a pediatric surgeon in Columbus, Ohio, and outspoken critic of medicalized executions. "Lethal injection looks like outpatient surgery, so people are willing to allow it."

I think if you're going to execute someone, at least make a show of it.

Scaphism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The intended victim was stripped naked and then firmly fastened within a face-to-face pair of narrow rowing boats (or hollowed-out tree trunks), with the head, hands and feet protruding. The condemned was forced to ingest milk and honey to the point of developing severe
diarrhea , and more honey would be rubbed on his body to attract
insects
to the exposed appendages. He would then be left to float on a stagnant pond or be exposed to the sun. The defenseless individual's
feces
accumulated within the container, attracting more insects, which would eat and breed within his exposed flesh, which—pursuant to interruption of the blood supply by burrowing insects—became increasingly
gangrenous . The feeding would be repeated each day in some cases to prolong the torture, so that dehydration or starvation did not kill him. Death, when it eventually occurred, was probably due to a combination of
dehydration ,
starvation
and
septic shock .
Delirium
would typically set in after a few days. In other recorded versions, the insects did not eat the person; biting and
stinging
insects such as
wasps , which were attracted by honey on the body, acted as the torture. Death by scaphism was painful, humiliating and protracted.
Plutarch
writes in his biography of
Artaxerxes
that
Mithridates , sentenced to die in this manner for killing
Cyrus the Younger , survived 17 days before dying. [2]

I used to support the death penalty wholeheartedly then I realized how fucked up our legal system is.

Killing is human, we wouldn't be on top of the food chain if we had it any other way. Personally I really had wish the Government could have telecast prison gladiator events with gambling, it be a sure fire way to boost up the economy.

Actually, a lot of anthropologists and evolutionary biologists say that humans are dominant on the food chain because of our efficiancy in hunting in groups and our advanced cognitive skills; There are still some hunter-gather tribes who can easily identify an animal, just by looking at the surroundings and studying days-old tracks. Not to mention, there are plenty of animals more vicious than
Homo Sapiens Sapiense
that aren't even on our level of dominance.

Our fascination in new ways to kill not only each other but other creatures are why we have survived so long. To Kill is only human.

And they go to war. It's creepy
