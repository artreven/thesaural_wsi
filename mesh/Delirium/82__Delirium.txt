Nervous system side effects have frequently included
insomnia
(26%),
dystonia
(18%),
akathisia
(16%),
extrapyramidal symptoms
(17%),
headache
(14%),
dizziness
(11%),
parkinsonism
(6%),
asthenia
(4%),
somnolence
(3%), and
hypoesthesia
(2%).
Increased dream activity ,
nervousness ,
impaired concentration ,
increased sleep
duration,
dysarthria ,
vertigo ,
stupor ,
paraesthesia ,
confusion , and
amnesia
have also been reported.
Delirium ,
withdrawal syndrome ,
yawning ,
aphasia , cholinergic syndrome,
hypoesthesia ,
tongue paralysis ,
leg cramps ,
torticollis ,
hypotonia ,
coma ,
migraine ,
hyperreflexia ,
choreoathetosis ,
seizures ,
neuroleptic malignant syndrome ,
tardive dyskinesia , and sleep- related eating disorder (SRED) have been reported rarely. Extrapyramidal symptoms
may be less frequently associated with risperidone than most other available antipsychotics.
Treatment of
extrapyramidal effects , in addition to general supportive measures, may include judicious use of one or more of the following: benztropine, trihexyphenidyl, biperiden, or diphenhydramine.
Sedation
may occur, particularly at higher doses.
Blurred vision ,
vertigo ,
impaired concentration ,
increased appetite
and
decreased appetite
have also been reported.
At least three cases of
tardive dyskinesia
have also been reported with risperidone use with one case accompanied by risperidone induced
parkinsonism .
Tardive dyskinesia
involves involuntary,
dyskinetic, repetitive movements .
Tardive dyskinesia may be irreversible and is related to both the duration of therapy and the total amount of drug consumed.
Frequent discontinuation and resumption of therapy may predispose patients to the development of
tardive dyskinesia .
At least fourteen cases of
neuroleptic malignant syndrome
have been reported with risperidone use.
Fever,
altered consciousness ,
autonomic dysfunction
and
muscle rigidity
are the hallmarks of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
The neuroleptic malignant syndrome is associated with a case fatality rate of about 20%.
Immediate discontinuation of neuroleptic therapy, consideration of dantrolene administration as well as intensive monitoring and supportive care are indicated.
Nine of the 13 cases reported were between 15 and 43 years old.
One of the cases had a delayed onset and another case resulted in death.
One study has reported that in patients who were given risperidone, there was a positive correlation between improvement in psychopathology and improvement in cognitive test of explicit memory and alertness.
