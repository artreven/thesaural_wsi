It fits, and no one cares about the size of your boobs except morons and catty girls.

You would look excellent as Faye, but you might want to cut your hair, hers is probably half as much as yours is now.
EDIT: Two more thoughts are Revy from Black Lagoon

and Misato from Eva.

FASHION ZOMBIES!
SUPER RAD!
POOL PART!
Anytime I have to go to any Con and it's with people who dress up, I throw on my 'bats gear. It's a really easy costume to make. They're also a reference within a reference so you'll get a lot of geek points. You may notice that all the members of the band are men, lot's of women rock the costume too, and it's considered the coolest.
The Aquabats! are a California based New Wave band that dress as their own version of japanese sentai super heroes and fight evil villains in a saturday morning style during their concerts, and have a ridiculously dedicated fanbase known as, "The Aquabats! Cadet Faction!!"or, "The Aquabats! Flan Club!!"
Seriously, this costume will get you TONS of high fives, it could even be considered that any room you'd be in would be considered,
high five city .
Spoiler:
Your sig is too tall.

I'm thinking that Alyx Vance from the Half-Life series could work.
It would involve a haircut, but it's a simple costume so it won't take much time, and she's a kick-ass character.
The only problem would be...how can I put this politely...Alyx is all about the butt, and the pictures you included don't tell us much in that regard.
This isn't a pathetic request to see your rear, but it's something you should think about.

Jill Valentine from Resident Evil. You get to choose between full coverage and not if you feel uncomfortable showing cleavage and gams at a con, too, since she was wearing her S.T.A.R.S. outfit in 1 and her streetclothes in 3.

Go as Bridget, I've always wanted to see a man dressed as a woman played by a woman, though this may in fact cause a space-time rip or some such science thing.

I'd recomend either
Death
or
Delirium
from Neil Gaimon's The Sandman chronicles.
Death is a bit Gothish, so if you don't feel like Goth, it'd be a bad choice, but Delirium could be a lot of fun.
And you wouldn't necessarily have to shave half your head like the picture on Wiki, I'm fairly certain she has quite a few hair styles throught the series, ONE of which has to be a full head of hair.
Do you, in fact, have any builds in this shop at all? 0

Death is a bit on the shorter side, thought I doubt many people would care.
You could pull off a good Desire (not to say you look androgynous or anything :-P ), but again that would be a haircut.

These are all pretty rad ideas! Thank you!
I'll be costume shopping this weekend and will hopefully come across some useful costume clothing.
More ideas are definitely welcomed!

Jenius.
Miriya Jenius.
And Max Jenius.
The difference is important because one pair persist beyond the original Macross.
Max becomes an admiral and Miriya a mayor.
Who still insists on flying periodically.

mc mystery, do you just go around H/A threads waiting until any sort of moment to mention the aquabats appears?
i swear to god it's your solution to everything
"bleeding profusely from your ears?" ...
AQUABATS
to the OP: just go in normal clothing, and tell people your costume is
invisible . mad props for creativity!

If you don't wanna cut your hair, I think Alex Vance (HL2) would work.
She had her hair pinned up, so you're good there.
Not sure if it'd be an easily recognizable costume, though.
If you want easily recognizable, but probably cliche'd, you could probably pull off Lara Croft.
If I were you, though, I'd try and find something (anything) else.

I was referring to Robotech which has a improved storyline over the original Macross

"Less Miriya" is an improvement to you?

I've been waiting for someone to notice. In addition, I feel that if someone WAS bleeding from their ears, The Aquabats! would cure it.

I'm a cosplayer myself, here is the best advice I have to the "who should I cosplay" question:
1) Pick a character that you really, really like.
2) Cosplay that.
3) Have fun.
Rule #1 of cosplay is "Thou shalt cosplay a character unsuited to your body type." Your height should never be an issue because of Rule #1. Hair should also never be an issue, since wigs come in all kinds of lengths, styles, and colors.
Given the short time frame, I would suggest something that can be put together quickly, like Faye Valentine or various Bleach characters. If you are concerned about your figure, you could crossplay (dressing as a male character). That opens up options like Inu-Yasha, L, or Wolf's Rain.
Also, if you are looking for someone that makes costumes, I sew professionally.

On the subject of death and daemons disappearing: arrows sure are effective in Lyra's universe. Seems like if you get shot once, you're dead - no lingering deaths with your daemon huddling pitifully in your arms, just *thunk* *argh* *whoosh*. A battlefield full of the dying would just be so much more depressing when you add in wailing gerbils and dogs.

Get off my plane.
The plane also transforms into a robot.
Anyway, tangent aside, everything Tigress says seems good. I'm not much of a cosplayer myself, but I do know a few and that's generally common and sound advice.
As for all the Chell suggestions earlier...you may not want to do something everyone else and their mom's going to do, and Portal cosplay is about a dime a dozen these days.
