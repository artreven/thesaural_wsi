The FDA has informed healthcare professionals that the agency has analyzed reports of suicidality (suicidal behavior or ideation) from placebo controlled clinical studies of eleven drugs used to treat epilepsy as well as psychiatric disorders, and other conditions.
In the FDA's analysis, patients receiving antiepileptic drugs had approximately twice the risk of suicidal behavior or ideation (0.43%) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.22%).
The increased risk of suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation was observed as early as one week after starting the antiepileptic drug and continued through 24 weeks.
The results were generally consistent among the eleven drugs.
The relative risk for suicidality was higher in patients with epilepsy compared to patients who were given one of the drugs in the class for psychiatric or other conditions.
Although this antiepileptic drug was not one of those specifically included in the analysis, the FDA expects that an increased risk of suicidality is shared by all antiepileptic drugs and anticipates that class labeling changes will be applied broadly.
Healthcare professionals should closely monitor all patients currently taking or starting any antiepileptic drug for notable changes in behavior that could indicate the emergence or worsening of suicidal thoughts or behavior or depression.
Clinical studies of lorazepam generally were not adequate to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently than younger subjects.
However, the incidence of
sedation
and
unsteadiness
has been reported to increase with age.
Blurred vision
Ativan
(lorazepam)
may cause
blurred vision . This drug may also cause the following symptoms that are
related
to
blurred vision: Drug withdrawal symptoms . Especially if drug is stopped or dose is lowered too quickly Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma

Use of benzodiazepines including lorazepam may lead to physical and
psychological dependence .
Lorazepam should not be discontinued abruptly in patients who have received the medication for long periods.
Abrupt discontinuation may
result in
symptoms
of
withdrawal .
Acute
worsening of narrow angle glaucoma
is possible with lorazepam therapy.
Lorazepam is contraindicated in this setting.
Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an
allergic reaction :
hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
Tell your caregivers at once if you have any of these serious side effects:
weak or
shallow breathing ;
seizure (convulsions );
hyperactivity ,
agitation ,
hostility ;
hallucinations ;
unusual thoughts or behavior; or
feeling like you might
pass out .
Less serious side effects may include:
drowsiness ,
dizziness ;

This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Tell your doctor about any unusual or bothersome side effect.

Healthcare professionals should closely monitor all patients currently taking or starting any antiepileptic drug for notable changes in behavior that could indicate the emergence or worsening of
suicidal thoughts
or behavior or
depression .
Lorazepam may
impair
the
mental
abilities necessary for potentially hazardous tasks such as
driving
or operating machinery.
Pediatric patients may exhibit sensitivity to benzyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and propylene glycol, components of lorazepam injection.
The "gasping syndrome", characterized by
central nervous system depression ,
metabolic acidosis , gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine, has been associated with the administration of intravenous solutions containing the preservative benzyl alcohol in neonates.
Additional symptoms may include gradual
neurological
deterioration,
seizures ,
intracranial
hemorrhage ,
hematologic
abnormalities , skin breakdown,
hepatic and renal failure ,
hypotension , bradycardia, and
cardiovascular collapse .
Central nervous system toxicity
(including
seizures
and intraventricular
hemorrhage , as well as unresponsiveness,
tachypnea ,
tachycardia , and
diaphoresis ) has been associated with propylene glycol toxicity.
Although normal therapeutic doses of lorazepam injection contain very small amounts of these compounds, premature and low-birth-weight infants as well as pediatric patients receiving high doses may be more susceptible to their effects.
Delirium
appears to be significantly associated with postoperative exposure to benzodiazepines.
It has been recommended that clinicians caring for patients at risk for
delirium
carefully evaluate the need for benzodiazepines in the postoperative period and consider alternative therapies whenever possible.
Other
side effects have included withdrawal symptoms
after abrupt cessation of lorazepam.
Withdrawal symptoms
have included
agitation ,
restlessness ,
anxiety ,
insomnia ,
convulsions ,
tremor , abdominal cramps,
vomiting , and
sweating .
Mania
and
delusional
depression
have also been observed rarely. Nervous system side effects have been common and have included
drowsiness ,
fatigue ,
confusion ,
impaired
cognition , daytime
anxiety ,
asthenia ,
amnesia ,
headache ,
dizziness , and
ataxia .
Orofacial dyskinesias
have been observed rarely.
