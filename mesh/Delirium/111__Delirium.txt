Other side effects occurring upon discontinuation of citalopram have been reported, particularly when the discontinuation has been abrupt.

mood ,
irritability ,
agitation ,
dizziness ,
sensory
disturbances
including unfavorable smell,
anxiety ,
confusion ,
headache ,
lethargy ,
emotional lability ,
insomnia , and

(up to 15%),

(4%),

(2%), and

emotional lability ,
panic reaction , and
psychosis
have been reported infrequently.
Catatonic
reaction,
withdrawal syndrome
and
melancholia
have been reported rarely.
Delirium
has been reported to be temporally associated with citalopram treatment. The development of a potentially life-threatening
serotonin syndrome
or
neuroleptic malignant syndrome
(NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, including citalopram, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists.
Serotonin syndrome
symptoms may include
mental status changes
(e.g.,
agitation ,
hallucinations ,
coma ),
autonomic instability
(e.g.,
tachycardia , labile blood pressure,
hyperthermia ),
neuromuscular aberrations
(e.g.,
hyperreflexia ,
incoordination ) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g.,
nausea ,
vomiting ,
diarrhea ).
Serotonin syndrome , in its most severe form can resemble
neuroleptic malignant syndrome , which includes
hyperthermia ,
muscle rigidity ,
autonomic instability
with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and
mental status changes .
Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms.
Worsening of depression
and/or increased
suicidal thinking
or behavior may always be a possibility in patients treated with antidepressant medications, particularly those being treated for depression.
Anxiety ,
agitation ,
panic attacks ,
insomnia ,
irritability ,
hostility , impulsivity,
akathisia
(severe
restlessness ),
hypomania , and
mania
have been reported in patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric.
It is unknown if these symptoms are a precursor to either worsening of depression or the emergence of suicidal impulses; however, there is concern that patients who experience one or more of these symptoms may be at increased risk for worsening
depression
or
suicidality .
Although the FDA has not concluded that antidepressant drugs cause worsening depression or suicidality, health care providers should be aware that worsening of symptoms could be due to the underlying disease or might be a result of drug therapy.
Adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of citalopram have been reported, particularly when the discontinuation has been abrupt.
These adverse events have included
dysphoric
mood ,
irritability ,
agitation ,
dizziness ,
sensory
disturbances ,
anxiety ,
confusion ,
headache ,
lethargy ,
emotional lability ,
insomnia , and
hypomania .
Theses events are generally self-limiting.
However, there have been reports of
serious discontinuation symptoms .
Patients should be monitored for withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing treatment with citalopram.
Gradual reduction of the dose is recommended whenever possible.
If intolerable symptoms occur due to a decrease in dosage or discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be appropriate.
This may be followed by a more gradual reduction in dosage.
A
heart rate
decrease
of 1.7 beats/minute was shown in ECG tests compared to no change in patients receiving placebo.
General side effects including
fatigue
(5% to 6%),
fever
(2%), and
asthenia
(1%) have been reported.

has been reported to be temporally associated with the use of citalopram.

has been reported in two patients who were concomitantly receiving linezolid (a reversible nonselective MAOI). Nervous system side effects including

(26%),
dry mouth
(20%),
increased sweating
(11%),
tremor
(8%),
dizziness
(2%), and
sleep abnormalities
have been reported.
