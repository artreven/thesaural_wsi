Knitting
Ravelry made me do this: Pattern: wham bam thank you lamb! neckwarmer Started August 7 and finished August 8, right before I went on vacation. Contains several meters of various leftovers, including handspun, Colinette Firecracker and who knows what else. Knitted on 8mm needles.
While I'm not really waiting for winter there are moments where I wish I could start wearing my vast assortment of hats and cowls and scarves. The scarf I was wearing today was knitted out of some wonderfully silk yarn from Lana Grossa. I only had something like three balls in total and it morphed into this little piece. A perfect public transport project.

Honey, I'm home!
Back after two weeks in Edinburgh, back from two weeks of clouds with rain and sun. Back from two weeks of tea and peas Back from two weeks of being on the Edge of the Fringe: (Amanda Palmer at HMV Picture House, during her entree. Shot in darkness and with no flash. Sums up the experience nicely :-)) (Group of musicians at Grassmarket. We liked them!) (Ensemble of Doctor Faustus)
(Female half with Lilly, from the
Lilly through the dark ensemble . It's a story about a little girl loosing her beloved father and trying to bring him back from death. When the last words were spoken I wasn't the only one in the audience crying. It's breathtaking and stunningly wonderful.) Two weeks of books (Neil Gaiman at one of two events he held at the Book Festival. I'm a fan girl...) And two weeks of inspirations I bought yarn (and hell, did I buy yarn) and knitted up a storm. I bought beads and within 15 minutes I had a new necklace. I ventured through many charity shops. I got interviewed by the Edinburgh City Council. I bought far too many books and had to re-pack our luggage to distribute them evenly. I discovered a bookshop called
Elvis Shakespeare
and had the idea of opening a shop next to it called William Presley :-) Had fudge and macroons. Partial on the first, in love with the latter :-) Can't see peas or sweetcorn for the rest of the year or I scream ;-) Had to leave a very broken pair of Doc Martens in Edinburgh after the sole and half of the shoe ripped open on the last day :-( Had fun! In fact, got so inspire and relaxed that I went and got my hair cut and coloured a vivid magenta today. On my way to a
Delirium
inspired punkish flapper do :-) And now - believe it or not - back to tea and knitting. I only have to face the grinding mill on Monday, so I kick back with music, art, crafts and movies until then. And cuddle two cats to heaven...they were lovingly looked after by my parents, who spent their vacation at our place and had wonderful weather and a ver good time!

Castlefest 2009 - aftermath
Dusty and bloody fantastic! I find myself more and more drawn towards anything medieaval, celtic, nordic, scottish and so we actually spend most of our time around the stalls and vendors of that kind.
Talking to a potter at length about clay,
talking and learning about herbs and teas to a lady selling the most delicious Lammas liqour (and sweets for the husband)... Hubby tried his hands at tin pouring and made his own Thor's hammer pendant. Though his craftiness was nothing compared to these gentlemen: Or even these ;-) One of my personal favourites: And then there was music. Especially Valravn, a band I had already seen at Castlefest 2008, when it started to pour down as soon as their set kicked off. This time we had - yes, of course - one very brief splash of rather welcome rain and other than this they kicked the proverbial rear end and we kicked dust: I haven't felt so alive in weeks! We bumped into two friends and their daughter we hadn't seen in ages, we feasted on roasted champignons and potatoes and fresh fruit, we went on an almost impossible quest for coffee (water, yes, beer, yes, coffee...difficult) and we learned the fine art of torture. And tomorrow it's back into the dungeons...with a head and heart full of music :-) Statt upp og dansa!
