Preludes & Nocturnes [ edit ]
Collects issues #1-8
Have you ever had one of those days when something just seems to be trying to tell you somebody?
It is
time
for me to walk the abyss. Time to reclaim my own. I must talk to
the Morningstar . I do not have high
hopes
for the meeting.
Never trust a demon. He has a hundred motives for anything he does … ninety-nine of them, at least, are malevolent.
I will be a
wise
and
tolerant
monarch , dispensing
justice
fairly , and only setting nightmares to rip out the
minds
of the
evil
and wicked. Or just anybody I don't like.
" But where shall
wisdom
be found? And where is the place of
understanding ?
Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living … for the price of wisdom is above rubies."

I find myself wondering about humanity. Their attitude to my sister's gift is so strange. Why do they fear the sunless lands? It is as natural to die as it is to be born. But they fear her. Dread her. Feebly they attempt to placate her. They do not love her.

There is another version of the tale…
Her kind walk amidst the flotsam of lives they have sacrificed, for their own purposes, till friendless and alone they needs must make the final sacrifice.
Do you know what
Freud
said about dreams of flying?
Life as a human contains substance I never dreamed of in
the Dreaming , Lord.
There is another version of the tale. That is the tale the women tell each other, in their private language that the men-children are not taught, and that the old men are too wise to learn.
And in that version of the tale perhaps things happened differently.
But then, that is a women's tale, and it is never told to men.

#16: "Lost Hearts"
If my dream was true, then everything we know, everything we think we know is a lie.
It means the world's about as solid and as reliable as a layer of scum on the top of a well of black water which goes down forever, and there are things in the depths that I don't even want to think about. It means that we're just dolls. We don't have a clue what's really going down, we just kid ourselves that we're in control of our lives while a paper's thickness away things that would drive us mad if we thought about them for too long play with us, and move us around from room to room, and put us away at night when they're tired, or bored.

Human beings are the creatures of desire.

Desire is everything you have ever wanted. Whoever you are. Whatever you are.
Everything .

Where others ask timorously, Thessalian, your kind commanded, directed, ordered. It galled us. But the others are dust now, and less than dust. And one day you, in your turn, will join them. And then our compact will be over, and you will be ours, as they are.

I was one of seventeen children. We were all named Wilkinson — I suppose it was roughest on the girls, but we all got used to it in the end. I blame the parents, really. … It was just when they found a name they liked, they stuck with it.

It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses. You build up this whole armor, for years, so nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life… You give them a piece of you. They don't ask for it. They do something dumb one day like kiss you, or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so a simple phrase like "maybe we should just be friends" or "how very perceptive" turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a body-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. Nothing should be able to do that. Especially not love. I hate love.

Sandman
#65: "The Kindly Ones: 9"
The thing you ought to remember about ravens, is that we belong equally to both genders. You don't see that every day. But we're as likely to be
the Morrigan 's as
Odin 's, as likely to be
Eve 's as
Dream 's.
Noah's raven, in
Sandman
#65: "The Kindly Ones: 9"
Listen, an eye's just an eye. A few more days, and he'll be something not even a raven would eat.
Over to the ants …

It was like a bad TV show. "He's a reincarnated serial killer — his partner's a bird. They're cops."

A
Puck
is harder by far to hurt than some little lord of malice from the lands of ice and snow. We Pucks are old and hard and wild …
Robin Goodfellow, in
Sandman
#66: "The Kindly Ones: 10"
I am the Puck, called Robin Goodfellow. I am a trickster, an antic prankster, a will o' the wisp. "Things fall apart, the centre cannot hold, mere
anarchy
is loose upon the world." That's me.
Robin Goodfellow, quoting lines from " The Second Coming " by
W. B. Yeats

Sandman

I bind you,
Loki
Sky Walker, malice-monger. I bind you with the guts of
Narvi , your son. I bind you with frost and with fire, and with the weight of the world.
Odin , in

You guys're an elite corps.
khoff
They say I'm hard, and I am hard. They say I am a bastard, and I'll tell you what, I am a bastard. A hard, tough bastard. A tough, hard bastard with a pumpkin for a head. But that doesn't mean I can't be proud'a you dumb lugs. And I am proud of you. All'a you — Wycziezbsky, O'Brien, McTavish, Silverstein, Pucci, and the little Norwegian. While some guys have skedaddled, and others have bolted into the castle, we're the Joe's that have faced the facts. And the facts are this. Is this. Are … whatever.

Me? Lady, I'm your worst nightmare — a pumpkin with a gun.

Gods fear us. Demons fear us. We have hounded kings and angels. We have taken vengeance on worlds and universes. We are the Kindly Ones. We are the

Yeah? Well, eumenides this!

"How … how dare you let that happen, Lord? How dare you?"
"You will not speak to me like that, Lucien."
" I doubt I'll be alive tomorrow, Lord. On that basis I find it particularly easy to say exactly what I think. "

No miracles. No magic. No dreams. Just pain and death and Visa slips.
Rose Walker, in

This will be felt across worlds and days as a reality storm; and, as it plays its course, conflicting realities will fall and spin and shatter across time and existence.

A customer at Lux's, drunk and flirtatious, peeks beneath
Mazikeen 's half-mask.
He satisfies his curiosity, as he loses, one after the other, his drink, his lunch, and his sanity.
Mazikeen has no patience with men.

Alianora foretold that I would receive my scars in my turn, like the one I left on her cheek, like the one I left on her heart. She knew it then.
Dream, in
Sandman
#67: "The Kindly Ones: 11"
If you don't let me in, I will turn you into a demon half-face waitress night-club lady with a crush on her boss, and I'll make it so you've been that from the beginning of time to now and you'll never ever know if you were anything else and it will itch inside your head worse than little bugses.
Delirium confronts Mazikeen, in

"Sorry, sweetheart. I don't do funerals. Life is, as they say, too short. And I can't wear black. I'm an autumn."

"You're crying."
"Lord Shaper is in dire need, and he doesn't love me."
"Would it be better if he was in dire need, and did love you?"
Cluracan and Nuala, in
Sandman
#69: "The Kindly Ones: 13"
The poison spills into Loki's mouth and eyes; he writhes, and a city falls: and in the moment of pain he gains a certain clarity.
The master manipulator realizes how, ultimately — how strangely, how elegantly — he too had been manipulated.
Perhaps the sound he makes is laughter.
Sandman
#69: "The Kindly Ones: 13"
I had the hubris originally to regard myself as a collaborator, as a co-author.
Very rapidly I found myself reduced to the status of character, following something of a disagreement in the fundamental direction of the Creation.
Lucifer, in
Sandman
#69: "The Kindly Ones: 13"
It's the same old story … whatever it turns into on the way, whatever it is you originally undertake to spin or knit or weave, keep it going long enough and, in the end, my lilies, it's always a winding sheet.
Sandman
#69: "The Kindly Ones: 13"
Flowers gathered in the morning
Afternoon they blossom on
Still are withered by the evening
You can be me when I'm gone.

The Wake [ edit ]
There are some powers that no one, not even the Endless, seeks to inquire into too deeply.
The one I hate is where I'm just an actor on a strange television version of my life. Have you ever had that dream?
I regret the conversations we never had, the time we did not spend together. I regret that I never told him that he made me happy, when I was in his company. The world was the better for his being in it. These things alone do I now regret: things left unsaid.
Nobody in England had even heard of the Renaissance until it had been over for centuries…
Omnia mutantur, nihil interit.
Everything changes, but nothing is truly lost.
Only the phoenix arises and does not descend. And everything changes. And nothing is truly lost.
Life is no play. We meet people once, and never see them again.
Collects issues 71 - 75
The family did not send to ask from whom the messenger had come; it was not the first time that messengers had visited them, after all. And there are some powers that no one, not even the Endless, seeks to inquire into too deeply.

The state of his bathroom — I'm not one to gossip, but there are things crusted on his sink that have not simply developed intelligent life but have in all probability by now evolved their own political systems.

#70, "The Wake" part one
Eblis O'Shaughnessy: you were created and gifted by five of the Endless, but you can neither dream nor, ultimately, destroy, and that shall be your triumph and that shall be your tragedy.
Destiny , in
Sandman
#70, part one of "The Wake"
I am not here to mourn him. I mourned the loss of my love a long time ago.
I am here to say goodbye to a stranger who once did me a good turn. And to the man who gave my son the death he craved.
Calliope , in
Sandman
#71, part two of "The Wake"
The bonds of family bind both ways. They bind us up, support us, help us, and they are also a bond from which it is difficult, perhaps impossible to extricate oneself.

"The one I hate is where I'm just an actor on a strange television version of my life.

We were never lovers, and we never will be, now. I do not regret that, however. I regret the conversations we never had, the time we did not spend together.
I regret that I never told him that he made me happy, when I was in his company.
The world was the better for his being in it. These things alone do I now regret: things left unsaid.
And he is gone, and I am old.

I'm not a young man anymore. I'm retired now. But I sometimes think that all the things in my life that have made it worth the living have been as a result of my connection to the dead gentleman.
Wesley Dodds , in
Sandman
#72, part three of "The Wake"
I cared for him, very much. He was so wise; he seemed so certain of the rightness of his actions. And I, who do nothing but doubt, admired that in him.
He was a creature of hope, for dreams are hopes, and echoes of hopes, and I am a creature of despair.
Despair , in
Sandman
#72, part three of "The Wake"
It's astonishing how much trouble one can get oneself into, if one works at it. And astonishing how much trouble one can get oneself out of, if one simply assumes that everything will, somehow or other, work out for the best.
Destruction , in
Sandman
#72, part three of "The Wake"
We never even noticed the Renaissance.
The Renaissance was a load of bloody Italians poncing around claiming to be the golden age of the Greeks come around again.
Nobody in England had even heard of the Renaissance until it had been over for centuries.
Hob Gadling , in
Sandman
#73, "Sunday Mourning"
There were a lot of Moors and Africans in Spain and Italy in the old days. Remember
Othello ? Trust me, if
Catherine of Aragon
had been in Alabama in the 1950s they'd have made her ride in the back of the bus.
Hob Gadling, in
Sandman
#73, "Sunday Mourning"
"When I first met you I thought you were gay."
"Why? 'Cos I'm English?"
"Uh-uh.
Because you seemed to know so many people who were dead. "
" … that's not funny."
"No. It's not, is it?"
Guenevere and Hob, in

#73, "Sunday Mourning"
"Father? I am your son. That is only a kitten. Why do you abandon me to chase after it?"
"When you were alive, you were all my joy. Now you are dead. I see you only in my dreams. And when I awake my pillow is wet with tears.
The kitten is living, and it needs my help ."
Master Li in reply to his son, in
Sandman
#74, "Exiles"
Why are you here, in this home of demons? Are you lost? Or are you also a demon? Forgive my bluntness, but I am an old man, and my flesh is sure to be stringy and lacking in taste: I doubt even a demon would relish it.
Master Li is frightened of Dream, in
Sandman
#74, "Exiles"
I have no liking for prisons, Master Li.
Sometimes I suspect that we build our traps ourselves, then we back into them, pretending amazement the while.
Dream, in
Sandman
#74, "Exiles"
"My Lord, what was it the barbarian said, as the riders vanished?"
" Omnia mutantur, nihil interit.
Everything changes, but nothing is truly lost.
Fare you well, Master Li."
Master Li and Dream, in
Sandman
#74, "Exiles"
But truth or no, still I believe in the correct manner, and correctness in behaviour is one of the cardinal virtues. I place the kitten in my sleeve once more.
I have saved his life, as he saved mine, and am responsible for him. We cannot evade our responsibilities.
Master Li, in
Sandman
#74, "Exiles"
I am banished to the grey waste at the end of the world, but I mourn myself no longer; I cherish the pain in my hand. I imagine the taste of the mulberries in the violet dusk. And tomorrow I shall arrive in the town of Wei.
Master Li, in
Sandman
#74, "Exiles"
Only the phoenix arises and does not descend. And everything changes. And nothing is truly lost.
Sandman
#74, "Exiles"
" My own fine words notwithstanding, life is no play. We meet people once, and never see them again.
There is no shape to events, no point at which we turn to the audience for their praise. No time at which we step behind the stage, to see the actors changing their wigs, and painting their faces, and muttering their lines."
" But that is precisely where you are now, Will. "
William Shakespeare
and Dream, in
Sandman
#75, "The Tempest"
I wanted a tale of graceful ends. I wanted a play about a king who … leaves his kingdom … about a man who turns his back on magic … I am Prince of Stories, Will, but I have no story of my own. Nor shall I ever … I thank you.
Dream to William Shakespeare, in
Sandman
#75, "The Tempest"
Quotes about
The Sandman [ edit ]
Death
is the only major character whose visuals didn't spring from me; that credit goes to
Mike Dringenberg
… he sent me a drawing based on a woman he knew named Cinnamon … and I looked at it and had the immediate reaction of, "Wow. That's really cool."
Looking back, the process of coming up with the Lord of Dreams seems less like an act of creation than one of sculpture: as if he were already waiting, grave and patient, inside a block of white marble, and all I needed to do was chip away everything that wasn't him.
Neil Gaiman , in his afterword in the "Preludes and Nocturnes" Trade Paperback (1991)
Roger Zelazny
died as I completed the first chapter of
The Wake
and his memorial informed the second chapter.
Neil Gaiman , in his Afterword to
The Wake
(1996)
Death
is the only major character whose visuals didn't spring from me; that credit goes to
Mike Dringenberg .
In my original Sandman outline, I suggested Death look like rock star
Nico
in 1968, with the perfect cheekbones and perfect face she has on the cover of her
Chelsea Girl
album.
But Mike Dringenberg had his own ideas, so he sent me a drawing based on a woman he knew named
Cinnamon
— the drawing that was later printed in
Sandman
11 — and I looked at it and had the immediate reaction of, "Wow. That's really cool." Later that day,
Dave McKean
and I went to dinner in
Chelsea
at the My Old Dutch Pancake House and the waitress who served us was a kind of vision. She was American, had long black hair, was dressed entirely in black — black jeans, T-shirt, etc. — and wore a big silver
ankh
on a silver necklace. And she looked exactly like Mike Dringenberg's drawing of Death.
Neil Gaiman , in
The Sandman Companion
(1999)
