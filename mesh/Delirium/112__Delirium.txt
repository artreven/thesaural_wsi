Medical Source Information Yellow
highlights indicate symptoms related to
parkinson-like symptoms . Nervous system side effects are among the most common.
Drowsiness, dizziness,
sedation
and
fatigue
occur commonly.
Delirium ,
tinnitus ,
sleep abnormalities ,
cognitive impairment
(especially in the elderly), a
tardive dyskinesia - like syndrome,
dystonic reactions
and
seizures
have also been reported. Nervous system effects
including
extrapyramidal reactions
such as
opisthotonus ,
trismus ,
torticollis ,
retrocollis ,
aching
and
numbness of the limbs , motor
restlessness , oculogyric crisis,
hyperreflexia ,
dystonia , including
protrusion ,
discoloration ,
aching
and rounding of the
tongue , tonic
spasm
of the
masticatory
muscles,
tight feeling in the throat ,
slurred speech ,
dysphagia ,
akathisia ,
dyskinesia ,
parkinsonism , and
ataxia
have been reported.
Persistent and sometimes irreversible
tardive dyskinesia , cerebral edema,
abnormality
of cerebrospinal fluid proteins,
convulsive
seizures , drowsiness , and headaches have also been reported.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been reported in patients treated with neuroleptic drugs. The incidence and severity of
extrapyramidal reactions
have been reported to increase with an increase in dosage.
Extrapyramidal reactions
have been reported to usually be controllable by concomitant use of an antiparkinsonian drug such as benztropine mesylate and/or by a reduction in dosage.
Risk of developing
tardive dyskinesia
has been reported to be greater in elderly patients on high-dose therapy, especially females.
In some patients, the symptoms are irreversible. Children, adolescents, and young adults (18 to 24 years of age) with major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders may be at an increased risk of suicidal thinking and suicidality with antidepressant use, particularly during the first few months of treatment.
Medical evidence has not shown this increased risk to exist in adults older than 24 years of age, but adults 65 years of age and older taking antidepressants appear to have a decreased risk of suicidality.
The results of a meta-analysis indicate an overall favorable risk-to-benefit profile for the use of antidepressants (i.e., selective serotonin and/or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) in the treatment of pediatric patients (less than 19- years- old) with major depressive disorders (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or non- OCD anxiety disorders.
Although this study also reports an overall increased risk of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt associated with the use of antidepressants in pediatric patients, the risk may be less than originally estimated.
Additional prospective studies are warranted in order to confirm these findings.
Worsening of depression
and/or increased
suicidal thinking
or behavior may always be a possibility in patients treated with antidepressant medications, particularly those being treated for depression.
Anxiety ,
agitation ,
panic attacks ,
insomnia ,
irritability ,
hostility , impulsivity,
akathisia
(severe
restlessness ),
hypomania , and
mania
have been reported in patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric.
It is unknown if these symptoms are a precursor to either worsening of depression or the emergence of suicidal impulses; however, there is concern that patients who experience one or more of these symptoms may be at increased risk for worsening
depression
or
suicidality .
Although the FDA has not concluded that antidepressant drugs cause worsening depression or suicidality, health care providers should be aware that worsening of symptoms could be due to the underlying disease or might be a result of drug therapy.
Tardive dyskinesia
has been reported most frequently in the elderly, especially in elderly females.
The risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that the syndrome will become irreversible have been reported to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose increase.
Therefore, the smallest dose and shortest duration of treatment necessary to produce a satisfactory clinical response is recommended.
For patients receiving long term therapy, it is recommended that the clinician keep in mind the possibility of
liver damage , corneal and lenticular deposits, and irreversible
dyskinesias .
Anticholinergic effects have been reported in more than 50% of patients taking amitriptyline and include dry mouth, blurry vision, constipation and urinary retention.
In one study, anticholinergic and antimuscarinic side effects occurred in 84% of patients. Adverse behavioral effects including paradoxical exacerbation of
psychotic symptoms ,
catatonic -like states,
paranoid
reactions,
lethargy , paradoxical
excitement ,
restlessness ,
hyperactivity ,
nocturnal confusion ,
bizarre dreams , and
insomnia
have been reported. Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an
allergic reaction :
