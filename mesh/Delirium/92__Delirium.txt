Medical Source Information Yellow
highlights indicate symptoms related to confusion/disorientation. Nervous system side effects have been reported frequently.
These have included
depression
with
drowsiness and sedation
in nearly all patients treated.
Motor skills may be impaired .
Dystonic reactions
have been reported after single doses of diphenhydramine. The
CNS depressant effect
of diphenhydramine parallels its plasma concentrations.
The plasma concentration threshold for
sedation
is 30 to 42 ng/mL, and to cause
mental impairment
is 58 to 74 ng/mL.
Patients should be warned against
driving
while taking diphenhydramine.
Dystonic reactions
have been accompanied by
dizziness ,
mental confusion ,
rigidity ,
lip and tongue protrusion ,
trismus ,
torticollis , and
swallowing difficulties
and generally resolve spontaneously.
Toxic encephalopathy
has been reported in a child with chicken pox treated generously with topical diphenhydramine.
Delirium
has been reported in elderly patients with mild dementia following a small oral dose of diphenhydramine. Genitourinary side effects have included
urinary retention
and
dysuria
as a result of the
anticholinergic effects
of diphenhydramine. Ocular side effects
have included
blurred vision ,
diplopia , and
dry eyes
due to
anticholinergic effects . Patients should be warned of the sedative effects of diphenhydramine, and advised not to take this drug with alcohol.
Due to the
anticholinergic
effect
of diphenhydramine, it should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstructions.
It should also be used with caution in patients with a history of lower respiratory disease, including asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, or hypertension.
