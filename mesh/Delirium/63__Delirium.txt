Medical Source Information Yellow
highlights indicate symptoms related to irritability. Alprazolam may carry a higher risk of dependency and possible withdrawal than other benzodiazepines.
Spontaneous post marketing reports suggest a greater risk and severity of dependence in patients treated for transient anxiety and anxiety disorder with doses exceeding 4 mg per day and for periods of duration exceeding 12 weeks.
Whereas, a study of patients being treated for panic disorder reported duration of treatment had no effect on ability to taper to zero; however, patients receiving doses exceeding 4 mg per day had more difficulty tapering to zero, an increased rate of rebound and withdrawal symptoms.
Alprazolam should not be discontinued abruptly in patients who have received the medication for long periods.
Abrupt discontinuation may
result in
serious
symptoms
of
withdrawal .
Episodes of
hypomania
and
mania
have been reported with the use of alprazolam in patients with depression.
Delirium
may be associated with postoperative exposure to benzodiazepines.
It has been recommended that clinicians caring for patients at risk for
delirium
carefully evaluate the need for benzodiazepines in the postoperative period and consider alternative therapies whenever possible.
Other side effects reported during treatment for anxiety disorder have included
weight gain
(2.7%) and
weight loss
(2.3%).
Other side effects reported during treatment for panic disorder have included
tinnitus
(6.6%),
increased appetite
(32.7%),
decreased appetite
(27.8%),
weight gain
(27.2%),
weight loss
(22.6%),
edema
(4.9%), and
infection
(1.3%).
Other
side effects have included withdrawal symptoms
following either abrupt cessation or fast tapering of alprazolam.
Withdrawal symptoms
may include agitation,
restlessness ,
anxiety ,
insomnia ,
convulsions ,
tremor , abdominal cramps, blurred vision,
vomiting , and
sweating .
The incidence is unknown but may be higher than for other benzodiazepines. Nervous system side effects reported during treatment for anxiety disorders have included
drowsiness
(41%),
lightheadedness
(20.8%), depression (13.9%),
headache
(12.9%),
confusion
(9.9%),
insomnia
(8.9%),
nervousness
(4.1%),
syncope
(3.1%),
dizziness
(1.8%), and akathisia (1.6%).
Nervous system side effects reported during treatment for panic disorder have included
drowsiness
(76.8%),
fatigue and tiredness
(48.6%),
impaired coordination
(40.1%),
irritability
(33.1%),
memory impairment
(33.1%),
lightheaded / dizziness
(29.8%),
insomnia

dysarthria

(14.8%),
decreased libido
(14.4%), confused state (10.4%),
muscular twitching
(7.9%),

(7.7%),
change in libido
(7.1%),

(1.3%).
Seizures,
hallucinations , and depersonalization have been reported in less than 1% of patients.
Amnesia ,
psychomotor impairment ,
anterograde memory loss , and
ataxia
have also been reported.
Elderly patients and/or patients with
liver dysfunction
may be particularly sensitive to
central nervous system side effects .
The smallest effective dose should be used in the elderly to avoid the development of
ataxia
and oversedation. One study has reported that the frequency of
ataxia
in patients treated for panic disorder ranges between 17% and 24%.
Another study has reported that patients treated acutely with alprazolam by intravenous administration experience a 25% to 30%
decrease in whole brain cerebral blood flow .
The decrease in blood flow is associated with
memory impairment , a decrease in plasma epinephrine and a decrease in self-rated alertness.
After a week of daily alprazolam therapy, most of the subjects developed tolerance to these effects.
A 64-year-old man with a history of renal insufficiency was diagnosed with nonconvulsive
status epilepticus
following abrupt withdrawal of year-long alprazolam therapy at dosage 1 mg orally every night.
The patient recovered with short-term oral anticonvulsant therapy and reinstitution of alprazolam followed by a more gradual taper of alprazolam therapy.
The following nervous system side effects have been reported to result in discontinuation of treatment in over 5% of patients and at a greater rate than placebo: insomnia (29.5%),
lightheadedness
(19.3%),
anxiety
(19.2%),
fatigue and tiredness
(18.4%), abnormal
involuntary movement
(17.3%),
headache
(17.0%),
irritability
(10.5%), cognitive disorder (10.3%), muscular twitching (6.9%),
impaired coordination
(6.6%),
muscle tone disorders
(5.9%), and weakness (5.8%), memory impairment (5.5%), depression (5.1%), and confused state (5.0%).
There have been reports of
seizures
in patients following rapid decrease in dose or abrupt withdrawal of treatment with alprazolam.
The risk of
withdrawal seizures
may be higher in patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day. Psychiatric side effects reported during treatment for panic disorder have included major
depression
(12.1% to 13.8%).
Hypomania ,
mania , and
aggression
have also been reported. Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an
allergic reaction :
hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
Call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects:
unusual risk-taking behavior, decreased inhibitions, no
fear
of danger;
depressed mood ,
thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself ;
hyperactivity , agitation,
hostility ,
hallucinations ;
feeling light-headed ,
fainting ;
seizure (convulsions );
urinating less than
usual or not at all;

( yellowing of the skin or eyes ).
