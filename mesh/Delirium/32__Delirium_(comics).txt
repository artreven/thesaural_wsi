Me, Captain Carrot, Terry Pratchett and his pseudonyms?
13 Replies
#pragma prerequisite you have read lots of Pratchett books
A few years ago at a rare party, my friend
Jim
got drunk and espoused to me a theory, viz: that I am
Captain Carrot ; not in some existential do-gooder sense, but instead he suggested that I might have been the (literal?) inspiration for the character as physically described in the Discworld books.
Personally I suspect that Jim might have been mixing the story up with yet another, older meme from my social circle[1] – however his idea has got legs, and has a plausible backplot: in 1987 I was working for my
university magazine
and on the back of the release of
Mort
in hardback, through his publisher I wangled an interview with
Pterry
and so was sent early one morning to rendezvous with him at Waterloo station, to ride in a limo for the best part of a couple of hours to (IIRC) Bromley in Kent, to a book signing that I could observe – and then trot back to UCL to write-up.
The resulting article got spiked in favour of student union politics, and I haven’t the notes – something I regret to this day – but merely two weeks later I got on a train at Paddington and there Terry was again, in the same carriage.
We politely exchanged nods, him sat at a table, me standing, while a pleasant lady asked him what he did for a living, thrilled at him being a writer, and “[had he] had anything published yet”?
Terry was very kind to her.
Anyway: Jim’s point was that I tend to leave an impression on people and that since I loom tall, am roughly triangular, have a voice that can saw through concrete and have/had a
shock of orange hair [2], Jim wondered if my shape might have lodged in Terry’s brain and served as a template for the description of Carrot.
Since “Mort!” predates “Guards! Guards!” only slightly in time – if not in volumes –
it’s not impossible, though in my heart of hearts I might
wish
it were true more than I believe it
likely .
The L-space wiki itself suggests otherwise.
But I do remember a
few
things from the interview:
one was Terry’s insistence that he didn’t like tape recorders, he thought they were not good tools for proper journalists who ought to use notepads; this led to a discussion of journalism as training for being a disciplined writer.
two was that apparently I was the first interviewer ever to be asking him about his work with
BNFL
as inspiration for “magic” in the early Rincewind books, with overspills of magic causing “walking trees” and “shoals of invisible fish” and so forth, compared to the contemporary woes at
Sellafield .
I was right, it was an influence, but he wasn’t seeking to make any political point – merely to juxtapose “magic” in one world and “physics” in another.
thirdly (and this is where I’m racking my brains to draw detail) – he
wanted to write a book under a pseudonym ; I don’t think it was fantasy exactly, but I can’t for the life of me remember what the plot was, even though he outlined it.
It was something “more serious” but not related to Discworld in any way.
It was standalone.
That’s about as much as I remember; interviews I’ve seen from the past decade suggest that the idea behind “ Nation ” is quite recent, else I would think that that was a candidate.
People reading this should bear in mind this was 1987, when book #5 of the Discworld series was just out, manuscripts for a few others might have been ready to go, and Terry was not the world famous crusading bazillionaire and national institution that he now is.
So now I’m wondering whether – 23 years later – perhaps somewhere in the Amazon catalogue there might be a Terry Pratchett book written under a pseudonym?
Does the internet have an answer?
A suspicion?
I’d love to know.
—
[1] …viz: that someone from the UK net.community whom most of us had met at one point or another – Tanaqui Weaver – both knew Neil Gaiman and was a partial inspiration for
Delirium
in the
Sandman
series, although Tori Amos has since been wrongly anointed and the
credit given yet elsewhere , with Tanaqui expunged from the public record.
[2] apologies for the mullet, I didn’t know any better, or rather I just never got it cut – I hacked the front off so that I could see, but the back was heading towards Unix-Guru ponytail proportions, but never quite worked.
The picture’s from circa 1993 but’s not too far off the mark for my university look.
It certainly wasn’t intentional – that would require me to follow fashion and I didn’t even know what a “mullet” was… or rather I thought it was a kind of fish.
Update:
better picture , 1989-ish.
Shows the height differential.

As a huge fan for Terry Pratchett, I’m always interested in his thoughts. I’m delighted that he’s just started writing another ‘Vimes’ book. I wonder if this is the piece of writing that he talked to you about:
http://www.paulkidby.com/news/index.html
The current entry that shows up when you use this address is the July 1st 2010 one in which you can read this
“I’m sure that most of you will have heard of the Long Earth, three pieces of writing I did around the time of Wyrd Sisters but put on one side because the Discworld suddenly became so successful.”
Just read on for more info as it’s an entry packed full of information.
I’m not sure how long Terry Pratchett had the idea for Nation but I do remember him saying that he had it for a while before the Boxing Day tsunami and had to put it on hold because of that.

So many books And so many good characters. Personally I think Adrian Turnipseed of the HEM dept at the UU could be me. My job is to go behind Hex and kick it, or initialize the GBL.
Perhaps everyone can find themselves in discworld if they try.

Fantasy might have made him his fortune, but for his next project, Terry Pratchett is set to venture into the world of science fiction, returning to a concept he first dreamed up almost 25 years ago in collaboration with the award-winning British science fiction writer Stephen Baxter.
Pratchett began work on a novel about a chain of parallel worlds, The Long Earth, in 1986, just after completing Equal Rites, the third book set in his Discworld universe in which the world is held up by four elephants, standing on a giant turtle. “I thought to myself [Discworld] is fantasy, and I want to get back to my first love, which is science fiction,” Pratchett told the Guardian. The author had previously written two science fiction novels in the late 70s and early 80s, The Dark Side of the Sun and Strata.
But the Discworld books took off, and Pratchett decided to pursue the fantasy path. “Equal Rites was very successful, and without me making an actual decision about it, I found I enjoyed writing the Discworld books, and The Long Earth remained on the back burner until the back burner receded over the horizon,” he said.
Digging through his archive recently in search of material for a compilation, his agent, Colin Smythe, stumbled across the unfinished novel and two short stories, and Pratchett began to realise “there was such a lot that could be done with it”.
“It was simply based on the quantum theory idea, that the earth is one of an immeasurable number of earths, each one differing by one electron. Like a lot of science fiction, or at least like the stuff which interests me, this is a scenario where we can start to have lots of fun,” he said.
“A way is found almost by accident for people to go from one world to another. An overarching theory here is how much our wars are caused by the scarcity of land. Supposing that the thickness of a thought away is another earth, almost exactly like this one, and as far as we can tell not inhabited by anything human. It’d be the land rush to end all land rushes. So off we go, but hang on a minute, there are no mobile phones … so there are certain problems: metal doesn’t go well through whatever ether you step through to get to the next world. You’re really pretty well having to start again, so it’s a strange kind of situation – people are incredibly rare, they’re the biggest resource you have.”
Pratchett has collaborated with other authors before, working with Neil Gaiman on Good Omens, and was keen to team up with a science fiction writer to develop The Long Earth series. Baxter, author of Flood, Ark and the Time’s Tapestry and Destiny’s Children series, and winner of the British Science Fiction Association prize and the Philip K Dick award, felt like the right choice.
“I think Stephen Baxter is one of our best science fiction writers, and the best hard science fiction writer,” he said. “I really like his stuff. There’s a man who’s at home with trillions … The nice thing about working with him is that pretty much one or other of us can solve any sort of problem. It’ll be fun – an antidote to all the other boys and girls being allowed out to play and you typing away by yourself. I suffer from permanent cabin fever. It’s having a mirror to bounce things off, and at the same time you’re his mirror as well. Also he is used to writing hard science fiction.”
At the moment, the pair are both working on other books (Pratchett’s next Discworld novel is out next autumn) but they’re bouncing ideas off each other and pinning down the outline for the series, the first book of which will be published by Doubleday in spring 2012. “There are excited phone calls – and there will probably be fights over who does what scene,” said Pratchett, who’s particularly looking forward to covering Native Americans visiting a pristine version of the Black Hills of Dakota, “and saying this is great but I really hope we get cell phones going, this blanket and smoke thing really sucks”.
This being a Terry Pratchett series, there will, of course, be humour involved, but the author is adamant that “you can’t just put humour in a book”. “There has to be something to play it up against – tragic relief,” he stressed. “Humour should come from the situation, not because you think it’s a good time to put a joke in.”
Both authors are determined to put the parameters of their world(s) down in concrete before getting started. “Once you’ve got the science and the background you have to be true to it. One of the problems of Doctor Who-type fiction is that you can make it up as you go along. If you do it right, you use the modelling clay you’ve got,” said Pratchett. “You only get one chance to put down the parameters of what’s possible. I’ve been phoning doctors and people like that and saying ‘Can this work?’ You have to find something which seems right and not too blatantly bad from a scientific point of view.”
Generally speaking, “the rule in science fiction is you are allowed one impossible thing,” he said. “Ours is, supposing we can step to the world next door – to all the words next door. And let’s see what people do, faced with this … Of course, being writers we can play with what we know about mankind – offered an absolute paradise, he will find some way of cocking things up.”

That sounds very familiar; the thing that piques me is that I’ve been meaning to write up the interview story for _years_ and never really got round to it, but then the same _month_ that I do, this gets announced…

Well, I’ve only met pTerry thrice, briefly, and I don’t recognise myself in any of his characters. This is, I suppose, weak confirmation that he bases characters on people he’s met. (-8
Also: there’s a social link between you and Tanaqui and another between Neil Gaiman and Tanaqui? It’s a small world. Once upon a time I got chatting with her by e-mail, then apparently met her once at a party in Oxford. But neither of us found out the other was at it until it was too late.
Also also: will you be at the Discworld Convention? I’ve finally got around to signing up for it this year.

@clive – Oh that’s not the only link between me and Gaiman; he also did the artwork for the SATAN network security tool by my friends Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema.
http://www.porcupine.org/satan/demo/docs/artwork.html
The world really is a very small place.
As for Tanaqui although we’ve once met at a party, perhaps twice, I nonetheless have no idea how many of my friends know her, why, and to what extent – although it seemed for a time that everyone-except-me did.

I suspect that a lot of characters are composite, so perhaps Carrot is partly you – I can’t imagine you throwing your voice, or running, during either your interview or train journey with pTerry, so he wouldn’t have seen those resemblances necessarily… and the timing is possibly just a little too close.
Why don’t you simply try and contact him and see if he remembers – his illness will not necessarily have damaged his long-term memory, and since you obviously asked him things other people hadn’t bothered about, it might just be he remembers – at least he would if there is any truth in the theory.
I wonder if the lady on train ever read any of his books?

@rac: In truth – it doesn’t bother me. Nice story, but it doesn’t have to be real.
But I am happy to have (via Em) tracked down the answer to my question!

Hmm.. I imagine quite a few of your friends/acquaintances know Tanaqui.
Grim for a start, and then there’s Shona McNeil and Jim Finnis (I believe).
Tanaqui also gets about a great deal in Oxford social circles. I’ve bumped into a number of random people who know her.
As for me, well, she introduced me to (and confused me with) Magic the Gathering, showed me parts of the Engineering Department I didn’t know existed and popped up randomly on the street.
I’ve not met either Terry Pratchett
or Neil Gaiman and I’m pretty sure that I’m not the inspiration for any characters in literature.
Oh, and I could well believe that Tanaqui could be the template for Delirium when she’s not had her medication.

A few more interview memories come to light… there was also some stuff about growing up, becoming a reporter… and…
Beconsfield?
Something to do with a model village?
I think we discussed Bekonscot or something.
