Waterfront Festival Day 3- Plenty of Salmon
The third day of the Waterfront Festival was billed as "Salmon Stuffed" Sunday because the line-up focused on members of the
Polyethnic Cajun Slamgrass
pioneers, Leftover Salmon.
Salmon’s keyboard player, Bill McKay started off the day.
His early set opened up a beautiful day at the Mish.
The sun was shining, and the Bloody Maries were cold.
McKay was followed by the bluegrass trio, The Grant Farm Duo with Larry Keel.
The trio of bluegrass pickers, Tyler Grant(guitar), Andy Thorn(banjo) and Larry Keel(guitar), brought us back to the roots of the festival, Pickin’ on the Poudre, yet again.
They were joined by Drew Emmitt during their set and really brought some great bluegrass.
Billy and Jillian Nershi finally made it down to the Mish from a mountain snow storm to play the next set.
I like Billy and his work with The String Cheese Incident; however, the Billy and Jillian set seemed too long and too slow.
The set seemed out of place after the two prior set and did not get the crowd energized on such a beautiful day.
However, Leftover Salmon’s front man, Vince Herman, and Great American Taxi brought the energy right back up.
Taxi delivered its rock focused music and reenergized the crowd.
Drew Emmitt Band, followed Taxi with a more bluegrass feel.
Emmitt closed the night in a great fashion delivering the bluegrass that Colorado is known for.

Waterfront Festival Day 2- ? Means 1:00 A.M.
After the first day at the Mish, we all knew what it took to get in. So everyone I knew planned appropriately.
The weather seemed to clear up just for the festival and provided and sunny backdrop for the second day of music.
Once again, I missed the first band, The Magic Beans, and arrived during Good Gravy.
Living in Fort Collins, I have seen Good Gravy several times and I have to admit that they get better every time I see them.
They are still not a super polished band, but they are developing in the style of The String Cheese Incident.
Their vocals have improved and their jamming is getting tighter.
Larry Keel followed the electronica/jamgrass styling of Good Gravy with some good old fashion bluegrass/folk music.
The tweener set from the day before setup Keel’s second day set.
Keel took the newly names Waterfront Festival back to its roots as Pickin’ on the Poudre while also adding a little reggae feel.
After Keel, the fans were treated to the funk/afrobeats/reggae styling of the Iowa City/Fort Collins band Euforquestra. Although this was a step away from the classic format of Pickin’, Euforquesta’s style always gets the crowd moving.
With the men in the middle,
Austin Zalatel and Ryan Jeter, blasting on their horns, Euforquesta brought the crowd to a frenzy.
They hit a high note covering the Talking Heads’ “Crosseyed & Painless” .
With the crowd worked up and Greensky Bluegrass finally arriving from the Hangout Festival, the boys from the K-Zoo (Kalamazoo, Michigan) took the stage.
Greensky’s set started out with the Springsteen classic “Dancing in the Dark.”
Anders Beck was rocking a Lynyrd Skynyrd t-shirt and teased their classic.
As the band jammed in and out their songs and other covers, the crowd responded by dancing their pants off.
The Greensky set ended at 1:00 A.M. and no one was let down.

Waterfront Festival Day 1: Run to the Hills
Another year and another Pickin' on the Poudre...wait I mean Waterfront Festival. For the seventh straight year, Head for the Hills has opened the Mishawaka Amphitheatre outdoor season. However, this year was a little different than the past six. Dani Grant bought the Mish in 2010 from Robin Jones, who bought it in 1991. Dani Grant hoped to revitalize the Mish, and change the image of the venue.
She made it clear all weekend that this was the new image of the Mish2.0. The venue received a bad name because of the acts of s few stupid kids partying too hard and
Mr.Jones' criminal history for growing and selling marijuana .
We all knew changes were coming, but the first day at the Mish was an eye opener. No longer are patron allowed to enter through the bar, instead they are herded through an entrance in the back of the venue (typically used as the main exit in the past). In order to enter the Mish on the first day, patrons were separated by sex and then searched. This search included taking everything out of your pockets, a complete search of any bag, searching wallets, searching cigarette packs, and even the use of a metal detector. This was an eye opening change of events for most Mishawaka veterans. Several medical marijuana and recreational users had their marijuana and paraphernalia thrown into a garbage can that was later given to the Sheriffs. The patrons were still let into the venue; however, since most of the patrons were taken to the Mish by the Mish's shuttle service, there was no way for the patron to take their marijuana and paraphernalia back to their car or camp grounds to not have them taken.
Another change is that there is no re-entry.
This specifically aggravated me because I paid the extra $50 so I could park on the premises of the Mishawaka.
I did this incase the weather turned bad like it did last year.
With the no re-entry I wasn’t allowed to take my rain gear back to my car when the rain never came.
My suggestion to any Mish veteran is it to be ready for the changes.
Yes the by the third day the metal detector was no longer used, but the search was still intrusive and thorough.
My final complaint before I talk about the music is about the shuttle service and the campgrounds.
Although I did not take the shuttle or use the campgrounds, I heard several complaints from friends who did.
First off a couple of friends were left at the Mish for an hour after the show because there was a mishap with the shuttle service.
This caused them to not get home until after 3 A.M.
Secondly was the campgrounds were nowhere near the canyon (north Taft and 287) and there was no easy way for the shuttles to drop off patrons staying at the campgrounds.
This caused the shuttle to take longer to get patrons to the other drop off areas.
Ok, on to the music.
It was great.
I arrived in the middle of the Larry Keel set.
Although I missed Whiskey Tango, I heard they were great.
Larry Keel delivered a great short set of music to foreshadow his sets and entertain the fans before Gregory Alan Isakov.
Gregory Alan Isakov brought his Boulder style music to the Poudre Canyon.
This was my first time I have ever seen Isakov, and he impressed me.
I came to the show under the impression that he would be playing solo, but was happy to see a band played with him.
After Isakov, Head for the Hills took the stage.
The Fort Collins band reaffirmed the reason we come to the Mish, the music.
The band’s “bluegrass” style is constantly evolving and transforming as the band continues to play.
They keep their fans dancing and provided two sets of Head for the Hill’s classics and a few new songs.
The show opened with Sloppy Joe blasting out Ray Charles’ Unchain My Heart.
I was enthralled to hear them cover Iron Maiden’s “Run to the Hills” for the second time (this time I got it on tape, but was still a little late).
Although it seemed like most of the fans had no idea what was going on, the few fans that did were ecstatic to hear the classic metal cover.
I know I spent a lot of time putting the Mish and Dani on blast, but I am thankful the venue is still open.
I am thankful that music will continue to fill the canyon.
But I just wanted to provide a heads up to anyone heading to the venue.
Gregory Alan Isakov

More Graphic Novels
Mark Millar's Superman Red Son:  This is a book I have wanted to since it was released in comic form.  It was released in 2003 when I was sucked back into buying comic, but I did not get the first book so I did not get the other two.  Being a historian, and growing up in the end of the cold war made the idea of Superman as a communist interesting to me.  The three part book take place in a parallel universe where Superman land in the Ukraine instead of Smallville.  Superman's abilities change the face of the world, and balance of power.  The Soviet Union becomes the world power, and the United States falls into a state a disarray.  Wonder Woman allies herself with the Soviet Superman, while a parallel Batman is created when his parents are killed for protesting the USSR.  The books creates a completely different world with many familiar faces and names from history and the DC Universe (Ike, JFK, Nixon, Stalin, Lex Luthor, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, Green Lantern, Brainiac).  The artwork is modern comic, nothing out of the ordinary, but the story is worth a read.  As a historian I enjoyed the view from the opposite side of the looking glass.  I would suggest the book to a fan of history or a fan of the DC Universe.
Mark Millar's 1985- Millar weaves a great story of comic and parallel universes in 1985.  The book takes place in 1985 when Marvel released "Secret Wars." "Secret Wars" was and still one of my favorite comic series ever, not only because of the introductions of the Black Spiderman, but also because it was the first cross-over book I ever read.  1985 brings a new type of cross-over, they type where the Marvel characters enter our world.  The book focuses on a young boy, Toby, and his family.  The Marvel villains are drawn into the world of 1985, and start to destroy Toby's hometown.  Toby is forced to enter the Marvel Universe to bring back the superheros.  The book is taken over the top with the artwork of Tommy Lee Edwards.  Edwards drawing style darkens the mood of the comic while enhancing the parallel worlds Millar created.  I enjoyed the book from cover to end.  Millar and Edwards ability to show the dark side of the Marvel Universe while still keeping true to the universe's origins impressed me.
Sam Kieth's Batman: Secrets- Sam Kieth take both the writing and artist role in this book; however, this is just another book that the author tries too hard.  The art is amazing at point, but falls sort in others.  Kieth's story follows Joker as he gets paroled.  Although I enjoyed the side story about media's control over the general populous, I felt Kieth's story had a lot of be desired.  The idea that secrets can tear a man down is a good basis to a story, it falls short in this case.  Joker is his typical insane self, and Batman is solid like always.  The books was not a total let down, but for me I enjoyed  Alan Moore's Batman: The Killing Joke.  I am glad that Kieth made reference to the final joke in the Moore book, but I also felt like he used it to draw unjust similarities between him and Moore.
Alan Moore's Batman: The Killing Joke- What can I say, Alan Moore, Batman, and the Joker... it has to be good.  And it was.  I remember reading this book a few years ago, and enjoyed rereading.  The story focuses on the origins of Joker, as well as the relationship between Joker and Batman.  As Moore typically does, he can show the dark side of a comic universe without going overboard.  The fine line that Moore walk is where other writers like Kieth failed.  Brian Bolland's illustrations are classic in nature, but it adds emotion and  darkness to Moore's story.  I would suggest this book to anyone who knows anything about Batman and wants a different look at the relationship between the Joker and the Bat.
Alan Moore's Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?- This book is a collection of Superman that Moore wrote during 1985 and 1986.  The first two story are parallel universe stories told by Lois Lane (Elliot) to the a Daily Planet reporter for the Superman Memorial Issue.  Moore spins the tale of Superman death (or disappearance) from the eyes of Lois.  The story involves attacks on Superman's closest friends by his old villains.  A re-merging of the Brainiac/Luthor team tries to finally destroy Superman and his friends at the Fortress of Solitude.  However it is Mxyzptlk who is really the man behind the scene.  Moore's idea of Mxyzptlk is different than the typical little man, and Moore also shows another of this classic villain.  The book also contains a Superman/Swamp Thing cross over called "The Jungle Line."  Moore brings his classic version of Swamp Thing into the world of Superman as the savior of Superman.  The final book is a Superman Annual called "For the Man Who Has Everything."  This book is classic Alan Moore.  He weaves a side of Superman that most of us have never seen, a emotional Superman who has not control or power.  A present sent to Superman sucks him into a parallel universe where his greatest desires are meet.  In this case that mean, Krypton was never destroyed.  While visiting to drop off his present, Batman, Robin, and Wonder Woman are sucked into saving Superman from his comatosed state and defeat Mongul.  I enjoyed all three stories.  Like always Alan Moore stays within the limits of the classic comic book story; however, creates a new universe or parallel world for the story to take place in.  If you like Superman, and want to read some new and inventive stories, check out this book.
Across the Universe: The DC Universe Stories of Alan Moore-  This book is as it says it is, the stories of Alan Moore in the DC Universe.  The book contains a few stories from earlier books I have read, but also contains others.  Moore writes stories for Detective Comics, Green Lantern, Vigilante, The Omega Men's Vega, Secret Origins as well as the aforementioned Superman and Batman.  Alan Moore does a great job doing what he does best, taking a comic universe to its limits while staying true to the universe.  I enjoyed all the stories and Moore's dark humor.  I would suggest this book to any Moore fan, and to fans of the DC Universe that wants to see the other side.
Greg Pak's X-men Magneto Testament-  I enjoyed this book; however, it is more of a historic testament to the terrible act of the Nazi than it is a X-men comic book.  As a historian, there is nothing wrong with that.  The book sets up Magneto's childhood, and travels through World War II.  Published by Marvel Knights, Pak hold little back in his story of Magneto.  He is able to do this because he used first hand accounts to help him write this book.  In theory he made the book to be used as a teaching supplement to World War II, in much of the same way Maus is used.  I also like that the book provides in-depth endnotes and a teacher's guide.  If you are looking for a X-men comic, this might not be the book for you; however, the story is a great depiction of the hardships of being a Jew in Germany during World War II.

Graphic Novels...Adults for Comic books
So I have reverted back to one of my childhood past time, and started reading comic books, I mean graphic Novels, again. I do blame Matt Loewen and the guys from Head for the Hills for this resurgence.  With the help of the
Poudre River Public Library , formally the Fort Collins Public Library, and
Prospector
I have gotten my hands on tons of wonderful graphic novels.  Here is what I have read so far...
Alan Moore's & Gene Ha's Top 10 Book 1 & 2-  A very interesting story of parallel earths. Top 10 is a police precinct on parallel earth 10 where superhuman, gods, machines, and humans inhabit the earth.  The books take you through the exploits of Top 10's finest.  The books also take every chance they can to poke fun at the DC and Marvel universes.  You will find all sorts of cameos in the margins of the scenes (like Doctor Doom as a little kid).  I enjoyed these two books, and would suggest them to anyone who like Alen Moore and comic books.
Neil Gaiman's & Yoshitaka Amano's Sandman: The Dream Hunters- Not your typical comic book.  The Dream Hunters is more like and illustrated novel.  In this book, Gaiman focus on a very Buddhist view of the world and dreams.  Amano's Japanese influence is felt through out the whole book both in his illustrations and the way Gaiman handles ideas of life, love, the world, and dreams.  I enjoyed this book.  It forces the reader to take a look at life and love via the thought process of a Buddhist.  Amano's illustrations are amazing and look like a dream.  Gaiman's story evolves past the focus of The Sandman however adds to legend of The Sandman.
Neil Gaiman's The Sandman: Volume One- First published in 1989, Gaiman's The Sandman brought new life to DC's original
Sandman
from the 70's.  Unlike the sleeping gas emitting crime fighter, Gaiman's The Sandman is actually Dream of the Endless (The Endless Family includes
Destiny ,
Death ,
Dream ,
Destruction ,
Despair ,
Desire
and
Delirium ).  Gaiman's story became the flagship comic of DC's
Vertigo
comic and set the mood for what was to come from this offshoot from the motherhsip.  Gaiman wields his story to open up a new world inside the DC Universe.  Like Alan Moore before him, Gaiman tests and pushes the limits of the hokie DC Universe where death was off limits.  Gaiman does not shy away from the Universe, he uses it to his advantage and includes the Justice League in the first book.   Although the cover illustration look amazing, the comic illustration is straight out of the late 80's early 90's; however, this takes nothing away from the story.  I would suggest getting into the series if you like Alan Moore, or have ever wondered about Dream.
Neil Gaiman's The Sandman: Endless Nights- In this book Gaiman provides a story for each of The Endless Family-
Destiny ,
Death ,
Dream ,
Destruction ,
Despair ,
Desire
and
Delirium .  I liked all of the stories except Despair and Delirium.  They were just a little too messy for me.  I understand why they were set up this way, but for me it made them almost impossible to read.  Other than that, I enjoyed the way they provided insight into the world of The Endless Family.  If you get into The Sandman series, I would suggest giving this book a read.
Paul Jenkins' & Paolo Rivera's Mythos-  Mythos rehashes the introductions of
six of Marvels most famous comic book(movie) character/groups-
X-Men,
Hulk,
Ghost Rider,
Spider-Man,
Fantastic Four, and Captain America.  Jenkins updates the stories based on their original appearances, and Rivera paints the comics in beautiful detail.  I love the way Rivera's brush seems to add emotion and depth to stories told by greats like Lee, Kirby, and Simon.  I grew up reading these characters books, and thoroughly enjoy the new artistic take on these Marvel classic.  I would suggest this book to anyone who loves the Marvel Universe, or wants an updated take on the origins of these Marvel classics.    G.I. Joe Origins Vol. 1- To be honest, not my favorite book that I read in the last week.  I grew-up watching G.I. Joe and have re-watched the series and the movie since (I know I am a nerd).  This books was a major let down to me.  I hated the story of Snake-eyes, and Cobra Commander(Chimera in the book).  It replaces a good story with blood and gore.  The book adds nothing to the origins of the characters and make assumptions about the development of the team.  If you like G.I. Joe go read GI. Joe #21- "Silent Interlude" (i am guessing if you like G.I. Joe you have already read it) and do not waste your time with this book.
Justice Society of America: The Next Age Vol 1-  This book links the original Justice Society with The Next Age Justice Society.  The Next Age is created at the request of the Justice League by original Justice Society members: The Flash, Green Lantern, and Wildcat.  The Flash and Green Lantern put together a team from the decedent of original members for Wildcat to train.  However, The Fourth Reich controlled by Vandal Savage tries to sever all family ties.   I would suggest this book to a fan of the DC Universe.  It is not your father's DC comic where death is nonexistent; however, it is still a comic book.  The art is modern but still comic based and so is the dialogue.  It brushes over the heavy things, and focuses on the the superpowers that be.  Do not expect a book that get into the human condition, but just enjoy another story of good superheros versus bad supervillains.

The Holler! first show at the "New" Mshawaka- 5-7-2011
The Mishawaka Amphitheatre  opened its doors for the first time after a face lift for a concert.
The Holler!
and
Constitution
opened the classic Fort Collins' venue (well Bellvue) with the Holler!'s CD release and masquerade party.  Everyone worn a mask, and received the new Holler! CD,
Gratitude .  The Mish's face life was minor but much needed.  The venue looks the same, has the same feel, but is much cleaner.  However, the true test will be during a big out door show like
Waterfront .  Constitution entertained the crowd with one set of opening music, but I only caught the tail end.  They invited the Holler!'s
Michael Kirkpatrick
on mandolin, and Brian Adams on guitar on stage to finish off there set.  The Holler! took the small indoor stage lead by the enthusiasm of Michael Kirkpatrick.  They played two set of new material of Graditude, newer song, old Wildwood Holler! and Handpick Holler! songs, and covers.

Stefani Germanotta....Lady Gaga
I am not a hater of Gaga, I am actually watching
"Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour"
on
HBO
right now (well flipping back and forth between that, basketball, hockey, and soccer).  It is an amazing spectacle.  I just think it is funny that she wears a jacket that says "Born This Way," the name of one of her
singles ; however, if you take five minutes out of your day on
Youtube , you can find the real
Gaga, Stefani Germanotta .
Yea that's right
Led Zeppelin
I guess my whole this is this is the way you were born. Don't hide from it.  I know you make more money being Madonna, but at what cost?

Osama Bin Laden Death and President Obama's Speech
The United States Government announced Afghan officials have confirmed that
Osama Bin Laden
had died and that his body was
with the United States.  There is no hard proof of the death, but the US Government suggest that a US operation killed Bin Laden and has confirmed the kill.  This comes six month before the 10 year anniversary of the start of the War in Afghanistan.  It is a symbolic victory for the United States and the Allied Forces; however, it could also fuel more radical actions from
al-Qaeda
or other radical groups during the 10 year anniversary of the 9-11 attack in the US and other terrorist attack in Europe.
