Akathisia ,

convulsions
have been reported to be temporally associated with citalopram treatment. Nearly all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mixed serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants cause sleep abnormalities to some extent.
These antidepressants have marked dose-dependent
effects on rapid eye movement ( REM) sleep , causing
reductions
in the overall
amount
of
REM
sleep
over the night and
delays
the first entry into
REM sleep (increased REM sleep onset latency
(ROL)), both in healthy subjects and depressed patients.
The antidepressants that increase serotonin function appear to have the greatest
effect on REM sleep .
The
reduction
in
REM
sleep
is greatest early in treatment, but gradually returns towards baseline during long-term therapy; however, ROL remains long.
Following discontinuation of therapy the amount of REM sleep tends to rebound.
Some of these drugs (i.e., bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, trazodone, trimipramine) appear to have a modest or minimal
effect on REM sleep . Metabolic and nutritional side effects including

You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.
The development of a potentially life-threatening
serotonin syndrome
or
neuroleptic malignant syndrome
(NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, including citalopram, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists.
Serotonin syndrome
symptoms may include
mental status changes
(e.g.,
agitation ,
hallucinations ,
coma ),
autonomic instability
(e.g.,
tachycardia , labile blood pressure,
hyperthermia ),
neuromuscular aberrations
(e.g.,
hyperreflexia ,
incoordination ) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g.,
nausea ,
vomiting ,
diarrhea ).
Serotonin syndrome , in its most severe form can resemble
neuroleptic malignant syndrome , which includes
hyperthermia ,
muscle rigidity ,
autonomic instability
with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and
mental status changes .
Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms.
Adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of citalopram have been reported, particularly when the discontinuation has been abrupt.
These adverse events have included
dysphoric
mood ,
irritability ,
agitation ,
dizziness ,
sensory disturbances, anxiety ,
confusion ,
headache ,
lethargy ,
emotional lability , insomnia, and
hypomania .
Theses events are generally self-limiting.
However, there have been reports of
serious discontinuation symptoms .
Patients should be monitored for withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing treatment with citalopram.
Gradual reduction of the dose is recommended whenever possible.
If intolerable symptoms occur due to a decrease in dosage or discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be appropriate.
This may be followed by a more gradual reduction in dosage.
Hyponatremia
may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram.
In many cases,
hyponatremia
appeared to be the result of the
syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH ), and was reversible when citalopram was discontinued.
Cases with serum
sodium lower
than 110 mmol/L have been reported.
Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing
hyponatremia
with SSRIs and SNRIs.
Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk.
Discontinuation of citalopram should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.
Signs and symptoms of
hyponatremia
include
headache ,
difficulty concentrating ,
memory impairment ,
confusion ,
weakness , and
unsteadiness , which may lead to falls.
Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included
hallucination ,
syncope ,
seizure , coma,
respiratory arrest , and death.
A
heart rate
decrease
of 1.7 beats/minute was shown in ECG tests compared to no change in patients receiving placebo.
Psychiatric side effects including
somnolence
(18%), insomnia (up to 15%),
anxiety
(4%),
anorexia
(4%),
agitation
(3%),
dysmenorrhea
(3%),
decreased libido
(2%), and
yawning
(2%) have been reported.
Impaired concentration ,
amnesia ,
apathy ,
depression ,
increased appetite , aggravated
depression ,
suicide attempt , and
confusion
have been reported frequently.
Increased libido ,
aggressive reaction ,
paranoia ,
drug dependence ,
depersonalization ,
hallucination , euphoria,
psychotic depression ,
delusion ,
paranoid reaction ,
emotional lability ,
panic reaction , and
psychosis
have been reported infrequently.
Catatonic
reaction,
withdrawal syndrome
and
melancholia
have been reported rarely.
Delirium
has been reported to be temporally associated with citalopram treatment. Hepatic
side effects including
necrosis
have been reported rarely. Renal side effects
including
acute renal failure
have been reported. Other side effects occurring upon discontinuation of citalopram have been reported, particularly when the discontinuation has been abrupt.
These withdrawal effects have included
dysphoric
mood ,
irritability ,
agitation ,
dizziness ,
sensory disturbances
including unfavorable smell,
anxiety ,
confusion ,
headache ,
lethargy ,
emotional lability , insomnia, and
hypomania .
Side Effects to Watch Watch closely for the following side effects and notify your physician immediately should any of these develop: Abnormal heart rate, fluttering in the chest, weakness, faintness, dizziness or loss of consciousness (signs of a serious condition called "torsade de pointe or QT prolongation" in which irregular heartbeats occur) Abnormal bruising or signs of bleeding such as bleeding from the gums, nose, digestive tract, vagina (females), faintness, dizziness, loss of consciousness, or rash (signs of problems with blood clot formation) Lab and Diagnostic Tests If certain symptoms develop, ask your physician whether you need the following lab tests or other diagnostic tests (if you've not already had them): Monitor serotonin Blood tests to assess normal clotting - in people who develop signs of bleeding such as abnormal bruising or signs of bleeding including bleeding from the gums, nose, digestive tract, vagina (females), faintness, dizziness, loss of consciousness, or rash EKG - if abnormal heartbeats (rapid slow or irregular) develop References Product Information.
