Risperdal
may cause
transient ischemic attack or "TIA" (condition that mimics a stroke but lasts for less than 24 hours - caused by a temporary lack of adequate blood circulation to the brain - can cause temporary signs of brain dysfunction including one-sided weakness, numbness, loss of sensation; changes in vision, hearing, taste; speech problems or slurred speech; balance problems; dizziness; weakness in facial muscle and tongue; facial or eyelid drooping; confusion; etc)
(rare) . Elderly people with
dementia . This drug may also cause the following symptoms that are
related
to
transient ischemic attack or "TIA" : Agranulocytosis (a severe sudden deficiency of white blood cells - may cause serious infections, sudden fever, chills, sore throat, mouth ulcers, sore/swollen gums, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, skin infections; low blood pressure/shock, rapid pulse, blood infection, etc)   Agranulocytosis Stroke caused by blockage of the arteries that supply blood to the brain (can cause signs of brain dysfunction including one-sided weakness, numbness, loss of sensation; headache and vomiting; changes in vision, hearing, taste; speech problems or slurred speech; balance problems; dizziness; weakness in facial muscle and tongue; facial or eyelid drooping; loss of consciousness; coma)   Stroke caused by blockage of the arteries that supply blood to the brain
(rare) . Increased risk in people with a history of
dementia Cholinergic side effects (caused by drugs that stimulate the part of the nervous system - "autonomic nervous system" - that controls muscles of the internal organs such as the heart, stomach, glands, and blood vessels - can cause a drop in blood pressure, abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea, and shock/stoppage of the heart)   Cholinergic side effects
(rare)
Medical Source Information Yellow
highlights indicate symptoms related to
transient ischemic attack or "tia" . In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience,
leucopenia/neutropenia
and
agranulocytosis
have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents.
Possible risk factors for
leukopenia/neutropenia
include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia.
Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of risperidone should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.
In addition, based on data from four placebo controlled trials conducted in elderly patients (n=1230), cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g.,
stroke ,
transient ischemic attack ), including fatalities, have been reported in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.
In placebo controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with risperidone compared to patients treated with placebo.
Risperidone has not been shown to be safe or effective in the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.
Additional information on these and other clinical trials conducted in elderly patients can be obtained by calling 1-800- JANSSEN (800-526-7736).
Cardiovascular side effects have frequently included
tachycardia ,
hypertension , and
hypotension .
Palpitation ,
AV block , and
myocardial infarction
have also been reported.
Ventricular tachycardia ,
angina pectoris ,
premature atrial contractions , T wave inversions,
ventricular extrasystoles ,
syncope ,
edema , ST depression,
myocarditis ,
venous thromboembolism , and
bradycardia
have been reported rarely.
Prolongation of the QT interval
has been reported in some patients.
One fatal
cardiac event
following initiation of risperidone therapy has been reported.
Cerebrovascular events (e.g.,
stroke
and
transient ischemic attack ), including fatalities, have rarely been reported and then primarily in elderly patients with dementia- related psychosis.
An increased risk of mortality, possibly due to
heart failure
or
sudden death , has been reported with the use of atypical antipsychotic agents, including risperidone, in the treatment of behavioral disorders in the elderly patient with dementia.
However, it should be noted that conflicting data exist regarding an increased risk of mortality and use of risperidone in elderly dementia patients.
During postmarketing surveillance,
retinal artery occlusion
in the presence of abnormal arteriovenous anastomosis has been reported following injection of long-acting risperidone. Collective data gathered from 17 placebo-controlled clinical studies (n=5106) involving the use of atypical antipsychotic agents, including risperidone, for the treatment of behavioral disorders in the elderly patient with dementia showed a risk of death 1.6 to 1.7 times greater in the drug- treated patient than in the placebo- treated patient.
The average length of duration for the trials was 10 weeks with the cause of death in the majority of cases, though not all, reported as either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature.
Similar results (i.e., increased risk of mortality with atypical antipsychotics) were reported in another meta-analysis involving elderly dementia patients that consisted of 15 randomized, placebo-controlled trials (n=3353) of 10 to 12 weeks in duration.
Risperidone is not approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of behavioral disorders in elderly patients with dementia.
However, in contrast, the results of another meta-analysis of 6 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials (n=1721) found a nonsignificant increase in overall mortality in elderly dementia patients treated with risperidone.
The results of a large retrospective cohort study appear to indicate that atypical antipsychotic agents (i.e., risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine, quetiapine) increase the risk of
venous thromboembolism
in elderly patients; however, these events seem to be rare.
Based on data from four placebo controlled trials conducted in elderly patients (n=1230), cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g.,
stroke ,
transient ischemic attack ), including fatalities, have been reported in elderly patients with dementia- related psychosis.
In placebo controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with risperidone compared to patients treated with placebo.
Risperidone has not been shown to be safe or effective in the treatment of patients with dementia- related psychosis.
Additional information on these and other clinical trials conducted in elderly patients can be obtained by calling 1-800- JANSSEN (800-526-7736).
However, the association between the use of atypical antipsychotics (i.e., risperidone, olanzapine) and the risk of cerebrovascular events appears to be somewhat controversial.
The results of a case-control study found no increased risk of cerebrovascular events in elderly patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Nervous system side effects have frequently included
insomnia
(26%),
dystonia
(18%),
akathisia
(16%),
extrapyramidal symptoms
(17%),
headache
(14%),
dizziness
(11%),
parkinsonism
(6%),
asthenia
(4%),
somnolence
(3%), and

(2%).
Increased dream activity ,
nervousness ,
impaired concentration ,
increased sleep
duration,
dysarthria ,
vertigo ,
stupor ,
paraesthesia ,
confusion , and
amnesia
have also been reported.
Delirium ,
withdrawal syndrome ,
yawning ,

cholinergic
syndrome ,
hypoesthesia ,
tongue paralysis ,
leg cramps ,
torticollis ,
hypotonia ,
coma ,
migraine ,
hyperreflexia ,
choreoathetosis ,
seizures , neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, and sleep- related eating disorder (SRED) have been reported rarely.
Side Effects to Watch Watch closely for the following side effects and notify your physician immediately should any of these develop: Abnormal heart rate, fluttering in the chest, weakness, faintness, dizziness or loss of consciousness (signs of a serious condition called "torsade de pointe or QT prolongation" in which irregular heartbeats occur) Abnormal bruising or signs of bleeding such as bleeding from the gums, nose, digestive tract, vagina (females), faintness, dizziness, loss of consciousness, or rash (signs of problems with blood clot formation) Lab and Diagnostic Tests If certain symptoms develop, ask your physician whether you need the following lab tests or other diagnostic tests (if you've not already had them): Monitor white blood cell count, complete blood count and complete blood count Blood tests to assess normal clotting - in people who develop signs of bleeding such as abnormal bruising or signs of bleeding including bleeding from the gums, nose, digestive tract, vagina (females), faintness, dizziness, loss of consciousness, or rash EKG - if abnormal heartbeats (rapid slow or irregular) develop glucose - check before starting treatment and then periodically References Fatal cardiac event following initiation of risperidone therapy.
