The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, including citalopram, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists.
Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).
Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes.
Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms.
Worsening of depression
and/or increased
suicidal thinking
or behavior may always be a possibility in patients treated with antidepressant medications, particularly those being treated for depression.
Anxiety ,
agitation ,
panic attacks ,
insomnia ,
irritability ,
hostility , impulsivity,
akathisia
(severe
restlessness ),
hypomania , and
mania
have been reported in patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric.
It is unknown if these symptoms are a precursor to either worsening of depression or the emergence of suicidal impulses; however, there is concern that patients who experience one or more of these symptoms may be at increased risk for worsening
depression
or
suicidality .
Although the FDA has not concluded that antidepressant drugs cause worsening depression or suicidality, health care providers should be aware that worsening of symptoms could be due to the underlying disease or might be a result of drug therapy.
General side effects including
fatigue
(5% to 6%),
fever
(2%), and
asthenia
(1%) have been reported.
Hot flushes ,
rigors ,
alcohol intolerance ,
syncope , and
influenza-like symptoms
have been reported infrequently.
Hay fever
has been reported rarely.
Chest pain
has been reported to be temporally associated with the use of citalopram.
Serotonin syndrome
has been reported in two patients who were concomitantly receiving linezolid (a reversible nonselective MAOI). Gastrointestinal side effects
including
nausea
(up to 21%),
diarrhea
(8%), and
dyspepsia
(5%) have been reported.
Increased saliva
and
flatulence
have been reported frequently.
Gastritis ,
gastroenteritis ,
stomatitis ,
eructation ,

Side Effects to Watch Watch closely for the following side effects and notify your physician immediately should any of these develop: Abnormal heart rate, fluttering in the chest, weakness, faintness, dizziness or loss of consciousness (signs of a serious condition called "torsade de pointe or QT prolongation" in which irregular heartbeats occur) Abnormal bruising or signs of bleeding such as bleeding from the gums, nose, digestive tract, vagina (females), faintness, dizziness, loss of consciousness, or rash (signs of problems with blood clot formation) Lab and Diagnostic Tests If certain symptoms develop, ask your physician whether you need the following lab tests or other diagnostic tests (if you've not already had them): Monitor serotonin Blood tests to assess normal clotting - in people who develop signs of bleeding such as abnormal bruising or signs of bleeding including bleeding from the gums, nose, digestive tract, vagina (females), faintness, dizziness, loss of consciousness, or rash EKG - if abnormal heartbeats (rapid slow or irregular) develop References Product Information.
