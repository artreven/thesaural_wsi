DNA Tests Prove that Shrunken Heads are Real

Shrunken Heads
have been one of the long debated phenomena of Anthropology. People have long questioned whether or not they were legitimate relics of head hunting practices or elaborate hoaxes. Shrunken Heads have long been reported as the gruesome trophies of head hunting tribes in Asia, the Pacific Islands, and South America (as well as in Europe, but in far more distant past). The last documented cases of Head Hunting took place in Papua New Guinea. Although long band, the outbreak of
Kuru , a degenerative nerve disorder transmitted through human tissue, put that the last nails in the metaphorical coffin.
Although Head Hunting is well documented, the process of ‘shrinking heads’ was strongly guarded by the natives who performed the rituals and process of ‘head shrinking.’ New evidence presented by  Gila Kahila Bar-Galm Ph.D.
and her colleagues have demonstrated, through extensive DNA evidence, that a remarkably well preserved human shrunken head is indeed authentic (most shrunken heads, estimated at 80%) are fakes.
