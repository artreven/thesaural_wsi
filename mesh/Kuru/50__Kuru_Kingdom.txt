Railway zones

zones.

Delhi
Indian Railways is divided into zones, which are further sub-divided
into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from
six to eight in 1951, nine in 1952, and finally 16 in 2003. Each zonal
railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a
divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-seven divisions.
The Kolkata Metro is owned and operated by Indian
Railways, but is not a part of any of the zones. It is administratively
considered to have the status of a zonal railway.
Each of the sixteen zones, as well as the Kolkata Metro, is headed by
a General Manager (GM) who reports directly to the Railway Board. The
zones are further divided into divisions under the control of Divisional
Railway Managers (DRM). The divisional officers of engineering,
mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts,
personnel, operating, commercial and safety branches report to the
respective Divisional Manager and are in charge of operation and
maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the Station
Masters who control individual stations and the train movement through
the track territory under their stations' administration.

Recruitment
and training
With approximately 1.6 million employees, Indian Railways is the
country's single largest employer.
Staff are classified into gazetted (Group A and B) and non-gazetted
(Group C and D) employees.
The recruitment of Group A gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission
through exams conducted by it.
The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways
is done through 19 Railway Recruitment Boards which are controlled by
the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB).
The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared
between six centralised training institutes.

Indian Railways manufactures much of its rolling
stock and heavy engineering components at its six manufacturing
plants, called Production Units, which are managed directly by the
ministry. As with most developing economies, the main reason for this
was the policy of import substitution of expensive
technology related products when the general state of the national
engineering industry was immature. Each of these six production units is
headed by a General Manager, who also reports directly to the Railway
Board.
There exist independent organisations under the control of the
Railway Board for electrification,
modernisation and research and design, each of which is headed by a
General Manager. A number of Public Sector
Undertakings, which perform railway-related functions ranging from consultancy to ticketing, are also under the
administrative control of the Ministry of railways.
Technical details
Track
Indian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676mm broad
gauge which is wider than the 1,435mm standard gauge; the 1,000mm metre
gauge; and two narrow gauge
762
mm (2 ft 6 in)
and
610 mm (2
ft)
. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to
160 km/h.
The total length of track used by Indian Railways was about
111,600 km (69,300 mi) while the total route length of the network was
63,273 km (39,316 mi) on 31 March 2008.
About 28% of the route-kilometre and 42% of the total track kilometre
was electrified on 31 March 2008.
Broad
gauge is the predominant gauge
used by Indian Railways.
Broad gauge is the predominant gauge
used by Indian Railways. Indian
broad gauge— 1,676 mm (5 ft 6 in) —is
the most widely used gauge in India with 96,851 km of track length
(86.8% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 51,082 km of
route-kilometre (80.7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges) on
31 March 2008.
In some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000mm) is
common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge had
11,676 km of track length (10.5% of entire track length of all the
gauges) and 9,442 km of route-kilometre (14.9% of entire route-kilometre
of all the gauges) on 31 March 2008.
The Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly
terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost
considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge.
Narrow gauges had a total of 2,749 route-kilometre on 31 March 2008. The
Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Nilgiri Mountain Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway
are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge.
The share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been
steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to more
than 83% in 2010 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45%
(24,185 route-km) to less than 13% in the same period and the share of
narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. However, the total
route-kilometre has increased by only 18% (by just 10,000 km from 53,596
route-km in 1951) in the last 60 years. This compares very poorly with
Chinese railways, which increased from about 27,000 route-km at the end
of second world war to about 90,000 route-km in 2010, an increase of
more than three-fold. More than 28,000 route-km (34% of the total
route-km) of Chinese railway is electrified compared to only about
18,000 route-km of Indian railways. This is an indication of the poor
state of Indian railways where the funds allocated to new railway lines
are meagre, construction of new uneconomic railway lines are taken up
due to political interference without ensuring availability of funds and
the projects incur huge cost and time overruns due to poor
project-management and paucity of funds.
Sleepers (ties) used are made of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast
iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on few older lines. The
prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were
extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways
divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature.
The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan,
where the difference may exceed 70°C.
Traction
As of March 2008, 18,274 km of the total 63,273 km route length is
electrified.
Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 V AC traction through overhead catenary
delivery.
A major exception is the entire Mumbai section, which uses 1,500 V DC.
and is currently undergoing change to the 25,000 V AC system. Another
exception is the Kolkata Metro, which uses 750 V DC delivered
through a third rail.
Traction voltages are changed at two places close to Mumbai. Central Railway
trains passing through Igatpuri switch from AC to DC using a neutral
section that may be switched to either voltage while the locomotives are
decoupled and swapped. Western Railway
trains switch power on the fly, in a section between Virar (DC)
and Vaitarna
(AC), where the train continues with its own momentum for about 30 m
through an unelectrified section of catenary
called a
dead zone .
All electric engines and EMUs operating in this section are the
necessary AC/DC dual system type (classified "WCAM" by Indian Railways).
Services
Passenger
A DMU Train
Indian Railways operates about 9,000 passenger trains and transports
20 million passengers daily across twenty-eight states and two union territories. Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, and Meghalaya
are the only states not connected by rail. A standard passenger train
consists of eighteen coaches, but popular trains can have up
to 24 coaches.
24 Coached Malwa Express
Coaches are designed to accommodate anywhere from 18 to 108
passengers, but during the holiday seasons and/or on busy routes, more
passengers may travel in unreserved coaches. Most regular trains have
coaches connected through vestibules.
However, 'unreserved coaches' are not connected with the rest of the
train via any vestibule.

Reservation against cancellation
service is a provision for
shared berth in case the travel ticket is not
confirmed.
Accommodation classes
An 'Open' type [3+3] Chair Car
Several long trains are composed of two to three classes of travel,
such as a 1st and 2nd classes which have different pricing systems for
various amenities. The 1st Class refers to coaches with separate cabins,
coaches can be air-conditioned or non air-conditioned.
An AC 1 Class coach
Further, other AC classes can have 2 or 3 tier berths, with higher
prices for the former, 3-tier non-AC coaches or 2nd class seating
coaches, which are popular among passengers going on shorter journeys.
In air-conditioned sleeper classes passengers are provided with
sheets, pillows and blankets. Meals and refreshments are provided, to
all the passengers of reserved classes, either through the on-board
pantry service or through special catering arrangements in trains
without pantry car. Unreserved coach passengers have options of
purchasing from licensed vendors either on board or on the platform of
intermediate stops.
The amenities depend on the popularity and length of the route.
Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the
Western style.
The following table lists the classes in operation. Not all classes
may be attached to a rake though.
Class
Description
1A
The
First class AC : This is the most expensive
class, where the fares are on par with airlines. Bedding is included
with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on
popular routes between metropolitan cities and can carry 18 passengers.
The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy
features like personal coupes.
2A
AC-Two tier : Air conditioned coaches with
sleeping berths, ample leg room, curtains and individual reading lamps.
Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the
width of the coach then the gangway then two berths longways, with
curtains provided to give some privacy from those walking up and down.
Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48
passengers.
FC
First class : Same as 1AC, without the air
conditioning. This class is not very common.
3A
AC three tier : Air conditioned coaches with
sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three
tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of
eight. They are slightly less well appointed, usually no reading lights
or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64
passengers in broad gauge.
CC
AC chair car : An air-conditioned seater coach
with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.
EC
Executive class chair car : An air-conditioned
seater coach with a total of four seats in a row used for day travel
between cities.
SL
Sleeper class : The sleeper class is the most
common coach, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These
are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In
broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach. Railways have modified
certain Sleeper Coaches on popular trains to accommodate 81 passengers
in place of regular 72 passengers. This was done in order to facilitate
benefits like clear the Passenger rush and simultaneously earn more
revenue. But this has got lukewarm response with criticism from the
travellers and railways has decided to remove them.
2S
Seater class : same as AC Chair car, but with
bench style seats and without the air-conditioning.
G
or
UR
General
or
Unreserved : The cheapest
accommodation, with seats made of pressed wood and are rarely cushioned.
Although entry into the compartment is guaranteed, a sitting seat is
not guaranteed. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route
if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket. These coaches are
usually very crowded.
A typical sleeper class coach
At the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's
cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver
and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the
train departs. A standard passenger rake generally has four general
compartments, two at the front and two behind, of which one is
exclusively for ladies. The exact number varies according to the demand
and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the
back. In some trains a separate mail compartment is present. In
long-distance trains a pantry car is usually
included in the centre. A new class; Economy AC three tier is introduced
in the Sealdah-New Delhi Duronto train.
Notable trains
and achievements
A train on the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway
There are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on IR — the Chatrapati
Shivaji Terminus
and the Mountain railways
of India. The latter is not contiguous, but actually consists of
three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:
The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a
narrow gauge railway in West
Bengal.
The Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a metre
gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil
Nadu.
The Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge
railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh.
The
Palace on Wheels
is a specially
designed train, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting
tourism in Rajasthan. On the same lines, the Maharashtra government
introduced the
Deccan Odyssey
covering various tourist
destinations in Maharashtra and Goa, and was
followed by the Government of Karnataka which
introduced the
Golden Chariot
train
connecting popular tourist destinations in Karnataka
and Goa.
However, neither of them has been able to enjoy the popular success of
the Palace on Wheels.
The
Samjhauta Express
is a train that runs
between India and Pakistan. However, hostilities between the two
nations in 2001 saw the line being closed. It was reopened when the
hostilities subsided in 2004. Another train connecting Khokhrapar
(Pakistan) and Munabao (India) is the
Thar
Express
that restarted operations on February 18, 2006; it was
earlier closed down after the 1965 Indo-Pak war. The Kalka Shimla Railway till
recently featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for
offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.

The
Lifeline Express
is a special train
popularly known as the "Hospital-on-Wheels" which provides healthcare to
the rural areas. This train has a carriage that serves as an operating
room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two
that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country,
staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.
Among the famous locomotives, the
Fairy Queen
is the oldest
operating locomotive in the world today, though it is operated only for
specials between Delhi and Alwar.
John Bull , a locomotive older
than Fairy Queen, operated in 1981 commemorating its 150 th
anniversary. Kharagpur railway station also has the distinction
of being the world's longest railway platform at 1,072 m (3,517 ft).
The Ghum station along the Darjeeling Toy Train route is the second
highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam
locomotive.
The Mumbai–Pune Deccan Queen has the oldest running dining car
in IR.
The
Himsagar Express , between Kanyakumari and Jammu Tawi,
has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways
network. It covers 3,745 km (2,327 mi) in about 74 hours and 55 minutes.
The
Bhopal Shatabdi Express
is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 150 km/h
(93 mph) on the Faridabad–Agra section.
The fastest speed attained by any train is 184 km/h (114 mph) in 2000
during test runs.
The
Rajdhani Express
and
Shatabdi Express
are the superfast, fully
air-conditioned trains that give the unique opportunity of experiencing
Indian Railways at its best. In July 2009, a new non-stop train service
called Duronto Express was announced by the railway
minister Mamata Banerjee.
Fares and ticketing
Fares on the Indian Railways across categories are among the cheapest
in the world. In the past few years, despite a recessionary
environment, the Indian Railways have not raised fares on any class of
service. On the contrary, there has been a minor dip in fares in some
categories.
Ticketing services are available at all major and minor railway
stations across India. In 2003, Indian Railways launched online
ticketing services through the IRCTC website.
Apart from E-tickets, passengers can also
book I-tickets that are basically regular printed tickets, except that
they are booked online and delivered by post.
Tourism
Main article: IRCTC#Tourism
IRCTC takes care of the tourism operations of the Indian Railways.
The Indian Railways operates several luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels, Golden Chariot, Royal Orient Express and Deccan Odyssey; that cater mostly to foreign tourists. For
domestic tourists too, there are several packages available that cover
various important tourist and pilgrimage destinations across India.
Freight
A single line rail bridge
IR carries a huge variety of goods ranging from mineral ores,
fertilizers and petrochemicals, agricultural produce, iron & steel,
multimodal traffic and others. Ports and major urban areas have their
own dedicated freight lines and yards. Many important freight stops have
dedicated platforms and independent lines.
Indian Railways makes 70% of its revenues and most of its profits
from the freight sector, and uses these profits to cross-subsidise the
loss-making passenger sector. However, competition from trucks which
offer cheaper rates has seen a decrease in freight traffic in recent
years. Since the 1990s, Indian Railways has switched from small
consignments to larger container movement which has helped speed up its
operations. Most of its freight earnings come from such rakes carrying
bulk goods such as coal, cement, food grains and iron ore.
Indian Railways also transports vehicles over long distances. Trucks
that carry goods to a particular location are hauled back by trains
saving the trucking company on unnecessary fuel expenses. Refrigerated
vans are also available in many areas. The "Green Van" is a special type
used to transport fresh food and vegetables. Recently Indian Railways
introduced the special 'Container Rajdhani' or CONRAJ, for high priority
freight. The highest speed notched up for a freight train is
100 kilometres per hour (62 mph) for a 4,700 metric tonne load.
Recent changes have sought to boost the earnings from freight. A
privatization scheme was introduced recently to improve the performance
of freight trains. Companies are being allowed to run their own
container trains. The first length of an 11,000-kilometre (6,800 mi)
freight corridor linking India's biggest cities has recently been
approved. The railways has increased load limits for the system's
225,000 freight wagons by 11%, legalizing something that was already
happening. Due to increase in manufacturing transport in India that was
augmented by the increase in fuel cost, transportation by rail became
advantageous financially. New measures such as speeding up the
turnaround times have added some 24% to freight revenues.
Dedicated Freight
Corridor
Ministry of Railways have planned to construct a new Dedicated
Freight Corridor (DFC) covering about 2762 route km on two corridors,
Eastern Corridor from Ludhiana to Sone Nagar and Western Corridor from
Jawahar Lal Nehru Port Mumbai to Tughlakabad/Dadri along with
interlinking of two corridors at Khurja. Upgrading of transportation
technology, increase in productivity and reduction in unit
transportation cost are the focus areas for the project.
“Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCC)” is a
special purpose vehicle created to undertake planning &
development, mobilization of financial resources and construction,
maintenance and operation of the Dedicated Freight Corridors. DFCC has
been registered as a company under the Companies Act 1956 on 30 October
2006.
Rail budget and
finances
A sample ticket
The Railway Budget deals with planned infrastructure expenditure on
the railways as well as with the operating revenue and expenditure for
the upcoming fiscal years, the public elements of which are usually the
induction and improvement of existing trains and routes, planned
investment in new and existing infrastructure elements, and the tariff
for freight and passenger travel. The Parliament discusses the policies and
allocations proposed in the budget. The budget needs to be passed by a
simple majority in the Lok Sabha (Lower House). The comments of the Rajya
Sabha (Upper House) are non-binding. Indian Railways is subject to
the same audit control as other government revenue and expenditures.
Based on anticipated traffic and the projected tariff, requirement of
resources for capital and revenue expenditure of railways is worked out.
While the revenue expenditure is met entirely by railways itself, the
shortfall in the capital (plan) expenditure is met partly from
borrowings (raised by Indian Railway Finance Corporation) and the rest
from Budgetary support from the Central Government. Indian Railways pays
dividend to the Central Government for the capital invested by the
Central Government.
As per the Separation Convention (on the recommendations of the
Acworth Committee), 1924, the Railway Budget is presented to the
Parliament by the Union Railway Minister, two days prior to the General Budget, usually around 26 February. Though
the Railway Budget is separately presented to the Parliament, the
figures relating to the receipt and expenditure of the Railways are also
shown in the General Budget, since they are a part and parcel of the
total receipts and expenditure of the Government of India. This document
serves as a balance sheet of operations of the Railways during the
previous year and lists out plans for expansion for the current year.
The formation of policy and overall control of the railways is vested
in Railway Board, comprising the
Chairman, the Financial Commissioner and other functional members of
Traffic, Engineering, Mechanical, Electrical and Staff departments.
Indian Railways, which a few years ago was operating at a loss, has,
in recent years, been generating positive cash flows and been meeting
its dividend obligations to the government, with (unaudited) operating
profits going up substantially.
The railway reported a cash surplus of INR 9000 cr in 2005, INR 14000
cr in 2006, INR 20,000 cr in 2007 and INR 25,000 cr for the 2007-2008
fiscal year. Its operating ratio improved to 76% while, in the last four
years, its plan size increased from INR 13,000 cr to INR 30,000 cr. The
proposed investment for the 2008-2009 fiscal year is INR 37,500 cr, 21%
more than for the previous fiscal year.
Budget Estimates-2008 for Freight, Passenger, Sundry other Earnings and
other Coaching Earnings have been kept at INR 52,700 cr, INR 21,681 cr,
INR 5,000 cr and INR 2,420 cr respectively. Maintaining an overall
double digit growth, Gross Traffic Earnings have been projected as INR
93,159 crore in 2009-10 (19.1 billion USD at current rate), exceeding
the revised estimates for the current fiscal by INR 10,766 crore.
Around 20% of the passenger revenue is earned from the upper class
segments of the passenger segment (the air-conditioned classes).
The Sixth Pay Commission was constituted by the Government of India
in 2005 to review the pay structure of government employees, and
submitted its recommendations in April 2008. Based on its
recommendations, the salaries of all Railways officers and staff were to
be revised with retrospective effect w.e.f. January 1, 2006, resulting
in an expenditure of over Rs. 13000 crore in 2008-09 and Rs. 14000 crore
in 2009-10. Consequently, staff costs have risen from 44% of ordinary
working expenses to 52%.
Issues
Most of the railway stations are in gross disrepair, dirty, outdated
and overcrowded. It is common to see passengers on trains hanging out
windows and even on the roof creating safety problems.
The interior of the trains are poorly maintained - "very dirty, broken
seats, filthy toilets, loose wires tangled in the passageways, chipped
paint, and the usual stinks."
The railway has not yet been successful in addressing the overcrowding,
cleanliness and other maintenance issues. Although accidents such as
derailment and collisions are less common in recent times,
many are run over by trains, especially in crowded areas. Indian
Railways have accepted the fact that given the size of operations,
eliminating accidents is an unrealistic goal, and at best they can only
minimize the accident rate. Human error is the primary cause, leading to
83% of all train accidents in India.
While accident rates are low - 0.55 accidents per million train
kilometre,
the absolute number of people killed is high because of the large
number of people making use of the network.
While strengthening and modernisation of railway infrastructure is in
progress, much of the network still uses old signalling and has
antiquated bridges.
Lack of funds is a major constraint for speedy modernisation of the
network, which is further hampered by diversion of funds meant for
infrastructure to lower-prioritised purposes due to political
compulsions.
In order to solve this problem, the Ministry of Railways in 2001
created a non-lapsible safety fund of Rs. 17000 crore exclusively for
the renewal of overaged tracks, bridges, rolling stock and signalling
gear.
In 2003, the Ministry also prepared a Corporate Safety Plan for the
next ten years with the objective of realising a vision of an
accident-free and casualty-free railway system. The plan, with and
outlay of Rs. 31835 crore, also envisaged development of appropriate
technology for higher level of safety in train operation.
Reforms and upgrades
One line Tunnel at Guntur division
Outdated communication, safety and signaling equipment, which used to
contribute to failures in the system, is being updated with the latest
technology. A number of train accidents happened on account of a system
of manual signals between stations, so automated signaling is getting a
boost at considerable expense. It is felt that this would be required
given the gradual increase in train speeds and lengths, that would tend
to make accidents more dangerous. In the latest instances of signaling
control by means of interlinked stations, failure-detection circuits are
provided for each track circuit and signal circuit with notification to
the signal control centres in case of problems.
Though currently available only in a small subset of the overall IR
system, anti-collision devices are to be extended to the entire system.
Aging colonial-era bridges and century-old tracks also require regular
maintenance and upgrading.
Comparison of different gauges common in India with the standard one,
which is not common in India
The fastest trains of Indian Railways, Rajdhani Express and Shatabadi Express face competition from
low-cost airlines since they run at a maximum speed of only
150 kilometres per hour (93 mph).
At least six corridors are under consideration for the introduction of
high speed bullet trains to India with expert assistance from France and
Japan.
IR is in the process of upgrading stations, coaches, tracks,
services, safety, and security, and streamlining its various software
management systems including crew scheduling, freight, and passenger
ticketing. Crew members will be able to log in using biometric scanners
at kiosks while passengers can avail themselves of online booking.
Initially, various upgrade and overhaul work will be performed at more
than five hundred stations, some of it by private contract. All metre
gauge lines in the country will be converted to broad gauge (see Project Unigauge). New LHB
stainless steel coaches, manufactured in India, have been installed in
Rajdhani and Shatabdi express trains.
These coaches enhance the safety and riding comfort of passengers
besides having more carrying capacity, and in time will replace
thousands of old model coaches throughout Indian Railways. More durable
and conforming polyurethane paint is now being used to enhance the
quality of rakes and significantly reduce the cost of repainting.
Improved ventilation and illumination are part of the new scheme of
things, along with the decision to install air brake systems on all
coaches. New manufacturing units are being set up to produce
state-of-the-art locomotives and coaches.
IR is also expanding its telemedicine network facilities to further
give its employees in far-flung and remote areas access to specialized
medicine. IR has also piloted Internet connectivity on the
Mumbai-Ahmedabad Shatabdi Express,
powered by Techno Sat Communications It is estimated that
modernisation of IR and bringing it up to international standards would
require US$280 billion in new upgrades and
investment from 2010 to 2020.
Sanitation in trains and stations throughout the system is getting
more attention with the introduction of eco-friendly, discharge-free,
green (or bio-) toilets developed by IIT Kanpur. Updated eco-friendly refrigerant is
being used in AC systems while fire detection systems will be installed
on trains in a phased manner. New rodent-control and cleanliness
procedures are working their way into the many zones of IR. Central
Railway's 'Operation Saturday' is gradually making progress, station by
station, in the cleanup of its Mumbai division.
Augmentation of capacity has also been carried out in order to meet
increasing demand. The number of coaches on each train have been
increased to 24, from 16, which increased costs by 28% but increased
revenues by 78%. The railways were permitted to carry 68 tons per wagon,
up from the earlier limit of 54 tons per wagon, thereby cutting costs.
The turnaround time for freight wagons was reduced from 7 days to 5 by
operating the goods shed 24X7, electrifying every feeder
line (this reduced time spent switching the engine from diesel to
electric or from electric to diesel). Reducing the turnaround time meant
that the Railways could now load 800 trains daily, instead of 550
trains daily. The minimum tonnage requirements were reduced allowing
companies to unload their cargo at multiple stops
