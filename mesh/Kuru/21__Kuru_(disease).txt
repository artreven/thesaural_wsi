Added like a biatch mofo.
My dad is a retired nurse who worked primarily with deformed and educationally subnormal kids, so he's given me a few things to look up.
The first is Harlequin-type ichthyosis, but the article doesn't contain any actual pictures, so here are a few (they're pretty horrendous; be prepared):
http://www.gfmer.ch/genetic_disease...st.php?cat3=729
I saw this defect on a gore site at first - a home video showing close-ups of a baby with this condition.
I assumed it was fake for many years.
Here's a similar video clip:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im0ohYH5zCU
[Kinda upsetting]
Donohue syndrome, aka Leprechaunism, is added too.
Again, no pics in the article, so here are a couple (nothing too upsetting here):
http://www.hinsdale86.org/staff/kga....SharplesOchoa/
Hurler syndrome is something I experienced first hand, a few kids in my neighbourhood had it and they were well-known/loved by pretty much everyone and were quite happy/contented all the time.
Kids with this condition don't live too long though, I still remember when each of them died.
Life's rather unfair.
Apert syndrome is added too, which causes malformation of the skull.
Encephalocele, aka cranium bifidum, is when the baby is born with its brain on the outside.
Article added!

Man hti is probably the disease that brought me into the topic of pathology etc. (along with Carcass of course...). It's just extremely fascinating how your body can deform by those soooooo small parts of your cells

You ever heard of this one, Gomli?:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinterkaifeck
I love that one.
I love a lot of the uber-paranormal ones, silly or not, like this one:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grinning_Man
There are a couple favorites I used to have but cant fucking remember the names for the life of me. One was about some Polish (or was he French? Might have been French) dude back in the early 20th century that had some extremely rare condition where he had to constantly gorge himself with food every few hours and if he didn't, he'd begin to starve. In his most desperate times he was known to eat herds of cats (usually while alive), screws, clothing, and even once, allegedly, a baby (a hospital he was staying at had a baby go missing. He was skinny, too. If anyone can find me this I will be forever in love with them.
EDIT: Paddy helped me find it
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrare
and, another:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Domery
Another great one was about some house in the midwest (I believe) that had some really interesting extraterrestrial activity. Err.

I've been quite fascinated by this sort of thing too, a fascination which began around about the same day I met you
I found a clip on YouTube of Omayra Sánchez (article above) and I'm holding back tears...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUE4q1dTqFU
Omayra Sánchez:
"Please, I want to say some words"
Male voice:
"Yes, go ahead"
Omayra Sánchez:
"Mother, if you﻿ are listening, I think you are. Pray so I can walk and these people can help me. Mama, I love you very much; papa, brother. Goodbye mother."
Jesus Christ.
I hope I have the balls this kid had when I'm about to die.
EDIT: Added your suggestions Dylster.

YOU'RE BORING! I think I really like it because of its peculiar evidence, paranormalness and unsolvedendence. I actually don't really believe in ghosts or much paranormal shit, but I find the idea and stories fascinating.
I had never heard of this Armin Meiwes fellow. Pretty interesting. What I find more interesting, however, is the psychology that goes on in someone who wants to be eaten and goes that far with it. Where does it come from? Why? How prevalent is such a condition?

Here are a couple of screen captures from the Meiwes video, but be warned that they're pretty graphic:

Let nothing disturb you.
Let nothing make you afraid.
All things are passing.
God alone never changes.
Patience gains all things.
If you have God you will want for nothing.
God alone suffices.
Couldn't agree more!
Well, except for the God part, unless by "God" she means "Wesley Snipes".

Yeah, but I find most of Freud's theories (mainly the sexual ones) so laughably ridiculous it hurts. Avoid him unless you want a good laugh. I was lucky enough to have Psych (AP, even) at my HS, too. Currently getting my degree in it.

I have a really big list of these that was posted on 7chan a long time ago. It included most of the links in the original post, but there were many more I think. I'll have to look for it. Might take some time though, I'm pretty sure it's on my second hard drive, which is a mess.
(Note: 7chan fucking sucks. I was only surfing there when I was temporarily banned from 4chan.)

s'al good, I think I got the original list from 4chan's /x/ board, which is one of the more hilarious boards. I am scared though to know what you're doing to be banned from 4chan.

lol /x/ can be entertaining sometimes if you're just looking for creepy/weird shit, like the above list of links. But it gets boring seeing thread after thread of
"herp derp, look at this photo I took of a shadow in my basement. I think it might be the ghost of somebody who committed suicide 50 years ago"
I was somewhat hesitant to give an explanation as to why I was banned for a month (from all boards) but oh well, I'll divulge. I was in one of those
you laugh you lose
threads on /b/, and some guy dropped a photo of a young boy who had been forced to pose wearing a bra and panties and lipstick (by some pedo I'll assume) Now I wasn't able to tell what the photo was just by looking at the thumbnail, so I clicked it, and when I saw the photo I lol'd really hard because the guy even went as far as making him do his hair up in pigtails. I replied to the image with "FUCKING LOL" or something to that effect, and a few minutes later I was banned for "replying to a ceepee image". Apparently they will ban even for replying to something that is against the rules, because it bumps the image to the top in the thread preview (which I wasn't aware of). But seriously though, banned for that? The photo didn't even show genitals or sexual activity. I wouldn't even consider that ceepee.
I feel pretty bad for laughing though, the kid looked pretty unhappy having to pose like that. The guy probably didn't even pay him. Oh well, my ban is over. Lesson learned.

As far as I know the video was either destroyed after the trial or it is under extremely tight security somewhere.
In other words, it's not on the interwebs.
It's the one gore video I'd actually look forward to seeing, though.

HOLY FACK! It's unfortunate the video isn't available
This song would have made an excellent soundtrack to edit into the video.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7oGGud2Jk4
I'm sure Gomli knows the lyrics
Any chances of the video being released to the public after the trial? Probably not any time soon, but sometimes evidence such as videos and photos become public domain after a certain amount of time (usually decades.)
A good example is the security footage of the Columbine shootings. Only a few minutes of the video was ever released to the public (the cafeteria footage) but there is much more that is locked away. Some of the unseen footage includes students being shot (some at point-blank range) and the library footage of the two gunmen committing suicide. The judge ordered that the footage is not to be released to the public for 20 years. That was decided in 1999, so it will be released in 8 years. I wonder why he decided 20 years, or why it will even be released at all? I don't want to see the innocent students being killed, but I've had a very odd curiosity to see the suicide footage ever since I saw the two photos of their bodies in a newspaper when I was 11. That footage would definitely make the Budd Dwyer video obsolete!

Hmmm normally there's no chance to get those evidences released even after 50 years or something like that. But I gotta ask a friend of mine who's a lawyer

Yeah, he wasn't all complete nonesense and he definitely pushed the development in the field. Check out Aaron T. Beck. He rules.

I think the thought behind it being released is the public has a right to see what happened, and I agree with that pretty much. The two decades wait is probably to let the pain and shock subside as much as possible. I personally don't want to see it, but I probably will out of morbid curiosity when it comes out. Fuck, I remember the day that happened, it was surreal. And I don't think anything will make that Budd Dwyer obsolete. Something about that footage makes me feel really, really uncomfortable. Just with the cold quickness he did it, how he did it, the good quality of the footage, and watching the life just drop out of his body.
Totally missed this:
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/wor...ult-family.html . Jesus. Much like the Fritz children, I can't even begin to imagine how much therapy and help they'll need to even become remotely normal. I don't even know if that's possible. Its really incredible how much damage you can do to a person's psyche and I think heavier sentences (read: life) should be put into place when children are involved as you've essentially fucked them for live.

Yeah I agree with that. The public does have a right to see what happened. And I figured the two decades was probably to let the dust settle. It would be tasteless to release the footage soon after the incident took place. I don't really remember much about the day it happened, but I do have that vivid memory of seeing the two fairly graphic closeups of the perpetrators bodies in the newspaper. Being eleven, it was the first time I had ever seen something so extreme. I was shocked, yet so goddamn fascinated at the same time lol.
Yeah, now that I think about it, I don't think anything would ever make the infamous Dwyer video obsolete. I must have been around late 12/early 13 the first time I saw that. I remember downloading the video through some P2P program (I think it was Morpheus) but the filename was somewhat misleading, it just said something like
'politician pulls gun on live TV' . So I assumed that it was some guy throwing a wobbler and taking hostages or whatever. When I watched the video, I had no idea what to expect, and when he popped himself and hit the ground I was in shock. I just sat there staring at the blood running from his nose/head like a fucking volcano. I started to have a bit of a panic attack and deleted the video immediately. God damn it was difficult to get to sleep that night, haha. Those images just wouldn't stop playing through my head.
Incidentally, were you aware that Budd was a
jazz trombonist
in his spare time?
Oh, also... in regards to my post above
(2011-03-17 23:57)
I should have clarified that I
do not
find child abuse funny. I was actually quite disturbed by what I saw, but it was only the pigtails that made me laugh. I have a very unusual sense of humour in the sense that I can see something totally horrendous (and be disturbed by it) but if there is one small thing about it that's unusual or weird like that, I'll explode with lulz. Talk about mixed emotions. But yeah, in all seriousness, there are two things I'll definitely draw the line with, child and animal abuse.
Well, I hope I cleared that up a bit so I don't seem like a
totally
revolting person.
Time to make some tea and go drop a brick.

I had the same list you posted blitz, but I excised quite a few of the articles because they were kinda pointless, such as ones about local legends involving swamp creatures and the like.
I'll add them for sure, I was just explaining their absence until now haha.
I'll also add Dylan's when I can be bothered.
Cunt.
In the meantime I've added a fascinating article about Bobbi, bunny and DameFraMorkum:
Vish Kanya .
These female assassins gradually made themselves immune to poison, and had a heavy dose of said poison in their blood, and would then use their girly bits to poison enemies to death via sexitimes.
I would pretty much make this top of my list of possible suicide methods, bumping "drowned in girl cum" down to second place.

Here's a classic I didn't see in the list; a good reminder of why you should never, ever, respect an authority just because they're the authorities.

Hahaha how is this even worthy of its own article?
And why do the spacemen in images like these always look exactly like the perceptions of what spacemen look like from that particular era?
This one looks very much like it's from a shitty sci-fi movie from the 60s, which is when the pic was taken.
If it was taken in the 80s it'd probably look like this:

The film is actually pretty interesting yet disturbing.
Have you guys ever wondered why experimentation with human beings mustn't be practised?
Of course not like in the third Reich against the will of someone, but I think there'd be enough strange dudes giving their okay to get stem cells of an axolotl injected to see if they can reproduce organs by themselves...just a thought
Edit: AH YEAH AND HOLY FUCK WHAT A CASE OF ANIMAL ABUSE!! What a strange feeling that must have been when your head is separated from your body and just laying there

If I was going to be executed or something I'd love to try this shit out before the big day.
That is, having my head severed but kept alive.
As long as it doesn't hurt too much.
Just think, I could suck my own cock!
I wouldn't feel it, but maybe I'd have that thing amputees get, where they experience phantom pain and sensations in the limbs they no longer have.
Man, I'd eat my fucking cock like Gomers eats German sausage aka cock.

Added all of the above.
My mum had a cluster headache-grade migraine once when we were in a cab on the way home from shopping.
It was fucking traumatic, she was literally screaming in pain and gripping the sides of her head, flailing around like she had a grenade inside her skull, and both I and the cab driver pretty much shat ourselves haha.
She was in agony until the ambulance arrived and pumped her full of morphine.
She's on meds for migraines, but she has a special pill she only takes when she starts tasting copper and her vision starts to blur, because that's when the biggie arrives.
The big migraine I mean, not my fat cock, although it has been known to blur vision and give off a weird taste.

You're turning into Dan Aykroyd, minus the talent.
I added an article about Freddie Scappaticci aka
Stakeknife , a British double-agent with balls the size of fists.
I also added Giant's Causeway, which is said to be "worth seeing, but not worth going to see".
I live about 20 minutes from it and even I have never bothered going to see it.
Ooo, just added David Reimer.
This kid was circumcised badly and, much like PST, ended up having to have his ruined cock lopped off and a shiny new vagina installed instead.
And, just like PST, upon reaching adolescence he developed severe emotional problems.
Unlike PST, however, he did the honourable thing and killed himself.
It's never too late!

20 minutes by car!
It's probably closer to 45 minutes to be honest, and if I'm not honest I'd say it's about 8 light years away, but I am so I won't.
My aunt and uncle recently bought a place on the coast, and it's walking distance from the Causeway.
If I'm down there this summer - and why the fuck wouldn't I be?
I'M SOCIAL
- I might consider walking down if I can be arsed which I probably won't be.
If I wanna see a load of mouldy hexagonal structures I'll just press my turds through a Play-Doh Fun Factory.

I know someone who totally isn't me that runs one of the biggest distributors of customizable used panties and underwear in the United States. He basically employs a few hundred women and men to wear a customer-picked pair of panties from anywhere between 1 - 30 days straight, depending on the price paid, model (if chosen, as its a pricier option instead of the "anonymous" model feature) and time specified. His company is one of the most successful in this business because of the awesome prices and high product quality. However, it can also get quite costly when it gets around the 30 day mark as it requires the employee to not wash their genital areas for the amount of time requested and, as I'm sure you can all imagine, most people don't like to not shower for such a long time. As mentioned above, you have the option to choose the model that you'd like to wear the panties. You can select the model from his extensive employee catalog that offers pictures, weight, height, age, sexual activity, physical activity, and even diet. This adds a completely new dimension to what you can order besides the panty type, color, size, etc.
He also sells what he calls "The Cake". If you don't want the panties for whatever reason, or just want the more "concentrated" product, you can have the 30 day crusty panty remnants scrapped off from the fabric (which is also soaked and wrung) and put inside a little perfume jar which you can then use to spray on anything you like. Its under his "Let Them Smell Cake!" product line.
His newest line of product is his "Winning Streak" underwear line (a tacky marketing name with the Sheen reference, I think, but hey, whatever sells). This is something I've been paid to do myself, actually! Basically, I wore a tight pair of white (usually Fruit of the Loom, cotton) underwear for a few days while only doing a very minimal amount of wiping so that you get those lovely brown streaks running up and down the backside. The customer also requested that I run 2.5 miles each day so that was interesting (and lucrative!). I had no intention of getting involved in this but as a joke he put my picture up on his site as one of the models you could commission to wear the underwear and I was picked a few times! They were all uncomfortable 5 days but it paid for this computer I am typing to you on.

How much would you charge to give yourself a big gash with a razor blade, then let it get infected and send me the smelly pus covered bandage dressings?
