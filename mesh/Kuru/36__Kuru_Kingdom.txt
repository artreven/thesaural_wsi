Yadav kingdoms
The
lineage of several rulers of ancient and medieval India is traced to Yadu. These
include Lord Shri Krishna, as well as historical rulers such as King Porus, who
fought
Alexander the Great in the Battle of the Hydaspes River. As Raghav
(Raghuvanshi) of Suryavansha, The Yaduvanshi is one of the sub-divisions of
Chandravanshi Rajputs.

Scholars, such as Robert Sewell, believe that
the rulers of Vijayanagara Empire were Kurubas (also known as Yadavas). Some
early inscriptions, dated 1078 and 1090, have implied that the Hoysalas of
Mysore were also the descendants of the original Yadava clan, by referring to
the Yadava vansa (clan) as Hoysala vansa.
Ruins of Vijayanagar Empire-World Heritage
Sites
J.N. Singh Yadav, a famous historian, gives the following
account in his Yadav's Through The Ages, “The Hoysalas ruled illustriously for
over three centuries and have left in the country imperishable monuments of art
and culture. They were family of kings who ruled over practically the whole of
the Kannada country at the height of their power. They scheduled the hill tribes
known as Malepas in the Western Ghats and they assumed the title
'Maleparoleganda'. The account of their origin can be traced in some of their
inscriptions. They claimed Sosevura (Sasakapura of Sanskrit writers) as their
birthplace.
This place
has been identified with Angadi of Mudigere Taluk in chikamanglura district. It
has been mentioned as the seen of the incident between Sala and the tiger. When
Sala,' an ornament of the Yaduvamsa' (Yaduvamsojvala tilakan) was worshiping the
goddess Vasantike of Sasakapura, a tiger came from the forest. The holiman
Sodutta, who was there, gave him his fan saying 'Poysala' (Strike, Sala). Sala
killed the tiger. From that time the name of Poysala become the designation of
the Yadava kings (E.C. VOL. VI, Cm. 20.). Almost the same account, though
differing in certain details, is found in many of their inscriptions. According
to another version, when Sala was hunting along the slopes of the Sahya
mountains (or the Western
Ghats), he was astonished to see a hare (SKt. Sasa)
pursuing a tiger, while he was walking alone saying to himself, 'this is heroic
soil', a holy muni near by, being afraid of the tiger, called out 'Poy-Sala' and
before it could proceed the length of a span Sala slew it with his sword (E.C.,
VOL. V, PART I B1. 171.). It is after this incident that the place came to be
known as Sasakapura.
The founder of the Wodeyar dynasty, Vijaya, also
claimed descent from the Yadu and took on the name Yadu-Raya. They ruled South
India from Mysore. Mysore Palace is one of the beautiful landmark of the
country. On the main Gate of Mysore palace, please see Lord Krishna's deity.
According to S.C. Raychoudhary (author of Social, Cultural and Economic History
of India), a noted historian, "The Pandya kingdom generally associated with the
Pandus of the Mahabarata covered the districts of Madura and Tinnivelly as well
as certain portions of south Travancore."
Mysore Palace
Dr. V.
Manickam in his path-breaking work Kongu Nadu gives an expanded version of his
doctoral thesis submitted to the university of Madras as follows, "It was noted
that the pastoral people (Ayar) of the mullai land in Kongu formed the major
component of the Vellalar community of the medieval period. It is Dr. V.
Manickam thesis that the Vellalar of Kongu were nothing but the pastoral people
of Kongu, of course,with some additions (p 553). However, We come across
references to Idaiyar of Kiranur, alias Kolumam Konda Cholanallur (SII : 5:283),
Kon from the same place (SII : 5: 265,267,269), and Yatavar in two epigraphs
from Chevur (Eye Copy 94,98). Further, there are also references to
Tiruvayappadi nattar, which indicate the supra-local activities of the herdsmen
discussed in chapter 15. The presence of the herdsmen, with the titles as found
in the macro region, may be explained as survivors of the pastoral people of the
pre-chola period who were reluctant to integrate themselves in the new setup or
new additions.
Trikuta Hill under Yaduvanshi king
Rawal Jaisal laid the
foundation stone of Jaisalmer in 1156 A.D. He hailed from the Yaduvanshi Rajput
kin group. The city has an interesting legend associated with it, according to
which, Lord Krishna, the head of the Yadav Clan, foretold Arjuna, one of the
Pandava brothers of the Mahabharata that a remote descendent of the Yadav Clan
would build his kingdom atop the Trikuta Hill. His prophecy was fulfilled in
1156 AD when Rawal Jaisal, abandoned his fort at Lodurva and founded a new
capital Jaisalmer, perched on the Trikuta Hill. However, historical facts
contradicts this claim, because Trikuta Hill is actually near Deccan, a range of
hills bordering Nashik, where one Abhira dynasty, Traikuta, directly claiming
descent from ancient Haihai Yadav King, Nala, in 5th century A.D., had built
kingdom on original Trikuta Hill, and hence assumed the title Traikuta.
Jaisalmer Fort
The name of the State of
Haryana may have been derived from its ancient inhabitants: Abhirayana. The name
`Abhira` may stem from a-bhira meaning fearless, i.e Yadav.
Yadav dominated areas in National Capital Region
(NCR) includes Gurgaon, Manesar, Behror, Bawal, Dharuhera, Pataudi, Bhiwadi,
Badshahpur, Kosli, Alwar and Rewari.
Jijabai- The mother of
Shivaji blessing him
The great Maratha
King Shivaji and his mother Jijabai was a Yadav.
Major cities of Famous Chandravanshi Kings
Champapura
in Bhagalpur was founded by Sahasra Arjuna, of
the
Haihaya
tribe. This was Mahishmati on the Nerbudda, still existing in Maheswar. The
rivalry between the Lunar race and that of the Suryas of Ayodhya, in whose aid
the priesthood armed, and expelled Sahasra Arjuna from Mahishmati, has been
mentioned. A small branch of these ancient Haihayas yet exist in the line of the
Nerbudda, near the very top of the valley at Sohagpur, in Baghelkhand, aware of
their ancient lineage; and, though few in number, are still celebrated for their
valour.
Dwarka
Kusasthali Dwarka, the capital of Krishna, was
founded prior to Prayag, to Surpur, or Mathura. The Bhagavat purana attributes
the foundation of the city to
Anrita, the brother of Ikshwaku ,
of the Solar race, but states not how or when the Yadus became possessed
thereof.
The ancient annals of the Jaisalmer family of the
Yadu or Jadon stock give the priority of foundation to
Prayag , next to
Mathura , and last to
Dwarka . All these
cities are too well known to require description; especially Prayag, at the
confluence of the Yamuna and Ganges. The Prasioi were the descendants of Puru's
of Prayag, visited by Megasthenes, ambassador of Seleucus, and the principal
city of the Yadus, ere it sent forth the four branches from Satwata. At Prayag
resided the celebrated Bharat, the son of Sakuntala.
Surpur
We are assured by Alexander's historians that the
country and people round Mathura, when he invaded India, were termed Surasenoi.
There are two princes of the name of Sursen in the immediate ancestry of
Krishna ; one his grandfather, the other eight generations anterior Which of
these founded the capital Surpur,1 whence the country and inhabitants had their
appellation, we cannot say Mathura and Cleisobara are mentioned by the
historians of Alexander as the chief cities of the Surasenoi. Though the Greeks
sadly disfigure names, we cannot trace any affinity between Cleisobara and
Surpur.
Hastinapur
The city of
Hastinapur
was built by
Hastin
a name celebrated in the Lunar dynasties. The name of
this city is still preserved on the Ganges, about forty miles south of Hardwar
where the Ganges breaks through the
Shiwalik
mountains and enters
the plains of India. This mighty stream, rolling its masses of waters from the
glaciers of the Himalaya, and joined by many auxiliary streams, frequently
carries destruction before it. In one night a column of thirty feet in
perpendicular height has been known to bear away all within its sweep, and to
such an occurrence the capital of Hastin is said to have owed its ruin.
Hastin sent forth three grand branches,
Ajamidha, Dvimidha, and Purumidha . Of the two last we lose
sight altogether ; but Ajamidha's progeny spread over all the northern parts of
India, in the Panjab and across the Indus. The period, probably one thousand six
hundred years before Christ.
Panchala
From Ajamidha in the fourth generation, was
Bajaswa, who obtained possessions towards the Indus, and whose five sons gave
their name, Panchala, to the Panjab, or space watered by the five rivers. The
capital founded by the younger brother, Kampila, was named Kampilnagara.*
The descendants of Ajamidha by his second wife,
Kesini, founded another kingdom and dynasty, celebrated in the heroic history of
Northern India. This is the Kausika dynasty.
Kannauj
Kusha had four sons, two of whom, Kushanabha and
Kushambha, are well known to traditional history, and by the still surviving
cities founded by them. Kushanabha founded the city of Mahodaya on the Ganges,
afterwards changed to Kanyakubja, or Kanauj, which maintained its celebrity
until the Muhammadan invasion of Shihabu-d-din (a.d. 1193), when this overgrown
city was laid prostrate for ever. It was not unfrequently called Gadhipura, or
the ' city of Gadhi.' Kusamba also founded a city, called after his own name -
Kausambi. The other sons built two capitals, Dharmaranya and Vasumati.
Rajgriha and Hastinapur
Kuru had two sons, Sudhanush and Parikhshit. The descendants of the former
terminated with Jarasandha, whose capital was Rajagriha (the modern Rajmahal) on
the Ganges, in the province of Bihar.
From Parikhshita descended the monarchs Santanu and Balaka : the first
producing the rivals of the Great War, Yudhishthira and Duryodhana ; the other
the Balakaputras.
Duryodhana, the successor to the throne of Kuru. resided at the ancient
capital, Hastinapura; while the junior branch, Yudhishthira, founded
Indraprastha, on the Yamuna or Jumna, which name in the eighth century was
changed to Delhi.
The sons of Balaka founded two kingdoms : Palibothra, on the lower Ganges;
and Aror on the eastern bank of the Indus, founded by Sahl. Aror, or Alor, was
the capital of Sind in remote antiquity : a bridge over the stream which
branched from the Indus, near Dara, is almost the sole vestige of this capital
of the Sogdoi of Alexander
Uru or Turvasu lineage Kingdoms
One great arm of the tree of Yayati remains
unnoticed, that of Uru or Urvasu, written by others Turvasu. Uru was the father
of a line of kings who founded several empires.
Virupa, the eighth prince from Uru, had eight sons, two of whom are
particularly mentioned as sending forth two grand shoots,
Druhyu and Bhabru. From Druhyu a dynasty was established in the north.
Aradwat, with his son Gandhara, is stated to have founded a State : Prachetas is
said to have become king of Mlecchhades, or the barbarous regions. This line
terminated with Dushyanta, the husband of the celebrated Sakuntala, father of
Bharat, and who, labouring under the displeasure of some offended deity, is said
by the Hindus to have been the cause of all the woes which subsequently befell
the race. The four grandsons of Dushyanta, Kalanjar, Keral, Pand, and Chaul,
gave their names to countries.
Kalanjar
Kalanjar is the celebrated fortress in
Bundelkhand, so well known for its antiquities, which have claimed considerable
notice.
Kerala
Of the second, Kerala, it is only known that in
the list of the thirty-six royal races in the twelfth century, the Kerala makes
one, but the capital is unknown.
Pandya
The kingdom founded by Pand may be that on the
coast of Malabar, the Pandu-Mandal of the Hindus, the Regia Pandiona of the
geographers of the west, and of which, probably,
Madurai
is the
modern capital.
Chaul
Chaul is in the Saurashtra peninsula, and on the
coast, towards Jagat Khunt,' the world's end,' and still retains its
appellation
Angades
Anga.—The other shoot from Bhabru became
celebrated. The thirty-fourth prince, Anga, founded the kingdom of Angadesa, of
which. Champapuri was the capital, established about the same tune with Kanauj,
probably fifteen hundred years before Christ. With him the patronymic was
changed, and the Anga race became famous in ancient Hindu history ; and to this
day Angdes still designates the Alpine regions of Tibet bordering on Chinese
Tartary.
Prithvisena terminates the line of Anga; and as
he survived the disasters of the Mahabharata War, his race probably multiplied
in those regions, where caste appears never to have been introduced.
Nakula's military campaigning to the west
MBh 2.31
Nakula, lead his campaign from
Indraprastha
to the western regions, to collect tribute for
Yudhisthira 's
Rajasuya
sacrifice.
Nakula , the
Pandava
general, brought under
subjection the mighty Gramaniya that dwelt on the shore of the sea, and the
Suras and the
Abhiras
that dwelt on the banks of the
Saraswati , and all those
tribes that lived upon fisheries, and those also that dwelt on the mountains,
and the whole of the country called after the five rivers, and the mountains
called Amara, and the country called Uttarayotisha and the city of Divyakutta
and the tribe called Dwarapala.
Markandeya's prediction of
powerful Dyansty in the future
MBh 3.187
Sage
Markandeya
explains to
Yudhisthira
about the rise of western tribes, and their influence on Bharata Varsha or
Ancient India
The
Andhhas , the
Sakas ,
the Pulindas, the
Yavanas , the
Kamvojas , the
Valhikas
and the
Abhiras , then become (in
Kali Yuga , which is future for
Yudhisthira ), possessed of
bravery and the sovereignty of the earth.
Abhiras in the List of Kingdoms of
Bharata Varsha
MBh 6.9
In
Bhishama Parava , while narrating to
Dhritarashtra
the names of
the
Mountains ,
Rivers ,
Provinces
etc of Bharata
Varsha, Sanjaya includes the Abhiras in the list of its provinces and seems to
locate them somewhere between the Mallas, Valhikas and the Aprantas (6,9).
i.e.
....the
Valhikas
,
the Vatadhanas, the
Abhiras , the Kalajoshakas; the Aparantas,
the Parantas, the Pahnabhas, the Charmamandalas; the Atavisikharas, the
Mahabhutas.....
In the same Parava, there is also reference to
the
Sura-Abhiras
who are listed among the
tribes
of north such as the
Yavanas , the
Chinas , the
Kambojas , the
Darunas, and many Mleccha tribes, the Sukritvahas, the Kulatthas (Kulutas), the
Hunas , and the
Parasikas , the Ramanas,
and the Dasamalikas, the
Daradas , the
Kasmiras , the
Khasiras , the
Bharadvajas , and the diverse
tribes of
Kiratas , the Tomaras, the
Hansamargas, and the Karamanjakas etc (6.9).
Participation in the Kurukshetra War
MBh 7.20
Bhutasarman, and Kshemasarman, and the valiant
Karakaksha, and the
Kalingas , the
Singhalas , the
Easterners, the Suras, the
Abhiras , the Daserakas, the
Sakas ,
the
Yavanas , the
Kambojas , the
Hangsapadas, the
Surasenas , the
Daradas , the
Madras , and the
Kalikeyas , with hundreds
and thousands of elephants, steeds, cars, and foot-soldiers were stationed at
its neck of the military formation formed by the
Kaurava
general
Drona
in
Kurukshetra War .
Impact of Bhargava Rama on Abhira
tribe
MBh 14.29
Dravidas
and
Abhiras
and
Pundras , together with
the Savaras, became fallen to low status, though those men who had Kshatriya
duties assigned to them in consequence of their birth, falling away from those
duties due to fear of
Bhargava Rama .
Balarama's pilgrimage along Saraswati
River
MBh 9.37
Then
Balarama
proceeded to Vinasana
where the
Sarasvati River
hath
become invisible in consequence of her contempt for the
Suras , the
Abhiras . And since the Sarasvati, in consequence of such
contempt, is lost at that spot, the Rishis, for that reason, always name the
place as Vinasana. Having bathed in that tirtha of the Sarasvati, the mighty
Bala Rama
then proceeded to Subhumika, situated on the excellent bank of the same
river.
Tarikh-i-Sorath
Mandalika the Abhira Ruler of Somnath, was also
among the confederate princes who pursued Mahmud's army. Tarikh i sorath states
Mahmud could not stand his onslaught and rather fled to save his life.
"Shah Mahmud took to his heels in dismay and
saved his life, but many of his followers of both sexes were captured.... Turk,
Afghan and Mughal female prisoners, if they happened to be virgins, were
accepted as wives by the Indian soldiers.... The bowels of the others, however,
were cleansed by means of emetics and purgatives, and thereafter the captives
were married to men of similar rank. Low females were joined to low men.
Respectable men were compelled to shave off their beards, and were enrolled
among the
Shekhawat
and the Wadhel
tribes of
Rajputs ; whilst the lower kinds
were allotted to the castes of Kolis, Khantas, Babrias and Mers."
History of Ahir Kingdoms
Ahir kings ruled territory of the present-day
India and beyond. At the beginning of the Christian era (CE), the invading
Scythians
and
Kushans
forced
most of the Ahirs to lower Rajasthan in the Arbuda (Aravali region). In
Marubhumi (Marwar), Saurashtra and Maharashtra areas, they served the local
rulers and established their own rule. Ahirs laid the foundation of Ahir Batak
town, which was called
Ahrora
and was located in Central provinces, and
Ahirwar
in
Jhansi district in 108 CE. Rudramurti Ahir became the chief of the army and
later on the King. Madhuriputra, Ishwarsen and Shivdutta were well-known kings
of this lineage. Ishwarsena, a great Ahir general, became master of Western
Deccan
in place of
the famous Satavahanas. He took the title of
Rajan
and an era was named after
him. His descendants continued to rule for nine generations. This generation of
Abhira kings ruled for 167 years till last of them was ousted by their
Traikutaka feudatory in AD 415. It is generally supposed that Traikutika were a
different dynasty of Abhira, and hence are sometimes called Abhira-Traikutika.
Indradutta, Dahrasena & Vyaghrasena were well known kings from this dynasty.
Traikutikas were known for their Vaishnava faith, who claimed to be
Yadav
of
Haiheya branch and Dahrasena performed Ashvamedha yajna too Abhira Era started
by Ishwarsena in AD 249, continued with them and was called Abhira-Traikutika
era. This era was later continued by Kalachuri Dynasty, calling it Kalachuri
era, and later Kalachuri-Chedi era. After the rule of five traikuta kings, they
retired to central provinces and assumed the name Haiyhaya ( Chedi ) and
Kalachuri . Historians call
this entire era as Abhira-Traikutika-Kalachuri-Chedi era
In a cave inscription at
Nashik , references were made to
an Ahir prince named Ishwersena, son of Shivdutta. Another inscription, found at
Gunda and dated 181 CE, in the reign of the Kshatrapa Rudrasinha, described his
general Rudrabhuti, who was called Ahir. When the
kathis
arrived in Gujarat, they found the greater part of the country controlled by
Ahirs. The old fort
Asirgarh (short of Asa Ahir
Garh), in Khandesh, retains the name of its founder Asa Ahir. For centuries the
Ahirs were eclipsed as a political power in
Haryana
until the time of the
Pratihara dynasty.
Ahirs ruled the whole of Haryana under the
Mogul
rule and later were
declared as independent kings. Vātsyāyana also noted the Abhira kingdoms in the
Kama
Sutra .Ahirs also ruled beyond the geographical borders of present-day
India, as kings of the hilly terrain of Nepal. Eight kings of the first Ahir
dynasty ruled Nepal, the first being
Bhuktaman
and the last
Yaksha
Gupta . Owing to pastoral disputes, this dynasty was replaced by another Ahir
dynasty. The second Ahir dynasty had a succession of three kings: Badasimha,
Jaymati Simha, and Bhuban Simha. Their rule ended when the
Kirati
invaders defeated
Bhuban Simha.
M.S.A Rao states that the
Allahabad
iron pillar
inscription of
Samudragupta
(fourth
century A.D) mentions the Abhiras as one of the tribal states of west and south
west India, who paid homage to the emperor (churn, 1943:81). A fourth century
(A.D) inscription found in
Nashik
speaks of an Abhira king,
and there is proof that in the middle of the fourth century the Abhiras were
settled in eastern
Rajputana
and
Malwa . Similarly, when the Kathis
arrived in
Gujarat
in the eighth century,
they found the greater part of the country in the possession of the Ahirs. The
Mirzapur district
of
the
United
Provinces
has a tract known as
Ahraura , named after the Ahir,
and near
Jhansi ,
another piece of country was called Ahirwar. The Ahirs were also kings of Nepal
at the beginning of the Christian era.
Khandesh
and the
Tapti
valley were other regions
where they were kings.
Ahir Raj in Moughal Era
Ahirs ruled the whole of
Haryana
under the
Mogul
rule and later were
declared as independent kings. A majority of Ahirs occupy the
Rewari
Thesil of
Gurgaon
district. When Shershah
Suri fought against the Mughal chief Humayun, the Ahir ‘Khap’ helped Humayun
under the leadership of Rao Rura Singh. When
Humayun
occupied the throne of
Delhi again, he made Rao Rura Singh the Chief of a
Pargana . The Head Quarters of
the Pargana was named Rewari. During the reign of Mughals, the Ahir State
continued as an ally, and Rao Tej Singh made a name with them. In 1803 Lord Lake
reduced the power and position of the Mughals and captured the Ahir State, then
ruled by Puran Singh.King
Rao Tula Ram
was born in
1825. He took over at age 13 after Rao Puran Singh died. Rao Tula Ram was
ambitious, increasing his power and territory. Raja Mahar Singh of Balabgarh was
the administrator and defender of Delhi during the mutiny of 1857. Rao Raja Tula
Ram was active in the areas of Rewari and Narnaul, where he roundly defeated the
British.
When the forces of Jaipur,
Patiala ,
Jind
and
Kapurthala
arrived to help
the British, Rao Tula Ram had to leave Rewari, Kanund, and Narnaul. He made an
alliance with Scindia and Tatiya Tope to continue fighting. A conference of the
revolutionaries was called and Rao Raja Tula Ram was appointed to seek help from
foreign countries. Rao Tula Ram reached the shore in disguise. He went to
Basra
by sea, where he
met with the
Russian
envoy and Khedive, and
went on to
Iran .
Although the government gave him a royal reception, they did not commit forces
to his aid. After that, Rao Tula Ram wen to
Kabul
and struggled for six years.
He raised a united army of
Pathans
and Indian
revolutionaries. He died before returning to India. The Emir of Kabul sent his
ashes to Rewari with two Sardars. In 1150, Vighararaja IV, a
Chauhan
from Rajasthan, forced
the people to become his feudal vassals. In 1181 they were defeated by
Prithviraj Chauhan ,
but only after they had put up a tough resistance.
Some scholars seek ethnic connections between the
Yadav
and
Jews . According to
Stephen Knapp, the Greeks referred to the
Jews
as
Judeos , or
Jah
deos
or
Yadavas , meaning people of Ya or descendants of Yadu, one
of the sons of
Yayati . In his book
The Holy Kabbalah , Arthur Edward Waite linked the mystical work with
the
Vedas . That
Yadavas were possessors of great mystical knowledge was described in the
Bhagvad Gita . It
said the same knowledge was given to
Manu
(first man on earth),
Surya
and
Ikshavaku
(ancestor of Lord Rama) in ancient times. The Abhira were
believed to be a link between eastern and western religions. There are
compelling proofs of both
Mauryan
and
Guptas
being Abhirs.
The
Kshatriya
religion was
propounded by Krishna, and no reference was found before him. We only find
Rajnya as the term alternatively used for it ( Bhagwad Gita
is a reduced
form of hidden knowledge—
Gope
—which has its root in
Shiva ). Later on, many Kshatriyas
were founded on the philosophy of
yadavanshis , as revealed in the
Bhagavad Gita .
Ahirs of Delhi NCR
For centuries the Ahirs were eclipsed as a
political power in Haryana until the time of the Pratihara dynasty. In time they
became independent rulers of Southwest Haryana. Although the Ahirs and Yadavas
form one group, the former are an important community of Haryana, but
numerically they constitute less than 10% of the total population. Most of them
live in the region around
Behror ,
Alwar ,
Rewari ,
Narnaul ,
Mahendragarh
and
Gurgaon
which is
therefore known as
Ahirwal
or the abode of
Ahirs.Ahirs synonyms are Yadav and
Rao Sahab . Rao Sahab is only
used in Ahirwal region consisting of territories of few villages of Delhi,
Southern Haryana & Behrod area of
Alwar
district (Rajasthan). Ahir's
of this region are mainly in armed forces. Yadav dominated areas in National
Capital Region(NCR) includes
Gurgaon ,
Noida ,
Manesar ,
Behror ,
Bawal ,
Dharuhera ,
Pataudi ,
Bhiwadi ,
Badshahpur ,
Kosli ,
Alwar
and
Rewari .
Ahirwal-Belt
This area starts from South of Delhi to South
west of Haryana and east of Rajasthan areas include Gurgaon till Alwar in
Rajasthan.The modern day
Gurgaon
city has more than 40
Yadav villages where they are also nicknamed as
Rao
or Rao Sahab.Thousands of Yadav
villagers from Gurgaon and
Manesar
are
millionaires
today after
selling their agricultural land to private builders and HUDA and many have
become property dealers.
Rao Birender Singh
Yadav was the second chief minister of Haryana and
Chaudhary Brahm
Prakash
Yadav was the first chief minister of Delhi.
Some of the villages in Ahirwal with Yadav
prominence are:-
Delhi
has Haider Pur, Jwala Heri, Rajokri, Madipur,
Surehra, Samaypur, Badli, Najafgarh, Todapur, Khaira, Sakarpur, Bagdola, Gudhana
and Kapashera.
Gurgaon
has Wazirabad, Samaspur, Kanhai, Badshapur,
Islampur, Sukhrali, Hyatpur, Shilokhra, Tikri, Teekli, Sahraul, Khedki, Daula,
Fazilpur, Sikohpur , Nathupur, Chakkarpur, Sikanderpur, Nawada, Mohmmadpur,
Dundahera, Iqbalpur, Smalkha, Bamdoli, Mirpur, Sashand and Manesar.
Noida
has Sarfabad, Garhi Chaukhandi,Morna ,Hoshiyarpur
,Patwari,Hoshiyarpur, Khanjarpur, Zahilabad,Rasoolpur Navada, Partha, Sorkhla
and Naharpur etc.
In Marubhumi (Marwar),
Saurashtra
and
Maharashtra
they served the
local rulers and established their own rule. Ishwarsena, a great Ahir general,
became master of Western Deccan in place of the famous Satava-hanas. He took the
title of
Rajan
and an
era was named after him. His descendants continued to rule for nine

(1802–1888) was an extraordinary military commander of his time. He was a close
friend of
Hari Singh Nalwa
and
famous Punjab ruler
Maharaja Ranjit Singh .In
his early career he trained
Sikh
Khalsa
army. After the death of
Maharaja Ranjit Singh he fought in both the
First
and
Second Anglo-Sikh
Wars , due to his extreme hatred towards Britishers after the defeat of Sikhs
he started giving military training to the farmers of
Narnaul
and
Mahendragarh
region.
King
Rao Tula Ram
of Rewari was
born on 9 December 1825 in a Royal Rao Bhadur Nirpur Yadav family which belonged
to "Rao Bhadur Ghari-Bolni" in village Rampura ( Rewari ). His father was Puran
Singh and his mother's name was Gyan Kaur who was daughter of Great
Jat
ruler
Maharaja Ranjit
Singh . In 1857, Rao Tula Ram led the rebellion in
Haryana
along with his brother
Rao Bhadur Tula Ram of Ghari Bolni and Rao Gopal Dev of Nirpur.For centuries the
Ahirs were eclipsed as a political power in
Haryana
until the time of the
Pratihara
dynasty. In time they became independent rulers of Southwest Haryana. Although
the Ahirs and Yadavas form one group, the former are an important community of
Haryana, but numerically they constitute less than 10% of the total population.
Most of them live in the region around
Rewari ,
Narnaul ,
Mahendragarh
and
Gurgaon
which is
therefore known as
Ahirwal
or the abode of Ahirs.
Ahirs of Gujarat
There is a great concentration of Ahirs in Kutch:
of the 18 million Ahirs in India about 300,000 live in Kutch. There are four
main castes of Ahirs in
Kutch :
Pancholi ,
Prantharia ,
Mochhaya ,
Boricha , and
Sorathia . These
communities are mainly of farmers who once sold milk and ghee but who now have
diversified their businesses because of the irregularity of rain. Their mother
tongue is Gujrati.
Ahir/Jhadhavs of Maharashtra
1334) was an Indian dynasty, which at its peak
ruled a kingdom stretching from the Tungabhadra to the Narmada rivers, including
present-day Maharashtra, north Karnataka and parts of Madhya Pradesh, from its
capital at
Devagiri
(present-day
Daulatabad in Maharashtra).
Aharwar
The Aharwar are a
Hindu
caste found in North India.
They are said to be descended from Ahir tribe. The Ahars are one of the most
ancient martial tribes of India, who ruled over different parts of India and
Nepal since ancient times. In appearance, they proclaim their
Aryan
descent. They are tall and
wiry, have dark eyes, long noses, black hair and their complexion varies from
wheatish to dark brown.
A community of Hindu Kshatriya belong to Ahirwada
(Jhansi) are known as Ahirwar / Aharwar Kshatriya. It is considered as a very
progressive caste. Aharwar is also used as a surname (last name) by
Rajput
clan
belonging to the chandravanshi kshatriya lineage.
Ahirwar/Aharwar claim to be descendants of the
Chandravanshi Kshatriya Rajput.
Many Aharwar live in different regions of India
including
Delhi ,
Mathura ,
Ahmedabad ,
Murena ,
Agra , and
Jhansi . The Aharwar
was derived from Ahar. The Ahars are one of the most ancient martial tribes of
India, who ruled over different parts of India and Nepal since ancient
times.
Pune under Yadav Dynasty
With the downfall of the Rashtrakutas which ruled
Pune
from the 8th
century AD to the middle of the 10th century.It went under the control of the
Yadavs.The Yadavs ruled Maharashtra from 10th century AD to the end of the 13th
century.
Singhania ,
the Yadav ruler was a lover of literature and art. Sant Dnyaneshwar, a Bhakti
saint lived during this period. The Yadav rule came to an end with the coming of
Ala-ud-din Khilji .
Seuna Yadavas of
Devagiri
The
Seuna ,
Sevuna
or
Yadava dynasty
( 850
-
1334 ) was an
Indian
dynasty, which at its peak
ruled a kingdom stretching from the
Tungabhadra
to the
Narmada
rivers,
including present-day
Maharashtra , north
Karnataka
and
parts of
Madhya Pradesh , from its
capital at
Devagiri
(present-day
Daulatabad
in Maharashtra).
The Yadavas initially ruled as
feudatories of the
Western Chalukyas .
Around the middle of the 12th century, they declared independence and
established rule that reached its peak under Singhana II.
The foundations of
Marathi
culture were laid
by the Yadavas and the peculiarities of
Maharashtra 's social life
developed during their rule.
Etymology
The Seuna dynasty claimed descent from
the
Yadavas
and
therefore, its kings are often referred to as the "Yadavas of Devgiri". The
correct name of the
dynasty , however, is Seuna or
Sevuna. The inscriptions of this dynasty, as well as those of contemporary
kingdoms, the
Hoysala ,
Kakatiya dynasty
and
Western Chalukyas
call
them
Seunas . The name is probably derived from the name of their second
ruler, "Seunachandra".
The "Sevuna" (or Seuna) name was brought
back into use by
John Faithfull
Fleet
in his book
The dynasties of the
Kanarese
districts of the
Bombay Presidency from the earliest historical times to the Musalman conquest of
A.D. 1318 .
Origin
North India
The Seuna dynasty claimed descent from
the
Chandravanshi
Yadavas
of
north India. According to verse 21 of
Vratakhand
(a Sanskrit work by
Hemadri), the Seunas were originally from
Mathura
and later
moved to
Dwaraka . Hemdari calls them
Krishnakulotpanna
(i.e., descendants of Lord
Krishna ). The Marathi saint
Dnyaneshwar
describes them
as
yadukulvansh tilak . Some Seuna inscriptions call them
Dvaravatipuravaradhishvaras
("masters of Dvaravati or Dwaraka").
Several modern researchers, such as Dr. Kolarkar, also believe that Yadavas came
from North India. [
Maratha
According to scholars such as Prof.
George Moraes, V. K. Rajwade, C. V. Vaidya, Dr. A.S. Altekar, Dr. D.R.
Bhandarkar, and
J. Duncan M. Derrett ,
the Seuna rulers were of
Maratha
descent who patronized
the Marathi language.  Digambar Balkrishna Mokashi noted that the Yadava dynasty
was "what seems to be the first true Maratha empire". In his book
Medieval
India , C.V.Vaidya states that Yadavas are "definitely pure
Maratha
Kshatriyas ".
A stone inscription found at Anjaneri,
near
Nasik ,
suggests that a minor branch of the Yadava family ruled a small district, with
Anjaneri as its chief city. The inscription indicates that a ruler called
Seunadeva, belonging to the Yadava family, called himself
Mahasamanta
and made a grant to a
Jain
temple. Scholars such as Dr.
O. P. Varma, state that Yadavas were Marathi speakers and the period of their
rule was very important for the history of the Marathi. [
Jijabai
(the mother of
Shivaji , who
founded the
Maratha Empire ) belonged
to the clan of
jadhava s of
Sindkhed Raja , who also
claimed descent from the Yadavas.
Dhangar
There is a belief that Deoghur or
Doulatabad was built in AD 1203 by a
Dhangar
or herdsman who,
acquiring by some unusual good fortune, vast wealth was named by his brother
shepherds Raja Ram and soon after assumed the rank of a Raja.
Immigrants from Karnataka
Scholars such as C M Kulkarni,
Colin
Masica , and Shrinivas Ritti believe that the Seuna rulers were originally
Kannada -speaking
people. Linguist
Colin Masica
believes that
they originally used Kannada (along with Sanskrit) in their inscriptions, but,
by the time of the
Muslim
conquest , they had begun to patronize Marathi, and Marathi phrases or lines
began to appear in their inscriptions. Dr. Shrinivas Ritti speculates that the
Seunas were originally from a Kannada-speaking region and migrated northwards
owing to the political situation in the
Deccan .
Many Seuna rulers had Kannada names and
titles such as "Dhadiyappa", "Bhillama", "Rajugi", "Vadugi" and "Vasugi", and
"Kaliya Ballala". Some kings had names like "Singhana" and "Mallugi", which were
also used by the Southern
Kalachuri
dynasty. Records
show that one of the early rulers, Seunachandra II, had a Kannada title,
Sellavidega . The Seunas had very close matrimonial relationships with
royal Kannada families throughout their rule. Bhillama II was married to
Lachchiyavve, who was from a
Rashtrakuta
descendant
family in Karnataka. Vaddiga was married to Vaddiyavve, daughter of Rashtrakuta
chieftain Dhorappa. Wives of Vesugi and Bhillama III were
Chalukya
princesess.
Over five hundred inscriptions belonging
to the Seuna dynasty have been found in Karnataka, the oldest being of the rule
of Bhillama II. Most of these are in
Kannada language
and
script. Others are in the Kannada language but use
Devanagari
script. The Seuna
coins from the early part of their rule have Kannada legends. Scholars such as
Dr. O. P. Varma believe that Kannada was a court language, used along with
Marathi and Sanskrit.
During the rule of the Seunas, ruling
chieftains who were related to the Seuna kings were from Kannada-speaking
families, like the Seunas of Masavadi in present day
Dharwad . Dr. A. V. Narasimha
Murthy opined that during the later part of the
Rashtrakuta
rule from
Manyakheta ,
Seuna chieftains were despatched from the Karnataka region to rule near Nasik.
History
Feudatory
Seunas were once the
feudatories
of the
Rashtrakutas
and then of the
Western Chalukya. The founder of the Suena dynasty was Dridhaprahara, the son of
Subahu. According to Vratakhanda, his capital was Shrinagara. However, an early
inscription suggests that Chandradityapura (modern
Chandor
in the
Nasik
district) was the
capital.
The name Seuna comes from Dridhaprahara's
son, Seunachandra, who originally ruled a region called
Seunadesha
(present-day
Khandesh ). Bhillama II, a later
ruler in the dynasty, assisted
Tailapa III
in his war with
the
Paramara
king Munja. Seunachandra II helped
Vikramaditya VI
in
gaining his throne.
Bhillama V
Bhillama V ( 1173 - 1192 ), son of Mallugi, established
the sovereign Seuna kingdom. He took over the Chalukya capital of
Kalyani
in 1190
and founded
Devagiri
(now
Daulatabad )
as the capital of the Yadava dynasty.
The Seunas were bordered by aggressive
neighbours on all sides:
Paramara
Rajputs
of
Malwa
in the north,
Kakatiya dynasty
in the
east,
Hoysalas
in the south and
Solanki
Rajputs
of
Gujarat
in the west. As a
precaution, they built their citadel at Devagiri. The citadel was situated on a
hill rising 183 meters (300 meters according to John Keay). The hill was
enclosed by three lines of walls, each of which was defended by
moats
and
turrets . The outermost wall had a
circumference of 4.4 km.
Singhana II
Singhana II
1200 - 1247
C.E. is considered the
greatest ruler of the Yadava dynasty. During his rule the kingdom expanded from
Narmada
to
Tungabhadra , reaching its
zenith at the expense of
Hoysalas
in the south,
Kakatiya dynasty
in the
east,
Paramaras
and
Chalukyas
in the north.
He founded the town Shinghanapur (or
Singhanapur). He was a great patron of learning and literature. He established
the college of astronomy to study the work of celebrated astronomer
Bhaskaracharya .
The
Sangita Ratnakara , an
authoritative
Sanskrit
work on
Indian
music
was written by
Sharngadeva
(or Shrangadeva)
during Singhana II's reign. He also patronized
Changadeva , the Kannada
poet Kamalabhava.
Ramachandra (Not Lord Ramchandra)
There is a belief that Deoghur or
Doulatabad was built in 1203 AD by a
Dhangar
or herdsman who
acquiring by some unusual good fortune vast wealth was named by his brother
shepherds Raja Ram and soon after assumed the rank of a Raja.
Ramachandra (or Ramadevarava or Raja
Ram), the grandson of Singhana II, ruled from 1271 to 1309 CE.
Hemadri
(or
Hemadpant ) was Ramachandra's
Shrikaranadhipa
(Chief Minister). He compiled the encyclopedic Sanskrit
work
Chaturvarga Chintamani . He is said to have built many temples in a
style known after him -
Hemadapanti . He also invented the Modi script
for writing Marathi. Hemadri wrote many books on
vaidhyakshastra
(medical science) and he introduced and supported
Bajra
cultivation.
In 1294,
Ala-ud-din Khalji
captured Devagiri. Khalji restored it to Ramachandra in return for his promise
of payment of a high
ransom
and an annual tribute.
However, this was not paid and the Seuna kingdom's arrears to the
Khalji
dynasty
kept mounting. In 1307, Khalji sent an army commanded by
Malik
Kafur
to Devagiri. Ramachandra was taken to Delhi. Khalji reinstated
Ramachandra in return for a promise to help Khalji subdue the Hindu kingdoms in
South
India . In 1309, Malik Kafur mounted an assault on the
Kakatiya dynasty
from
Devagiri.
Alauddin Khilji invaded Devagiri once
when he was the crown prince. Alauddin Khilji once again invaded Devagiri in
1306. The invincible Malik Kafur was on the spearhead of the army. He was
accompanied with Khwaja Haji. The governors of Malwa and Gujarat were ordered to
help Malik Kafur. The huge army conquered Devagiri almost without a battle.
Alauddin Khilji appointed Raja Ramchandra the governor of Devagiri. He was given
the title "Rai Rayan" (king of kings).
Fall of the kingdom
Ramachandra's successor Singhana III
challenged the supremacy of Khalji, who sent Malik Kafur to recapture Devagiri
in 1310. Singhana III was killed in the ensuing battle and Khalji's army
occupied Devagiri.
Muhammad Tughluq
subsequently renamed the city Daultabad. The kingdom was annexed by the Khalji
Empire in 1317.

Among the Seuna Yadava rulers, Sindhan,
Krishnadev, Mahadeva and Ramdev are considered as having been 'able'.

Literature
Marathi
The Yadavas of Devagiri patronised
Marathi which was their court language. Kannada may also have been a court
language during Seunachandra's rule, but Marathi was the only court-language of
Ramchandra and Mahadeva Yadavas. The Yadava capital Devagiri became a magnet for
learned scholars in Marathi to showcase and find patronage for their skills. The
origin and growth of
Marathi literature
is
directly linked with rise of Yadava dynasty. [
Their reign also saw the literary
development of Marathi. The origin and growth of Marathi literature is directly
linked to this period.
Some historians believe that prior to the
Yadava rule, both Marathi and Kannada had been used in Maharashtra;
subsequently, at least partly due to their efforts, Marathi became dominant.
Historian José Pereira has credited Yadavas with overthrowing the rule of
Kannada-speaking dynasties in Maharashtra.
Bhillama was the
founder of Yadava (Also known as Jadhav) dynasty although it was his grandson
Singhana, who made it the premier kingdom of Deccan. Singhana was great patron
of learning and literature. He established the college of astronomy to study the
work of celebrated astronomer Bhaskaracharya. We can read about his magnanimous
donations which are carved in stone (written in earliest Marathi language) slabs
in the temple of Goddess at Kolhapur in Maharashtra. Composition of famous works
of scholars like Hemadri (who was responsible for introducing a style of
architecture also called Hemandpanthi), Bopadeva and Dhnaneshwar (a prodigy who
at the age of 16 translated
Bhagavat Gita
from Sanskrit to Marathi,
perhaps the best and sweetest poetry ever written in Marathi) were composed
during reign of Yadava dynasty.
Bhillama V's son, Jaitrapal (or Jaitugi)
had Mukundaraja, the author of
Paramamrita
and
Vivekasindhu
as
his spiritual teacher.
Paramamrita
is considered the first systematic
attempt to explain the
Vendantic
principles in Marathi.
Vivekasindhu
is another exposition of Vedantic principles.
Mukundaraja's earliest works were completed in 1190 C.E. and Mahimabhatta wrote
Lilacharita
in
1238 .
The famous Marathi saint-poet
Dnyaneshwar
wrote
Dnyaneshwari , a
commentary on the
Bhagavad Gita
in
1290 , during
Ramachandra's rule. He also composed devotional songs called
abhanga s.
Dnyaneshwar gave a higher status to Marathi by translating the sacred
Geeta
from
Sanskrit . He
proudly said about Marathi:
I will speak my Marathi (language)
only with pride and I will give such Marathi words to the ardent listeners which
will even win bets against the nectar (amrit).
Hemadri invented the
Modi
script during this
period. Chakradhara propagated the Mahanubhava cult, using Marathi as the medium
for his religious teachings. The work of his followers are counted among the
first works of
Marathi literature .
Kannada
Many scholars believe Kannada was one of
the court languages during early Seuna times, as is evident from a number of
Kannada-language inscriptions (see,
Origin
section). Kamalabhava, patronised by Bhillama V wrote
Santhishwarapurana . Achanna composed
Varadhamanapurana
in
1198 . Amugideva,
patronised by Singhana II, composed many
Vachanas
or devotional
songs. Chaundarasa of
Pandharapur
wrote
Dashakumara Charite .
Sanskrit
The Sanskrit literary works created
during the Seuna period include:
Chaturvarga Chintamani
by Hemadri
Suktimuthavali
by Jalhana
Hammiramadhana
by Jayasimha Suri
Karnakutuhala
and
Siddhanta Shiromani
by
Bhaskaracharya
Anantadeva's commentaries on
Varahamihira 's
Brijajjataka
and
Brahmagupta 's
Brihatsputa siddhanta
Haripaladeva's

Indian Classical
Music , which bifurcates Indian classical music as
Hindustani Music
and
Carnatic Music
for the
first time, acknowledging the
Muslim
influence on Indian music.
Fort of Devagiri (Muslims renamed it to
Daulatabad)
Devgiri/Daulatabad
(meaning “City of Prosperity”),
is a city in
Maharashtra ,
India , about 16 kilometers
northwest of
Aurangabad . The
place was once known as
Deogiri , (circa the sixth century AD,
when it was an important uplands city along caravan route. Yadavas had capital
at Devagiri fort , perhaps the strongest fort of India. It is the best example
of medieval fort building style. In spite of its strength, it fell to the first
Muslim invasion of southern India. In 1294, Allauddin Khilji capured the fort
defeating Yadava king Ramchandra. Khilji extracted massive amounts of gold and
precious metals from Yadava king. Soon after in 1312 his general Malik Kafur
again invaded Devgiri followed by masacre of members of royal family. Thus Hindu
sovereignty in Maharashtra came to an end in 14th century after more than two
hundred years of glorious reign of Yadavas. Thus for the first time Maharashtra
was ruled by the Muslim invaders which was continued till Marathas again got
united and emerged as supreme power in seventeenth century under command of
Shivaji. Shown above is the nice example of a gold coin issued by Ramachandra
Deva which shows `Trishul" (trident) below the legends. Lotus is shown in middle
while conch is shown on top.
Deogiri was renamed as Daulatabad in 1327
by Muhammad Bin Tughluq. Starting 1327, it famously remained the capital of
Tughlaq dynasty , under
Muhammad bin
Tughluq
(r. 1325-1351), who changed its name from Deogiri to Daulatabad, and
forcibly moved the entire population of
Delhi
here, for two years, before
it was abandoned due to lack of water. The city of Daulatabad was built around
the fort and it was because of the strength of the fort that
Muhammad bin
Tughluq
shifted his capital to the
Deccan .
The area of the city includes the
hill-fortress of
Devagiri
(sometimes Latinised to Deogiri). It
stands on a conical hill, about 200 meters high. Much of the lower slopes of the
hill has been cut away by
Yadava dynasty
rulers to
leave 50 meter vertical sides to improve defenses. The fort is a place of
extraordinary strength. The only means of access to the summit is by a narrow
bridge, with passage for not more than two people abreast, and a long gallery,
excavated in the rock, which has for the most part a very gradual upward
slope.
About midway along this gallery, the
access gallery has steep stairs, the top of which is covered by a grating
destined in time of war to form the hearth of a huge fire kept burning by the
garrison above. At the summit, and at intervals on the slope, are specimens of
massive old cannon facing out over the surrounding countryside. Also at the mid
way, there is a cave entrance meant to confuse the Enemies.
The City
The original widespread capital city is
now mostly unoccupied and has been reduced to a village. Much of its survival
depends on the tourists to the old city and the adjacent fort.
History
The site had been occupied since at least
100 BCE, and now has remains of Buddhist caves similar to those at
Ajanta
and
Ellora .
The city is said to have been founded c.
1187 by Bhillama V, a prince who renounced his allegiance to the
Chalukyas
and
established the power of the
Yadava dynasty
in the
west.
There is a tradition that Deoghur or
Doulatabad was built in 1203 AD by a
Dhangar
or herdsman who
acquiring by some unusual good fortune vast wealth was named by his brother
shepherds Rajah Ram and soon after assumed the rank of a Rajah.
In 1294 the fort was captured by
Ala-ud-din Khilji, and the rajas, so powerful that they were held by the
Sultans of Delhi
to
be the rulers of all the
Deccan , were reduced to pay
tribute. The tribute falling into arrear, Devagiri was again occupied by the
Muslims under
Malik Kafur , in 1307 and
1310, and in 1318 the last raja, Harpal, was flayed alive.
Devagiri now became an important base for
the operations of the Delhi Sultanate's conquering expeditions southwards. In
1327
Muhammad bin
Tughluq
determined to make Deogiri his capital, changed its name to
Daulatabad , and tried to march the whole population of Delhi to it.
The project was interrupted by troubles
which summoned him to the north; during his absence the Muslim governors of the
Deccan revolted; and Daulatabad itself fell into the hands of Zafar Khan, the
governor of
Gulbarga . It remained in the
hands of the
Bahmanis
till 1526, when it was
taken by the Nizam Shahis. It was captured by the
Mughal
emperor Akbar, but
in 1595 it again surrendered to Ahmad Nizam Shah of
Ahmednagar , on the fall of
whose dynasty in 1607 it passed into the hands of the usurper, the Nizam Shahi
minister Malik Amber, originally an Abyssinian slave, who was the founder of
Kharki (the present Aurangabad).
His successors held it until they were
overthrown by
Shah Jahan , the Mughal
emperor, in 1633; after which it remained in the possession of the
Delhi
emperors until,
after the death of
Aurangzeb , it fell to the
first Nizam of
Hyderabad . Its glory,
however, had already decayed owing to the removal of the seat of government by
the emperors to Aurangabad.
Fortification walls of the fort
The Fort which according to Indian
ancient texts falls under the classification of Misra durg or mixed fort as it
combines the qualities of Giridurg (mountain fort), Dev durg (God's fort) and
Bhumi durg (land fort). The fortification walls were built at different periods
by different dynasites like the Yadavas, Khilji, Tughlaq, Bahamani, Nizam Shahi
and
Malik
Amber
bears a marked resemblance to medieval European forts in the
disposition of projecting towers, covered passages and bastions. The walls
consist of labyrinth like arrangements of the underground secret passage with
safety arrangements, in the style of buildings which give the bastions, despite
their grim appearances, a touch of beauty by insertions of carved stones and
dainty architectural details at various places.
The strengths of Daulatabad Fort
The fort has been considered as the most
powerful, puissant fort that offered robust resistance to the enemies. An
invincible fort, one of the best preserved in comparison to other forts in the
vicinity of the same period. Its sound and sturdy quality exists due to the
powerful wall about three miles in perimeter and defended by a moat and gacis
that runs round the hill at its foot and between this outer curtain and the
citadel, also known as Dharagir and Duwagir. These details have been extracted
from Professor
Dulari Qureshi 's book
Fort of Daulatabad. "
Monuments
The outer wall, 2.75 miles (4.43 km) in
circumference, once enclosed the ancient city of Deogiri (Devagiri), and between
this and the base of the upper fort are three lines of defences.
Besides the fortifications Daulatabad
contains several notable monuments, of which the chief are the Chand Minar and
the Chini Mahal. The Chand Minar is a tower 210 ft (64 m). high and 70 ft (21
m). in circumference at the base, and was originally covered with beautiful
Persian
glazed tiles. The
Chini Mahal, or China Palace, is the ruin of a building once of great beauty.
Underground Tunnel
Daulatabad fort has many underground
tunnels. Most of them have been closed or sealed. It is believedthat one such
tunnel stretches from inside the fort to Rajur town where famous Ganapati temple
is built. The tunnel's length is approximately 70 km. It is said [
that Daulatabad Fort's 'deep-mala' (lights tower) can be seen from Rajur
temple.

Kosala
in
Treta
Yuga . He conquered this region after defeating the
Asura
king
Madhu
who
dwelled in a forest named
Madhu Forest
named after
him. In
Dwapara Yuga
it was ruled
by Yaduvanshis who took the kingdom from the descendants of Satrughna. Capital
of Surasena kingdom was
Mathura
(Mathura,
Mathura, Uttar Pradesh).
The Yaduvanshi chief
Kansa , became the ruler of this
kingdom for some time. He forcefully took the ruleship by imprisoning his own
father
Ugrasena .
Magadha
king
Jarasandha
was Kansa's father
in law. Later
Vasudeva
Krishna , Kansa's sister's son, killed Kansa and gave the kingdom back to the
old king
Ugrasena . But Jarasandha
attacked the kingdom and all the Yaduvanshi had to flee to
Dwaraka . There they founded
their new kingdom.

Vidarbha Kingdom
Vidarbha kingdom
was one among
the many kingdoms ruled by
Yadava
kings
(Bhoja Yadavas) in the central and western India, in a region still known as
Vidarbha . It was
the southern most kingdom known to the kings of Gangatic Plain until they
explored Southern India.
Damayanti , the wife of
Nala
was the princess of
Vidarbha. Similarly
Rukmini , the eldest wife of
Vasudeva
Krishna
was from Vidarbha. Sage
Agastya 's wife
Lopamudra ,
also was a princess from the country of Vidarbha as mentioned in the
Mahabharata
[1] .
Kundinapuri
was its capital,
which is identified as Kundapur in the eastern
Maharashtra . Rukmini's
brother
Rukmi
founded another kingdom with capital
Bhojakata , close to Vidarbha
proper. During the
Kurukshetra War , when
all other kingdoms participated in the battle, Vidarbha under Rukmi stayed
neutral, because his army was rejected by both
Pandavas
and
Kauravas
who were the two
parties engaged in the war. It is not clear if any other king from Vidarbha
participated in the war. There is a mention at MBh 6:51, that a Vidarbha army
sided with Kauravas under the generalissimo
Bhishma .
References in Mahabharata
King Bhima of Vidarbha
King Bhima is mentioned as the ancient ruler of
Vidarbha at many places in Mahabharata. (MBh 3:53 to 77). The famous princess
Damayanti
was
his daughter. She was wedded to the
Nishadha
prince
Nala .
The southern route connecting Vidarbha
and Ayodhya
Mahabharata gives clues on a route that existed
in ancient times connecting Vidarbha to the northern kingdoms like
Kosala .
The following conversation between Nala and
Damayanti describes many ancient roads or pathways connecting kingdoms of north,
south and central India of ancient times. (MBh 3:61)
These many roads lead to the southern country,
passing by (the city of) Avanti and the Rikshavat mountains. This is that mighty
mountain called Vindhya; yon, the river Payasvini running sea-wards, and yonder
are the asylums of the ascetics, furnished with various fruit and roots. This
road leadeth to the country of the Vidarbhas—and that, to the country of the
Kosalas . Beyond these
roads to the south is the southern country.
Rituparna,the king (of
Ayodhya ,
Kosala ),
arrived at the city of the Vidarbhas. The people brought unto king Bhima (of
Vidarbha) the tidings (of his arrival). And at the invitation of Bhima, the king
entered the city of Kundina
The king of Kosala reflected a while and at
length said, ‘I have come here to pay my respects to thee.’ And the king Bhima
was struck with astonishment, and reflected upon the (probable) cause of
Rituparna’s coming, having passed over a hundred yojanas. And he reflected,
‘That passing by other sovereigns, and leaving behind him innumerable countries,
he should come simply to pay his respect to me is scarcely the reason of his
arrival.

Dvārakā
In the
Mahabharata ,
Dvārakā
(also known as
Dvāravatī , both names meaning
"the many-gated [city]" in
Sanskrit ; sometimes transcribed
as
Dwaraka
and
Dwaravati
respectively) is the capital of the
Yadus
who ruled the
Anarta Kingdom . The city
was situated on the western point of
Gujarat , and is submerged in the
sea as per the volume 16 of the epic Mahabharata.
It was founded by a clan of
Yadu
chiefs who fled from the
Surasena Kingdom
out of
constant attack by the envious king
Jarasandha
of
Magadha . The territory
of Dwaraka included the
Dwaraka Island , many neighbouring islands like
the
Antar Dwipa
and the mainland area neighbouring the
Anarta
Kingdom .
Dwaraka was a
federation
of many
republics
rather
than a
kingdom
under a single king,
the title of king of the Dwaraka-confederation being only titular. [ citation

Within the Federation of Dwaraka were included
the states of
Andhakas ,
Vrishnis
and
Bhojas . The Yadavas ruling Dwaraka
were also known as
Dasarhas
and
Madhus .
Prominent
Yadava
chiefs residing in
Dwaraka included
Vasudeva
Krishna ,
Bala Rama ,
Satyaki ,
Kritavarma ,
Uddhava ,
Akrura
and
Ugrasena .
Dwaraka and Kusasthali
Kusasthali was the older city, upon which the
city of Dwaraka was built during the time of
Vasudeva
Krishna .
From constant attack by envious Jarasandha, the
Magadha
king,
Yadavas
had
to leave
Mathura
and flee
to the city of
Dwaravati .(2,14). Due to Jarasandha, Yadavas
fled towards the west. There was a delightful town towards the west called
Kusasthali, adorned by the mountains of Raivata. In that city, they took up
their abode. They rebuilt its fort and made it so strong that it became
impregnable.
The Yadavas' migration from
Surasena Kingdom
to
Dwaraka is mentioned at (13,147).
Vasudeva
Krishna
took up his residence in Kusasthali at the city of Dwaraka. (12,339)
At Kusasthali, there was held a conclave of the
Devas . Kuvera went to
that place surrounded by grim visaged
Yakshas , numbering three hundred
maha-padmas, carrying various weapons. (3,160)
Arjuna's visit
Pandava
Arjuna , made a visit to Dwaraka,
at the end of his 12 year pilgrimage of holy places of ancient India (Bharata
Varsha). From
Indraprastha
( Delhi ) the Pandava
capital, he went to the
Himalayas , then to east and
reached the eastern sea. Then he travelled along the coast to the south and then
reached southern ocean. From there he went north along the western shore of
India, to reach the area known as
Prabhasa
(Southern shore of
Gujarat ). From
there
Vasudeva
Krishna , his friend, accompanied him and took him to the Raivataka mountains
and to Dwaraka, which was not far away.
Abduction of Subhadra by
Arjuna
During Raivataka festival,
Arjuna
fell in love with
Krishna 's
sister
Subhadra . He took away the
maiden with the secret consent of Krishna, but provoked the anger of other
Yadava heroes. This passage described the preparedness of the citizens of
Dwaraka for an emergency
The armed attendants of Subhadra, beholding her
thus seized and taken away, all ran, crying towards the city of Dwaraka.
Reaching all together the Yadava court called by the name of Sudharma, they
represented everything about the prowess of
Arjuna
unto the chief officer of
the court. The chief officer of the court blew his gold-decked trumpet calling
all to arms. Stirred up by that sound, the Bhojas, the Vrishnis, and the
Andhakas began to pour in from all sides. Those that were eating left their
food, and those that were drinking left their drink. Those tigers among men,
those great warriors of the Vrishni and the Andhaka tribes, took their seats
upon their thousand thrones. The chief officer of the court, assisted by those
that stood at his back, spoke of the conduct of
Arjuna . The proud Vrishni heroes,
of eyes red with wine rose up from their seats, unable to brook what Arjuna had
done. Some amongst them said, ‘Yoke our chariots’, and some, ‘Bring our weapons’
and some said, ‘Bring our costly bows and strong coats of mail; and some loudly
called upon their charioteers to harness their chariots, and some, from
impatience, themselves yoked their horses decked with gold unto their chariots.
Arjuna was later called back to Dwaraka, and
Subhadra was married to him. He stayed there for one year. He spent the last
year of his 12-year pilgrimage at
Pushkara
( Pushkar
in
Rajasthan ) and then went back
to
Indraprastha .
Sisupala's assault on Dvaraka and
Raivataka
Sisupala was the son of Srutasravas, a sister of
Vasudeva
Krishna 's father, similar to his relation to the
Pandavas . But unlike the
Pandavas , this
king of
Chedi
was his enemy.
Sisupala
came and burnt
Dwaraka , while Krishna and his army was at
Pragjyotisha
Kingdom . While king Bhoja was sporting on the
Raivataka
hill, he fell upon the attendants of that king and slew and led away many of
them in chains to his own city.
Salwa's attack on Dvaraka
The attack by Salwa on Dwaraka is a much-debated
topic, since it undoubtedly has the signs of an aerial-warfare. Historians are
of the opinion that it could be a naval attack, described in the fashion of an
aerial attack. For example the flying car or combat aircraft of Salwa, named
Saubha could actually be a navy ship. This explanation suits well since Dwaraka
was a city in a small island, surrounded by sea.
Salwa
king, burning with
fierce anger, upon the death of Sisupala by
Vasudeva
Krishna
during the
Rajasuya
sacrifice of
Yudhisthira
at
Indraprastha , came to
Dwaraka. Krishna was then at Indraprastha. He arrived there on a car made of
precious metals and hence called the
Souva
(some times called
Saubha , though a city also have the same name). He slew many
young Vrishni heroes and destroyed many gardens of the city. He addressed all
the
Anarttas
(clearly
indicating that Anarta was the greater-country while Dwaraka was its capital),
asking them to reveal where is Krishna. He rose into the
sky
on
his car of precious metals capable of going anywhere at will. Salwa king's
capital was mentioned here as
Maticka . Salwa considered
Sisupala as his brother. When Krishna came back to the city he saw the destroyed
Dwaraka and the slain heroes. Krishna went in search of Salwa, and found him in
an island in the midst of the ocean. (3,14)
The fortification of Dwaraka
Salwa, stationing his forces in array, besieged
that city around and above. And
stationing himself in the upper regions, the king began
his fight with the city. And that encounter commenced with a thick shower of
weapons from all sides. The city at that time was well-fortified on all sides,
according to the science (of fortification), with pennons, and arches, and
combatants, and walls and turrets, and engines, and miners, and streets
barricaded with spiked wood-works and towers and edifices with gate-ways
well-filled with provisions, and engines for hurling burning brands and fires,
and vessels, of deer-skins (for carrying water), and trumpets, tabors, and
drums, lances and forks, and Sataghnis, and plough-shares, rockets, balls of
stone and battle-axes and other weapons and shield embossed with iron, and
engines for hurling balls and bullets and hot liquids! And the city was also
well-defended by numerous cars. Yadava heroes (Gada, Samva, Uddhava) placing
themselves on commanding posts, aided by cavalry and standard-bearers, began to
defend the town.
High alert proclaimed in the
city
To prevent carelessness, Ugrasena, Uddhava and
others proclaimed throughout the city that nobody should drink. All the Vrishnis
and the Andhakas, well-knowing that they would be slain by Salwa if they behaved
carelessly, remained sober and watchful. The
police
soon drove
out of the city all mimes and dancers and singers of the
Anartta
country. And all
the bridges over rivers were destroyed, and boats forbidden to ply, and the
trenches (around the city) were spiked with poles at the bottom. And the land
around the city for full two miles was rendered uneven, and holes and pits were
dug thereon, and combustibles were secreted below the surface.
Dwaraka
fort
is naturally strong and always well-defended and filled with all
kinds of weapons! And in consequence of the preparations made, the city was more
prepared than ever to meet the foe.
Identity signs were made
strict
At the time of Salwa’s approach,nobody could
either enter or leave the town of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas without
presenting the sign that had been agreed upon. And all the streets of the town
and the open spaces were filled with numerous elephants and horses! The
combatants were all especially gratified with allowances and wages, and rations,
and weapons, and dresses! And amongst the combatants there was none who was not
paid in gold, and none who was not paid at all, and none who was not somehow
obliged, and none who was not of tried valour! It was thus Dwaraka, abounding in
well-ordered arrangements, was defended by Ahuka (Ugrasena).
Camping of Salwa's army
Kings, Salwa, the lord of Saubha, came towards
our city with an immense force consisting of infantry, cavalry and elephants!
And the army headed by king Salwa, consisting of four kings of forces, occupied
a level ground commanding a copious water-supply. And forsaking cemeteries and
temples dedicated to the gods, and sacred trees, and grounds covered by
anthills, that host occupied every other place. Divisions of the army blocked
the roads (leading to the city), and the enemy’s camp also blocked all the
secret entrances. Salwa's host was equipped with all kinds of arms, skilled in
all weapons, consisting of a dense display of cars and elephants and cavalry
abounding in banners, and well-paid and well-fed foot-soldiers possessed of
great strength and bearing every mark of heroism and furnished with wonderful
chariots and bows.
The Battle outside Dvaraka
Beholding the army of Salwa, the youthful
princess of the Vrishni race resolved to encounter it sallying out of the city.
Charudeshna, Samva, and Pradyumna sailed out, ascending on their chariots, and
clad in mail, and decked with ornaments, with colours flying, resolved to
encounter the mighty and countless host of Salwa. Samva caused Salwa's general
Kshemavriddhi to flee. He slew Vegavat. Charudeshna slew Vivindhya. Salwa
defeated Pradyumna but Pradyumna's driver bore him away. He came back after
regaining strength and attacked Salwa and made him flee. When
Vasudeva
Krishna
came back from
Indraprastha
there were no
sounds of Vedic recitation or sacrificial offering, the excellent damsels were
all destitute of ornaments, and the gardens were devoid of beauty.
Krishna's fight with Salwa
Accompanied by army consisting of the four kinds
of the forces so persevering in battle,
Krishna
set out from
Dwaraka. And crossing many countries, and mountains, crowned with trees, and
pieces of water, and streams, he at last arrived at the country of
Matrikavarta
(alias Matika). There, Krishna got the
intelligence that Salwa was coursing on his car of precious metals near the
ocean . Krishna followed in his pursuit. Having reached the
main force , Salwa on his car of costly metals was in the midst
of the
deep heaving with billows ! Salwa challenged Krishna
repeatedly to fight. Many arrows discharged from Krishna's bow didn't reach his
car. Salwa began to shoot thousand upon thousands of arrows in torrents! He
rained shafts upon soldiers. But without thinking of the shafts, Krishna
continued the conflict. But as that car ( or ship ? ) of costly metals
was in the sky ( or in ocean ? ), full two miles off, it could not, be
seen by Krishna's troops. They could therefore only remaining on the field of
battle look on like spectators in a place of amusement. Krishna shot arrows at
the car, which penetrated into the bodies of the
Danavas . Then arose cries in the
car of precious metals from those that were dying of wounds by those sharp
arrows and
falling into the waters of the mighty ocean . The
Danavas deprived of their arms, necks, and wearing the form of Kavandhas,--fell,
sending up tremendous roars. And as they fell animals living in the waters of
the ocean devoured them. Seeing his soldiers fall, Salwa the possessor of the
car of precious metals, began to fight with the help of illusion. Then he began
to ceaselessly hurl at Krishna, maces, and ploughshares, and winged darts and
lances, and javelins, and battle-axes, and swords and arrows blazing like
javelins and thunderbolts, and nooses, and broad swords, and bullets from
barrels, and shafts, and axes, and rockets. He began the contest with mountain
peaks (large boulders?). Then there was darkness and light alternately, and the
day was now fair, and now gloomy, and now hot, and now cold. And there was a
perfect shower of coals, and ashes, and weapons. Then the dome of heaven blazed
as with a hundred suns, and with one hundred moons, and thousands and ten
thousands of stars! And then none could ascertain whether it was day or night,
or distinguish the points of the horizon. Becoming bewildered, Krishna fixed on
my bowstring the weapon called
Pragnastra . Having regained,
light, Krishna again fought with the enemy!
Salwa gives false intelligence to
Krishna
A certain person, having his home in Dwaraka
quickly coming to Krishna's car, addressed him like a friend, delivering to him,
a message from Ahuka! He seemed to be one of Ahuka’s followers. And sadly and in
a voice choked in sorrow, he said words:- "O warrior, Ahuka, the lord of
Dwaraka, hath said these words unto thee! O Krishna, hear what thy father’s
friend sayeth: in thy absence today Salwa, coming to Dwaraka, hath by
main force
killed Vasudeva, your father! Therefore, no need of
battle any more. Cease, O Krishna! Do thou defend Dwaraka."
Disregarding this false information, though
temporarily stunned by it, Krishna continued the fight.
Krishna slays Salwa and destroys Saubha
city
This last part of the war, seem to be fought in
an island in the midst of ocean. Saubha seems to be a city in that island.
Salwa's troops made a shower of boulders at Krishna and his army. Krishna
managed to destroy those boulders with a weapon resembling
thunderbolt . Salwa's car was away from visibility. Krishna
launched his weapon named
Sudarsana . That weapon cleft Salwa in
twain who in that fierce conflict was at the point of hurling a heavy
mace . With its energy it set the foe ablaze. After that brave
warrior was slain, the disheartened
Danava women
fled in all
directions, exclaiming Oh! and Alas! Taking his chariot in front of
the
town of Saubha
Krishna cheerfully blew his conch and gladdened the
hearts of his friends. Beholding their town, high as the peak of the Meru, with
its palaces and gateways utterly destroyed, and all ablaze, the Danavas fled in
fear. Having thus destroyed the town of Saubha and slain Salwa, Krishna returned
to the Anarttas and delighted all friends.
Many historians argue that this foe who fought
with Krishna in the sky or ocean was not the Salwa of Mritikavarta. Mritikavara
was a city, also known as Matika, Martika, Mritikavati etc. It was the capital
of
Salwa Kingdom
in
Rajasthan
situated to the south-west of
Madra Kingdom
and to the
west of
Matsya Kingdom
ruled by
king
Virata . This
Salwa came and attacked Dwaraka, to avenge the death of Sisupala and was
vanquished by Pradyumna, the son of
Vasudeva
Krishna . The other enemy was probably an ally of this king Salwa. King Salwa
could have prompted this foe to attack Dwaraka from the sea. Krishna might have
got this intelligence when he reached Mritikavarta. Then Krishna urgently
reached the ocean surrounding Dwaraka where he fought this naval war. This enemy
is certainly a sea-faring
Danava
and an
Asura
probably belonging to
another civilization. They might have launched this attack on Dwaraka, from
their island close to the Arabian Peninsula. The name Salwa is linked with
Arabia as far as Kuwait.
Pandya's enmity towards
Dvaraka
Sarangadhwaja was the king of the
Pandyas .
Vasudeva
Krishna
invaded his country. All his kinsmen fled and his father was slain
by
Vasudeva
Krishna
in battle. Obtaining weapons then from
Bhishma
and
Drona ,
Bhargava Rama
and
Kripa , king
Sarangadhwaja became, in weapons, the equal of Rukmi and
Karna
and
Arjuna
and
Krishna . He then
desired to destroy the city of
Dwaraka
and subjugate the whole
world. Wise friends, however, from desire of doing him good, counselled him
against that course. Giving up all thoughts of revenge, he is now ruling his own
dominions.
He later made friendship with Krishna and allied with
Pandavas
in the
Kurukshetra
War .
Dvaraka sinks into the ocean
Dwarakadheesh
temple
in present
Dwarka
city, believed to have
been originally built by
Lord Krishna 's grandson,
Vajranabha, over the hari-griha (Lord Krishna's residential place). The account
of Dvaraka's sinking into the ocean is found in book 16 of the Mahabharata
(Mausala-parvan).
Day by day strong winds blew. Earthen pots showed
cracks or broke from no apparent cause. Society became corrupt. The day of the
new moon coincided with the thirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation. The
fourteenth lunation has been made the fifteenth by Rahu once more. Such a day
had happened at the time of the great battle of Bharatas. ( Kurukshetra War ). It has
once more appeared. After that war 36 years had passed. The messengers
proclaimed at the command of
Vasudeva
Krishna
that the Vrishnis should make a journey to the seacoast for bathing
in the sacred waters of the ocean.
The Yadavas, then, with their wives, proceeded to
Prabhasa and took up their residence there, each in the (temporary) habitation
that was assigned to him, and all having an abundance of provisions consisting
of edibles and drink. The Vrishnis, mixing with wine the food that had been
cooked for high-souled Brahmanas, gave it away unto monkeys and apes. Those
heroes of fierce energy then began their high revels, of which drinking formed
the chief feature, at Prabhasa. Then a dispute arose between
Satyaki
and
Kritavarman
on the wrongs
they did in the
Kurukshetra War . This
dispute turned into a great massacre, in which all the Yadava heroes were slain.
Arjuna
arrived at Dwaraka and
addressed the chief officers, to prepare to leave Dwaraka within 7 days, as
Dwaraka is going to sink in the ocean. Krishna's grandson Vajra was chosen as
their king to be ruled at
Indraprastha .
Arjuna
then
proceeded to the place where the Vrishnis were slaughtered. Searching out the
bodies then of
Bala Rama , Arjuna caused them
to be burnt by persons skilled in that act. On the seventh day,
Arjuna
evacuated Dwaraka Island.
After all the people had set out, the ocean flooded Dvaraka, which still teemed
with wealth of every kind, with its waters. Whatever portion of the ground was
passed over, ocean immediately flooded over with his waters. Beholding this
wonderful sight, the inhabitants of Dvaraka walked faster and faster.
Pandavas
on their last journey
before death, saw Dwaraka covered by ocean.
Other mentions
Pandava's sons lived in Dwaraka during their exile to woods. Their servants
headed by Indrasena lived there for one year (the 13th year)
A desert is mentioned to be present on the way from
Indraprastha

King Nriga in consequence of a single fault of his, had to dwell for a long
time at Dwaravati and Krishna became the cause of his rescue from that miserable
plight.
Sage Durvasa resided at Dwaravati for a long time

Kurukshetra War
Kunti Kingdom
As per the epic
Mahabharata , the
Kunti Kingdom
was the kingdom of
Kuntibhoja , one of the
prominent kings among the
Bhoja
Yadavas .
Kunti , the mother of
Pandavas
and the
first wife of
Kuru
king
Pandu , was the adopted daughter of
the king Kuntibhoja. Her given name was Pritha and she was a sister of
Vasudeva , the
father of
Vasudeva
Krishna . The Kunti kingdom was neighbour to the
Avanti Kingdom . It was
probably to the north of Avanti.

The Haihayas and Talajanghas of Vatsa
Kingdom
MBh (13,30)
Haihayas and Talajanghas probably had their
origin in
Vatsa Kingdom . Haihayas in
Vatsa kingdom, known collectively as Vitahavyas, under their king named
Vitahavya, attacked the neignboring country called
Kasi , during the reign of
four successive generations of Kasi kings viz that of Haryaswa, Sudeva, Divodasa
and Pratarddana. The last one among them, viz Pratarddana, defeated the Haihayas
and probably expelled them from the Vatsa kingdom. Kasi kings were also born in
the race of Ikshwaku. This could be the seed of Haihayas's dispute with
them.
Haihayas attack of Kasi during the reign
of Haryaswa
In Saryati’s lineage (Saryati and Ikshwaku were
two among the many sons of Manu, two kings took their birth, viz., Haihaya and
Talajangha. Both of them were sons of
Vatsa . Haihaya had ten
wives and a hundred sons, all of whom were highly inclined to fighting. In
Kasi ,
also, there was a king, the grandfather of Divodasa, known by the name of
Haryyaswa. The sons of king Haihaya, who was otherwise known by the name of
Vitahavyas ,
invaded the kingdom of Kasi. Advancing into that country that lies between the
rivers
Ganga
and
Yamuna , he fought a battle with
king Haryyaswa and also slew him in it. The sons of Haihaya fearlessly went back
to their own delightful city in the country of the Vatsas.
Haihayas attack of Kasi during the reign
of Sudeva
Meanwhile Haryyaswa’s son
Sudeva
was installed on the throne of Kasi as its ruler. That righteous-souled prince
ruled his kingdom for sometime, when the hundred sons of Vitahavya once more
invaded his dominions and defeated him in battle. Having vanquished king Sudeva
thus, the victors returned to their own city.
Haihayas attack of Kasi during the reign
of Divodasa
After that
Divodasa , the son of
Sudeva, became installed on the throne of Kasi as its ruler. Realising the
prowess of those high-souled princes, viz., the sons of Vitahavya, king
Divodasa, endued with great energy, rebuilt and fortified the city of Baranasi
(Varanasi or
Banaras ) at the command of
Indra. The territories of Divodasa were full of Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, and
abounded with Vaisyas and Sudras. And they teemed with articles and provisions
of every kind, and were adorned with shops and marts swelling with prosperity.
Those territories stretched northwards from the banks of Ganga to the southern
banks of Gomati, and resembled a second Amravati (the city of Indra). The
Haihayas once again, attacked. King Divodasa fought the enemy for a thousand
days at the end of which, having lost a number of followers and animals, he
became exceedingly distressed. King Divodasa having lost his army and seeing his
treasury exhausted left his capital and fled away. He sought protection of his
priest, Bharadwaja the son of Vrihaspati.
Divodasa's son Pratarddana attacks the
Haihays
Divodasa wished for a brave son who could revenge
the Vitahavyas (the Haihayas of Vatsa Kingdom). With his priest Bharadwaja's
blessings he obtained a son named Pratarddana. He became well skilled in battle.
Divodasa instaled his son on the throne of Kasi and asked him to march against
the sons of Vitahavya (Vitahavyas). He speedily crossed the Ganga on his car,
followed by his army and proceeded against the city of the Vitahavyas. The
Vitahavyas issued out of their city in their cars and poured upon Pratarddana,
showers of weapons of various kind. Pratarddana slew them all in battle. The
Haihaya king Vitahavya then, all his sons and kinsmen dead, sought protection of
his priest Bhrigu. Bhrigu converted him a Brahmana. Sage
Saunaka

attendands acting as his hands, for executing his commands) and great beauty the
mighty Kartavirya, in days of yore, became the lord of all the world. He had his
capital in the city of
Mahishmati . Of unbaffled
prowess, that chief of the Haihaya race of
Kshatriyas
swayed the whole
earth with her belt of seas, together with all her islands and all her precious
mines of gold and gems. Keeping before him the duties of the Kshatriya order, as
also humility and Vedic knowledge, the king made large gifts of wealth unto the
sage
Dattatreya .
Other Haihaya Kings
Haihaya king Vitahavya is mentioned as the son of Vatsa King
Haihaya king Udvarta , became the exterminator of his own race.
The conversation between a Haihaya king and a sage named Tarkshya is
mentioned.
A royal sage of the Haihaya race, Sumitra by name is mentioned . Sumitra is
mentioned as the son of Mitra.
Enmity with the Bhargavas
The Haiheya tribe's dispute with
Bhargavas
(a
clan of
Bhrahmins ) is mentioned at
various places in
Mahabharata . The leader of
the Bhargavas viz
Bhargava Rama , the son of
Jamadagni, is said to kill the Haiyaya king Kartavirya Arjuna. This dispute
didn't end there. The Bhargavas went all over India and slew numerous
Kshatriya
kings, most of them, being the kinsmen of Kartavirya Arjuna.
In consequence of the unrivalled
battle-axe
of fiery splendour and irresistible sharpness,
Bhargava
Rama
became unrivalled on earth. He obtained the battle-axe from Mahadeva of
Gandhamadana mountains, in the
Himalayas .
Meanwhile the mighty son of Kritavirya, viz.,
Arjuna of the Kshatriya order and ruler of the Haihayas, endued with great
energy, highly virtuous in behaviour, and possessed of a thousand arms through
the grace of (the great sage)
Dattatreya , having subjugated
in battle, by the might of his own arms, the whole earth with her mountains and
seven islands, became a very powerful
emperor .
The king, Arjuna by name, the mighty lord of the
Haihaya tribe was killed by Rama.
Signs of a tribal war
" Even though only the leaders viz
Bhargava Rama
and Kartavirya Arjuna were mentioned
in most places, there is evidance that
many people were involeved in this dispute. It could be a dispute between two
tribes, spanning generations.
Once on a time the
Brahmanas , raising a standard
of
Kusa
grass, encountered in battle the
Kshatriyas
of the Haihaya
clan endued with immeasurable energy. The
Vaisyas
and the
Sudras
followed the Brahmanas, so
that all the three orders were on one side, while the Kshatriyas were alone on
the other. In the battles, however, that ensued, the three orders repeatedly
broke, while the Kshatriyas, though alone, vanquished large army that was
opposed to them. Then those best of Brahmanas enquired of the Kshatriyas
themselves as to the cause of this. The Kshatriyas told, ‘ In battle we obey
the orders of one person endued with great intelligence, while ye are disunited
from one another and act according to your individual understanding. ’ The
Brahmanas then appointed one amongst themselves as their commander, who was
brave and conversant with the ways of policy. And they then succeeded in
vanquishing
Haihaya
the Kshatriyas.
The summary of the dispute
Bhargava Rama's father was slain by the
Kartavirya Arjuna's kinsmen.
Bhargava Rama 's father
Jamadagni, having been slain and his calf having been stolen by the Kshatriyas,
he slew Kartavirya who had never been vanquished before by foes. With his bow he
slew 64 times 10,000 Kshatriyas. In that slaughter were included 14,000
Brahmana-hating Kshatriyas of the
Dantakura country , all of
whom he slew. Of the Haihayas, he slew a 1000 with his short club, a 1000 with
his sword, and a 1000 by hanging. Rama slew 10,000 Kshatriyas with his
axe . He could not quietly bear the furious speeches uttered by
those (foes of his). And when many foremost of Brahmans uttered exclamations,
mentioning the name of Rama of Bhrigu’s race, he proceeding against the
Kashmiras , the
Daradas , the
Kuntis , the Kshudrakas,
the
Malavas , the
Angas ,
the
Vangas , the
Kalingas , the
Videhas , the
Tamraliptakas, the Rakshovahas, the Vitahotras, the
Trigartas , the
Martikavatas, counting by thousand, slew them all by means of his whetted
shafts. Proceeding from province to province, he thus slew thousands of crores
of Haihaya-Kshatriyas. Creating a deluge of blood and filling many lakes also
with blood and bringing all the 18 islands under his subjection, he performed a
100 sacrifices.

called
Dakshinapatha
extending from
Rajagriha
to Pratishthana (modern

These many roads lead to the southern country,
passing by (the city of)
Avanti
and the Rikshavat mountains.
This is that mighty mountain called
Vindhya  ; yon, the river
Payasvini running seawards, and yonder are the asylums of the ascetics,
furnished with various fruit and roots. This road leadeth to the country of the
Vidarbhas
—and that, to
the country of the
Kosalas . Beyond these
roads to the south is the southern country.

Allying himself with the vanquished tribes the
Pandava
Sahadeva
then
marched towards the countries that lay on the banks of the
Narmada . And defeating
there in battle the two heroic kings of
Avanti , called
Vinda and Anuvinda , supported by a mighty host, the mighty son
of the twin gods exacted much wealth from them. After this the hero marched
towards the town of Bhojakata. (2,30)
Karna's conquests
Then going to
Sisupala 's son, the son of
the Suta defeated him and that highly powerful one also brought under his sway
all the neighbouring rulers. And having subjugated the
Avantis
and concluded peace with them, and having met with the Vrishnis, he conquered
the west.

Avanti kings allied with the Kauravas in
Kurukshetra War
The two kings of Avanti (Vinda and Anuvinda),
accompanied by a mighty force, brought to
Duryodhana , each a separate
Akshauhini of troops, for the
Kurukshetra War .
They were considered as the best among the
Kaurava heroes as per
Duryodhana 's words:- Those,
however, amongst us , that are our chief warriors, are Bhishma, Drona, Kripa,
Drona's son, Karna, Somadatta, Vahlika, and Salya, the king of Pragjyotisha, the
two kings (Vindha and Anuvinda) of
Avanti , and Jayadratha; and
then, O king, thy sons Dussasana, Durmukha, Dussaha, Srutayu; Chitrasena,
Purumitra, Vivingsati, Sala, Bhurisravas, and Vikarna.
Rating by
Bhishma :- Vinda and Anuvinda of
Avanti are both regarded as excellent Rathas. These two heroes among men will
consume the troops of thy foes, with maces and bearded darts, and swords and
long shafts, and javelins hurled from their hands. Like a couple of (elephant)
leaders sporting in the midst of their herds, these two princes longing for
battle, will range the field, each like Yama himself.
Suvala's son Sakuni, and Salya, Jayadratha and
the two princes of
Avanti
named Vinda and Anuvinda, and the
Kekaya brothers, and Sudakshina the ruler of the Kamvojas and Srutayudha the
ruler of the Kalingas, and king Jayatsena, and Vrihadvala the ruler of the
Kosalas, and Kritavarman of Satwata's race,--these ten tigers among men, endued
with great bravery and possessing arms that looked like maces stood each at
the head of an Akshauhini
of troops.(6,16)
Avanti Kings Vinda and Anuvinda in

Malava kingdom
Malava kingdom
was one among the many kingdoms ruled by the
Yadava
kings in the
central and western India, corresponding to the
Malwa
region. Sometimes Avanti and
Malava were described to be the same country. They were originally a western
tribe, in
Punjab
province of
Pakistan . Later
they migrated to
Rajasthan
and
Madhya
Pradesh
states of India. In recorded history of India, there were a royal
tribe called Malavas. They were believed to be the descendants of the
Malavas.
References in Mahabharata
Malavas were originally a tribe neighbouring the
Madra
territories
in Punjab province of
Pakistan .
The origin of Malavas
Accordiing to the Mahabharata (Book 3, Chapter
295), the Malavas were a small unknown tribe near
Madra Kingdom , who later
became the powerful Malavas in
Madhya Pradesh
state in
India , near
Avanti
Kingdom
(having Ujjayani or
Ujjain
as its capital).
Vivaswat’s son,
Yama , the dispenser of
justice, untied his noose, and with cheerful heart said these words to
Savitri , ‘Thus, O
auspicious and chaste lady, is thy husband freed by me! Thou wilt be able to
take him back free from disease. And he will attain to success! And along with
thee, he will attain a life of four hundred years. And celebrating sacrifices
with due rites, he will achieve great fame in this world. And upon thee Satyavan
will also beget a century of sons. And these
Kshatriyas
with their sons
and grandsons will all be kings, and will always be famous in connection with
thy name. And thy father (Aswapati, the king of
Madra Kingdom
also will
beget a hundred sons on thy mother Malavi. And under the name of the
Malavas , thy
Kshatriya
brothers, will be
widely known along with their sons and daughters.
Wife of a Madra King from
Malava
Mahabharata, Book 3, Chapter 291
There was a king among the
Madras , named Aswapati,
who was virtuous and highly pious. And then, by the grace of goddess Savitri,
the embryo in the womb of the princess of
Malava
(wife of
Aswapati) increased like the lord of stars in the heavens during the lighted
fortnight. And when the time came, she brought forth a daughter furnished with
lotus-like eyes. She was the famous
Savitri , who became
wife of the prince
Satyavan
of

Anarta Kingdom
Anarta was a kingdom of ancient India, roughly forming the northern
Gujarat
state of
India. It was ruled by
Yadavas
after they fled from
Mathura
of
Surasena Kingdom , due
to the attacks of
Jarasandha , the king of
Magadha . The Yadava
chiefs like
Vasudeva
Krishna ,
Bala Rama
(brother of
Krishna),
Kritavarma
and
Satyaki , ruled
this kingdom under their king
Ugrasena . In
Mahabharata , Dwaraka is
considered as a capital city of Anarta Kingdom. But some other ancient texts
like Mahabhagavata, mentiones
Dwaraka
and Anarta as
two independent kingdoms. It can be concluded that, during the
Mahabharata
period, this
kingdom was under the direct rule of the city-state of
Dwaraka
which ruled a
federation of many kingdoms. See also
Dwaraka Kingdom . As per
the
Purana
viz.
Bhagavata Purana ,
Bala Rama 's
wife
Revati
was
from this kingdom.
References in Mahabharata
Draupadi's sons in Anarta country
undergoes military training
MBh. 3.182
When
Pandavas
were
exiled to the woods, by the
Kauravas , the five
sons of Pandavas, born to
Draupadi , were
sent to
Panchala ,
the kingdom ruled by their maternal grandfather
Drupada . They later
went to the Anarta Kingdom, ruled by the
Yadavas , so that
they can stay with their step brother and dear friend,
Abhimanyu , and
learn military science from eminent Yadava warriors.
Vasudeva
Krishna 's words to
Princess Krishna
(alias
Draupadi, Panchali):- Those sons of yours, are devoted to the study of the
science of arms, are well-behaved and conduct themselves on the pattern of their
righteous friends. Your father and your uterine brothers proffer them a kingdom
and territories; but the boys find no joy in the house of
Drupada , or in that of their
maternal uncles. Safely proceeding to
the land of the Anartas ,
they take the greatest delight in the study of the science of arms. Your sons
enter the town of the Vrishnis ( Dwaraka ) and take an immediate
liking to the people there. And as you would direct them to conduct themselves,
or as the respected
Kunti
would do, so does
Subhadra
(their
stepmother) direct them in a watchful way. Perhaps, she is still more careful of
them. As
Pradyumna
is the preceptor of
Aniruddha ,
of
Abhimanyu , of Sunitha, and of
Bhanu; so he is the preceptor and the refuge of your sons also! And a good
preceptor, would unceasingly give them lessons in the wielding of maces and
swords and bucklers, in missiles and in the arts of driving cars and of riding
horses, being valiant. And he,
Pradyumna , the son of
Rukmini , having
bestowed a very good training upon them, and having taught them the art of using
various weapons in a proper way, takes satisfaction at the valorous deeds of
your sons, and of
Abhimanyu . O daughter of
Drupada! And when your son goes out, in pursuit of (out-door) sports, each one
of them is followed thither by cars and horses and vehicles and elephants.’
Vasudeva
Krishna , next told to the exiled
Pandava
king
Yudhisthira , that the
fighting men of
Anarta , consisting of Satwata, Dasarha, Kukura,
Adhaka, Bhoja, Vrishni and Madhu tribes will be kept ready to overthrow the
enemies of
Pandavas , viz the
Kauravas
headed
by
Duryodhana , ruling the
Kuru
city
Hastinapura .
Bala Rama ,
with plough as his weapon, will lead the warriors cosnisting of bowmen,
horsemen, foot-soldiers, cars and elephants.
In the fifth book, Chapter 83 of Mahabharata (MBh
5.83), it is mentioned that
Pandava 's mother
Kunti
also stayed for some time in
Anarta, during the exile of the Pandavas.

arrived at
the city of
Anarta
(Dwaraka alias Dwaravati) seeking alliance
of
Yadavas , to join their side
in the
Kurukshetra War . Some
Yadava heroes allied with
Kauravas
while others allied
with the
Pandavas .
Vasudeva
Krishna
allied with the
Pandavas
and promised not to
take any weapons in the battle. Thus he took part in the war not as a warrior,
but as a diplomat, an ambassador of peace, an adviser on war-strategy and as the
guide and car-driver of
Arjuna . The army owned by
Vasudeva
Krishna , called the
Narayanas
were given to
Duryodhana .
The Narayanas consisted of a large body of cowherds, all of whom are able to
fight in the thick of battle. Another hero
Bala Rama , took a neutral
standpoint, though he wished to aid
Duryodhana , because he cannot
fight against his brother
Vasudeva
Krishna , who had already joined the
Pandavas . Thus he will not
fight for any of the parties and wished to set for a pilgrimage over
Saraswati River . The
Bhoja Yadava hero,
Kritavarman
joined
Duryodhana
with a body of troops numbering an
Akshauhini

Youdheya Kingdom
Yodheya
(alias Yaudheya,
Yauddheya) was a kingdom that lied close to the
kingdom of the Pandavas .
They have taken part in the
Kurukshetra War , siding
with the
Kauravas .
Pandava
king
Yudhisthira
had a son named
Yaudheya . It is not clear if he belonged to the Yaudheya tribe. There
is some speculation that the Yaudheyas were linked to the
Yadava
chief
Yuyudhana, otherwise known as
Satyaki
and thus were a Yadava
tribe, whereas other evidences link them to
Rajputs
(See
Yaudheya ).
References in Mahabharata
There is no mention in
Mahabharata
linking Yaudheyas with the
Yadava
chief
Satyaki
who was an
ally of the
Pandavas
in the
Kurukshetra
War . In fact many references make them allied to the
Kauravas
the
enemies of the
Pandavas .
Tributes to king Yudhisthira
Yaudheyas were mentioned in the list of
tribes giving tribute to the
Pandava
king
Yudhisthira
during his
Rajasuya
sacrifice.
The Kairatas, the
Daradas , the Darvas, the
Suras, the Vaiamakas, the Audumvaras, the Durvibhagas, the Kumaras, the Paradas
along with the
Vahlikas , the
Kashmiras , the Ghorakas,
the Hansakayanas, the
Sivis , the
Trigartas , the
Yauddheyas, the ruler of
Madras
and the
Kaikeyas , the Amvashtas,
the Kaukuras, the Tarkshyas, the Vastrapas along with the
Palhavas , the
Vashatayas, the Mauleyas along with the Kshudrakas, and the
Malavas , the Paundrayas,
the Kukkuras, the
Sakas , the
Angas ,
the
Vangas , the
Punras , the Sanavatyas,
and the Gayas—these good and well-born
Kshatriyas
distributed into
regular clans and trained to the use of arms, brought tribute unto
Pandava
king
Yudhishthira
by hundreds
and thousands.
Yudhisthira's son Yaudheya
This is the only reference linking Yaudheyas
to the
Pandavas .
Yudhishthira , having
obtained for his wife
Devika , the daughter of Govasana of the
Saivya
tribe, in a
self-choice ceremony, begat upon her a son named
Yaudheya
. The
verse in Mahabharata is same as in Matsya Purana but their it refers to
Yaudheya, son of Prativindhya, son of Yudhisthara. Other son of Yudhisthara is
called Devaka, his grandson is called Yaudheya. Nalanda Shabda kosha indicates
Yaudheya as descendents of Yudhisthara. The Yaudheya kingdom coins claim descent
from Dharmaraja, name for Yudhisthara. As per Altekar & Muzumdar, Yaudheyas
lead the nationa;l revolt against the Kushana rulers, allied with Malavas and
Arjunayanas as a federation of three with coins celebrating this fact linking it
to their ancestors, the brothers Dharma, Bhima and Arjuna. The legend of
overthrow of Kansa and his downfall by Krishna is a legend based in Mathura
where they still celebrate the downfall and destruction of Tochari Raja's fort.
The legend of later destruction of foreign foes by allied tribes of Yaudheyas,
Malavas and Arjunayanas may be basis for the Pandava legends. As for Yaudheya's
mother, In Adiparva, Yudhisthara is mentioned having a second wife, in Bheeshma
Parva, he is mentioned with at least two more wives but in the mentions in
Streeparva and later parvas, she does not show up though other wives of the
brothers do.
In Kurukshtera War
Yaudheyas were mentioned as allied with the
Kauravas
in the
Kurukshetra
War . It is not clear if there were another Yaudheya tribe allied to
the Pandavas.
Arjuna
of white steeds
despatched, the Yaudheyas, the
Parvatas , the
Madrakas , and the
Malavas
also, to the
regions of the dead (7:158). With his shafts,
Yudhishthira
began to slay
the Amvashthas, the
Malavas
, the brave
Trigartas
and the
Sivis .
And cutting off the Abhishahas, the
Surasenas , the
Valhikas , and the
Vasatis, he caused the earth to be miry with flesh and blood. And he also
despatched within a trice, by means of many shafts, to region of the dead, the
Yaudheyas, the
Malavas
, and large
numbers,of the
Madrakas
. The
Kekeyas , the
Malavas
, the
Madrakas
the
Dravidas
of fierce
prowess, the Yaudheyas, the Lalittyas, the Kshudrakas, the Usinaras, the
Tundikeras, the Savitriputras, the Easterners, the Northerners, the Westerners,
and the Southerners, have all been slain by
Arjuna
.

Vijayanagara Empire
The
Vijayanagara Empire
Kannada : ವಿಜಯನಗರ
ಸಾಮ್ರಾಜ್ಯ
Vijayanagara Sāmrājya ,
Telugu : విజయనగర
సామ్రాజ్యము
Vijayanagara Sāmrājyamu , referred as the
Kingdom of
Bisnaga
by the
Portuguese , was a
South
Indian
empire based in the
Deccan Plateau .
Established in 1336 by
Harihara I
and his brother
Bukka Raya
I . The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the
southern powers against
Islamic
invasions
by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646 although its
power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 by the
Deccan sultanates . The
empire is named after its capital city of
Vijayanagara , whose
impressive ruins surround modern
Hampi , now a
World Heritage Site
in modern
Karnataka ,
India . The writings of medieval
European travelers such as
Domingo Paes ,
Fernão
Nunes
and
Niccolò Da Conti
and
the literature in local vernaculars provide crucial information about its
history. Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's
power and wealth.
The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the
best known being the group at
Hampi . The previous temple
building traditions in South India came together in the
Vijayanagara
Architecture
style. The mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired
architectural innovation of
Hindu
temple construction, first
in the Deccan and later in the
Dravidian
idioms
using the local
granite . Secular royal
structures show the influence of the
Northern Deccan
Sultanate
architecture. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade
brought new technologies like water management systems for irrigation. The
empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in the
languages of
Kannada ,
Telugu ,
Tamil
and
Sanskrit , while
Carnatic music
evolved
into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian
history that transcended regionalism by promoting
Hinduism
as a unifying
factor.
History
Differing theories have been proposed regarding
the Vijayanagara empire's origins. Some claim that
Harihara I
and
Bukka Raya
I , the founders of the empire, or
Kuruba
people first associated
with the
Kakatiya
kingdom who
took control of the northern parts of the
Hoysala Empire
during its
decline. Other historians propose they were
Kannadigas
and commanders in
the army of the
Hoysala Empire
stationed
in the
Tungabhadra
region to ward
off Muslim invasions from the Northern India. Irrespective of their origin,
historians agree the founders were supported and inspired by
Vidyaranya , a saint at the
Sringeri
monastery to fight the Muslim invasion of South India.Writings by foreign
travelers during the late medieval era combined with recent excavations in the
Vijayanagara principality have uncovered much-needed information about the
empire's history, fortifications, scientific developments and architectural
innovations.
Before the early 14th century rise of the
Vijayanagara empire, the Hindu kingdoms of the Deccan, the
Seuna Yadavas of
Devagiri , the
Kakatiya dynasty of
Warangal , the
Pandyan Empire of
Madurai , and the tiny kingdom of
Kampili
had been repeatedly
invaded by
Muslims
from the north, and by
1336 they had all been defeated by
Alla-ud-din Khilji
and
Muhammad bin
Tughluq , the
Sultans of Delhi . The
Hoysala Empire was the sole remaining Hindu kingdom in the path of the Muslim
invasion. After the death of Hoysala
Veera Ballala III
during a battle against the Sultan of Madurai in 1343, the Hoysala empire merged
with the growing Vijayanagara empire.
In the first two decades after the founding of
the empire, Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the
Tungabhadra river and earned the title of
Purvapaschima
Samudradhishavara
("master of the eastern and western seas"). By 1374 Bukka
Raya I, successor to Harihara I, had defeated the chiefdom of
Arcot , the
Reddy
dynasty
of Kondavidu, the
Sultan of Madurai
and
gained control over
Goa
in the west and the Tungabhadra- Krishna River
doab
in the north. The
original capital was in the
principality
of
Anegondi
on the
northern banks of the Tungabhadra River in today's
Karnataka . It was later moved
to nearby Vijayanagara on the river's southern banks during the reign of Bukka
Raya I.
With the Vijayanagara Kingdom now imperial in
stature,
Harihara II , the second son
of Bukka Raya I, further consolidated the kingdom beyond the
Krishna
River
and brought the whole of South India under the Vijayanagara umbrella.
The next ruler,
Deva Raya I , emerged
successful against the
Gajapatis
of
Orissa
and undertook important
works of fortification and irrigation.
Deva Raya II
(called
Gajabetekara ) succeeded to the throne in 1424 and was possibly the most
capable of the
Sangama dynasty
rulers.
He quelled rebelling feudal lords as well as the
Zamorin
of
Calicut
and
Quilon
in the south. He invaded
the island of
Lanka
and became overlord of the kings of
Burma
at
Pegu
and
Tanasserim . The
empire declined in the late 15th century until the serious attempts by commander
Saluva Narasimha
Deva Raya
in 1485 and by general
Tuluva Narasa
Nayaka
in 1491 to reconsolidate the empire. After nearly two decades of
conflict with rebellious chieftains, the empire eventually came under the rule
of Krishnadevaraya, the son of Tuluva Narasa Nayaka.
In the following decades the Vijayanagara empire
dominated all of Southern India and fought off invasions from the five
established
Deccan Sultanates . The
empire reached its peak during the rule of
Krishnadevaraya
when
Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious. The empire annexed areas
formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the
eastern Deccan, including
Kalinga , while
simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south. Many
important monuments were either completed or commissioned during the time of
Krishnadevaraya.
Krishnadevaraya was followed by
Achyuta
Raya
in 1530 and in 1542 by
Sadashiva Raya
while the
real power lay with
Aliya Rama Raya , the
son-in-law of Krishnadevaraya, whose relationship with the Deccan Sultans who
allied against him has been debated.
The sudden capture and killing of Aliya Rama Raya
in 1565 at the
Battle of Talikota ,
against an alliance of the Deccan sultanates, after a seemingly easy victory for
the Vijayanagara armies, created havoc and confusion in the Vijayanagara ranks,
which were then completely routed. The Sultanates' army later plundered Hampi
and reduced it to the ruinous state in which it remains; it was never
re-occupied. Tirumala Raya, the sole surviving commander, left Vijayanagara for
Penukonda with vast amounts of treasure on the back of 550 elephants.
The empire went into a slow decline regionally,
although trade with the Portuguese continued, and the British were given a land
grant for the establishment of
Madras .
Tirumala Deva Raya
was succeeded by his son
Sriranga I
later followed by
Venkata
II
who made
Chandragiri
his capital,
repulsed the invasion of the
Bahmani Sultanate
and
saved
Penukonda
from being captured.
His successor,
Ramadeva , took power and ruled
till 1632 after whose death,
Venkata III
became king and
ruled for about ten years after which
Vellore
was made the capital.
The empire was finally conquered by the
Sultanates
of
Bijapur
and
Golkonda . The
largest feudatories of the Vijayanagar empire — the
Mysore Kingdom ,
Keladi
Nayaka ,
Nayaks of Madurai ,
Nayaks of Tanjore ,
Nayakas of
Chitradurga
and
Nayak Kingdom
of
Gingee
— declared
independence and went on to have a significant impact on the history of South
India in the coming centuries. These Nayaka kingdoms lasted into the 18th
century while the Mysore Kingdom remained a princely state until
Indian Independence
in 1947 although they came under the
British Raj
in 1799 after
the death of
Tipu Sultan .
Governance
The rulers of the Vijayanagara empire maintained
the well-functioning administrative methods developed by their predecessors, the
Hoysala, Kakatiya and Pandya kingdoms, to govern their territories and made
changes only where necessary. The King was the ultimate authority, assisted by a
cabinet of ministers ( Pradhana ) headed by the prime minister
( Mahapradhana ). Other important titles recorded in inscriptions were
the chief secretary ( Karyakartha
or
Rayaswami ) and the
imperial officers ( Adhikari ). All high ranking ministers and officers
were required to have military training. A secretariat near the king's palace
employed
scribes
and officers to maintain
records made official by using a
wax seal
imprinted with the
ring of the king. At the lower administrative levels, wealthy feudal landlords
( Goudas ) supervised accountants ( Karanikas
or
Karnam )
and guards ( Kavalu ). The palace administration was divided into 72
departments ( Niyogas ), each having several female attendants chosen for
their youth and beauty (some imported or captured in victorious battles) who
were trained to handle minor administrative matters and to serve men of nobility
as courtesans or concubines.
The empire was divided into five main provinces
( Rajya ), each under a commander ( Dandanayaka
or
Dandanatha ) and headed by a governor, often from the royal family, who
used the native language for administrative purposes. A
Rajya
was
divided into regions ( Vishaya
Vente
or
Kottam ), and
further divided into counties ( Sime
or
Nadu ) themselves
subdivided into municipalities ( Kampana
or
Sthala ). Hereditary
families ruled their respective territories and paid tribute to the empire while
some areas, such as
Keladi
and
Madurai , came
under the direct supervision of a commander.
On the battlefields, the king's commanders led
the troops. The empire's war strategy rarely involved massive invasions; more
often it employed small scale methods such as attacking and destroying
individual forts. The empire was among the first in India to use long range
artillery
commonly manned by foreign gunners. (Gunners from present day
Turkmenistan
were
considered the best). Army troops were of two types: The king's personal army
directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army under each feudatory. King
Krishnadevaraya's personal army consisted of 100,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalrymen
and over 900 elephants. This number was only a part of the army numbering over
1.1 million soldiers, a figure that varied as an army of two million has also
been recorded along with the existence of a navy as evidenced by the use of the
term
Navigadaprabhu
(commander of the navy). The army recruited from
all classes of society (supported by the collection of additional feudal
tributes from feudatory rulers), and consisted of
archers
and
musketeers
wearing quilted
tunics , shieldmen with
swords and
poignards
in their girdles, and
soldiers carrying shields so larges that no armour was necessary. The horses and
elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their
tusks to do maximum damage in battle.
The empire's economy was largely dependent on
agriculture. Corn ( jowar ), cotton and
pulse legumes
grew in
semi arid regions, while sugarcane, rice and wheat thrived in rainy areas.
Betel leaves ,
areca
(for chewing),
and coconut were the principal cash crops, and large scale cotton production
supplied the weaving centers of the empire's vibrant textile industry. Spices
such as
turmeric , pepper,
cardamom
and
ginger grew in the remote
Malnad
hill region and were
transported to the city for trade. The empire's capital city was a thriving
business centre that included a burgeoning market in large quantities of
precious gems and gold. Prolific temple-building provided employment to
thousands of
masons ,
sculptors , and other skilled
artisans.
Land ownership was important. Most of the growers
were
tenant farmers
and were
given the right of part ownership of the land over time. Tax policies
encouraging needed produce made distinctions between land use to determine tax
levies. For example, the daily market availability of rose petals was important
for perfumers, so cultivation of roses received a lower tax assessment. Salt
production and the manufacture of
salt pans
were
controlled by similar means. The making of
ghee
(clarified butter), which was
sold as an oil for human consumption and as a fuel for lighting lamps, was
profitable. Exports to China intensified and included cotton, spices, jewels,
semi-precious stones, ivory, rhino horn, ebony, amber, coral, and aromatic
products such as perfumes. Large vessels from China made frequent visits, some
captained by the Chinese Admiral
Cheng Ho , and brought Chinese
products to the empire's 300 ports, large and small, on the
Arabian
Sea
and the
Bay of Bengal . The ports
of
Mangalore ,
Honavar ,
Bhatkal ,
Barkur ,
Cochin ,
Cannanore ,
Machilipatnam
and
Dharmadam
were
the most important.
When merchant ships docked, the merchandise was
taken into official custody and taxes levied on all items sold. The security of
the merchandise was guaranteed by the administration officials. Traders of many
nationalities ( Arabs ,
Persians ,
Guzerates ,
Khorassanians ) settled
in
Calicut ,
drawn by the thriving trade business. Ship building prospered and
keeled
ships of 1000–1200
bahares
( burden ) were built without decks
by sewing the entire
hull
with ropes rather
than fastening them with nails. Ships sailed to the
Red Sea
ports of
Aden
and
Mecca
with Vijayanagara goods sold
as far away as
Venice . The empire's principal
exports were pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom,
myrobalan ,
tamarind timber ,
anafistula , precious
and semi-precious stones, pearls, musk, ambergris, rhubarb, aloe, cotton cloth
and porcelain. Cotton yarn was shipped to
Burma
and indigo to Persia. Chief
imports from
Palestine
were copper,
quicksilver (mercury), vermilion, coral, saffron, coloured velvets, rose water,
knives, coloured
camlets , gold and silver.
Persian
horses were
imported to Cannanore before a two week land trip to the capital. Silk arrived
from China and sugar from
Bengal .
East coast trade hummed, with goods arriving from
Golkonda
where rice, millet, pulse and tobacco were grown on a large scale. Dye crops of
indigo and
chay root
were produced for
the weaving industry. A mineral rich region,
Machilipatnam
was the
gateway for high quality iron and steel exports. Diamond mining was active in
the Kollur region. The cotton weaving industry produced two types of cottons,
plain
calico
and muslin
(brown, bleached or dyed). Cloth printed with coloured patterns crafted by
native techniques were exported to
Java
and the
Far East . Golkonda specialised
in plain cotton and
Pulicat
in printed. The main
imports on the east coast were non-ferrous metals, camphor, porcelain, silk and
luxury goods.
Culture
Most information on the social life in
Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence
that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The
Hindu caste system
was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body
of elders who represented the community. These elders set the rules and
regulations that were implemented with the help of royal decrees.
Untouchability
was part
of the caste system and these communities were represented by leaders
( Kaivadadavaru ). The Muslim communities were represented by their own
group in coastal Karnataka. The caste system did not, however, prevent
distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high ranking cadre
in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system,
Brahmins
enjoyed a
high level of respect. With the exception of a few who took to military careers,
most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation
from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial
matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated
investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order. However, the
popularity of low-caste scholars (such as
Molla
and
Kanakadasa )
and their works (including those of
Vemana
and
Sarvajna ) is an indication of
the degree of social fluidity in the society.
The practice of
Sati
was common, though
voluntary, and mostly practiced among the upper classes. Over fifty inscriptions
attesting to this have been discovered in the Vijayanagara principality alone.
These inscriptions are called
Satikal
(Sati stone) or
Sati-virakal
(Sati
hero stone ).
Satikals
commemorated the death of a woman by entering into fire after
the death of her husband while
Sati-virakals
were made for a woman who
performed
Sati
after her husband's heroic death. Either way, the woman
was raised to the level of a demi-goddess and proclaimed by the sculpture of a
Sun and crescent moon on the stone.
The socio-religious movements of the previous
centuries, such as
Lingayatism , provided
momentum for flexible social norms to which women were expected to abide. By
this time
South Indian
women had
crossed most barriers and were actively involved in matters hitherto considered
the monopoly of men, such as administration, business and trade, and involvement
in the fine arts.
Tirumalamba Devi
who wrote
Varadambika Parinayam
and
Gangadevi
who wrote
Madhuravijayam
were among the notable women poets of the era. Early
Telugu women poets like
Tallapaka Timmakka
and Atukuri
Molla became popular during this period. The court of the
Nayaks of Tanjore
is
known to have patronised several women poets. The
Devadasi system
existed,
as well as legalised prostitution relegated to a few streets in each city. The
popularity of harems amongst men of the royalty is well known from records.
Well-to-do men wore the
Petha or
Kulavi , a tall
turban
made of silk and decorated
with gold. As in most Indian societies, jewellery was used by men and women and
records describe the use of anklets, bracelets, finger-rings, necklaces and ear
rings of various types. During celebrations, men and women adorned themselves
with flower garlands and used perfumes made of
rose water ,
civet ,
musk
or
sandalwood . In stark contrast
to the commoners whose lives were modest, the lives of the empire's kings and
queens were full of ceremonial pomp in the court. Queens and princesses had
numerous attendants who were lavishly dressed and adorned with fine jewellery,
their daily duties being light.
Physical exercises were popular with men and
wrestling was an important male preoccupation for sport and entertainment. Even
women wrestlers are mentioned in records. Gymnasiums have been discovered inside
royal quarters and records speak of regular physical training for commanders and
their armies during peace time. Royal palaces and market places had special
arenas where royalty and common people alike amused themselves by watching
matches such as cock fights, ram fights and wrestling between women. Excavations
within the Vijayanagara city limits have revealed the existence of various types
of community-based activities in the form of engravings on boulders, rock
platforms and temple floors, implying these were places of casual social
interaction. Some of these games are in use today and others are yet to be
identified.
Religion
The Vijayanagara kings were tolerant of all
religions and sects as writings by foreign visitors show. The kings used titles
such as
Gobrahamana Pratipalanacharya
("protector of cows") and
Hindurayasuratrana
("upholder of Hindu faith") that testified to their
intention of protecting Hinduism and yet were at the same time staunchly
Islamicate in their court ceremonials and dress as Philip Wagoner points out in
his 1996 article 'Sultan Among Hindu Kings' published in the Journal of Asian
Studies. The Empire's founders Harihara I and Bukka Raya I were devout
Shaivas
(worshippers
of
Shiva ), but made
grants to the
Vaishnava
order of
Sringeri
with
Vidyaranya
as their patron saint, and designated
Varaha
(the boar, an
avatar
of
Vishnu ) as their
emblem . It is also
important to note here that over one-fourth of the archaeological dig found a
"Islamic Quarter" not far from the "Royal Quarter." Nobles from Central Asia's
Timurid kingdoms also came down to Vijayanagara. The later
Saluva
and
Tuluva
kings were Vaishnava by
faith, but worshipped at the feet of Lord Virupaksha (Shiva) at Hampi as well as
Lord
Venkateshwara
(Vishnu) at
Tirupati . A
Sanskrit work,
Jambavati Kalyanam
by King Krishnadevaraya, called Lord
Virupaksha
Karnata Rajya Raksha Mani
("protective jewel of
Karnata Empire "). The
kings patronised the saints of the
dvaita
order (philosophy of
dualism) of
Madhvacharya
at
Udupi .The
Bhakti
(devotional)
movement was active during this time, and involved well known
Haridasas
(devotee saints) of
that time. Like the
Virashaiva
movement of the
12th century, this movement presented another strong current of devotion,
pervading the lives of millions. The haridasas represented two groups, the
Vyasakuta
and
Dasakuta , the former
being required to be proficient in the
Vedas ,
Upanishads
and other
Darshanas ,
while the
Dasakuta
merely conveyed the message of Madhvacharya through
the Kannada language to the people in the form of devotional songs
( Devaranamas
and
Kirthanas ). The philosophy of Madhvacharya
was spread by eminent disciples such as
Naraharitirtha ,
Jayatirtha ,
Vyasatirtha ,
Sripadaraya ,
Vadirajatirtha
and
others. Vyasatirtha, the
guru
(teacher) of Vadirajatirtha,
Purandaradasa
(Father of
Carnatic music) and
Kanakadasa
earned the
devotion of King Krishnadevaraya. The king considered the saint his
Kuladevata
(family deity) and honoured him in his writings. During this
time, another great composer of early carnatic music,
Annamacharya
composed
hundreds of
Kirthanas
in
Telugu
at
Tirupati
in present
day
Andhra Pradesh .
The defeat of the
Jain
Western Ganga
Dynasty
by the Cholas in early 11th century and the rising numbers of
followers of Vaishnava Hinduism and Virashaivism in the 12th century was
mirrored by a decreased interest in Jainism. Two notable locations of Jain
worship in the Vijayanagara territory were
Shravanabelagola
and
Kambadahalli .
Islamic
contact with South India
began as early as the 7th century, a result of trade between the Southern
kingdoms and
Arab
lands.
Jumma
Masjids
existed in
the Rashtrakuta empire by the 10th century and many mosques flourished on the
Malabar
coast
by the early 14th century. Muslim settlers married local women; their
children were known as Mappillas ( Moplahs ) and were actively involved
in
horse trading
and manning
shipping fleets. The interactions between the Vijayanagara empire and the
Bahamani Sultanates to the north increased the presence of Muslims in the south.
The introduction of
Christianity
began as early
as the 8th century as shown by the finding of
copper
plates
inscribed with land grants to Malabar Christians. Christian travelers
wrote of the scarcity of Christians in South India in the Middle Ages, promoting
its attractiveness to missionaries. The arrival of the
Portuguese
in the 15th
century and their connections through trade with the empire, the propagation of
the faith by
Saint Xavier
(1545) and
later the presence of
Dutch
settlements
fostered the growth of Christianity in the south.
Literature
During the rule of the Vijayanagar Empire, poets,
scholars and philosophers wrote in Sanskrit and the regional languages, Kannada,
Telugu and Tamil and covered such subjects as religion, biography,
Prabhanda
(fiction), music, grammar, poetry and medicine. The Telugu
language became a popular literary medium, reaching its peak under the patronage
of
Krishnadevaraya .
Most Sanskrit works were commentaries either on
the
Vedas
or on the
Ramayana
and
Mahabharata
epics, written
by well known figures such as
Sayana
and Vidyaranya that
extolled the superiority of the
Advaita
philosophy over other
rival Hindu philosophies. Other writers were famous
Dvaita
saints of the
Udupi
order such as
Jayatirtha (earning the title
Tikacharya
for his polemicial writings),
Vyasatirtha who wrote rebuttals to the Advaita philosophy and of the conclusions
of earlier logicians, and Vadirajatirtha and Sripadaraya both of whom criticised
the beliefs of
Adi Sankara . Apart from
these saints, noted Sanskrit scholars adorned the courts of the Vijayanagara
kings and their feudatory chiefdoms. Many kings of the dynasty were themselves
litterateurs and authored classics such as King Krishnadevaraya's
Jambavati
Kalyana , a poetic and dramatically skillful work.
The
Kannada
poets and scholars of the empire
produced important writings supporting the
Vaishnava
Bhakti
movement heralded by the
Haridasas
(devotees of Vishnu),
Brahminical
and
Virashaiva ( Lingayatism ) literature. The
Haridasa
poets
celebrated their devotion through songs called
Devaranama
(lyrical
poems) in the
ragale
metre. Their inspirations were the teachings of
Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the
foremost among many
Dasas
(devotees) by virtue of their immense
contribution.
Kumara Vyasa , the most
notable of Brahmin scholars wrote
Gadugina Bharata , a translation of
the epic
Mahabharata . This work marks a transition of Kannada
literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada.
Chamarasa
was a famous
Virashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the
court of Devaraya II. His
Prabhulinga Lile , later translated into
Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint
Allama Prabhu
(the saint
was considered an incarnation of Lord
Ganapathi
while
Parvati
took the
form of a princess of Banavasi).
At this peak of
Telugu
literature, the
most famous writing in the
Prabhanda
style was
Manucharitamu .
King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated
Amuktamalyada . In his court were the eight famous scholars regarded as
the pillars ( Ashtadiggajas ) of the
literary assembly, the most famous being
Allasani Peddana
honoured with the title
Andhrakavitapitamaha
(father of Telugu poetry)
and
Tenali Ramakrishna ,
Krishnadevaraya's court jester who authored several acclaimed works. This was
the age of
Srinatha , the greatest of all
Telugu poets in legend, who wrote books like
Marutratcharitamu
and
Salivahana-sapta-sati . He was patronised by King Devaraya II and his
stature was equal to the most important ministers in the court.
Though much of the
Tamil
literature from
this period came from Tamil speaking regions ruled by the feudatory Pandya who
gave particular attention on the cultivation of Tamil literature, some poets
were patronised by the Vijayanagara kings.
Svarupananda
Desikar
wrote an anthology of 2824 verses,
Sivaprakasap-perundirattu , on the Advaita philosophy. His pupil the
ascetic,
Tattuvarayar , wrote a
shorter anthology,
Kurundirattu , that contained about half the number
of verses. Krishnadevaraya patronised the Tamil Vaishnava poet Haridasa whose
Irusamaya Vilakkam
was an exposition of the two Hindu systems,
Vaishnava and Shaiva, with a preference for the former. Notable among secular
writings on music and medicine were
Vidyaranya 's
Sangitsara ,
Praudha Raya 's
Ratiratnapradipika ,
Sayana 's
Ayurveda
Sudhanidhi
and
Lakshmana Pandita 's
Vaidyarajavallabham .
Architecture
Vijayanagara architecture is a vibrant
combination of the
Chalukya ,
Hoysala ,
Pandya
and
Chola
styles, idioms that prospered in previous centuries. Its legacy of sculpture,
architecture and painting influenced the development of the arts long after the
empire came to an end. Its stylistic hallmark is the ornate
pillared
Kalyanamantapa
(marriage hall),
Vasanthamantapa
(open pillared halls) and the
Rayagopura
(tower). Artisans used the locally available hard granite
because of its durability since the kingdom was under constant threat of
invasion. While the empire's monuments are spread over the whole of Southern
India, nothing surpasses the vast open air theatre of monuments at its capital
at
Vijayanagara , a
UNESCO
World Heritage Site .
In the 14th century the kings continued to build
Vesara
or Deccan
style monuments but later incorporated dravida-style
gopurams
to meet their
ritualistic needs. The Prasanna Virupaksha temple (underground temple) of
Bukka Raya
I
and the Hazare Rama temple of Deva Raya I are examples of Deccan
architecture. The varied and intricate ornamentation of the pillars is a mark of
their work. At Hampi, though the
Vitthala
temple is the best example of
their pillared
Kalyanamantapa
style, the
Hazara Ramaswamy
temple is a modest but perfectly finished example. A visible aspect of their
style is their return to the simplistic and serene art developed by the Chalukya
dynasty. A grand specimen of Vijayanagara art, the
Vitthala
temple,
took several decades to complete during the reign of the Tuluva kings.
Another element of the Vijayanagara style is the
carving of large
monoliths
such as the
Sasivekalu
(mustard)
Ganesha
and
Kadalekalu
(Ground nut) Ganesha at Hampi, the
Gomateshwara
statues in
Karkala
and
Venur , and the
Nandi
bull in
Lepakshi . The Vijayanagara
temples of
Bhatkal ,
Kanakagiri ,
Sringeri
and other towns of
coastal Karnataka, as well as
Tadpatri ,
Lepakshi ,
Ahobilam ,
Tirupati
and
Srikalahasti
in
Andhra
Pradesh , and
Vellore ,
Kumbakonam ,
Kanchi
and
Srirangam
in
Tamil Nadu
are examples of this style. Vijayanagara art includes wall-paintings such as
Dasavathara
(ten
avatars
of Vishnu) and
Girijakalyana
(marriage of Goddess
Parvati ) in the
Virupaksha
temple at Hampi, the
Shivapurana
paintings (tales of Shiva) at the
Virabhadra
temple at
Lepakshi , and those at the Jain
basadi
(temple) and the Kamaskshi and Varadaraja temple at Kanchi. This
mingling of the South Indian styles resulted in a richness not seen in earlier
centuries, a focus on
reliefs
in addition to sculpture
that surpasses that previously in India.
An aspect of Vijayanagara architecture that shows
the cosmopolitanism of the great city is the presence of many secular structures
bearing Islamic features. While political history concentrates on the ongoing
conflict between the Vijayanagara Empire and the Deccan Sultanates, the
architectural record reflects a more creative interaction. There are many
arches ,
domes
and
vaults
that show
these influences. The concentration of structures like
pavilions ,
stables
and
towers
suggests they were for use
by royalty. The decorative details of these structures may have been absorbed
into Vijayanagara architecture during the early 15th century, coinciding with
the rule of Deva Raya I and Deva Raya II. These kings are known to have employed
many Muslims in their army and court, some of whom may have been
Muslim architects .
This harmonious exchange of architectural ideas must have happened during rare
periods of peace between the Hindu and Muslim kingdoms. The "Great Platform"
( Mahanavami dibba ) has relief carvings in which the figures seem to
have the facial features of central Asian Turks who were known to have been
employed as royal attendants.
Language
Kannada, Telugu and Tamil were used in their
respective regions of the empire. Over 7000 inscriptions ( Shasana )
including 300 copper plate inscriptions ( Tamarashasana ) have been
recovered, almost half of which are in Kannada, the remaining in Telugu, Tamil
and Sanskrit. Bilingual inscriptions had lost favour by the 14th century. The
empire minted coins at Hampi, Penugonda and Tirupati with
Nagari , Kannada and Telugu
legends usually carrying the name of the ruler. [105] [106]
Gold, silver and copper were used to issue coins called
Gadyana ,
Varaha ,
Pon ,
Pagoda ,
Pratapa ,
Pana ,
Kasu
and
Jital . The coins contained the images of various Gods
including Balakrishna (infant Krishna),
Venkateshwara
(the
presiding deity of the temple at Tirupati), Goddesses such as
Bhudevi
and Sridevi, divine
couples, animals such as bulls and elephants and birds. The earliest coins
feature
Hanuman
and the
Garuda
(divine eagle), the vehicle of Lord Vishnu. Kannada and Telugu inscriptions have
been deciphered and recorded by historians of the
Archaeological
Survey of India .
Kingdom of Mysore
The
Kingdom of Mysore
( Kannada
maisūru
sa ṃ sthāna ) (1399–1947 AD) was a kingdom of
southern India ,
traditionally believed to have been founded in 1399 in the vicinity of the
modern city of
Mysore . The kingdom, which was
ruled by the
Wodeyar
family (Yadav Dynasty),
initially served as a
vassal state
of the
Vijayanagara Empire .
With the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire (circa 1565), the kingdom became
independent. The 17th century saw a steady expansion of its territory and, under
Narasaraja Wodeyar
I
and
Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar ,
the kingdom annexed large expanses of what is now southern Karnataka and parts
of Tamil Nadu to become a powerful state in the southern
Deccan .
The kingdom reached the height of its military
power and dominion in the latter half of the 18th century under
Haider Ali
and his son
Tipu Sultan , who deposed the
Wodeyars to take control of the kingdom. During this time, it came into conflict
with the
Marathas , the
British
and the
Nizam
of
Golconda
which
culminated in the four
Anglo-Mysore wars .
Success in the first two Anglo-Mysore wars was followed by defeat in the third
and fourth. Following Tipu's death in the fourth war of 1799, large parts of the
kingdom were annexed by British which signaled the end of a period of Mysorean
hegemony over southern Deccan. The British, however, restored the Wodeyars to
the throne by way of a
subsidiary alliance
and a diminished Mysore was now transformed into a
Princely state . The
Wodeyars continued to rule the state until
Indian
independence in 1947 , when Mysore acceded to the
Union of India .
Even as a princely state, Mysore came to be
counted among the more modern and urbanized regions of India. This period
(1799–1947) also saw Mysore emerge as one of the important centers of art and
culture in India. The Mysore kings were not only accomplished exponents of the
fine arts and men of letters, they were enthusiastic patrons as well and their
legacies continue to influence music and art even today.
History
Early history
Kingdom of Mysore (1704) during the rule of King
Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar
Sources for the history of the kingdom include
numerous extant lithic and copper plate
inscriptions , records from the
Mysore palace and contemporary literary sources in
Kannada ,
Persian
and other
languages. According to traditional accounts, the kingdom originated as a small
state based in the modern city of
Mysore
and was founded by two
brothers, Yaduraya (Bothh were Yadavs of Gujarat) (also known as Vijaya) and
Krishnaraya. Their origins are mired in legend and are still a matter of debate;
while some historians posit a northern origin at
Dwaraka , others locate it in
Karnataka. Yaduraya is said to have married Chikkadevarasi, the local princess
and assumed the feudal title "Wodeyar" ( lit , "Lord"), which the ensuing
dynasty retained. The first unambiguous mention of the Wodeyar family is in 16th
century
Kannada literature
from the reign of the Vijayanagara king
Achyuta Deva Raya
(1529–1542); the earliest available inscription, issued by the Wodeyars
themselves, dates to the rule of the petty chief Timmaraja II in 1551.
Autonomy: advances and
reversals
The kings who followed ruled as vassals of the
Vijayanagara empire until the decline of the latter in 1565. By this time, the
kingdom had expanded to thirty-three villages protected by a force of 300
soldiers. King Timmaraja II conquered some surrounding chiefdoms, and King
Bola
Chamaraja IV ( lit , "Bald"), the first ruler of any
political significance among them, withheld tribute to the nominal Vijayanagara
monarch Aravidu Ramaraya. After the death of Aravidu Ramaraya, the Wodeyars
began to assert themselves further and King Raja Wodeyar I wrested control of
Srirangapatna
from the
Vijayanagara governor ( Mahamandaleshvara ) Aravidu Tirumalla – a
development which elicited, if only
ex post facto , the tacit approval
of Venkatapati Raya, the incumbent king of the diminished Vijayanagar empire
ruled from
Chandragiri . Raja Wodeyar
I's reign also saw territorial expansion with the annexation of
Channapatna
to the north
from Jaggadeva Raya– a development which made Mysore a regional political factor
to reckon with.
Consequently, by 1612–13, the Wodeyars exercised
a great deal of autonomy and even though they acknowledged the nominal
overlordship of the Aravidus, tributes and transfers of revenue to Chandragiri
stopped. This was in marked contrast to the major chiefs ( Nayakas ) of
Tamil country who continued to pay off Chandragiri well into the 1630s.
Chamaraja V and Kanthirava Narasaraja I attempted to expand further northward
but were thwarted by the
Bijapur Sultanate
and
its Maratha subordinates, though the Bijapur armies under Ranadullah Khan were
effectively repelled in their 1638 siege of Srirangapatna. Expansionist
ambitions then turned southward into Tamil country where Narasaraja Wodeyar
acquired Satyamangalam (in modern northern
Coimbatore
district) while
his successor Dodda Devaraja Wodeyar expanded further to capture western Tamil
regions of
Erode
and
Dharmapuri , after
successfully repulsing the chiefs of
Madurai . The invasion of the
Keladi
Nayakas
of
Malnad
was also dealt with
successfully. This period was followed by one of complex geo-political changes,
when in the 1670s, the Marathas and the Mughals pressed into the Deccan.
Chikka Devaraja (r. 1672–1704), the most notable
of Mysore's early kings, who ruled during much of this period, managed to not
only survive the exigencies but further expanded territory. He achieved this by
forging strategic alliances with the Marathas and the
Mughals . The kingdom soon
grew to include
Salem
and
Bangalore
to
the east,
Hassan
to the west,
Chikkamagaluru
and
Tumkur
to the north
and the rest of
Coimbatore
to the south.
Despite this expansion, the kingdom, which now accounted for a fair share of
land in the southern Indian heartland, extending from the
Western
Ghats
to the western boundaries of the
Coromandel
plain, remained
landlocked without direct coastal access. Chikka Devaraja's attempts to remedy
this brought Mysore into conflict with the
Nayaka
chiefs of
Ikkeri
and the
kings ( Rajas ) of Kodagu (modern Coorg); who between them controlled the
Kanara
coast
(coastal areas of modern Karnataka) and the intervening hill region
respectively. The conflict brought mixed results with Mysore annexing
Periyapatna but suffering a reversal at Palupare.
Nevertheless, from around 1704, when the kingdom
passed on to "Muteking" ( Mukarasu )
Kanthirava Narasaraja
II , the survival and expansion of the kingdom was achieved by playing a
delicate game of alliance, negotiation, subordination on occasion, and
annexation of territory in all directions. According to historians Sanjay
Subrahmanyam and Sethu Madhava Rao, Mysore was now formally a tributary of the
Mughal empire. Mughul records claim a regular tribute ( peshkash ) was
paid by Mysore. However, historian Suryanath Kamath feels the Mughals may have
considered Mysore an ally, a situation brought about by Mughal–Maratha
competition for supremacy in southern India. By the 1720s, with the Mughal
empire in decline, further complications arose with the Mughal residents at both
Arcot
and
Sira
claiming tribute. The years that followed saw Krishnaraja Wodeyar I tread
cautiously on the matter while keeping the Kodagu chiefs and the Marathas at
bay. He was followed by Chamaraja Wodeyar VI during whose reign power fell into
the hands of prime minister ( Dalwai
or
Dalavoy ) Nanjarajiah
(or Nanjaraja) and chief minister ( Sarvadhikari ) Devarajiah (or
Devaraja), the influential brothers from Kalale town near
Nanjangud
who would rule for
the next three decades with the Wodeyars relegated to being the titular heads.
The latter part of the rule of
Krishnaraja II
saw the Deccan Sultanates being eclipsed by the Mughals and in the confusion
that ensued,
Haider Ali , a captain in the
army, rose to prominence. His victory against the Marathas at
Bangalore
in 1758, resulting
in the annexation of their territory, made him an iconic figure. In honour of
his achievements, the king gave him the title "Nawab Haider Ali Khan
Bahadur".
Princely State
Following Tipu's fall, a part of the kingdom of
Mysore was annexed and divided between the Madras Presidency and the Nizam. The
remaining territory was transformed into a Princely State; the five-year-old
scion of the Wodeyar family,
Krishnaraja III ,
was installed on the throne with chief minister ( Diwan ) Purniah, who
had earlier served under Tipu, handling the reins as regent and Lt. Col.
Barry
Close
taking charge as the British Resident. The British now took control of
Mysore's foreign policy and also exacted an annual tribute and a subsidy for
maintaining a standing British army at Mysore. As Diwan, Purniah distinguished
himself with his progressive and innovative administration until he retired from
service in 1811 (and died shortly thereafter) following the 16th birthday of the
boy king.
The years that followed witnessed cordial
relations between Mysore and the British until things began to sour in the
1820s. Even though the Governor of Madras, Thomas Munro determined after a
personal investigation in 1825 that there was no substance to the allegations of
financial impropriety made by A. H. Cole, the incumbent Resident of Mysore, the
civil
insurrection
which broke out towards the end of the decade changed things
considerably. In 1831, close on the heels of the insurrection and citing
mal-administration, the British took direct control of the princely state. For
the next fifty years, Mysore passed under the rule of successive British
Commissioners; Sir
Mark Cubbon , renowned for
his statesmanship, served from 1834 until 1861 and put into place an efficient
and successful administrative system which left Mysore a well developed state.
In 1876–77, however, towards the end of the direct British rule, Mysore was
struck by a devastating famine with estimated mortality figures which ranged
between 700,000 and 1,100,000, or nearly a fifth of the population. Shortly
thereafter, Maharaja Chamaraja IX, educated in the British system, took over the
rule of Mysore in 1881, following the success of a lobby set up by the Wodeyar
dynasty that was in favour of
rendition . Accordingly,
a resident British officer was appointed at the Mysore court and a Diwan was to
handle the administration. From then onwards, until Indian independence in 1947,
Mysore remained a Princely State under the
British Raj
with the
Wodeyars continuing their rule.
After the demise of Maharaja Chamaraja IX,
Krishnaraja
IV , still a boy of eleven ascended the throne in 1895. His mother Maharani
Kemparajammanniyavaru ruled as regent until Krishnaraja took over the reins on 8
February 1902. Under his rule, with Sir M. Vishweshwariah as his Diwan, the
Maharaja set about transforming Mysore into a progressive and modern state,
particularly in industry, education, agriculture and art. Such were the strides
that Mysore made that
Mahatma Gandhi
called the
Maharaja a "saintly king" ( Rajarishi ). [54]
Paul
Brunton , the British philosopher and orientalist,
John Gunther , the American
author, and British statesman Lord Samuel praised the ruler's efforts. Much of
the pioneering work in educational infrastructure that took place during this
period would serve Karnataka invaluably in the coming decades. The Maharaja was
an accomplished musician, and like his predecessors, avidly patronised the
development of the fine arts. He was followed by his nephew
Jayachamaraja
whose rule came to an end when he signed the instrument of accession and Mysore
joined the Indian Union on 9 August 1947.
Administration
There are no records relating to the
administration of the Mysore territory during the
Vijayanagara
Empire 's reign (1399–1565). Signs of a well organised and independent
administration appear from the time of Raja Wodeyar I who is believed to have
been sympathetic towards peasants ( raiyats ) who were exempted
from any increases in taxation during his time. The first sign that the kingdom
had established itself in the area was the issuing of gold coins ( Kanthirayi
phanam ) resembling those of the erstwhile Vijayanagara Empire during
Narasaraja Wodeyar's rule.
The rule of Chikka Devaraja saw several reforms
were effected. Internal administration was remodeled to suit the kingdom's
growing needs and became more efficient. A postal system came into being. Far
reaching financial reforms were also introduced. A number of petty taxes were
imposed in place of direct taxes, as a result of which the peasants were
compelled to pay more by way of land tax. ]
The king is said to have taken a personal interest in the regular collection of
revenues the treasury burgeoned to 90,000,000  Pagoda
(a unit of
currency) – earning him the epithet "Nine
crore
Narayana" ( Navakoti
Narayana ). In 1700, he sent an embassy to Aurangazeb's court who bestowed
upon him the title
Jug Deo Raja
and awarded permission to sit on the
ivory throne. Following this, he founded the district offices ( Attara
Kacheri ), the central secretariat comprising eighteen departments, and his
administration was modeled on Mughal lines.
During
Haider Ali 's rule, the kingdom
was divided into five provinces ( Asofis ) of unequal size, comprising
171
taluks
( Paraganas ) in total. When
Tipu Sultan
became the
de facto
ruler, the kingdom, which encompassed 160,000 km 2
(61,776 sq mi) (62,000 mi²), was divided into 37 provinces and a total of 124
taluks ( Amil ). Each province had a governor ( Asof ), and one
deputy governor. Each taluk had a headman called
Amildar
and a group of
villages were in charge of a
Patel . [44]
The central administration comprised six departments headed by ministers, each
aided by an advisory council of up to four members.
When the
princely state
came under
direct British rule in 1831, early commissioners Lushington, Briggs and Morrison
were followed by Mark Cubbon, who took charge in 1834.  He made
Bangalore
the
capital and divided the princely state into four divisions, each under a British
superintendent. The state was further divided into 120 taluks with 85 taluk
courts, with all lower level administration in the Kannada language. The office
of the commissioner had eight departments; revenue, post, police, cavalry,
public works, medical, animal husbandry, judiciary and education. The judiciary
was hierarchical with the commissioners' court at the apex, followed by the
Huzur Adalat , four superintending courts and eight
Sadar
Munsiff
courts at the lowest level.
Lewin Bowring
became the chief commissioner in 1862 and held the position until 1870. During
his tenure, the property "Registration Act", the "Indian Penal code" and "Code
of Criminal Procedure" came into effect and the judiciary was separated from the
executive branch of the administration.
After rendition, Rangacharlu, a native of
Chennai , was made
the Diwan. Under him, the first Representative Assembly of British India, with
144 members, was formed in 1881. [64]
He was followed by Sheshadri Iyer in 1883 during whose tenure gold mining at the
Kolar Gold Fields
began, the
Shivanasamudra
hydroelectric
project was
initiated in 1899 (the first such major attempt in India) and electricity and
drinking water (the latter through pipes) was supplied to Bangalore. Sheshadri
Iyer was followed by P.N. Krishna Murthy, who founded The Secretariat Manual to
maintain records and the Co-operative Department in 1905, [65]
V.P. Madhava Rao who focussed on conservation of forests and T. Ananda Rao, who
finalised the Kannambadi Dam project.
Sir
M.
Visveshwarayya , popularly known as the "Maker of Modern Mysore", holds a key
place in the history of Karnataka. An engineer by education, he became the Diwan
in 1909. Under his tenure, membership of the Mysore Legislative Assembly was
increased from 18 to 24, and it was given the power to discuss the state budget.
The Mysore Economic Conference was expanded into three committees; industry and
commerce, education, and agriculture, with publications in English and Kannada.
Important projects commissioned during his time included the construction of the
Kannambadi
Dam, the founding
of the
Mysore
Iron Works at Bhadravathi , founding of the
Mysore University
in
1916, the
University
Visvesvaraya College of Engineering
in Bangalore, establishment of the
Mysore state railway department and numerous industries in Mysore. In 1955, he
was awarded the
Bharat Ratna , India's
highest civilian honor.
Sir
Mirza Ismail
took office as
Diwan in 1926 and built on the foundation laid by his predecessor. Amongst his
contributions were the expansion of the Bhadravathi Iron Works, the founding of
a cement and paper factory in
Bhadravathi
and
the launch of
Hindustan
Aeronautics Limited . A man with a penchant for gardens, he founded the
Brindavan Gardens
(Krishnaraja Sagar) and built the
Kaveri River
high-level
canal to irrigate 120,000 acres (490 km 2 ) in modern Mandya district.
Economy
The vast majority of the people lived in villages
and agriculture was their main occupation. The economy of the kingdom was based
on agriculture. Grains, pulses, vegetables and flowers were cultivated.
Commercial crops included sugarcane and cotton. The agrarian population
consisted of landlords ( gavunda ,
zamindar ,
heggadde ) who
tilled the land by employing a number of landless labourers, usually paying them
in grain. Minor cultivators were also willing to hire themselves out as
labourers if the need arose.  It was due to the availability of these landless
labourers that kings and landlords were able to execute major projects such as
palaces, temples, mosques, anicuts (dams) and tanks. Because land was abundant
and the population relatively sparse, no rent was charged on land ownership.
Instead, landowners paid tax for cultivation, which amounted to up to one-half
of all harvested produce.
Tipu Sultan is credited to have founded state
trading depots in various locations of his kingdom. In addition, he founded
depots in foreign locations such as
Karachi ,
Jeddah
and
Muscat , where Mysore
products were sold. During Tipu's rule French technology was used for the first
time in carpentry and
smithy ,
Chinese
technology was used for
sugar production, and technology from
Bengal
helped improve the
sericulture
industry. State
factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing
cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state held the monopoly in the
production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, cardamom, betel nut,
tobacco and
sandalwood , as well as the
extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and
precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries
and sericulture was developed in twenty-one centres within the kingdom.
This system changed under the British, when tax
payments were made in cash, and were used for the maintenance of the army,
police and other civil and public establishments. A portion of the tax was
transferred to England as the "Indian tribute". Unhappy with the loss of their
traditional revenue system and the problems they faced, peasants rose in
rebellion in many parts of south India. After 1800, the Cornwallis land reforms
came into effect. Reade, Munro, Graham and Thackeray were some administrators
who improved the economic conditions of the masses. However, the homespun
textile
industry
suffered during British rule, with the exception of the producers of the finest
cloth and the coarse cloth which was popular with the rural masses. This was due
to the manufacturing mills of
Manchester ,
Liverpool
and
Scotland
being more than a match for the traditional handweaving industry, especially in
spinning and weaving.
The economic revolution in England and the tariff
policies of the British also caused massive de-industrialization in other
sectors throughout India and Mysore. For example, the gunny bag weaving business
had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, which they lost when the British began
ruling the area. The import of a chemical substitute for saltpetre (potassium
nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for
use in gunpowder. The import of kerosene affected the Ganiga community which
supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries had an impact on the
native pottery business and mill-made blankets replaced the country-made
blankets called
kambli . This economic fallout led to the formation of
community-based social welfare organisations to help those within the community
to cope better with their new economic situation, including youth hostels for
students seeking education and shelter. However, the British economic policies
created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class
comprising various blue and white-collared occupational groups, including
agents, brokers, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and physicians. Due to a more
flexible caste hierarchy, the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of
people from different castes.
Culture
Religion
The early kings of the Wodeyar dynasty worshipped
the Hindu god Shiva. The later kings, starting from the 17th century, took to
Vaishnavism , the worship of
the Hindu god Vishnu. According to musicologist Meera Rajaram Pranesh, King Raja
Wodeyar I was a devotee of the god Vishnu, King Dodda Devaraja was honoured with
the title "Protector of Brahmins" ( Deva Brahmana Paripalaka ) for his
support to
Brahmins , and Maharaja
Krishnaraja III was devoted to the goddess Chamundeshwari (a form of Hindu
goddess
Durga ).
Wilks ("History of Mysore", 1800) wrote about a
Jangama
(Veerashaiva
saint-devotee of Shiva) uprising, related to excessive taxation, which was put
down firmly by Chikka Devaraja. Historian D.R. Nagaraj claims that four hundred
Jangamas
were murdered in the process but clarifies that Veerashiava
literature itself is silent about the issue. Historian Suryanath Kamath claims
King Chikka Devaraja was a Srivaishnava (follower of
Sri Vaishnavism , a sect
of Vaishnavism) but was not anti-Veerashaiva. Historian Aiyangar concurs that
some of the kings including the celebrated Narasaraja I and Chikka Devaraja were
Vaishnavas, but suggests this may not have been the case with all Wodeyar
rulers. The rise of the modern day Mysore city as a centre of
south Indian
culture
has been traced from the period of their sovereignty. Raja Wodeyar I
initiated the celebration of the
Dasara
festival in Mysore,
a proud tradition of the erstwhile Vijayanagara royal family.
Jainism, though in decline during the late
medieval period, also enjoyed the patronage of the Mysore kings, who made
munificent endowments to the
Jain
monastic order at the town of
Shravanabelagola .
Records indicate that some Wodeyar kings not only presided over the
Mahamastakabhisheka
ceremony, an important Jain religious event at Shravanabelagola, but also
personally offered prayers ( puja ) during
the years 1659, 1677, 1800, 1825, 1910, 1925, 1940, and 1953.
The contact between South India and
Islam
goes back to the
7th century, when trade between Hindu kingdoms and
Islamic
caliphates
thrived. These
Muslim traders settled on the
Malabar
coast and married local
Hindu women, and their descendants came to be known as
Mappillas . By
the 14th century, Muslims had become a significant minority in the south, though
the advent of Portuguese missionaries checked their growth. Haider Ali, though a
devout Muslim, did not allow his faith to interfere with the administration of
the predominantly Hindu kingdom. Historians are, however, divided on the
intentions of Haider Ali's son, Tipu Sultan. It has been claimed that Tipu
raised Hindus to prominent positions in his administration, made generous grants
to Hindu temples and brahmins, and generally respected other faiths, and that
any religious conversions that Tipu undertook were as punishment to those who
rebelled against his authority. However, this has been countered by other
historians who claim that Tipu Sultan treated the non-Muslims of Mysore far
better than those of the Malabar,
Raichur
and
Kodagu
regions. They opine that
Tipu was responsible for mass conversions of Christians and Hindus in these
regions, either by force or by offering them tax incentives and revenue benefits
to convert.
Society
Prior to the 18th century, the society of the
kingdom followed age-old and deeply established norms of social interaction
between people. Accounts by contemporaneous travellers indicate the widespread
practice of the
Hindu caste system
and of animal sacrifices during the nine day celebrations (called
Mahanavami ). Later, fundamental changes occurred due to the struggle
between native and foreign powers. Though wars between the Hindu kingdoms and
the Sultanates continued, the battles between native rulers (including Muslims)
and the newly arrived British took centre stage. The spread of English
education, the introduction of the printing press and the criticism of the
prevailing social system by Christian missionaries helped make the society more
open and flexible. The rise of modern nationalism throughout India also had its
impact on Mysore.
With the advent of British power, English
education gained prominence in addition to traditional education in local
languages. These changes were orchestrated by
Lord Elphinstone , the
governor of the
Madras Presidency . His
plan became the constitution of the central collegiate institution or University
Board in 1841. Accordingly, a high school department of the university was
established. For imparting education in the interior regions, schools were
raised in principal towns which eventually were elevated to college level, with
each college becoming central to many local schools ( zilla
schools).The
earliest English-medium schools appeared in 1833 in Mysore and spread across the
region. In 1858, the department of education was founded in Mysore and by 1881,
there were an estimated 2,087 English-medium schools in the state of Mysore.
Higher education became available with the formation of Bangalore Central
College in Bangalore (1870), Maharaja's college (1879), Maharani's college
(1901) and the
Mysore University
(1916) in Mysore and the St. Agnes college in Mangalore (1921).
Social reforms aimed at removing practices such
as
sati
and social
discrimination based upon
untouchability , as well as demands
for the emancipation of the lower classes, swept across India and influenced
Mysore territory.In 1894, the kingdom passed laws to abolish the marriage of
girls below the age of eight. Remarriage of widowed women and marriage of
destitute women was encouraged, and in 1923, women were granted the permission
to exercise their franchise in elections. There were, however, uprisings against
British authority in the Mysore territory, notably the
Kodagu
uprising in 1835 (after
the British dethroned the local ruler Chikkaviraraja) and the
Kanara
uprising of 1837. The era
of printing heralded by Christian missionaries resulted in the founding of
printing presses across the kingdom. The publication of ancient and contemporary
Kannada books (such as the
Pampa Bharata
and the
Jaimini
Bharata ), a Kannada-language
Bible , a bilingual dictionary and
a Kannada newspaper called
Kannada Samachara
began in the early 19th
century.
Aluru Venkata Rao
published a consolidated Kannada history glorifying the achievements of
Kannadigas
in his book
Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava .
Classical English and Sanskrit plays,  and native
Yakshagana plays influenced the Kannada stage and produced famous dramatists
like
Gubbi Veeranna .The public
began to enjoy Carnatic music through its broadcast via public address systems
set up on the palace grounds. Mysore paintings, which were inspired by the
Bengal Renaissance ,
were created by artists such as Sundarayya, Ala Singarayya, and B. Venkatappa.
Literature
The era of the Kingdom of Mysore is considered an
important age in the development of
Kannada literature .
Not only was the Mysore court adorned by famous
Brahmin
and
Veerashaiva
writers and
composers, the kings themselves were accomplished in the fine arts. While
conventional literature in philosophy and religion remained popular, writings in
new genres such as chronicle, biography, history, encyclopedia, novel, drama,
and musical treatise became popular. A native form of folk literature with
dramatic representation called
Yakshagana
gained popularity.
A remarkable development of the later period was the influence of
English literature
and classical
Sanskrit literature
on Kannada.
Govinda Vaidya, a native of
Srirangapatna , wrote
Kanthirava Narasaraja Vijaya , a eulogy of his patron King Narasaraja I.
Written in
sangatya
metre (a composition meant to be rendered to the
accompaniment of a musical instrument), the book describes the king's court,
popular music and the types of musical compositions of the age in twenty-six
chapters. King Chikka Devaraja was the earliest composer of the dynasty. To him
is ascribed the famous treatise on music called
Geetha Gopala . Though
inspired by Jayadeva's Sanskrit writing
Geetha Govinda , it had an
originality of its own and was written in
saptapadi
metre. Contemporary
poets who left their mark on the entire Kannada-speaking region include the
brahmin
poet
Lakshmisa
and
the
itinerant
Veerashaiva
poet
Sarvajna . Female
poets also played a role in literary developments, with Cheluvambe (the queen of
Krishnaraja Wodeyar I), Helavanakatte Giriyamma, Sri Rangamma (1685) and
Sanchi
Honnamma
( Hadibadeya Dharma , late 17th century) writing notable
works.
A polyglot, King Narasaraja II authored fourteen
Yakshaganas in various languages, though all are written in Kannada script.
Maharaja Krishnaraja III was a prolific writer in Kannada for which he earned
the honorific
Abhinava Bhoja
(a comparison to the medieval King
Bhoja ). Over forty
writings are attributed to him, of which the musical treatise
Sri
Tatwanidhi
and a poetical romance called
Saugandika Parinaya
written in two versions, a
sangatya
and a drama, are most well-known.
Under the patronage of the Maharaja, Kannada literature began its slow and
gradual change towards modernity. Kempu Narayana's
Mudramanjusha
("The
Seal Casket", 1823) is the earliest work that has touches of modern prose.
However, the turning point came with the historically important
Adbhuta
Ramayana
(1895) and
Ramaswamedham
(1898) by Muddanna, whom the
Kannada scholar Narasimha Murthy considers "a
Janus
like figure" of modern
Kannada literature. Muddanna has deftly handled an ancient epic from an entirely
modern viewpoint.
Basavappa Shastry, a native of Mysore and a
luminary in the court of Maharaja Krishnaraja III and Maharaja Chamaraja IX, is
known as the "Father of Kannada theatre" ( Kannada Nataka Pitamaha ). He
authored dramas in Kannada and translated
William
Shakespeare 's "Othello" to
Shurasena Charite . His well-known
translations from Sanskrit to Kannada are many and include
Kalidasa ,
Abhignyana Shakuntala .
Music
Under Maharaja Krishnaraja III and his successors
– Chamaraja IX, Krishnaraja IV and the last ruler, Jayachamaraja, the Mysore
court came to be the largest and most renowned patron of music. While the
Tanjore and Travancore courts also extended great patronage and emphasised
preservation of the art, the unique combination of royal patronage of individual
musicians, founding of music schools to kindle public interest and a patronage
of European music publishers and producers set Mysore apart. Maharaja
Krishnaraja III, himself a musician and musicologist of merit, composed a number
of
javalis
(light lyrics) and devotional songs in Kannada under the
title
Anubhava pancharatna . His compositions bear the
nom de
plume
( mudra ) "Chamundi'" or
'"Chamundeshwari'", in honour of the Wodeyar family deity. His successor
Chamaraja IX founded the Oriental Library in 1891 to house music books and also
commissioned phonograph recordings of several musicians for the palace
library.
Under Krishnaraja IV, art received further
patronage. A distinct school of music which gave importance to
raga
and
bhava
evolved. The Royal
School of Music founded at the palace helped institutionalise teaching of the
art. Carnatic compositions were printed and the European staff notation came to
be employed by royal musicians. Western music was also encouraged – Margaret
Cousins' piano concerto with the Palace Orchestra marked the celebrations of
Beethoven's centenary in Bangalore. Maharaja Jayachamaraja, also a renowned
composer of Carnatic
kritis
(a musical
composition), sponsored a series of recordings of Russian composer Nikolas
Medtner and others.The court ensured that Carnatic music also kept up with the
times.
Gramophone recordings
of the palace band were made and sold commercially. Attention was paid to
"technology of the concert". Lavish sums were spent on acquiring various
instruments including the unconventional horn violin,
theremin
and
calliaphone ,
a mechanical music player.
The Mysore court was home to several renowned
experts ( vidwan ) of the time.
Veena Sheshanna , a court
musician during the rule of Maharaja Chamaraja IX, is considered one of the
greatest exponents of the
veena . His achievements in
classical music won Mysore a premier place in the art of instrumental Carnatic
music and he was given the honorific
Vainika Shikhamani
by Maharaja
Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV.
Mysore
Vasudevacharya
was a noted musician and composer in Sanskrit and Telugu from
Mysore. He holds the unique distinction of being patronised by four generations
of Mysore kings and rulers and for being court musician to three of them.
H.L. Muthiah
Bhagavatar
was another musician-composer who adorned the Mysore court.
Considered one of the most important composers of the post- Tyagaraja
period, he is
credited with about 400 compositions in Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu and Tamil
under the pen name "Harikesha". Among
violinists ,
T.
Chowdiah
emerged as one of the most accomplished exponents of the time. He
is known to have mastered the seven-stringed violin. Chowdiah was appointed
court musician by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV in 1939 and received such
titles as "Sangeeta Ratna" and "Sangeeta Kalanidhi". He is credited with
compositions in Kannada, Telugu and Sanskrit under the pen name "Trimakuta".
Architecture
The architectural style of courtly and royal
structures in the kingdom underwent profound changes during British rule – a
mingling of European traditions with native elements. The Hindu temples in the
kingdom were built in typical South Indian
Dravidian
style –
a modest version of the Vijayanagara building idiom. When in power, Tipu Sultan
constructed a palace and a mosque in Srirangapatna, his capital. However, it is
the city of Mysore that is best known for its royal palaces, earning it the
nickname "City of Palaces". The city's main palace, the
Mysore Palace , is also
known as the Amba Vilas Palace. The original complex was destroyed by fire and a
new palace was commissioned by the Queen-Regent and designed by the English
architect Henry Irwin in 1897. The overall design is a combination of Hindu,
Islamic,
Indo-Saracenic
and
Moorish
styles,
which for the first time in India, used cast iron columns and roof frames. The
striking feature of the exterior is the granite columns that support cusped
arches on the portico, a tall tower whose finial is a gilded dome with an
umbrella ( chattri ) on it, and groups of other domes around it.The
interior is richly decorated with marbled walls and a teakwood ceiling on which
are sculptures of Hindu deities. The
Durbar
hall leads to an
inner private hall through silver doors. This opulent room has floor planels
that are inlaid with semi-precious stones, and a stained glass roof supported
centrally by columns and arches. The marriage hall ( Kalyana mantapa ) in
the palace complex is noted for its stained glass octogonal dome with peacock
motifs. [
The
Lalitha Mahal
Palace was
built in 1921 by E.W. Fritchley under the commission of Maharaja Krishnaraja IV.
The architectural style is called "Renaissance" and exhibits concepts from
English
manor houses
and Italian
palazzos.The central dome is believed to be modelled on
St. Paul's
Cathedral
in London. Other important features are the Italian marble
staircase, the polished wooden flooring in the banquet and dance halls, and the
Belgian cut glass lamps. The
Jaganmohan Palace
was
commissioned in 1861 and was completed in 1910. The three storeyed building with
attractive
domes ,
finials
and
cupolas
was the
venue of many a royal celebration. It is now called the Chamarajendra Art
Gallery and houses a rich collection of artifacts.
The
Mysore University
campus, also called "Manasa Gangotri", is home to several architecturally
interesting buildings. Some of them are in European style and were completed in
late 19th century. They include the
Jayalakshmi Vilas
mansion, the Crawford Hall, the Oriental Research Institute (built between 1887
and 1891) with its Ionic and Corinthian columns, and the district offices
( Athara Kutchery , 1887). The Athara Kutchery, which initially served as
the office of the British commissioner, has an octagonal dome and a finial that
adds to its beauty. The maharaja's summer palace, built in 1880, is called the
Lokaranjan Mahal, and initially served as a school for royalty. The
Rajendra Vilas
Palace,
built in the Indo-British style atop the
Chamundi Hill , was
commissioned in 1922 and completed in 1938 by Maharaja Krishnaraja IV. Other
royal mansions built by the Mysore rulers were the Chittaranjan Mahal in Mysore
and the
Bangalore Palace
in
Bangalore, a structure built on the lines of England's
Windsor Castle . The
Central Food Technical Research Institute (Cheluvamba Mansion), built in
baroque
European
renaissance style, was once the residence of princess Cheluvambaamani Avaru, a
sister of Maharaja Krishnaraja IV. Its extensive pilaster work and mosaic
flooring are noteworthy.
Most famous among the many temples built by the
Wodeyars is the Chamundeshwari Temple atop the
Chamundi Hill . The
earliest structure here was consecrated in the 12th century and was later
patronised by the Mysore rulers. Maharaja Krishnaraja III added a
Dravidian-style
gopuram
in 1827. The temple has
silver-plated doors with images of deities. Other images include those of the
Hindu god
Ganesha
and of Maharaja
Krishnaraja III with his three queens. Surrounding the main palace in Mysore and
inside the fort are five temples, built in various periods. The Prasanna
Krishnaswamy Temple (1829), the Lakshmiramana Swamy Temple whose earliest
structures date to 1499, the Trinesvara Swamy Temple (late 16th century), the
Shweta Varaha Swamy Temple built by Purniah with a touch of Hoysala style of
architecture, the Prasanna Venkataramana Swami Temple (1836) notable for 12
murals of the Wodeyar rulers. Well-known temples outside Mysore city are the
yali
("mythical
beast") pillared Venkataramana Temple built in the late 17th century in the
Bangalore fort, and the Ranganatha temple in Srirangapatna.
Tipu Sultan built a wooden colonnaded palace
called the Dariya Daulat Palace ( lit , "garden of the wealth of the
sea") in Srirangapatna in 1784. Built in the Indo-Saracenic style, the palace is
known for its intricate woodwork consisting of ornamental arches, striped
columns and floral designs, and paintings. The west wall of the palace is
covered with murals depicting Tipu Sultan's victory over Colonel Baillie's army
at Pollilur, near
Kanchipuram
in 1780. One
mural shows Tipu enjoying the fragrance of a bouquet of flowers while the battle
is in progress. In that painting, the French soldiers'
moustaches
distinguish them
from the cleanshaven British soldiers. Also in Srirangapatna is the Gumbaz
mausoleum ,
built by Tipu Sultan in 1784. It houses the graves of Tipu and Haider Ali. The
granite base is capped with a dome built of brick and
pilaster .
Chandragupta Maurya
Chandragupta Maurya
( Sanskrit : चन्द्रगुप्त
मौर्य), (born c. 340BCE, ruled c. 320, – 298 BCEdied about 298 BCE) was the
founder of the
Maurya Empire .
Chandragupta succeeded in conquering most of the
Indian subcontinent .
Chandragupta, the first
Mauryan
king, claimed descent
from
Shakya
clan
of the
Kshatriya
varna . Having defeated
the Greek
satrap
in the
Khyber mountains
around 303
BC, Chandragupta was crowned King at
Taxila . As a result, Chandragupta
is considered the first unifier of India and its first genuine emperor. In
foreign
Greek
and
Latin
accounts, Chandragupta is
known as
Sandrokyptos
( Σανδρόκυπτος ),
Sandrokottos
( Σανδρόκοττος ) or
Androcottus .
Prior to Chandragupta's consolidation of power,
small regional kingdoms dominated the northwestern subcontinent, while the
Nanda
Dynasty
dominated the middle and lower basin of the Ganges. After
Chandragupta's conquests, the Maurya Empire extended from
Bengal
and
Assam
in the east, to
Afghanistan
and
Balochistan
in the
west, to
Kashmir
and
Nepal
in the north, and to the
Deccan
Plateau
in the south.
His achievements, which ranged from conquering Macedonian
satrapies
in the northwest and
conquering the
Nanda Empire
by the time he
was only about 20 years old, to achieving an alliance with
Seleucus I Nicator
and establishing centralized rule throughout
South Asia , remain some of
the most celebrated in the
history of India . Over
two thousand years later, the accomplishments of Chandragupta and his
successors, including
Ashoka the Great , are
objects of great study in the annals of South Asian and world
history.
Origins
While many Indian historians held the view that
Chandragupta was an
illegitimate
child of the
Nanda Dynasty of
Magadha
in
eastern India , born to a
Nanda prince (a Yadav King) and a
maid
named "Mura".
According to Col. James Tod Chandragupta was a
descendant of
Puru
dynasty:
“
Sandrocottus is mentioned by Arrian to be of this
line ; and we can have no hesitation, therefore, in giving him a place in the
dynasty of
Puru , the
second son of Yayati, whence the patronymic used by the race now extinct, as was
Yadu , the elder
brother of Puru.,
”
—, Annals and
Antiquities of Rajasthan, By James Tod , pp 37
Another popular legend among the common folks of
India
is that
Chandragupta was a shepherd( Kuruba / Dhangar ) boy who with the help
of the
Brahmin
Chanakya
revolted against the atrocities of the
Nanda
kings and established the
Mauryan Empire.
But according to Bhagavat Puran Chandragupta
Maurya was a Yadav King.
Early life
Very little is known about Chandragupta's youth.
Much of what is known about his youth is gathered from later classical
Sanskrit literature ,
as well as classical
Greek
and
Latin
sources which refer to
Chandragupta by the names "Sandracottos" or "Andracottus". He was paragon for
later rulers.
According to traditional accounts,
Chanakya , a
teacher at
Takshasila
University
at the time of
Alexander 's
invasion, found the boy Chandragupta from the
Magadha
kingdom in
eastern
India . As the story goes, Chandragupta was playing as a king with his
friends and was giving justice to another boy playing criminal. He also saw the
kindness inside him to help others. Chanakya saw this and was impressed with
Chandragupta's sense of justice. Chanakya asked his mother about him. His mother
told him that his father used to work as a servant of the Nanda king who ruled
over the kingdom of Maghada and due to some fault he was sent into the prison.
Chanakya told her to take him to the king and ask him to give some education to
Chandragupta. Then she went to his court. There Chandragupta solved a problem
for the king. The king was impressed and told his minister to join him in the
best university at that time, The Vishvavidhyalay of Takshasila[often known as
the Takshasila University]
Plutarch
reports that he met
with
Alexander the Great ,
probably around
Takshasila
in the northwest,
and that he viewed the ruling
Nanda Empire
in a negative
light:
“
"Androcottus, when he was a
stripling , saw Alexander
himself, and we are told that he often said in later times that Alexander
narrowly missed making himself master of the country, since its king was hated
and despised on account of his
baseness
and low
birth."
”
— Plutarch ,
Parallel
Lives : Life of Alexander
62.9
This view is not accepted by most Indian
historians.
According to this tradition, the encounter would
have happened around 326 BCE, suggesting a birth date for Chandragupta around
340 BC.
Junianus Justinus
(Justin) describes the humble origins of Chandragupta, and explains how he later
led a popular uprising against the Nanda king:he was known as king of the
time.
“
"He was of humble origin, but was pushing to
acquiring the throne by the superior power of the mind. When after having
offended the king of Nanda by his insolence, he was condemned to death by the
king, he was saved by the speed of his own feet... He gathered bandits and
invited Indians to a change of rule."
”
— Junianus Justinus ,
Historiarum Philippicarum libri XLIV ,
XV.4.15
Foundation of the Maurya
Empire
Chandragupta Maurya with the help of Chanakya
defeated the Magadha kings and the bulk army of Chandravanshi clan and defeated
generals of Alexander settled in Gandhara (Kamboja kingdom of Aryan Mahajanpad)
which is called as
Afghanistan
now. At the time
of
Alexander 's
invasion,
Chanakya
was a teacher at
Takshasila
University . The king of
Takshasila
and
Gandhara ,
Ambhi
(also known
as Taxiles), made a treaty with Alexander and did not fight against him.
Chanakya saw the foreign invasion against the Indian culture and sought help
from other kings to unite and fight Alexander.
Porus
(Parvateshwar), a king
of
Punjab , was the only local
king who was able to challenge Alexander at the
Battle of the
Hydaspes River , but was defeated.
Chanakya then went to
Magadha
further east to seek the
help of Dhana Nanda, who ruled a vast
Nanda Empire
which
extended from
Bihar
and
Bengal
in the
east to
eastern Punjab
in the
west, but he denied any such help. After this incident, Chanakya began sowing
the seeds of building an empire that could protect Indian territories from
foreign invasion into his disciple Chandragupta.
Chandragupta later adopted Jainism. It is said he
died fasting which was according to Jainism a holy way of sacrificing mortal
life.
Kautilya's role in the formation of the Mauryan
Empire is the essence of a historical/spiritual novel
The
Courtesan and the Sadhu
by Dr. Mysore N. Prakash.
Chanakya
Chandragupta's adviser or
prime
minister Chanakya, who is also known as Kautilya and was the author of the
Arthashastra , is
regarded as the architect of Chandragupta's early rise to power. Chandragupta
Maurya, with the help of Chanakya, began laying the foundation of the Maurya
Empire. In all forms of the Chanakya legend, he is thrown out of the Nanda court
by the king, whereupon he swears revenge. While in Magadha, Chanakya by chance
met Chandragupta in whom he spotted great military and executive abilities.
Chanakya was impressed by the prince's personality and intelligence, and
immediately took the young boy under his wing to fulfill his silent vow.
Depending upon the interpretation of Justin's
accounts, the second version of the above story is that Chandragupta had also
accompanied Chanakya to Pataliputra and himself was insulted by Dhana Nanda
(Nandrum of Justin). If this version of Justin's accounts is accepted, then the
view that Chanakya had purchased Chandragupta from Bihar, on his way back to
Taxila, becomes irrelevant. The shrewd Chanakya had trained Chandragupta under
his expert guidance and together they planned the conquest of the Nanda
Empire.
Nanda army
According to
Plutarch , at the time of
Alexander's
Battle of the
Hydaspes River , the size of the Nanda Empire's army further east numbered
200,000
infantry , 80,000
cavalry , 8,000
chariots , and
6,000
war elephants , which was
discouraging for Alexander's men and stayed their further progress into
India:
“
"As for the Macedonians, however, their struggle
with Porus blunted their courage and stayed their further advance into India.
For having had all they could do to repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty
thousand infantry and two thousand horse, they violently opposed Alexander when
he insisted on crossing the river Ganges also, the width of which, as they
learned, was •thirty-two furlongs, its depth •a hundred fathoms, while its banks
on the further side were covered with multitudes of men-at‑arms and horsemen and
elephants. For they were told that the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were
awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight
thousand chariots, and six thousand fighting elephants. And there was no
boasting in these reports. For Androcottus, who reigned there not long
afterwards, made a present to Seleucus of five hundred elephants, and with an
army of six hundred thousand men overran and subdued all India."
”
— Plutarch ,
Parallel Lives ,
"Life of Alexander"
62.1-4
In order to defeat the powerful Nanda army,
Chandragupta needed to raise a formidable army of his own.
Conquest of Macedonian territories in
India
After Alexander's death in 323 BC, Chandragupta,
turned his attention to Northwestern India (modern
Pakistan ), where he defeated
the
satrapies
(described as "prefects" in classical Western sources) left in place by
Alexander (according to Justin), and may have
assassinated
two of his
governors,
Nicanor
and
Philip .The satrapies he fought
may have included
Eudemus , ruler in
western Punjab until his departure in 317 BC; and
Peithon, son of
Agenor , ruler of the Greek colonies along the
Indus
until his departure
for
Babylon
in
316 BC. The Roman historian
Justin
described how
Sandrocottus ( Greek
version of
Chandragupta's name) conquered the northwest:
“
"Some time after, as he was going to war with the
generals of Alexander, a wild elephant of great bulk presented itself before him
of its own accord, and, as if tamed down to gentleness, took him on its back,
and became his guide in the war, and conspicuous in fields of battle.
Sandrocottus, having thus acquired a throne, was in possession of India, when
Seleucus was laying the foundations of his future greatness; who, after making a
league with him, and settling his affairs in the east, proceeded to join in the
war against Antigonus. As soon as the forces, therefore, of all the confederates
were united, a battle was fought, in which Antigonus was slain, and his son
Demetrius put to flight. "
”
— Junianus Justinus ,
Historiarum Philippicarum libri XLIV ,
XV.4.19
Having consolidated power in the northwest,
Chandragupta pushed east towards the Nanda Empire.
Conquest of the Nanda Empire
Chanakya had trained Chandragupta under his
guidance and together they planned the destruction of Dhana Nanda. The
Mudrarakshasa
of
Visakhadutta as well as the
Jaina
work
Parisishtaparvan
talk of Chandragupta's alliance with the Himalayan
king Parvatka, sometimes identified with
Porus .
It is noted in the
Chandraguptakatha
that the protagonist and Chanakya were initially rebuffed by the Nanda forces.
Regardless, in the ensuing war, Chandragupta faced off against Bhadrasala –
commander of Dhana Nanda's armies. He was eventually able to defeat Bhadrasala
and Dhana Nanda in a series of battles, ending with the siege of the capital
city
Kusumapura
and
the conquest of the Nanda Empire around 321 BC, thus founding the powerful
Maurya Empire in Northern India by the time he was about 20 years old.
Expansion
By the time he was only about 20 years old,
Chandragupta, who had succeeded in defeating the Macedonian satrapies in India
and conquering the Nanda Empire, had founded a vast empire that extended from
the
Bay of Bengal
in the east,
to the
Indus River
in the west,
which he would further expand in later years.
Conquest of Seleucus' eastern
territories
Seleucus I Nicator , a
Macedonian
satrap
of Alexander, reconquered most of Alexander's former empire and put under his
own authority eastern territories as far as
Bactria
and the Indus ( Appian , History of
Rome, The Syrian Wars 55), until in 305 BC he entered in a confrontation with
Chandragupta:
“
"Always lying in wait for the neighboring
nations, strong in arms and persuasive in council, he acquired Mesopotamia,
Armenia, 'Seleucid' Cappadocia, Persis, Parthia, Bactria, Arabia, Tapouria,
Sogdia, Arachosia, Hyrcania, and other adjacent peoples that had been subdued by
Alexander, as far as the river Indus, so that the boundaries of his empire were
the most extensive in Asia after that of Alexander. The whole region from
Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus. He crossed the Indus and waged war
with Sandrocottus [Maurya], king of the Indians, who dwelt on the banks of that
stream, until they came to an understanding with each other and contracted a
marriage relationship. Some of these exploits were performed before the death of
Antigonus and some afterward."
”
— Appian ,
History of Rome ,
The Syrian Wars
The exact details of engagement are not known. As
noted by scholars such as R. C. Majumdarand D. D. Kosambi, Seleucus appears to
have fared poorly, having ceded large territories west of the Indus to
Chandragupta. Due to his defeat, Seleucus surrendered Arachosia, Gedrosia,
Paropamisadae, and Aria.
Mainstream scholarship asserts that Chandragupta
received vast territory west of the Indus, including the
Hindu Kush , modern day
Afghanistan , and the
Balochistan
province of
Pakistan . Archaeologically,
concrete indications of Mauryan rule, such as the inscriptions of the
Edicts of Ashoka , are
known as far as
Kandhahar
in southern
Afghanistan.
“
"After having made a treaty with him
(Sandrakotos) and put in order the Orient situation, Seleucos went to war
against
Antigonus ."
”
— Junianus Justinus ,
Historiarum Philippicarum libri XLIV ,
XV.4.15
It is generally thought that Chandragupta married
Seleucus's
daughter,
or a
Greek
Macedonian
princess , a gift
from Seleucus to formalize an alliance. In a return gesture, Chandragupta sent
500
war - elephants , a
military asset which would play a decisive role at the
Battle of Ipsus
in 302
BC. In addition to this treaty, Seleucus dispatched an ambassador,
Megasthenes , to
Chandragupta, and later
Deimakos
to his son
Bindusara , at
the Mauryan court at
Pataliputra
(modern
Patna
in
Bihar
state ). Later
Ptolemy II
Philadelphus , the ruler of
Ptolemaic Egypt
and
contemporary of
Ashoka the Great , is
also recorded by
Pliny the Elder
as
having sent an ambassador named
Dionysius
to the
Mauryan court.
Classical sources have also recorded that
following their treaty, Chandragupta and Seleucus exchanged presents, such as
when Chandragupta sent various
aphrodisiacs
to
Seleucus:
“
"And Theophrastus says that some contrivances are
of wondrous efficacy in such matters [as to make people more amorous]. And
Phylarchus confirms him, by reference to some of the presents which
Sandrakottus, the king of the Indians, sent to Seleucus; which were to act like
charms in producing a wonderful degree of affection, while some, on the
contrary, were to banish love."
”
— Athenaeus of
Naucratis
Southern conquests
After annexing Seleucus' eastern Persian
provinces, Chandragupta had a vast empire extending across the northern parts of
Indian
Sub-continent , from the
Bay of Bengal
to the
Arabian
Sea . Chandragupta then began expanding his empire further south beyond the
barrier of the
Vindhya Range
and into the
Deccan Plateau . [33]
By the time his conquests were complete, Chandragupta succeeded in unifying most
of Southern Asia. Megasthenes later recorded the size of Chandragupta's acquired
army as 400,000 soldiers, according to
Strabo :
“
"Megasthenes was in the camp of Sandrocottus,
which consisted of 400,000 men"
”
— Strabo ,
Geographica ,
15.1.53
On the other hand,
Pliny , who also drew
from Megasthenes' work, gives even larger numbers of 600,000 infantry, 30,000
cavalry, and 9,000 war elephants:
“
"But the Prasii surpass in power and glory every
other people, not only in this quarter, but one may say in all India, their
capital Palibothra, a very large and wealthy city, after which some call the
people itself the Palibothri,--nay even the whole tract along the Ganges. Their
king has in his pay a standing army of 600,000-foot-soldiers, 30,000 cavalry,
and 9,000 elephants: whence may be formed some conjecture as to the vastness of
his resources."
”

Jainism
Chandragupta gave up his throne towards the end
of his life and became an ascetic under the
Jain saint
Bhadrabahu ,
migrating south with them and ending his days in
sallekhana
at
Shravanabelagola , in
present day
Karnataka ; though
fifth-century inscriptions in the area support the concept of a larger southern
migration around that time. [46]
A small temple marks the cave (Bhadrabahu Cave) where he is said to have died by
fasting.
Successors
Chandragupta Maurya renounced his throne to his
son,
Bindusara , who became the new
Mauryan Emperor.
Bindusara
later became the
father of
Ashoka the Great , who
was one of the most influential kings in history due to his important role in
the
history of
Buddhism .
Nanda Dynasty
The
Nanda Empire
originated from the kingdom of
Magadha
in
Ancient India
during
the 5th and
4th centuries BC . At its
greatest extent, the Nandas extended from
Bengal
in the east,
Punjab
in the west and as
far south as the
Vindhya Range . The Nanda
Empire was later conquered by
Chandragupta Maurya ,
who founded the
Maurya
Empire .
Establishment of the dynasty
Mahapadma Nanda
has been
described as the destroyer of all the
Kshatriyas . He defeated the
Panchalas, Kasis,
Haihayas , Kalingas, Asmakas,
Kurus, Maithilas, Surasenas, Vitihotras, etc .
He expanded his
territory south of
Deccan . Mahapadma Nanda died at
the age of 88 and, therefore, he ruled the bulk of the period of this dynasty,
which lasted 100 years. The Nandas who usurped the throne of the
Shishunaga
dynasty were of low origin. Some sources state that the founder, Mahapadma, was
the son of a Shudra mother, others that he was born of a union of a barber with
a courtesan.
Nanda Rule
The Nandas are sometimes described as the first
empire builders in the recorded
history of India . They
inherited the large kingdom of
Magadha
and wished to extend it
to yet more distant frontiers. To this purpose they built up a vast army
consisting of 200,000
infantry , 20,000
cavalry , 2,000 war
chariots
and
3,000
war elephants
(at the
lowest estimates). According to
Plutarch
however, the size of
the Nanda army was even larger, numbering 200,000 infantry, 80,000 cavalry,
8,000 war chariots, and 6,000 war elephants. However, the Nandas never had the
opportunity to see their army up against
Alexander , who invaded India
at the time of Dhana Nanda, since Alexander had to confine his campaign to the
plains of
Punjab , for his forces,
frightened by the prospect of facing a formidable foe, mutinied at the
Hyphasis
River
(the modern
Beas River ) refusing to march
any further. This river thus marks the eastern-most extent of Alexander's
conquests:
"As for the Macedonians, however, their struggle
with
Porus
blunted their courage
and stayed their further advance into India. For having had all they could do to
repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty thousand infantry and two thousand
horse, they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river
Ganges also, the width of which, as they learned, was thirty-two furlongs, its
depth a hundred fathoms, while its banks on the further side were covered with
multitudes of men-at-arms and horsemen and elephants. For they were told that
the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were awaiting them with eighty thousand
horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight thousand chariots, and six
thousand fighting elephants.".
The Nandas made the methodical collection of
taxes by regularly appointed officials a part of their administrative system.
The treasury was continually replenished, the wealth of the Nandas being
well-known. The Nandas also built canals and carried out
irrigation
projects. The
possibility of an imperial structure based on an essentially agrarian economy
began to germinate in the Indian mind.
The Fall
The last of the Nandas was Dhana Nanda (called
Xandrames or Aggrammes in ancient Greek and Latin sources). Dhana Nanda was
dethroned after he was defeated by Chandragupta Maurya, a young adventurer born
of a Nanda prince and a maid named "Mura". He had a great potential to rule.
Dhana Nanda was murdered which finally signaled the advent of the
Maurya
Empire
in 321 BC.
Plutarch records that
Chandragupta Maurya
had stated that he was able to overthrow Dhana Nanda since he was hated and
despised by his subjects on account of the wickedness of his disposition:

Gupta dynasty
The Gupta Empire under Chandragupta II (ruled
375-415)
The
Gupta dynasty
ruled from
around
240
to
550
AD. The Gupta Empire
was one of the largest political and military
empires
in
ancient
India . The Gupta age is referred
to as the Classical age of India by most historians. The time of the Gupta
Empire was an Indian " Golden Age " in
science ,
mathematics ,
astronomy ,
religion
and
philosophy . They had
their capital at Pataliputra. The difference between Gupta and Mauryan
administration was that the in the Mauryan administration power was centralised
but in the Gupta administration power was more decentralised. The king occupied
a powerful and important position and often took titles to assert his supremacy.
A council of ministers and some officials helped him. The empire was divided
into provinces and provinces were further divided into districts. Villages were
the smallest units. The kingdom covered Gujarat, North-east India, south-eastern
Pakistan, Orissa, northern Madhya Pradesh and eastern India. Art and
architecture flourished during the Gupta age. People were mostly Vaishnavas.
Temples devoted to Shiva and Vishnu were built during this period. Early temples
had a large room where the idol of god was kept. Today these can be found in
Deogarh in Jhansi. Temples were mostly made of brick or stone. The doorways were
very decorative. Wall murals flourished during this age.These can be seen in
Ajanta caves which are about 100 km from Aurangabad. These murals depict the
life of Buddha.Yajnas were performed by Brahmins. All forms of worship were
carried out in Sanskrit. Astronomy made rapid strides. Aryabhatta and
Varahamihira were two great Astronomers and Mathematicians. Varahamihira stated
that the earth moved round the sun and rotated on its own Axis. Metallurgy too
made rapid strides. Proof is the Iron Pillar near Mehrauli on the outskirts of
Delhi. Ayurveda was known to the people of Gupta age. People led happy and
prosperous lives. Most people lived in villages and led a simple life. Rest
houses and hospitals were set up. Laws were simple and punishments were not very
harsh. However there was a serious flaw. The bad, inhuman treatment of the
Chandalas or Untouchables. They were made to live outside the city and even
their shadows were considered capable of polluting. The material sources of this
age were Kalidasa's works i.e. Raghuvamsa, Meghdoot, Malavikagnimitram and
Abhinjnana Shakuntalam, works of Fa-hein, the Chinese buddhist scholar,
Allahabad pillar inscription called Prayag Prashsti, Books by Harisena and
others.
Ashoka
Ashoka
( Devanāgarī :,
IAST :
Aśoka , IPA:  [aˈɕoːkə] ,
304–232 BC), popularly known as
Ashoka the Great , was an
Indian
emperor
of the
Maurya
Dynasty
(Yadavs) who ruled almost all of the
Indian subcontinent
from 269 BC to 232 BC. One of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka reigned over
most of present-day India after a number of military conquests. His empire
stretched from present-day
Pakistan ,
Afghanistan
in the west, to
the present-day
Bangladesh
and the Indian
state of
Assam
in
the east, and as far south as northern
Kerala
and
Andhra . He conquered the kingdom
named
Kalinga , which no one in
his dynasty had conquered starting from
Chandragupta Maurya .
His reign was headquartered in
Magadha
(present-day
Bihar , India). [1]
He embraced
Buddhism
from the prevalent
Vedic
tradition after witnessing the mass deaths of the
war of Kalinga , which he
himself had waged out of a desire for conquest. He was later dedicated to the
propagation of Buddhism across
Asia
and established monuments
marking several significant sites in the life of
Gautama Buddha . Ashoka
was a devotee of
ahimsa
( nonviolence ),
love ,
truth ,
tolerance
and
vegetarianism . Ashoka is
remembered in history as a
philanthropic
administrator. In the
history of India
Ashoka
is referred to as
Samraat
Chakravartin
Ashoka - the Emperor of Emperors
Ashoka .
His name "aśoka" means "without sorrow" in
Sanskrit
.
In the history of the world there have been
thousands of kings and emperors who called themselves 'their highnesses,' 'their
majesties,' and 'their exalted majesties' and so on. They shone for a brief
moment, and as quickly disappeared. But Ashoka shines and shines brightly like a
bright star, even unto this day.
After two thousand years, the influence of Ashoka is seen in
Asia
and especially the
Indian subcontinent .
An emblem excavated from his empire is today the national
Emblem of India . In the
History of Buddhism
Ashoka is considered just after
Gautama
Buddha .
Biography
Early life
Ashoka was born to the
Mauryan
emperor
Bindusara
and
his Queen 'Dharma' (although she was a
Brahmin
or Shubhadrangi, she was
undervalued as she wasn't of royal blood). Ashoka had several elder siblings
(all half-brothers from other wives of Bindusara). He had just one younger
sibling, Vitthashoka (a much loved brother from the same mother). Because of his
exemplary intellect and warrior skills, he was said to have been the favorite of
his grandfather
Chandragupta Maurya .
As the legend goes, when Chandragupta Maurya left his empire for a
Jain
living, he threw his
sword
away. Ashoka
found the sword and kept it, in spite of his grandfather's warning. Ashoka, in
his adolescence, was rude and naughty. He was a fearsome hunter. He was a
kshatriya
and
was given all royal military trainings and other
Vedic
knowledge. According to a
legend, he killed a Lion with just a wooden rod. Ashoka was very well known for
his sword fighting. He was very adventurous and this made him a terrific
fighter. Ashoka was a frightening warrior and a heartless general. Because of
this quality he was sent to destroy the riot of
Avanti .
Rise to Power
Maurya Empire
at the age
of Ashoka. The empire stretched from
Iran
to
Bangladesh / Assam
and from
Central
Asia
( Afganistan ) to
Tamil
Nadu / South India .
Developing into an impeccable warrior general and
a shrewd statesman, Ashoka went on to command several regiments of the Mauryan
army. His growing popularity across the empire made his elder brothers wary of
his chances of being favored by
Bindusara
to become the next
emperor. The eldest of them,
Susima , the traditional heir to
the throne, persuaded Bindusara to send Ashoka to quell an uprising in
Taxshila , a city
in the north-west District of Pakistani Punjab region, for which Prince Susima
was the Governor. Taxshila was a highly volatile place because of the war-like
Indo-Greek population and mismanagement by Susima himself. This had led to the
formation of different militias causing unrest. Ashoka complied and left for the
troubled area. As news of Ashoka's visit with his army trickled in, he was
welcomed by the revolting militias and the uprising ended without a conflict.
(The province revolted once more during the rule of Ashoka, but this time the
uprising was crushed with an iron fist)
Ashoka's success made his stepbrothers more wary
of his intentions of becoming the emperor and more incitements from Susima led
Bindusara to send Ashoka into exile. He went into
Kalinga
and stayed there
incognito. There he met a fisher woman named
Kaurwaki , with whom he fell in
love. Recently found inscriptions indicate that she would later become either
his second or third queen.
Meanwhile, there was again a violent uprising in
Ujjain . Emperor
Bindusara summoned Ashoka out of exile after two years. Ashoka went into Ujjain
and in the ensuing battle was injured, but his generals quelled the uprising.
Ashoka was treated in hiding so that loyalists of the Susima group could not
harm him. He was treated by
Buddhist
monks and nuns. This
is where he first learned the teachings of the
Buddha , and it is also where he
met Devi, who was his personal nurse and the daughter of a merchant from
adjacent Vidisha. After recovering, he married her. It was quite unacceptable to
Bindusara that one of his sons should marry a Buddhist, so he did not allow
Ashoka to stay in
Pataliputra
but instead sent
him back to Ujjain and made him the governor of Ujjain.
The following year passed quite peacefully for
him, and Devi was about to deliver his first child. In the meanwhile, Emperor
Bindusara died. As the news of the unborn heir to the throne spread, Prince
Susima planned the execution of the unborn child; however, the assassin who came
to kill Devi and her child killed his mother instead. Ashoka beheads his elder
brother to ascend the throne. In this phase of his life, Ashoka was known for
his unquenched thirst for wars and campaigns launched to conquer the lands of
other rulers and became known as Chandashok (terrible Ashoka), the Sanskrit word
chanda
meaning cruel, fierce, or rude,
Chandi -devi being associated with
Kali .
Ascending the throne, Ashoka expanded his empire
over the next eight years, from the present-day boundaries and regions of
Burma – Bangladesh
and the state of
Assam
in India in the east to the
territory of present-day
Iran
/
Persia
and
Afghanistan
in the west;
from the
Pamir
Knots in the north almost to the peninsular of
southern India
(i.e.
Tamilnadu
/
Andhra
pradesh ).
Conquest of Kalinga
While the early part of Ashoka's reign was
apparently quite bloodthirsty, he became a follower of the
Buddha 's teaching after his
conquest of Kalinga on the east coast of India in the present-day state of
Orissa . Kalinga was
a state that prided itself on its sovereignty and democracy. With its
monarchical parliamentary democracy it was quite an exception in ancient Bharata
where there existed the concept of
Rajdharma .
Rajdharma means the duty of the rulers, which was intrinsically entwined with
the concept of bravery and
Kshatriya
dharma.
The pretext for the start of the
Kalinga
War
(265 BC or 263 BC) is uncertain. One of Susima's brothers might have
fled to Kalinga and found official refuge there. This enraged Ashoka immensely.
He was advised by his ministers to attack Kalinga for this act of treachery.
Ashoka then asked Kalinga's royalty to submit before his supremacy. When they
defied this diktat, Ashoka sent one of his generals to Kalinga to make them
submit.
The general and his forces were, however,
completely routed through the skilled tact of Kalinga's commander-in-chief.
Ashoka, baffled at this defeat, attacked with the greatest invasion ever
recorded in Indian history until then. Kalinga put up a stiff resistance, but
they were no match for Ashoka's brutal strength. The whole of Kalinga was
plundered and destroyed. Ashoka's later edicts state that about 100,000 people
were killed on the Kalinga side and 10,000o from Ashoka's army. Thousands of men
and women were deported.

Ashoka
Chakra
atop the four lions thought to be missing in the Lion Capital of
Ashoka at
Sarnath Museum
which has
been adopted as the
National Emblem of
India .
As the legend goes, one day after the war was
over, Ashoka ventured out to roam the city and all he could see were burnt
houses and scattered corpses. This sight made him sick and he cried the famous
monologue:
What have I done? If this is a victory,
what's a defeat then? Is this a victory or a defeat? Is this justice or
injustice? Is it gallantry or a rout? Is it valor to kill innocent children and
women? Do I do it to widen the empire and for prosperity or to destroy the
other's kingdom and splendor? One has lost her husband, someone else a father,
someone a child, someone an unborn infant.... What's this debris of the corpses?
Are these marks of victory or defeat? Are these vultures, crows, eagles the
messengers of death or evil?
The brutality of the conquest led him to adopt
Buddhism and he used his position to propagate the relatively new religion to
new heights, as far as ancient Rome and Egypt. He made Buddhism his state
religion around 260 BC, and propagated it and preached it within his domain and
worldwide from about 250 BC. Emperor Ashoka undoubtedly has to be credited with
the first serious attempt to develop a Buddhistic policy.
Prominent in this cause were his son Venerable
Mahindra
and
daughter
Sanghamitra
(whose name
means "friend of the Sangha"), who established Budhism in Ceylon (now
Sri Lanka ).
He built thousands of Stupas and Viharas for Buddhist followers. The Stupas of
Sanchi are world famous and the stupa named
Sanchi Stupa
was built by
Emperor Ashoka. During the remaining portion of Ashoka's reign, he pursued an
official policy of
nonviolence
( ahimsa ). Even the unnecessary
slaughter or mutilation of people was immediately abolished. Everyone became
protected by the king's
law
against sport hunting and
branding. Limited hunting was permitted for consumption reasons but Ashoka also
promoted the concept of vegetarianism. Ashoka also showed mercy to those
imprisoned, allowing them leave for the outside a day of the year. He attempted
to raise the professional ambition of the common man by building universities
for study, and water transit and irrigation systems for trade and agriculture.
He treated his subjects as equals regardless of their religion, politics and
caste. The kingdoms surrounding his, so easily overthrown, were instead made to
be well-respected allies.
He is acclaimed for constructing hospitals for
animals and renovating major roads throughout India. After this transformation,
Ashoka came to be known as Dhammashoka (Sanskrit), meaning Ashoka, the follower
of Dharma. Ashoka defined the main principles of dharma (dhamma) as nonviolence,
tolerance of all sects and opinions, obedience to parents, respect for the
Brahmans and other religious teachers and priests, liberality towards friends,
humane treatment of servants, and generosity towards all. These principles
suggest a general ethic of behaviour to which no religious or social group could
object.
Some critics say that Ashoka was afraid of more
wars, but among his neighbors, including the
Seleucid Empire
and the
Greco-Bactrian kingdom established by
Diodotus I , none could match
his strength. He was a contemporary of both
Antiochus I Soter
and
his successor
Antiochus II Theos
of
the Seleucid dynasty as well as
Diodotus I
and his son
Diodotus
II
of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. If his inscriptions and edicts are well
studied one finds that he was familiar with the Hellenic world but never in awe
of it. His edicts, which talk of friendly relations, give the names of both
Antiochus of the Seleucid empire and
Ptolemy III
of
Egypt . The fame of the
Mauryan
empire
was widespread from the time that Ashoka's grandfather
Chandragupta Maurya
defeated
Seleucus Nicator , the
founder of the Seleucid Dynasty.
The source of much of our knowledge of Ashoka is
the many inscriptions he had carved on pillars and rocks throughout the empire.
Emperor Ashoka is known as Piyadasi (in
Pali ) or Priyadarshi (in
Sanskrit )
meaning "good looking" or "favored by the gods with good blessing". All his
inscriptions have the imperial touch and show compassionate loving. He addressed
his people as his "children". These inscriptions promoted Buddhist morality and
encouraged nonviolence and adherence to Dharma (duty or proper behavior), and
they talk of his fame and conquered lands as well as the neighboring kingdoms
holding up his might. One also gets some primary information about the Kalinga
War and Ashoka's allies plus some useful knowledge on the civil administration.
The Ashoka Pillar at
Sarnath
is the most popular of
the relics left by Ashoka. Made of sandstone, this pillar records the visit of
the emperor to Sarnath, in the 3rd century BC. It has a four-lion capital (four
lions standing back to back) which was adopted as the emblem of the modern
Indian republic. The lion symbolizes both Ashoka's imperial rule and the
kingship of the
Buddha . In translating these
monuments, historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact
of the Mauryan Empire. It is difficult to determine whether or not some actual
events ever happened, but the stone etchings clearly depict how Ashoka wanted to
be thought of and remembered.
Ashoka's own words as known from his
Edicts
are: "All men
are my children. I am like a father to them. As every father desires the good
and the happiness of his children, I wish that all men should be happy always."
Edward D'Cruz interprets the Ashokan dharma as a "religion to be used as a
symbol of a new imperial unity and a cementing force to weld the diverse and
heterogeneous elements of the empire".
Also, in the Edicts, Ashoka mentions Hellenistic
kings of the period as converts to Buddhism, although no Hellenic historical
record of this event remain:
The conquest by
Dharma
has been won here, on the
borders, and even six hundred
yojanas
(5,400–9,600 km) away,
where the Greek king
Antiochos
rules,
beyond there where the four kings named
Ptolemy ,
Antigonos ,
Magas
and
Alexander
rule,
likewise in the south among the
Cholas , the
Pandyas , and as far
as
Tamraparni
( Sri
Lanka ).
— Edicts of Ashoka ,
Rock Edict
13
(S. Dhammika)
Ashoka also claims that he encouraged the
development of
herbal medicine , for
human and nonhuman animals, in their territories:
Everywhere within Beloved-of-the-Gods, King
Piyadasi's [Ashoka's] domain, and among the people beyond the borders, the
Cholas , the
Pandyas , the
Satiyaputras, the Keralaputras, as far as
Tamraparni
and where the
Greek king
Antiochos
rules, and
among the kings who are neighbors of Antiochos, everywhere has
Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, made provision for two types of medical
treatment: medical treatment for humans and medical treatment for animals.
Wherever medical herbs suitable for humans or animals are not available, I have
had them imported and grown. Wherever medical roots or fruits are not available
I have had them imported and grown. Along roads I have had wells dug and trees
planted for the benefit of humans and animals.
— Edicts of Ashoka ,

The Greeks in India even seem to have played an
active role in the propagation of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka,
such as
Dharmaraksita , are
described in
Pali
sources as leading Greek ( Yona ) Buddhist monks, active in
spreading Buddhism (the
Mahavamsa , XII).
Death and legacy
Ashoka ruled for an estimated forty years. After
his death, the Mauryan dynasty lasted just fifty more years. Ashoka had many
wives and children, but many of their names are lost to time.
Mahindra
and
Sanghamitra
were twins born
by his first wife, Devi, in the city of
Ujjain . He had entrusted to them
the job of making his state religion, Buddhism, more popular across the known
and the unknown world.
Mahindra
and
Sanghamitra
went into
Sri Lanka
and converted the King, the Queen and their people to Buddhism. They were
naturally not handling state affairs after him.
In his old age, he seems to have come under the
spell of his youngest wife
Tishyaraksha . It is said
that she had got his son
Kunala , the regent in
Takshashila , blinded
by a wily
stratagem . The official
executioners spared Kunala and he became a wandering singer accompanied by his
favourite wife
Kanchanmala .
In
Pataliputra , Ashoka hears
Kunala's song, and realizes that Kunala's misfortune may have been a punishment
for some past sin of the emperor himself and condemns Tishyaraksha to death,
restoring Kunala to the court. Kunala was succeeded by his son,
Samprati , but
his rule did not last long after Ashoka's death.
The reign of Ashoka Maurya could easily have
disappeared into history as the ages passed by, and would have had he not left
behind a record of his trials. The testimony of this wise king was discovered in
the form of magnificently sculpted pillars and boulders with a variety of
actions and teachings he wished to be published etched into the stone. What
Ashoka left behind was the first written language in India since the ancient
city of
Harappa . The language used for
inscription was the then current spoken form called
Prakrit .
In the year 185 BC, about fifty years after
Ashoka's death, the last Maurya ruler,
Brhadrata , was assassinated by
the commander-in-chief of the Mauryan armed forces,
Pusyamitra Sunga , while
he was taking the Guard of Honor of his forces. Pusyamitra Sunga founded the
Sunga
dynasty
(185 BC-78 BC) and ruled just a fragmented part of the Mauryan
Empire. Many of the northwestern territories of the Mauryan Empire (modern-day
Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan) became the
Indo-Greek
Kingdom .
When India gained independence from the
British Empire
it adopted
Ashoka's emblem for its own, placing the
Dharmachakra
(The Wheel of
Righteous Duty) that crowned his many columns on the
flag
of the newly
independent state. In 1992, Ashoka was ranked #53 on
Michael H. Hart 's
list of the most
influential figures in history . In 2001, a semi-fictionalized portrayal of
Ashoka's life was produced as a motion picture under the title
Asoka . King
Ashoka, the third monarch of the Indian Mauryan dynasty, has come to be regarded
as one of the most exemplary rulers in world history. The British historian H.G.
Wells has written: "Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd
the columns of history ... the name of Asoka shines, and shines almost alone, a
star."
Buddhist Kingship
One of the more enduring legacies of Ashoka
Maurya was the model that he provided for the relationship between Buddhism and
the state. Throughout Theravada Southeastern Asia, the model of ruler ship
embodied by Ashoka replaced the notion of divine kingship that had previously
dominated (in the
Angkor
kingdom, for instance).
Under this model of 'Buddhist kingship', the king sought to legitimize his rule
not through descent from a divine source, but by supporting and earning the
approval of the Buddhist
sangha . Following
Ashoka's example, kings established monasteries, funded the construction of
stupas, and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom. Many rulers also
took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the
sangha, as Ashoka had in calling a conclave to settle a number of contentious
issues during his reign. This development ultimately lead to a close association
in many Southeast Asian countries between the monarchy and the religious
hierarchy, an association that can still be seen today in the state-supported
Buddhism of
Thailand
and the traditional role of the Thai king as both a religious and
secular leader. Ashoka also said that all his courtiers were true to their self
and governed the people in a moral manner.
Historical sources
Western sources
– Ashoka was
almost forgotten by the historians of the early British India but
James
Prinsep
contributed in the revelation of historical sources. Other important
historian was
British
archaeologist
Sir
John Hubert
Marshall
who was director-General of the
Archaeological
Survey of India . His main interests were
Sanchi
and
Sarnath
besides
Harappa
and
Mohenjodaro . Sir
Alexander
Cunningham , a British archaeologist and army engineer and often known as the
father of the
Archaeological
Survey of India , unveiled heritage sites like the
Bharhut
Stupa, Sarnath, Sanchi,
and the Mahabodhi Temple; thus, his contribution is recognizable in realms of
historical sources. Sir
Mortimer Wheeler
who
was a
British
archaeologist
also exposed Ashokan historical sources, especially the
Taxila .
Eastern sources
- Information
about the life and reign of Ashoka primarily comes from a relatively small
number of Buddhist sources. In particular, the
Sanskrit
Ashokavadana
('Story of Ashoka'), written in the 2nd century, and the two
Pāli
chronicles of
Sri Lanka
(the
Dipavamsa
and
Mahavamsa )
provide most of the currently known information about Ashoka. Additional
information is contributed by the
Edicts of Asoka , whose
authorship was finally attributed to the Ashoka of Buddhist legend after the
discovery of dynastic lists that gave the name used in the edicts
( Priyadarsi  – 'favored by the Gods') as a title or additional name of
Ashoka Mauriya. Architectural remains of his period have been found at
Kumhrar ,
Patna , which include
an 80-pillar
hypostyle
hall.
Edicts of Ashoka
-The
Edicts of Ashoka are a collection of 33 inscriptions on the
Pillars of Ashoka , as
well as boulders and cave walls, made by the Emperor Ashoka of the Mauryan
dynasty during his reign from 272 to 231 BC. These inscriptions are dispersed
throughout the areas of modern-day Pakistan and India, and represent the first
tangible evidence of Buddhism. The edicts describe in detail the first wide
expansion of Buddhism through the sponsorship of one of the most powerful kings
of Indian history.It give more information about Ashoka's proselytism, Moral
precepts, Religious precepts, Social and animal welfare .
Ashokavadana
- The
Ashokavadana is a 2nd century CE text related to the legend of the Maurya
Emperor Ashoka. The legend was translated into Chinese by
Fa Hien
in 300 CE.
Mahavamsa
-The Mahavamsa
("Great Chronicle") is a historical poem written in the
Pali
language, of the kings of
Sri Lanka .
It covers the period from the coming of King Vijaya of
Kalinga
(ancient Orissa) in 543
BC to the reign of King Mahasena (334–361).As it often refers to the royal
dynasties of India, the Mahavamsa is also valuable for historians who wish to
date and relate contemporary royal dynasties in the
Indian subcontinent .
It is very important in dating the consecration of the Maurya emperor
Ashoka.
Dipavamsa
-The Dipavamsa, or
"Deepavamsa", (i.e., Chronicle of the Island, in Pali) is the oldest historical
record of Sri Lanka. The chronicle is believe to be compiled from
Atthakatha
and other sources around the 3–4th century, King Dhatusena (4th century CE) had
orderd that the Dipavamsa be recited at the
Mahinda
(son to Ashoka )festival
held annually in Anuradhapura.
The use of Buddhist sources in reconstructing the
life of Ashoka has had a strong influence on perceptions of Ashoka, as well as
the interpretations of his edicts. Building on traditional accounts, early
scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a
conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the
Buddhist monastic institution. Some scholars have tended to question this
assessment. The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources
are the Ashokan edicts, and these do not explicitly state that Ashoka was a
Buddhist. In his edicts, Ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of
his time: Buddhism, Brahmanism, Jainism, and Ajivikaism, and his edicts
addressed to the population at large (there are some addressed specifically to
Buddhists; this is not the case for the other religions) generally focus on
moral themes members of all the religions would accept.
However, there is strong evidence in the edicts
alone that he was a Buddhist. In one edict he belittles rituals, and he banned
Vedic animal sacrifices; these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to
the Vedic tradition for guidance. Furthermore, there are many edicts expressed
to Buddhists alone; in one, Ashoka declares himself to be an " upasaka ", and in another he
demonstrates a close familiarity with Buddhist texts. He erected rock pillars at
Buddhist holy sites, but did not so for the sites of other religions. He also
used the word "dhamma" to refer to qualities of the heart that underlie moral
action; this was an exclusively Buddhist use of the word. Finally, the ideals he
promotes correspond to the first three steps of the Buddha's graduated
discourse. [3]

Contributions
Global Spread of Buddhism
Ashoka, now a
Buddhist
emperor, believed that
Buddhism
is
beneficial for all human beings as well as animals and plants, so he built
84,000
stupas ,
Sangharama ,
viharas ,
Chaitya , and
residences for Buddhist monks all over
South Asia
and Central Asia.
He gave donations to viharas and
mathas . He sent his only daughter
Sanghamitta
and son
Mahindra
to spread
Buddhism in
Sri Lanka
(ancient name
Tamraparni). Ashoka also sent many prominent Buddhist monks (bhikshus) Sthaviras
like Madhyamik Sthavira to modern
Kashmir
and
Afganistan ; Maharaskshit
sthavira to
Syria ,
Persia
/
Iran ,
Egypt ,
Greece ,
Italy
and
Turkey ; Massim Sthavira to
Nepal ,
Bhutan ,
China
and
Mongolia ; Sohn Uttar Sthavira
to modern
Cambodia ,
Laos ,
Myanmar
(old name Suvarnabhumi
for Burma and Thailand),
Thailand
and
Vietnam ; Mahadhhamarakhhita
stahvira to
Maharashtra
(old name
Maharatthha); Maharakhhit Sthavira and Yavandhammarakhhita Sthavira to
South
India . Ashoka also invited Buddhists and non-Buddhists for religious
conferences. Ashoka inspired the Buddhist monks to compose the sacred religious
texts, and also gave all types of help to that end. Ashoka also helped to
develop viharas (intellectual hubs) such as
Nalanda
and
Taxila . Ashoka helped to
construct
Sanchi
and
Mahabodhi Temple .
Ashoka never tried to harm or to destroy non-Buddhist religions, and indeed gave
donations to non-Buddhists. As his reign continued his even-handedness was
replaced with special inclination towards Buddhism. [4]
Ashoka helped and respected both Sramans (Buddhists monks) and Brahmins (Vedic
monks). Ashoka also helped to organize the
Third Buddhist
council
(c. 250 BC) at Pataliputra (today's
Patna ). It was conducted by the
monk
Moggaliputta-Tissa
who was the spiritual teacher of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka.
As an Administrator
Ashoka's military power was so strong that he was
able to crush those empires that went to war against him still, he was on
friendly terms with kingdoms in the South like
Cholas ,
Pandya , Keralputra, the post
Alexandrian empire,
Tamraparni , and
Suvarnabhumi
who were
strong enough to remain outside his empire and continued to profess Hinduism.
According to his edicts we know that he provided humanitarian help including
doctors ,
hospitals ,
inns ,
wells ,
medical herbs and
engineers
to his neighboring
countries. In his neighboring countries Ashoka helped humans as well as animals.
Ashoka also planted trees in his empire and his neighboring countries. Ashoka
was perhaps the first emperor in human history to ban
slavery ,
hunting ,
fishing
and
deforestation . Ashoka also
banned the death sentence and asked the same for the neighboring countries.
Ashoka commanded his people to serve the orders of their elders parents) and
religious monks ( shramana
and
Brahmin ). Ashoka also
recommended his people study all religions and respect all religions. According
to Ashoka, to harm another's religion is a harm to someone's owns religion.
Ashoka asserted his people to live with Dharmmacharana. Ashoka asked people to
live with harmony, peace, love and tolerance. Ashoka called his people as his
children, and they could call him when they need him. He also asked people to
save money and not to spend for immoral causes. Ashoka also believed in
dharmacharana (dhammacharana) and dharmavijaya (dhammavijaya). According to many
European and Asian historians the age of Ashoka was the age of light and
delightment. He was the first emperor in human history who has taught the lesson
of unity, peace, equality and love. Ashoka's aim was not to expand the
territories but the welfare of all of his subjects (sarvajansukhay). In his vast
empire there was no evidence of recognizable mutiny or civil war. Ashoka was the
true devotee of nonviolence, peace and love. This made him different from other
emperors. Ashoka also helped
Buddhism
as well as religions
like
Jainism ,
Hinduism ,
Hellenic polytheism
and
Ajivikas .
Ashoka was against any discrimination among humans. He helped students, the
poor, orphans and the elderly with social, political and economic help.
According to Ashoka, hatred gives birth to hatred and a feeling of love gives
birth to love and mercy. According to him the happiness of people is the
happiness of the ruler. His opinion was that the sword is not as powerful as
love. Ashoka was also Kind to prisoners, and respected animal life and tree
life. Ashoka allowed females to be educated. He also permitted females to enter
religious institutions. He allowed female Buddhist monastic such as
Bhikkhuni . He
combined in himself the complexity a king and a simplicity of a buddhist monk.
Because of these reasons he is known as the emperor of all ages and thus became
a milestone in the
History of the
world .
Ashoka Chakra
The
Ashoka Chakra
(the wheel
of Ashoka) is a depiction of the Dharmachakra or Dhammachakka in
Pali , the Wheel of Dharma ( Sanskrit : Chakra
means wheel). The wheel has 24 spokes. The Ashoka Chakra has been widely
inscribed on many relics of the
Mauryan
Emperor, most prominent
among which is the Lion Capital of
Sarnath
and The
Ashoka
Pillar . The most visible use of the Ashoka Chakra today is at the centre of
the National flag of the Republic of India (adopted on 22 July 1947), where it
is rendered in a Navy-blue color on a White background, by replacing the symbol
of Charkha (Spinning wheel) of the pre-independence versions of the flag. Ashoka
Chakra can also been seen on the base of Lion Capital of Ashoka which has been
adopted as the National Emblem of India.
The Ashoka chakra was built by Ashoka during his
reign.
Chakra
is
a
Sanskrit
word which also means cycle or self repeating process. The process it signifies
is the cycle of time as how the world changes with time. The horse means
accuracy and speed while the bull means hardwork.
A few days before India became independent on
August 1947, the specially constituted
Constituent
Assembly
decided that the flag of India must be acceptable to all parties
and communities. [6]
A flag with three colours, Saffron, White and Green with the
Ashoka
Chakra
was selected.
Sarvepalli
Radhakrishnan , who later became India's first
Vice President ,
clarified the adopted flag and described its significance as follows:
Bhagwa
or the saffron color denotes
renunciation or disinterestedness. Our leaders must be indifferent to material
gains and dedicate themselves to their work. The white in the center is light,
the path of truth to guide our conduct. The green shows our relation to (the)
soil, our relation to the plant life here, on which all other life depends. The
" Ashoka Chakra " in the
center of the white is the wheel of the law of
dharma . Truth or
satya ,
dharma
or
virtue ought to be the controlling principle of those who work under this flag.
Again, the wheel denotes motion. There is death in stagnation. There is life in
movement. India should no more resist change, it must move and go forward. The
wheel represents the dynamism of a peaceful change. It also represents 24 hours
in a day.
A widely held unofficial interpretation is that
the saffron stands for purity and spirituality, white for peace and truth, green
for fertility and prosperity and the wheel for justice/righteousness.
The twenty four
spokes
in this chakra
wheel
represent twenty
four virtues:
Love
Courage
Patience
Peacefulness
Kindness
Goodness
Faithfulness
Gentleness
Self-control
Selflessness
Self sacrifice
Truthfulness
Righteousness
Justice
Mercy
Graciousness
Humility
Empathy
Sympathy
Supreme knowledge
Supreme wisdom
Supreme moral
Love for all beings
Hope , trust, or
faith in the goodness of
God
or
nature .
Pillars of Ashoka
(Ashokstambha)
The pillars of Ashoka are a series of columns
dispersed throughout the northern Indian subcontinent, and erected by Ashoka
during his reign in the 3rd century BC. Originally, there must have been many
pillars of Ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive. Averaging
between forty and fifty feet in height, and weighing up to fifty tons each, all
the pillars were quarried at Chunar, just south of Varanasi and dragged,
sometimes hundreds of miles, to where they were erected. The first Pillar of
Ashoka was found in the 16th century by Thomas Coryat in the ruins of ancient
Delhi. The wheel represents the sun time and Buddhist law, while the
swastika
stands
for the cosmic dance around a fixed center and guards against evil. There is no
evidence of a swastika, or manji, on the pillars.
Lion Capital of Asoka
(Ashokmudra)
The Lion capital of Ashoka is a sculpture of four
"Indian
lions "
standing back to back. It was originally placed atop the Aśoka pillar at
Sarnath , now in
the state of
Uttar Pradesh ,
India . The pillar,
sometimes called the Aśoka Column is still in its original location, but the
Lion Capital is now in the
Sarnath Museum . This Lion
Capital of Ashoka from Sarnath has been adopted as the National Emblem of India
and the wheel " Ashoka Chakra " from its
base was placed onto the center of the
National Flag of
India .
The capital contains four lions (Indian / Asiatic
Lions), standing back to back, mounted on an abacus, with a frieze carrying
sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull, and a lion,
separated by intervening spoked chariot-wheels over a bell-shaped lotus. Carved
out of a single block of polished sandstone, the capital was believed to be
crowned by a 'Wheel of Dharma' (Dharmachakra popularly known in India as the
"Ashoka Chakra").
The Ashoka Lion capital or the Sarnath lion
capital is also known as the national symbol of India. The Sarnath pillar bears
one of the Edicts of Ashoka, an inscription against division within the Buddhist
community, which reads, "No one shall cause division in the order of monks". The
Sarnath pillar is a column surmounted by a capital, which consists of a canopy
representing an inverted bell-shaped lotus flower, a short cylindrical abacus
with four 24-spoked Dharma wheels with four animals (an
elephant , a
bull , a
horse , a
lion ).
The four animals in the Sarnath capital are
believed to symbolize different steps of Lord
Buddha 's life.
The Elephant represents the Buddha's idea in reference to the dream of Queen
Maya of a white elephant entering her womb.
The Bull represents desire during the life of the Buddha as a prince.
The Horse represents Buddha's departure from palatial life.
The Lion represents the accomplishment of Buddha.
Besides the religious interpretations, there are
some non-religious interpretations also about the symbolism of the Ashoka
capital pillar at Sarnath. According to them, the four lions symbolize Ashoka's
rule over the four directions, the wheels as symbols of his enlightened rule
(Chakravartin) and the four animals as symbols of four adjoining territories of
India .

All men are my children. What I desire for my own children, and I desire
their welfare and happiness both in this world and the next, which I desire for
all men. You do not understand to what extent I desire this, and if some of you
do understand, you do not understand the full extent of my desire.
Here (in my domain) no living beings are to be slaughtered or offered in
sacrifice.
Respect for mother and father is good, generosity to friends, acquaintances,
relatives, Brahmans and ascetics is good, not killing living beings is good,
moderation in spending and moderation in saving is good.
To do good is difficult. One who does good first does something hard to do.
I have done many good deeds, and, if my sons, grandsons and their descendants up
to the end of the world act in like manner, they too will do much good. But
whoever amongst them neglects this, they will do evil.
Truly, it is easy to do evil.
All religions should reside everywhere, for all of them desire self-control
and purity of heart.
King Piyadasi does not consider glory and fame to be of great account unless
they are achieved through having my subjects respect Dhamma and practice Dhamma,
both now and in the future.
Whoever praises his own religion, due to excessive devotion, and condemns
others with the thought "Let me glorify my own religion," only harms his own
religion. Therefore contact (between religions) is good. One should listen to
and respect the doctrines professed by others.
There is no gift like the gift of the Dhamma, (no acquaintance like)
acquaintance with Dhamma, (no distribution like) distribution of Dhamma, and (no
kinship like) kinship through Dhamma. And it consists of this: proper behavior
towards servants and employees, respect for mother and father, generosity to
friends, companions, relations, Brahmans and ascetics, and not killing living
beings.
King Piyadasi, honors both ascetics and the householders of all religions,
and he honors them with gifts and honors of various kinds.But
Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, does not value gifts and honors as much as
he values this—that there should be growth in the essentials of all
religions.
Along roads I have had banyan trees planted so that they can give shade to
animals and men, and I have had mango groves planted. At intervals of eight
//krosas//, I have had wells dug, rest-houses built, and in various places, I
have had watering-places made for the use of animals and men. But these are but
minor achievements. Such things to make the people happy have been done by
former kings. I have done these things for this purpose, that the people might
practice the Dhamma.
It is my desire that there should be uniformity in law and uniformity in
sentencing. I even go this far, to grant a three-day stay for those in prison
who have been tried and sentenced to death. During this time their relatives can
make appeals to have the prisoners' lives spared. If there is none to appeal on
their behalf, the prisoners can give gifts in order to make merit for the next
world, or observe fasts. [7]
About Ashoka
"Among the emperors and historical personalities, Samrath / Emperor Ashoka
is the surely only being who had decided not to battle with enemy when he won
the battle." –
Jawaharlal Nehru
in
The Discovery of
India
(page no. 86).
"There is the only one period in Indian history which is a period of
freedom, greatness and glory. That is the period of the Mauryan empire (Ashoka's
empire)." –
B. R. Ambedkar
in
Annihilation of Caste (page no. 70–71).
"Ashoka is perhaps the only emperor who hated wars because of the blood shed
and cruelty. He wanted to win the souls of people with love not the bodies with
sword and terror." –
V.
G. Gokhale .
"In some cases Ashoka may be compared with
Alexander the Great ,
Augustus Caesar ,
Genghis
Khan ,
Timur ,
Peter I of Russia ,
Napoleon
I . But Ashoka was not extra ambitious like Alexander. Ashoka was an ideal
administrator like Augustus Caesar, but unlike Caesar, he didn't want to be
known as a dictator. Ashoka was a strong general but unlike Napoleon I Ashoka
never was unsatisfied. Ashoka wanted to be loved by his subjects. He never
terrorized his subjects like Genghis Khan, Timur and Peter I of Russia. Nobility
of soul, purity of mind, honesty of nature, clarity of dignity and love for all
let Ashoka sit with
Gautama Buddha
and
Jesus
Christ ." –

"Nowadays wars, conflicts and blood shed have become very familiar, but
about two thousand years ago Ashoka comprehended the evils of war and conflicts.
Ashoka turned his all power to establish harmony and peace, in this way he has
put a fine example to be followed before all mankind. In this way he has shown
that in peacetime man would be a progressed being." – Dr.
Binda
Paranjape
in Ashokache Shilalekha (page no.29).
"A hundred years after my death there will be an emperor named Ashoka in
Pataliputra. He will rule one of the four continents and adorn Jambudvipa (old
name to India) with my relics, building eighty four thousand stupas for the
welfare of people. He will have them honored by gods and men. His fame will be
widespread. His meritorious gift was just this: Jaya threw a handful of dust
into the Tathaagata's bowl." Prediction of
Buddha
for Ashoka according to
the
Ashokavadana .
"He (Ashoka) insisted on the recognition of the sanctity of all human life".
Dr.
Munshi .
"Asoka, one of the great monarchs of history, whose dominions extended from
Afghanistan to Madras... is the only military monarch on record who abandoned
warfare after victory. He had invaded Kalinga (255 B.C.), a country along the
east coast of Madras, perhaps with some intention of completing the conquest of
the tip of the Indian peninsula. The expedition was successful, but he was
disgusted by what be saw of the cruelties and horrors of war. He declared, in
certain inscriptions that still exist, that he would no longer seek conquest by
war, but by religion, and the rest of his life was devoted to the spreading of
Buddhism throughout the world. He seems to have ruled his vast empire in peace
and with great ability. He was no mere religious fanatic. For eight and twenty
years Asoka worked sanely for the real needs of men. Amidst the tens of
thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their
majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like,
the name of Asoka shines, and shines, almost alone, a star. From the Volga to
Japan his name is still honored. China, Tibet, and even India, though it has
left his doctrine, preserve the tradition of his greatness. More living men
cherish his memory today than have ever heard the names of
Constantine
or
Charlemagne ." –

"A large number of international scholars agree that Emperor Aśoka of India
in the 3rd century B.C. was one of the greatest conquerors who later achieved
the most difficult conquest of all — the conquest of himself — through
self-conviction and his perception of human suffering. After embracing the
Dhamma of the Buddha as his guide and refuge, he transformed the goal of his
regime from military conquest to conquest by
Dhamma . By providing royal
patronage for the propagation of Buddhism both within and outside his vast
dominion, he helped promote the metamorphosis of Buddhism from one among many
sects of Indian ascetic spirituality into a world religion that was eventually
to penetrate almost all of southern and eastern Asia." –
Anuradha
Seneviratna
in King Asoka and Buddhism Historical & Literary Studies
(editors preface ) (page. no. xi).
"We have no way of knowing how effective Asoka’s reforms were or how long
they lasted but we do know that monarchs throughout the ancient Buddhist world
were encouraged to look to his style of government as an ideal to be followed.
King Asoka has to be credited with first attempt to develop a Buddhist polity.
Today, with widespread disillusionment in prevailing ideologies and the search
for a political philosophy that goes beyond greed, hatred, and delusion, Asoka’s
edicts may make a meaningful contribution to development of a more spiritually
based political system." –
Ven.
S. Dhammika
in The Edicts of Ashoka.
"Many people ask: How can any nation be defended if all of its people adopt
nonviolence? It is rather difficult to answer this hypothetical question.
However, an emperor ruled over India with nonviolence and compassion in the 3rd
century B.C. Ashoka was the emperor - emperor of peace and social justice. He
did not rule by force or by accumulating goods and means of comfort for himself
or by pomp and show. He ruled by sacrificing material comforts and by treating
all his subjects equal and with justice. His example can guide us, rulers and
administrators, politicians and civil servants, religious leaders and laymen, to
establish peace, justice and harmony in present-day world." – Sh.
Duli
Chandra Jain
and Ms.
Sunita
Jain
in Ashoka - Emperor Or Monk.
"Ashoka was a man dedicated to peace, and the only emperor in history to
forsake warfare after victory in the Kalinga war, devoting the balance of his
lifetime serving not only his people, but mankind, with magnanimity and
benevolence seldom seen in history. Thus he was able to build the Golden Period
of Indian history." – Dr.

Gupta Empire
The
Gupta Empire
( Sanskrit : गुप्त
राजवंश,
Gupta Rājavaṃśa ) was an
Ancient
Indian
empire which existed approximately from 320 to 550 CE and covered
much of the
Indian Subcontinent .
Founded by
Maharaja Sri-Gupta ,
the dynasty was the model of a
classical civilization . The peace and
prosperity created under leadership of Guptas enabled the pursuit of scientific
and artistic endeavors. This period is called the
Golden Age of India
and was marked by extensive
inventions
and discoveries
in
science,
technology ,
engineering ,
art ,
dialectic ,
literature ,
logic ,
mathematics ,
astronomy ,
religion
and
philosophy
that
crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Hindu culture [5] .
Chandragupta I ,
Samudragupta , and
Chandragupta II
were the
most notable rulers of the Gupta dynasty.
The high points of this cultural creativity are
magnificent architectures, sculptures and paintings. The Gupta period produced
scholars such as
Kalidasa ,
Aryabhata ,
Varahamihira ,
Vishnu
Sharma ,
Vatsyayana
and
Prashastapada
who made great advancements in many academic fields. Science and political
administration reached new heights during the Gupta era. Strong trade ties also
made the region an important cultural center and set the region up as a base
that would influence nearby kingdoms and regions in
Burma ,
Sri Lanka ,
Malay Archipelago
and
Indochina .
The earliest available
Puranas
are also thought to have
been written around this period. The empire gradually declined because of many
factors like the substantial loss of territory and imperial authority caused by
their own erstwhile feudatories and the invasion by the
Hunas
from Central Asia.
After the collapse of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century, India was again ruled
by numerous regional kingdoms. A minor line of the Gupta clan continued to rule
Magadha after the disintegration of the empire. These Guptas were ultimately
ousted by the Vardhana king
Harsha , who established an empire
in the first half of the 7th century.
Origin of the Guptas
Recent excavations in Nepal and Deccan has
revealed that Gupta suffix was common among
Abhira
kings, and Historian D. R.
Regmi, links Imperial Guptas with Abhira-Guptas of Nepal.
Fa Xian
was the first of the
Chinese
pilgrims who
visited India during the reign of
Chandra Gupta
II. He
started his journey from China in 399 CE and reached India in 405 CE. During his
stay in India up to 411 CE, he went on a pilgrimage to
Mathura ,
Kanauj ,
Kapilavastu ,
Kushinagar ,
Vaishali ,
Pataliputra ,
Kashi
and
Rajgriha
and
made careful observations about the empire's conditions. Fa Xian was pleased
with the mildness of administration. The Penal Code was mild and offences were
punished by fines only. From his accounts, the Gupta Empire was a prosperous
period.
The
Chinese
traveler
Yijing
(see also
Xuanzang )
provides more knowledge of the Gupta kingdom in
Magadha . He came to north India
in 672 CE and heard of
Maharaja Sri-Gupta ,
who built a temple for Chinese pilgrims near
Mi-li-kia-si-kia-po-no
( Mrigasikhavana ). According to Yijing, this temple was "about 40
yojanas
to the east
of
Nalanda ,
following the course of the
Ganga ".
Srigupta and Ghatotkacha
The most likely time for the reign of Sri Gupta
is c. 240-280 CE. A number of modern historians, which include
Rakhaldas
Bandyopadhyay
and K.P.Jayaswal think he and his son were possibly
feudatories of the
Kushans .
His son and successor
Ghatotkacha
ruled probably from c. 280-319 CE. In contrast to their successor, Chandragupta
I, who is mentioned as
Maharajadhiraja , he and his son
Ghatotkacha are referred to in inscriptions as
Maharaja . At the beginning of the 5th century the
Guptas established and ruled a few small Hindu kingdoms in
Magadha
and around modern-day
Bihar .
Chandra Gupta I
Main article:
Chandragupta
I
Ghatotkacha
(c. 280–319 CE), had a son named
Chandra Gupta . (Not to
be confused with
Chandragupta Maurya
(340-293 BCE), founder of the
Mauryan Empire .) In a
breakthrough deal, Chandra Gupta was married to Kumaradevi, a
Lichchhavi
princess—the
main power in Magadha. With a dowry of the kingdom of Magadha (capital
Pataliputra ) and an
alliance with the Lichchhavis, Chandra Gupta set about expanding his power,
conquering much of Magadha,
Prayaga
and
Saketa . He established a realm
stretching from the
Ganga River
(Ganges River)
to Prayaga (modern-day
Allahabad ) by 321 CE. He
assumed the imperial title of
Maharajadhiraja .
Samudragupta
Main article:
Samudragupta
Samudragupta ,
Parakramanka
succeeded his father in
335
CE, and ruled for about 45
years, till his death in
380
CE. He took the kingdoms of
Ahichchhatra
and
Padmavati
early in his reign.
He then attacked the
Malwas , the
Yaudheyas , the
Arjunayanas , the
Maduras
and the
Abhiras , all of
which were tribes in the area. By his death in 380, he had incorporated over
twenty kingdoms into his realm and his rule extended from the
Himalayas
to the river
Narmada
and from the
Brahmaputra
to the
Yamuna . He gave himself the
titles
King of Kings
and
World Monarch . Historian
Vincent
Smith
described him as the "Indian Napoleon" [19] .
He performed
Ashwamedha yajna
(horse sacrifice) to underline the
importance of his conquest. The stone replica of the sacrificial horse, then
prepared, is in the Lucknow Museum. The Samudragupta Prashasti inscribed on the
Ashokan Pillar, now in Akbar’s Fort at Allahabad, is an authentic record of his
exploits and his sway over most of the continent.
Samudragupta was not only a talented military
leader but also a great patron of art and literature. The important scholars
present in his court were Harishena, Vasubandhu and
Asanga . He was a poet and
musician himself. He was a firm believer in
Hinduism
and is known to have
worshipped Lord
Vishnu . He was considerate of
other religions and allowed
Sri Lanka 's Buddhist king
Sirimeghvanna to build a
monastery
at
Bodh Gaya . That monastery was
called by
Xuanzang
as the
Mahabodhi
Sangharama . [20]
He provided a gold railing around the Bodhi Tree.
Succession of Samudragupta
According to
A.S. Altekar , a
king named Ramagupta intervened between Samudragupta and Chandragupta II. His
theory is based on a tradition that, Samudragupta's eldest son Ramagupta, who
succeeded him, was a weak ruler. After suffering a humiliating defeat at the
hands of the Sakas, he agreed to surrender his wife Dhruvadevi or Dhurvasvamini
to the
Saka
Chief
(who, Altekar believes is Rudrasena II). But, Rama Gupta’s younger brother
Chandra Gupta II, protested against this dishonour and went to the Saka camp
disguised as the queen and assassinated the Saka Chief. After this he killed his
brother Rama Gupta, married Dhruvadevi and ascended to the throne. But this
theory is not supported by any contemporary epigraphic evidence. The earliest
version of this narrative is found in the
Harshacharita
of
Bana . The later versions
are found in a number of texts, which include the extracts of the
Devichandragupta , a historical drama of
Vishakhadatta
found in the
Natyadarpana
of Ramachandra and Gunachandra and also in the
Shringaraprakasha
of
Bhoja I . [21]
The version of this narrative given by
Bana
in his
Harshacharita
differs
significantly from all the later versions, even the narrative known to the
author of the
Kavyamimamsa
(c.900). The
Harshacharita
only
mentions that Chandragupta II, disguised as a female, destroyed a Saka king, who
coveted the wife of another, in the very city of the enemy. [17]
It does not mention anything about Ramagupta.
Ramagupta
Although, the narrative of the
Devichandragupta
is not supported by any contemporary
epigraphical evidence, the historicity of Ramagupta is proved by his Durjanpur
inscriptions on three Jaina images, where he is mentioned as the
Maharajadhiraja . A large number of his copper coins also have been
found from the
Eran - Vidisha
region and classified in
five distinct types, which include the
Garuda , [22]
Garudadhvaja ,
lion
and
border legend
types. The
Brahmi
legends on
these coins are written in the early Gupta style. [23]
Chandragupta II
According to the Gupta records, amongst his many
sons,Samudragupta nominated prince Chandra Gupta II, born of queen Dattadevi, as
his successor.
Chandra Gupta II,
Vikramaditya
(the Sun
of Power), ruled from 380 until 413. Chandra Gupta II also married to a Kadamba
princess of Kuntala region and a princess of Naga lineage
( Nāgakulotpannnā ), Kuberanaga. His daughter
Prabhavatigupta
from this Naga queen was married to
Rudrasena
II , the
Vakataka
ruler of
Deccan . His son
Kumaragupta I was married to Kadamba princess of karnatka region . Emperor
Chandra Gupta II expanded his realm westwards, defeating the
Saka
Western Kshatrapas
of
Malwa ,
Gujarat
and
Saurashtra
in a
campaign lasting until 409, but with his main opponent
Rudrasimha III
defeated
by 395, and crushing the Bengal (Vanga) chiefdoms. This extended his control
from coast-to-coast, estabilshed a second capital at
Ujjain
and was the high point of
the empire.
Despite the creation of the empire through war,
the reign is remembered for its very influential style of
Hindu
art, literature, culture and
science, especially during the reign of Chandra Gupta II. Some excellent works
of Hindu art such as the panels at the Dashavatara Temple in
Deogarh
serve to
illustrate the magnificence of Gupta art. Above all it was the synthesis of
elements that gave Gupta art its distinctive flavour. During this period, the
Guptas were supportive of thriving
Buddhist
and
Jain
cultures as well, and for this
reason there is also a long history of non-Hindu Gupta period art. In
particular, Gupta period
Buddhist art
was to be
influential in most of East and Southeast Asia. Much of advances was recorded by
the Chinese scholar and traveller
Faxian
(Fa-hien) in his diary and
published afterwards.
The court of Chandragupta was made even more
illustrious by the fact that it was graced by the
Navaratna
(Nine
Jewels), a group of nine who excelled in the literary arts. Amongst these men
was the immortal Kalidasa whose works dwarfed the works of many other literary
geniuses, not only in his own age but in the ages to come. Kalidasa was
particularly known for his fine exploitation of the
shringara
(erotic)
element in his verse.
Chandra Gupta II's campaigns against
Foreign Tribes
4th century AD
Sanskrit
poet
Kalidasa , credits Chandragupta
Vikramaditya with having conquered about twenty one kingdoms, both in and
outside India. After finishing his campaign in the East and West India,
Vikramaditya (Chandra Gupta II) proceeded northwards, subjugated the
Parasikas
( Persians ), then the
Hunas
and the
Kambojas
tribes
located in the west and east
Oxus
valleys respectively.
Thereafter, the glorious king proceeds across the
Himalaya
and reduced the
Kinnaras ,
Kiratas
etc. and
lands into India proper
[25] .
The
Brihatkathamanjari
of the
Kashmiri
writer
Kshmendra states, king Vikramaditya (Chandra Gupta II) had
"unburdened the
sacred earth of the
Barbarians
like
the
Sakas ,
Mlecchas ,
Kambojas ,
Yavanas ,
Tusharas ,
Parasikas ,
Hunas , etc.
by annihilating these sinful
Mlecchas
completely"
[26] [27] [28] .
Kumaragupta I
Chandragupta II was succeeded by his second son
Kumaragupta I , born of
Mahadevi
Dhruvasvamini. Kumaragupta I assumed the title,
Mahendraditya . [30]
He ruled until 455. Towards the end of his reign a tribe in the Narmada valley,
the Pushyamitras, rose in power to threaten the empire.
Umpagupta
Skandagupta , son and
successor of Kumaragupta I is generally considered to be the last of the great
rulers. He assumed the titles of
Vikramaditya
and
Kramaditya . [31]
He defeated the Pushyamitra threat, but then was faced with invading
Hephthalites
or "White
Huns", known in India as the
Huna , from the northwest.
He repulsed a
Huna
attack c. 455, But the expense of the wars drained
the empire's resources and contributed to its decline. Skandagupta died in 467
and was succeeded by his agnate brother
Purugupta . [32]
Huna
invasions
and the end of empire
Skandagupta was followed by weak rulers
Purugupta
(467-473),
Kumaragupta
II
(473-476),
Budhagupta
(476-495?),
Narasimhagupta ,
Kumaragupta
III ,
Vishnugupta ,
Vainyagupta
and
Bhanugupta .
In the 480's the
Hephthalite
King Oprah broke
through the Gupta defenses in the northwest, and much of the empire was overrun
by the
Huna
by 500. The
empire disintegrated under the attacks of
Toramana
and his successor
Mihirakula .
The
Hunas
conquered several provinces of the empire, including
Malwa ,
Gujarat
and
Thanesar
and
broke away under the rule of local dynasties. It appears from inscriptions that
the Guptas, although their power was much diminished, continued to resist the
Hunas. Narasimhagupta formed an alliance with the independent kingdoms to drive
the
Huna
from most of northern India by the 530's. The succession of
the sixth-century Guptas is not entirely clear, but the tail end recognized
ruler of the dynasty's main line was king
Vishnugupta , reigning from
540 to 550.
Military organization
The Imperial Guptas could have achieved their
successes through force of arms with an efficient martial system. Historically,
the best accounts of this comes not from the Hindus themselves but from Chinese
and Western observers. However, a contemporary Indian document, regarded as a
military classic of the time, the
Siva-Dhanur-veda , offers some insight
into the military system of the Guptas. The Guptas seem to have relied heavily
on infantry archers, and the bow was one of the dominant weapons of their army.
The Hindu version of the longbow was composed of metal, or more typically
bamboo, and fired a long bamboo cane arrow with a metal head. Unlike the
composite bows
of Western
and Central Asian foes, bows of this design would be less prone to warping in
the damp and moist conditions often prevalent to the region. The Indian longbow
was reputedly a powerful weapon capable of great range and penetration and
provided an effective counter to invading horse archers. Iron shafts were used
against armored elephants and hippos, and fire arrows were also part of the
bowmen's arsenal. India historically has had a prominent reputation for its
steel
weapons . One of these was the steel bow. Due to its high
tensility , the steel
bow was capable of long range and penetration of exceptionally thick armor.
These were less common weapons than the bamboo design and found in the hands of
noblemen rather than in the ranks. Archers were frequently protected by infantry
equipped with shields, javelins, and longswords.
The Guptas also had knowledge of siegecraft,
catapults, and other sophisticated war machines.
The Guptas apparently showed little predilection
for using horse archers, despite the fact these warriors were a main component
in the ranks of their Scythian, Parthian, and Hepthalite ( Huna )
enemies. However, the Gupta armies were probably better disciplined. Able
commanders like Samudragupta and Chandragupta II would have likely understood
the need for combined armed tactics and proper logistical organization. Gupta
military success likely stemmed from the concerted use of elephants, armored
cavalry, and foot archers in tandem against both Hindu kingdoms and foreign
armies invading from the Northwest. The Guptas also maintained a navy, allowing
them to control regional waters.
The collapse of the Gupta Empire in the face of
the
Huna
onslaught was due not directly to the inherent defects of the
Gupta army, which after all had initially defeated these people under
Skandagupta. More likely, internal dissolution sapped the ability of the Guptas
to resist foreign invasion, as was simultaneously occurring in Western Europe
and China.
Gupta administration
A study of the epigraphical records of the Gupta
empire shows that there was a hierarchy of administrative divisions from top to
bottom. The empire was called by various names such as
Rajya ,
Rashtra ,
Desha ,
Mandala ,
Prithvi
and
Avani . It was divided in to 26 provinces, which were styled as
Bhukti ,
Pradesha
and
Bhoga . Provinces were also divided into
Vishayas
and put under the control of the
Vishayapati s. A
Vishayapati
administered the
Vishaya
with the help of the
Adhikarana
(council of representatives), which comprised four representatives:
Nagarasreshesthi ,
Sarthavaha ,
Prathamakulika
and
Prathama Kayastha . A part of the
Vishaya
was called
Vithi . [33]
Legacy of the Gupta Empire
Scholars of this period include
Aryabhata , who
is believed to be the first to come up with the concept of
zero , postulated the theory that
the Earth
moves round the Sun , and studied
solar
and
lunar
eclipses .
Kalidasa , who was a great
playwright, who wrote plays such as
Shakuntala , which is said to
have inspired
Goethe , and marked the highest
point of
Sanskrit literature
is also said to have belonged to this period.
The flow of invasions from the Huns from central
Asia aided in accelerating the demise of the glorious Gupta dynasty rule in
India, although the effects of its fall was far less devastating than that of
the Han or Roman at the same time. According to historian's work,
“
The Gupta Empire is considered by many scholars
to be the "classical age" of
Hindu
and
Buddhist
art and literature.
The Rulers of the Gupta Empire were strong supporters of developments in the
arts, architecture, science, and literature. The Gupta Empire circulated a large
number of
gold coins , called
dinars , and supported
the Universities of
Nalanda
and
Vikramasila .
”
Chess
is said to have originated
in this period, where its early form in the 6th century was known as
caturaṅga , which
translates as "four divisions [of the military]" –
infantry ,
cavalry ,
elephants , and
chariotry
-
represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight,
bishop, and rook, respectively. Doctors also invented several medical
instruments, and even performed operations. The
Indian numerals
which
were the first
positional
base 10
numeral systems
in the
world originated from Gupta India. The ancient Gupta text
Kama Sutra
is widely
considered to be the standard work on
human sexual
behavior
in Sanskrit literature written by the Indian scholar
Vatsyayana .
Aryabhata ,
a noted mathematician-astronomer of the Gupta period proposed that the earth is
not flat, but is instead round and rotates about its own axis. He also
discovered that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight. Instead of the
prevailing cosmogony in which eclipses were caused by pseudo-planetary nodes
Rahu
and
Ketu , he explained eclipses in
terms of shadows cast by and falling on Earth. These and the other scientific
discoveries made by Indians during this period about gravity and the planets of
the solar system spread throughout the world through trade.

Samudragupta
Samudragupta the
Great , ruler of the
Gupta Empire
(c.AD 335 –
375), and successor to
Chandragupta I , is
considered to be one of the greatest military geniuses in
Indian history
according to Historian V.A Smith. His name is taken to be a title acquired by
his conquests ( Samudra
referring to the 'oceans'). Samudragupta the
Great is believed to have been his father's chosen successor even though he had
several older brothers. Therefore, some believe that after the death of
Chandragupta I , there was
a struggle for succession in which Samudragupta prevailed.
The Empire
The main source of Samudragupta the Great's history is an inscription
engraved on one of the rocks set up by Ashoka in Kausambi ( present day
Allahabad). In this inscription Samudragupta details his conquests. This
inscription is also important because of the political geography of India that
it indicates by naming the different kings and peoples who populated India in
the first half of the fourth century AD. The inscription to Samundraupta's
martial exploits states that its author is
Harishena , who was an
important poet of Samudragupta's court.
The beginning of Samudragupta the Great's reign was marked by the defeat of
his immediate neighbours,
Achyuta , ruler of Ahichchhatra,
and Nagasena. Following this Samudragupta the Great began a campaign against the
kingdoms to the south. This southern campaign took him south along the
Bay of
Bengal . He passed through the forest tracts of
Madhya Pradesh , crossed
the
Orissa
coast,
marched through
Ganjam ,
Vishakapatnam ,
Godavari ,
Krishna
and
Nellore
districts
and may have reached as far as
Kancheepuram . Here however
he did not attempt to maintain direct control. After capturing his enemies he
reinstated them as tributary kings. This act prevented the Gupta Empire from
attaining the almost immediate demise of the
Maurya Empire
of
Ashoka
and is a
testament to his abilities as a statesman. The details of Samudragupta the
Great's campaigns are too numerous to recount here. These can be found in the
first reference below. However it is clear that he possessed a powerful navy in
addition to his army. In addition to tributary kingdoms, many other rulers of
foreign states like the
Saka
and
Kushan
kings accepted the
suzerainty of Samudragupta and offered him their services.
Patronage
Much is known about Samudragupta the Great through coins issued by him. These
were of eight different types and all made of pure
gold . His conquests brought him the
gold and also the coin-making expertise from his acquaintance with the Kushana.
Samudragupta is also known to have been a man of culture. He was a patron of
learning, a celebrated poet and a musician. Several coins depict him playing on
the Indian
lyre
or
Veena . He gathered a
galaxy of poets and scholars and took effective actions to foster and propagate
religious, artistic and literary aspects of Indian culture. Though he favoured
the Hindu religion like the other Gupta kings, he was reputed to possess a
tolerant spirit vis-a-vis other religions. A clear illustration of this is the
permission granted by him to the king of
Ceylon
to build a monastery for
Buddhist pilgrims in
Bodh
Gaya .
