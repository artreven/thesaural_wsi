Shakey's Zombie Chum
When you need to get away, put your trust in us. Here at Shakey's, we put people in our product. Shakey's Zombie chum, all natural. Will attract zombies. So when you need to get away, use Shakey's Zombie Chum, you'll die if you don't.
*Shakey's Zombie chum only available after the apocalypse. May not attract all zombies. Product contains people. Now with babies.
Shakey's first introduced the product
Zombie Chum
in 2011 after reports
of a possible zombie outbreak along the Mexico/U.S. border. Whether or not those reports were accurate are a matter of debate. (ApocEpoch can neither confirm nor deny those reports).
Shakey's began producing
Zombie Chum
with all natural animal ingredients (pig, deer, raccoon, Caucasians and squirrel). But just weeks before releasing the product, the research and development department at Shakey's decided to change the formula. There was uncertainty about the attractiveness of the product to zombies. Would be zombies were brought in to test the attractiveness of the chum. The human test subjects were actually repulsed by the product. More tests were done and came to the same conclusion, people were just not attracted to
Zombie Chum . Researchers needed an actual zombie to test their product. Since the likelihood of capturing a live zombie was remote, scientists looked to
Dawn of the Dead
for answers. After many hours of research and beer, a break through was made. It was found that zombies were attracted to humans and not animals. So the formula for
Zombie Chum
needed more people. Shakey's released the
Zombie Chum
in the summer of 2011 with people in their product. Not long after its release, a new formula was introduced. Shakey's spiced up
Zombie Chum
with babies. This is the present formula on the market. Shakey's will not comment on how well sales are doing but one executive stated that "...more people are being brought in everyday."
And with that news, ApocEpoch recommends
Zombie Chum
as a zombie fighting tool.

Solar Flare, Then The Silence
I'm sure most of you are aware of the silence that accompanies a power outage. The house no longer hums and there is an absence of high frequency noise. The noises you do hear, are your neighbors talking about the power going out and the cars passing by. Planes flying overhead still rumble, along with your vibrating cell. Things may get quieter but there are still noises from electronically controlled machines.
After a catastrophic solar flare event, we will initially hear noises much louder than we would normally hear on any given day. These loud noises will most likely come from crashing planes and the screams of neighbors. Several hours or so into the doomsday, things will get eerily quiet. The silence won't last long however. Before long you will start to hear gunfire and explosions. If you are still around, these noises will be coming from looters, bandits and roving gangs battling in the streets. It will be weeks, maybe even months before the noise finally settles.
Once the noise settles there will still be regular gunfire and general destruction but much less than the initial chaos. In the cities much of the noise will come from fighting, which may be attributed to military elements remaining. You won't want to make much noise so as to avoid the fighting. But if you must; make some noiseÂ  with your 1911 .45 ACP. In the country, the noise will be similar to what we experience now but will have greater frequency in gunfire. Those who made the exodus from the cities into the country will be hunting and killing at will. There may be less fighting than in the cities but by no means will the country be a safe place to take the kids for a hike.
Things will get loud, then silent, then loud and then settle to "normal" post-apocalyptic level...
...Maybe. No one really knows.

The Job Solution
There is an easy solution to the whole lack of jobs issue that we are facing. The official unemployment rate was 9.5 percent in June 2010 ( bls.gov ). This figure isn't telling the whole story. We can reasonably assume that the real number is much higher. We can assume this because the government will skew the numbers to benefit itself. For instance, before the crash, everything was fine according to the government when it really wasn't. No warnings came from them. Now, there are signs of recovery according to the government and unemployment is holding. Can we really believe that? You can if you like.
Now for the solution to the job problem. We all would immediately have jobs if the economy and governement came crumbling down. An out of work citizen would now be self employed in the survival business. The job description is quite extensive. A job one may encounter in their new field could be transportation. Hauling your family away from riots is a job that will be in high demand early on. The most important job all new workers will encounter in the field of survival is water and food finder. This job has many subsets (i.e. water purification, butchering, ect). There is no job to small in the survival biz. Even the kids who had not even thought about work can now participate. Get those kids to work as look outs while you rummage through your neighbors pantry. Or better yet, get into the lucrative child slave industry. A child will never go without work as a slave.
Yes there will be jobs for everyone once society collapses. No one will be left out and you can count on that.

Squats with Squirrels
The elders always mocked me before I went on the hunt. And when I was on the hunt, the other hunters made fun of me as well. I was a good hunter but that made no difference to them. It made a difference for the tribe that I was a good hunter and everyone was fed but they still would give me a hard time. I do not usually talk about the past but this is really pissing me off.
It all started when I was becoming a man. It was my first hunt with the hunters. Some of them are now elders and no longer hunt. We had been tracking a large puh-hubich (bear) through the mountains for many moons. Along the track, we hunted small animals and gathered other food. One morning I woke early with a full bladder (old indian trick). I also had a full belly. Next to a tree, I squatted, the sun just beginning to rise. I thought about the hunt and how I was going to prove myself to the others. From above in the tree, three gray squirrels climbed to the ground next to me. I was still so they did not see me. They began to search for acorn. I watched them as they squatted next to me eating the acorn. Just when I felt as one with them, the other hunters appeared from behind a willow bush. They were laughing and rolling around on the ground as I squatted with the squirrels. And not a sun or moon goes by that they let me forget my name.

Cannibalism
When animals resort to cannibalism, we conclude that there must be a good reason why they do it. But when humans resort to cannibalism, the consensus is that it is taboo or wrong. Right away we can see that there is a problem with this. Why is it taboo for humans but acceptable for animals? The line is drawn by religion or simply morality. A christian would not be a cannibal because it is immoral and so goes the same for most religions. But in some areas today and through out history, cannibalism has been an acceptable practice (this
article
details such instances).
In society as we know it, cannibalism typically occurs during survival situations. And it is in this extreme situation of survival do we see that it is justifiable to eat our own -- so long as there was no other choice (read:
Donner Party ). So, despite its wide disapproval on moral grounds, many good and moral people will become cannibals under extreme circumstances. In a post apocalyptic world the practice of feeding on ones own kind will become popular
because food will be scarce/gone.
There may be some adverse side effects to long term cannibalism that should be taken into account before you eat your neighbors, the neighbors on the other side, the neighbors down the street and all of their neighbors. Take a look at the following silent video. The disease is called
Kuru
and its effects resemble mad cow disease.
I think cannibalism may work just fine for some but as for me, I'd rather eat something else that doesn't walk upright and put up a good fight. Food should lack intelligence so it is easier for me to kill or collect. However, babies don't walk upright, put up a fight or have much intelligence. But that doesn't mean I'm going to make a BLT (babies, lettuce and tomato) out of one. No, I think eating people is wrong. I'm not sure why exactly but maybe its because no one ate me when I was a baby. Since I wasn't eaten, I was able to grow up and live a full life. A life where I can think about whether or not it is okay to eat people. So, no people for me thank you. Check back when the apocalypse happens to see if my mind has changed.

The Grasshopper and the Ant
Many are familiar with the tale of the fastidious grasshopper and his hippie-esque fellow insectoid American, the slovenly ant . In the original telling, the grasshopper is able to make it through winter alive and in style, but the ant...not so much... Of course, we aren't insectoids. Nevertheless, being prepared, as the Boy Scouts of America put it, is more than just the sum of your actions and supplies, it's also a state of mind. Almost like a sacred enlightenment that is achieved without warning. The time when you can think of almost any random TEOTWAWKI or SHTF scenario and say "I got this" with some personal reassurance that you do indeed have a plan that will see your's and your family's asses through to the other side of forever. Planning is good. But what are some of the implications of always being prepared?
I'd like to introduce something that I'm going to call "The Jackass Factor."
Now lets take your average survivalist Joe. Call him Dude X. He's got all his beans, bullets, and band-aids squared away. His preparedness library covers everything from A-bombs to Zombie Outbreak. He is skilled in 1,000 different forms of armed and unarmed combat, and he's handsome as a politician to boot. This guy's a shoe in for hero of the year no doubt, and if Hollywood movies have taught us anything, this guy will pull through unscathed, perhaps with a zany sidekick tagging along for comedic relief. But this isn't a Hollywood movie. This is reality, and in reality unexpected things can and do happen. Dude X planned TOO MUCH! When something unexpected happened, he froze up just for a second, and did something stupid. Let's say he fell down his basement stairs and broke his back, dying a slow agonizing death when his pet chihuahua's walnut sized brain decides his master looks more and more like kibble with each passing day. Game over Dude X.
Now for the interesting part, "The Jackass Factor" if you will. Lets call this man Dude Y. Your average suburbanite loser. He only has enough food to last him until his next bowel movement, enough gas to get to the closest gas station, and enough cash on hand to leave a penny in the tray at the register. Typical guy. Now, in reality, this guy is used to living unprepared. He has never prepared for ANYTHING in his entire life. Rather, he just breezes through each day without a care or thought in his dopey head. And yet, he will survive. Why, you might ask? It's all about adaptability. Period. Being able to think on your feet, and change based on environmental factors that you may not have anticipated. Dude Y is an expert at being woefully under supplied, uninformed, and otherwise uninitiated to do anything that the world expects of him. And yet, he does manage to live, and not only live, but THRIVE.
There's a lesson here.
Somewhere.
Figure it out yourself, I'm not getting paid for this.
We'll get back to this topic sometime later to further explore the virtues of being an oaf.

Will You Be a Bandit?
If there was a short answer to this question I believe it would be a yes. Let me try to explain why I think most of us will become bandits in the post-apocalyptic world. According to the
CIA world factbook
82% of the population lives in cities (2008). Apparently we like to huddle together or rather it is in our nature to herd together. In this
article
the vast majority of the herd follows along with the minority. "The findings show that in all cases, the âinformed individualsâ were followed by others in the crowd" ( Nauert ). After a major doomsday scenario, these "informed" few are going to head for the hills. The rest will follow. All that leave the cities become instant refugees. Many will band together as we naturally do. The herd will push further into rural areas. The idea most will probably have is to hunt and fish just like how they used to do every summer while on vacation. The deer, small game and fish will be annihilated. Now the herd will set its sights on those who still have food. The rural populations that are still in there own homes and have a pantry full of food will be the target of desperate refugees. The refugees then turn into bandits the moment they try to take what is not their own. Even worse, these refugees may take the turn for the worse and try to eat one another. That is a topic for another time. How well organized these refugee/bandit herds may become is uncertain. I think one thing is for certain though, most of us will become bandits. Just try not to become one of the cannibals.

The G.A.M.E.
Game over. The Russians finally beat the Americans in all out nuclear war. A surprise attack...sneaky Russians. The Americans were sore losers. "Hey! What the fuck was that? Try that shit in this reality and see what happens!" screamed an American gamer. The Global Apocalypse Mime Engine (G.A.M.E.) competition was a spectacular event that rivaled the Olympics and World Cup. Every two years, each U.N. recognized nation sends a team of gamers to compete against other teams from around the world. The competition is simple, be the last nation standing.
The sophisticated virtual reality simulation was built originally to mimic numerous apocalyptic scenarios. But the global popularity of G.A.M.E. was due to its all out war scenario. War is interesting to us because of the drama aspect. And it was this drama that fueled the fierce competition amongst the gamers. Not long after the simulator became popular globally, governments became interested in the G.A.M.E. phenomenon. Government sanctioned tournaments commenced almost immediately and thus the International G.A.M.E. competition was borne. Nations could now show off their might without actually destroying each other.
Amidst all the hoopla of achieving victory through global domination, the irony of that victory was lost on most nations. For the competition had only one true end, the complete destruction of the planet.

Prognosticators (of the economic kind)
Beware of the soothsayers in our midst. They all seem very convincing. Some are right, most are probably wrong. If you watch or follow news, try not to get caught up in the whole forecasting business. Here is what I mean by that. Back in early 2007, everything was great and the wealth of America was untouchable. You wouldn't know it, by how these forecasters talked, that there was doom not far down the road. Now these very same prognosticators are telling us how well the economy is looking or how bad its going to get. It appears for the most part, that they are split. On one side we are recovering from the crises and on the other we are about to encounter something even worse than the market fallout of March 2008. I don't believe most of them. Most of the "experts" either betrayed us or were to preoccupied with profits to warn us properly. It's hard to decipher any good information through all the nonsense. I was lucky enough to be forewarned via the survival community, namely
survivalblog.com . I'm going to assume that there won't be much of a recovery or a catastrophic collapse. But either way, I'm going stock up on guns and ammo, find a remote location with few people and hope for the best. I will however offer a prediction of my own. I predict that we're in for another 1930's style depression as one, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, lays out in this
article .Â  But here is an
article
that I just found, coincidentally, that previews various economic doomsday predictions that are more dire. Keep your chin up and above the b.s.

Economy Collapsing
(Image source:
www.matador94.nl )
Something is stirring in the news these days. The oil spill must not be getting as much ratings as it did when it first began. A shift has happened and now the economy is back in the spotlight. Worries of a "double-dip" recession has been floating around the air waves like in this
article . As if we had any sort of recovery from the "first" recession. Is this "double-dip" as they are calling it, going to put the country, nay, the world over the edge? Probably not. This is going to be a slow and painful process for years to come. So much for a quick and epic collapse.
The horrible economic state alone will not bring about complete apocalyptic destruction. But what could cause worldwide obliteration is a good ole fashion world war. One reasoning for going to war, is that it got us through tough times before, at least that is what we were taught in school. Oh and we can't forget the
New Deal
programs, those supposedly helped too. War, it could lead to the end of it all. For example what if: North Korea attacks South Korea (more than one
sub
this time). Israel uses this opportunity to take out Iran nuke facilities. China takes the opportunity to take back Taiwan. Venezuela is looking for an excuse to do something so it attacks one of those other South American countries. Mexican cartels move in further in the southwest U.S. We attack Canada because its got some oil...we might as well attack Alaska while we're at it. Who knows what the
sneaky Russians
would be up to if any one of these scenarios were to play out.
The economy is collapsing and will do so slowly for years to come. War will not save us from this depression. But Canada needs to be conquered in order to secure the necessary resources for Americas future.

The Aisle
"Pardon me sir" said I, scooting past the young store clerk who was placing items on the sparsely stocked shelves. The store clerk made a noise but I couldn't make out any words. As I made my way towards the rice, an old lady turned her cart down the narrow aisle toward me. I reached the rice and grabbed a small bag of the white. The old woman drew closer. I looked back at the young store clerk who was still stocking the shelves. I was trapped. Who designed this store? I thought to myself. I could return the way I came but would that require another "Pardon me sir." I again looked at the store clerk. Oh shit! That's no sir at all! Now I'm going to have to try and squeeze past this old woman. I couldn't possibly face another encounter with that young lady stocking the shelves. As she made her slow approach, the old woman eyed the rice that I was carrying then looked into my eyes. I hesitated, then made my move to get around her. "Excuse me Ma'am." She smiled and again eyed the rice as I side stepped between the shelves and the cart. I was clear from the awkward moment. I then declared to myself that I should have climbed over the row of shelves into the next aisle. I reached the check out. I lifted the back flap of my gray sport coat to grab my wallet. Tucked into my trousers at the small of my back, was a Model 1911 .45 Auto pistol. Had she made a move for the rice, I would have dropped that old bag. I paid for the rice and left without incident...this time.

Dead Penguins: This was an interesting
story
to read. It reminds me of using canaries in mines as an indicator of dangerous atmospheric conditions. The penguins dying in mass can be seen as an indicator as well. Is there imminent danger? perhaps not. It may not be any real indicator at all but nonetheless interesting. Zombies: A nice
article
covering the numerous zombie apocalypse theories. The author goes in depth on the subject and makes an insightful presentation.
