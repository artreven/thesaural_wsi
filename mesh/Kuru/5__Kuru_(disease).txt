"What cannot be spoken of cannot be
defeated ."
My
head
isn't clear and I pass in and out of
sleep . I'm
infected .
Stay with
me
as I type this. I'll give you a little background. In the 1950's the last of the
South Fore
engaged in
ritual
necrophagia
and the
prion
disease
Kuru
recently claimed the last
victims
among them.  The last that ate the
thoughts
of another.  Nearby, another
Papua New Guinea
tribe discovered a more pernicious and far more
horrifying
threat about forty years ago.  For years, their population shook and trembled for a reason unknown to them.  They pointed to a
cave
in which words approximated by the
English
phrase
The
Black
Whisper
of
Death
were inscribed.
"The
plague
came from in there,"
they said.
8-43 0x12a_rr . ;09]]
Globalization
efforts brought the
whisper
heard
round the world .  Oh,
look ! On the overhead
TV , that
image ..
A beloved American
religious
leader at a political celebration passes an attractive, conservatively
dressed
young woman. As the light of
recognition
flares in his eyes, he warmly
greets
her by
name . She smiles
mechanically . Suddenly horrified he whirls around to locate the
camera
capturing an
unmistakable
expression
of
humiliation .
It's on
TV
every other day.  She was a minor
porn
star .  It was not that he greeted her that condemned him.  He could have
legitimately
known
her in a
number
of ways.  Even had he known her
biblically
it would have been taken in stride.  Who cares?  It turns out his televised
shame
indicted him more decisively than a
living-room
stash of indecent
DVD  s.  After all, it is shame and little else that condemns us.  The
tabloids
carried that
image
for months next to the articles decrying
Death's Whisper .  It doesn't matter.  The
young
woman and the
religioso
are dead now,
victims
of their own
fascination
with their
tabloid fame
and more directly, victims of its
adjacent
coverage .
In this case it is
knowledge
that destroys. dsf6 -saf ;; This is not a disease borne by a
bacterium , a
virus , or a prion. See, this
whisper
is a disease carried by the most insidious of
vectors
-
language
itself. To simply
understand what it is
is to be
irreversibly
afflicted. What cannot be spoken of cannot be
defeated . I am condemned already and by writing I damn my readers. But there will be no
readers ..
Some said it was the
Creator , dropping in a
kill switch
to flip at the turn of a phrase.  It's adaptive. They named the disease in the
native tongue
and it killed them. Scientists described it in
English
and
French
and
Spanish . It killed them. The blind read of it in
Braille , the deaf signed in
ASL . Experts from around the world spewed a rainbow of
euphemisms . It killed
millions . It is not bound to any particular
lexical
form - perhaps its representation in the brain creates the disease
ex nihilo . I don't really know. We did not discover the
mechanism
that drives this
epidemic .
It may be strange to think of language spreading disease, but it is not unique.  What is it that
viral machines
inject into living cells if not RNA/DNA coded
assembly language
pathogens?  I know that machines aren't affected because
words
are transparent to them. Still,
machines
played the
pivotal
role in the spread -&89sd(( of the disease as its
immune and efficient carriers .
Can you
imagine
(no, you can't - because there is no you)
seeing
all those around you die for an
unknown cause of death ?  As death certificate handlers really
understood
the meaning of
unknown cause of death
they came down
with
the disease in droves.  Suddenly, the certificates began listing things like
Onychocryptosis
and
Internecivus raptus .  Those who
witness
the deaths but don't
know
the cause are inexorably driven to discover it.  ( Most
of) those who
know , and are infected, try desperately to not
reveal
it to anyone and have
always
failed.  Now though, strangely, I'm compelled to type this even if I have to type with the
keyboard
upside down to keep the
blood
from my hands from running into it.  I can no longer hope
for
any resolution but the
obvious .
And I wait for that
resolution
even as the
asymptomatic
machines
auto- hyperlink
this
document. No future, fatal question will go
unanswered

Bytecode to Native Compilation
At work, some of the software I develop uses a bytecode interpreter.
And, as always, we need better performance from the whole system.
So I'm looking into bytecode-to-native (in this case C++) compilation.
I've done this before, with embedded Lisp-based languages and there are a number of compilers available that do this for Java (GCC has a back-end for this), C#, Lisp and its derivatives (Bigloo for Scheme, for instance).
Compiling to C or C++ is great as it serves as a sort of portable assembly language and it's possible to leverage further the fine optimization skillz of modern C/C++ compilers.
I'll report on this when I make some progress - if I don't get pulled off onto something else.
