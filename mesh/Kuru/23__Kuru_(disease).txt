Joke of the Month Award #1.3 - "Irish Coffee"
An Irish woman of advanced age visited her physician to ask his advice in reviving her husband's libido. 'What about trying Viagra?' asked the doctor. 'Not a chance', she said. 'He won't even take an aspirin.' 'Not a problem,' replied the doctor. 'Give him an 'Irish Viagra'. It's when you drop the Viagra tablet into his coffee. He won't even taste it. Give it a try and call me in a week to let me know how things went..' It wasn't a week later when she called the doctor, who directly inquired as to her progress. The poor dear exclaimed, 'Oh, faith , bejaysus and begorrah! T'was horrid! Just terrible, doctor!' 'Really? What happened?' asked the doctor. 'Well, I did as you advised and slipped it in his coffee and the effect was almost immediate. He jumped straight up, with a twinkle in his eye and with his pants a-bulging fiercely! With one swoop of his arm, he sent me cups and tablecloth flying, ripped me clothes to tatters and took me then and there passionately on the tabletop! It was a nightmare, I tell you, an absolute nightmare!' 'Why so terrible?' asked the doctor, 'Do you mean the sex your husband provided wasn't good?' 'Feckin jaysus, 'twas the best sex I've had in 25 years! But sure as I'm sittin here, I'll never be able to show my face in Starbucks again!' b'dum tish

Essentials of Glycobiology - New Edition
is freely available from the NLM/NCBI Bookshelf
As reported today
on Open Access News (OAN):- ... Essentials of Glycobiology, the largest and most authoritative text in its field, will be freely available online beginning October 15, through collaboration between the Consortium of Glycobiology Editors, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Fittingly, the release of the book follows soon after the October 14th celebration of
International Open Access Day , which will highlight prior successes in providing such open access to research journals. ...
Here is the book .
The Foreword
is a great place to start of course. -- OAN Comments:
* Add this to the growing list of widely-used textbooks that are available OA.
* Who's backing this is also noteworthy. It's not an author who negotiated the right to self-archive a copy, or an OA startup publisher; it's a scientific press and the National Library of Medicine.
* The first edition of the book has been OA since 2003. Apparently, the impact on sales of the print copy hasn't been overwhelmingly negative, or it seems unlikely the publisher would support OA to the new edition. My Comments: Glycobiology is a most fascinating area that continues to gather interest over time.
I applaud all involved for contributing to and publishing this work to the widest audience on the planet. Press Release:
Novel publishing approach puts textbook in more hands

EXiS (Excellence in Science) Open Choice
Since I've been following Prion disease
(PrPd)
research for seven years now, I've studied a lot of literature in this and other fields. Upon my latest search of the
NeuroPrion database ,
(of which I have access to but can't widely share)
I noted a stack of new Manuscripts about
Kuru . When I checked PubMed, I found many of them archived there, at full article level. It didn't take long to track down this page:-
Volume 363, Number 1510 / November 27, 2008 Theme Issue ‘The end of kuru: 50 years of research into an extraordinary disease’ compiled by John Collinge and Michael P. Alpers
That's 52 new Open Access Manuscripts relating to Kuru research.
Kudos to all involved for making all of this broadly accessible for free . I've never seen such a glut of material on Kuru before so have a lot of reading to do. I do wonder however, if these articles will remain OA ?? --
EXiS Open Choice EXiS (Excellence in Science) Open Choice is an 'author-pays' model that operates alongside our established subscription model. Under this scheme submission of an article is free, but if it is accepted for publication, the authors are asked to pay a fee to have their article made freely available to all immediately on publication.
By selecting this option, authors benefit in a number of ways:
* the same standards of high-quality, rapid peer-review and production
* the potential for greatly increased dissemination and citation
* publisher deposit of the article in PubMedCentral
* liberal licensing policy through
Creative Commons 2.5
* satisfies the requirements of research funders requiring open access publication, such as the NIH,MRC and Wellcome Trust (see
http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo.php?colour=green
* publication is both online and in print
For more information about this journal service please see the
FAQs

OHS - Open Housekeeping Stuff
I do my best to maintain my apartment to pretty reasonable standards. Yesterday, with under an hours notice, some visitors popped by. As such, some general last minute general cleaning, I thought would suffice. -- Just before they left, one guest had a few comments to make so I prepared a Steel House Complaint Form:-
The individual who completed the form apologised from the onset for their grammatical errors. Fair enough - she be aged 10.
-- 1)
SQUKEK FRIGE
- OK, I have some WD-40 somewhere 2)
BROKE TILES
- yes, there are three tiles I need to replace in the bathroom 3)
WOBELY CHAIRS
- two of my four kitchen table chairs need minor screwdriver TLC 4) NON CLEAN FISH TANK - can't argue with that and will clean the tank this week

ANNOUNCING THE LAUNCH OF THE OPEN ACCESS SCHOLARLY PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION, OASPA
Subject: Launch of OASPA Date: Tue, 14 Oct 2008 09:25:23 -0700 From:
feedback@openaccesspublishing.org Apology for cross posting: ANNOUNCING THE LAUNCH OF THE OPEN ACCESS SCHOLARLY PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION, OASPA 14 October 2008, London. The Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association, OASPA, announces its official launch today in conjunction with an OA Day celebration hosted by the Wellcome Trust in London. The mission of OASPA is to support and represent the interests of Open Access (OA) journals publishers globally in all scientific, technical, and scholarly disciplines through an exchange of information, setting of industry standards, advancing business and publishing models, advocating for gold OA journals publishing, education and the promotion of innovation. From having first emerged as a new publishing model over a decade ago, OA publishing has become an embedded feature of the scholarly publishing landscape: The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) lists over 3500 peer-reviewed journals; a growing number of professional organizations offer OA publications; university libraries increasingly support OA publishing services; funding organizations support and encourage OA publishing; and a long tail of independent editorial teams and societies now publish their titles OA. Professional OA publishers such as BioMed Central and the Public Library of Science (PLoS) have been in business for over five years, while some scientist/scholar publishers (editorial teams operating independently of a professional publisher) have published their OA journals for a decade or more. Moreover, a number of traditional publishing houses are now engaging in Open Access activities, the recent acquisition of BioMed Central by Springer and the SAGE-Hindawi partnership being two cases in point. By bringing together those who share an interest in developing appropriate business models, tools and standards to support OA journals publishing, it is hoped that success in these areas can be achieved more quickly to the benefit of not only OASPA members, but more importantly, for the scholarly community that OA publishers serve. Membership in OASPA is open to both scholar publishers and professional publishing organizations, including university presses and for profit and non-profit organizations. Members are expected to demonstrate a genuine interest in OA journals publishing by having signed either the Berlin or Budapest Declarations and must publish at least one full OA journal. Other individuals and organizations who support OA journals publishing or who are interested in exploring opportunities are also welcome. Membership criteria and an application form can be found on the OASPA website, www.oaspa.org. The founding members of OASPA represent a broad spectrum of OA publishers and include: BioMed Central, Co-Action Publishing, Copernicus, Hindawi Publishing Corporation, Journal of Medical Internet Research (Gunther Eysenbach), Medical Education Online (David Solomon), the Public Library of Science (PLoS), SAGE, SPARC Europe and Utrecht University Library (Igitur). Representatives from each of these publishers will form an interim board until a first General Meeting is held during 2009. Open Access Scholarly Publishers’ Association, OASPA, is launched today 14 October 2008 in response to long-time informal discussions among Open Access publishers, and aims to represent the interests of OA journals publishers globally. For more information about the organization, visit the OASPA website at: www.oaspa.org. The Wellcome Trust is the largest charity in the UK. It funds innovative biomedical research, in the UK and internationally, spending over £600 million each year to support the brightest scientists with the best ideas. The Wellcome Trust supports public debate about biomedical research and its impact on health and wellbeing. Open Access (OA) scholarly publication refers to the dissemination of peer-reviewed manuscripts containing original research or scholarship immediately upon publication, at no charge to user groups, without requiring registration or other restrictions to access. OA publications also allow users to "copy, use, distribute, transmit and display the work publicly and to make and distribute derivative works, in any digital medium for any responsible purpose, subject to proper attribution of authorship...."

Why I am an OA Advocate
Why does Open Access matter to me?
I became involved in patient advocacy in September 2001 just under two years after I lost my brother to a fatal, rare neurodegenerative disease. During the early years of this work, I commenced the process of studying peer reviewed scientific, technical and medical (STM) research.
This namely involved paper copies of Toll Access (TA) articles passed to the support group I was involved with by highly regarded UK researchers in the field. Whilst 'we' were able to share such STM research (with family members of the organisation) by post using "fair use", I knew that Copyright restricted me from sharing any such material with a wider audience - the organisations website.
Despite this restriction, simply by placing as much information online in an open manner wherever possible, in the space of year, traffic had increased by over 4000%. As such, even before I knew what Open Access was, it was abundantly clear that being open was the main key to outreaching.
When did I become aware of Open Access?
That would have been mid 2006. Up until the day in question, I had a
pretty simple system
in place to obtain PDF's of TA manuscripts from authors.
On the day in question, I noted from the Abstract of the Manuscript that I was looking for, there was a link to the full article. Yay.
PLoS Pathogens
was the first OA Journal that I came across.
Not only could I access the Manuscript I was looking for, but the real eye opener was that I was able to access the entire Journal online for free!
As I said in
this recent interview :-
One of my main eternal frustrations remains not being able to share my extensive library of papers due to Draconian copyright restrictions.
Creative Commons
is a dream come true..... Indeed, I'm wearing one of my PLoS t-shirts right now =) Prof
Lawrence Lessig , you remain a STAR !!
Why should scientific and medical research be an open-access resource for the world?
To me, it makes so little sense in this day and age to carry out
and share
STM research in a closed environment as was done for centuries before the advent of OA.
May I quote in part, Associate Professor Bevin P. Engelward, the winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine
from this
2007 PLoS Biology article:-
...In an age rife with the potential for infectious pandemics, bioterrorism, and toxic environmental calamity, and at a time when we need new ways to cure terrible illnesses, public access is our society's compelling answer to accelerating the best science possible. This advance is much needed, both by researchers working in academic settings and in the private sector. Indeed, we should demand no less. We invite our fellow scientists to join in the demand for open access to biomedical literature.
Science, progress, societal benefits from that is a pretty concise focus.
Indeed, here's a shot of
Peter Murray-Rust
and McDawg discussing their forthcoming OA related Manuscript in London, August 2008.
(Image c/o Joe Dunckley's
sciblog Flickr stream )
What do you do to support Open Access, and what can others do?
Simple. Spread the word.
My
most blogged about post
to date is precisely about this.
The blogosphere is an astonishingly great place to share and discover information.
I've blogged
fairly extensively
about OA since I started blogging late 2007.
--
The musician in me cannot omit something poignant on this post. As such, here's McDawg's favourite mix of Peter Gabriel's Shock The Monkey arising as a result of
this competition .
Peter Gabriel
fully supports
initiatives such as Creative Commons, The Open Society Institute, Students For Free Culture etc.

Brisbane Declaration
[Forwarding from Tom Cochrane, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Queensland University of Technology.
--Peter Suber.]
08 October 2008 20:16:40
Following the conference on Open Access and Research held in September in Australia, and hosted by Queensland University of Technology, the following statement was developed and has the endorsement of over sixty participants.
Brisbane Declaration Preamble The participants recognise Open Access as a strategic enabling activity, on which research and inquiry will rely at international, national, university, group and individual levels. Strategies Therefore the participants resolve the following as a summary of the basic strategies that Australia must adopt: 1.
Every citizen should have free open access to publicly funded research, data and knowledge. 2.
Every Australian university should have access to a digital repository to store its research outputs for this purpose. 3.
As a minimum, this repository should contain all materials reported in the Higher Education Research Data Collection (HERDC). 4.
The deposit of materials should take place as soon as possible, and in the case of published research articles should be of the author’s final draft at the time of acceptance so as to maximize open access to the material. Brisbane, September, 2008

Open Access Day on FriendFeed
Readers of this blog and/or people who know me are aware of my ongoing involvement in the Open Access Community although some of what I do is behind the scenes. Back in April, thanks to suggestions in
this thread
at Nature Network, we came up with the idea of
Open Access Week . You can find a summary of that on McBlawg
here . As a result of that, McDawg has already been consulted over plans for next year's Open Access Week. Further details to follow nearer the time. In the meantime, after some behind the scenes work, on August 28th, seconds after
the official announcement
was made about Open Access Day, I spread the word
here
on FriendFeed.
In the lead up to the day itself, there's been loads of coverage in the blogosphere already (simply Google open access day) so I don't intend to expand upon that. It just so happens that McDawg is off work during the week that the event is being held. I'm particularly glad to see that the suggestion of
live worldwide broadcasts of events
has become a reality. Kudos to the organisers. -- Cut to the chase. There's going to be a frenzy of OA related items taking place on or around 14th October such as video, audio, synchroblogging etc.
As has been done recently to great effect, a brilliant way (this is simply one) to capture all of this and archive it, is to set up a dedicated room over at FriendFeed (FF). Recent examples (FF Rooms) are
BioBarCamp
and
Science Blogging 2008: London
(now Called Science Online at FF). As such, as of today,
I've set up a Room at FF called "Open Access Day" . Not just because they were the first two to join, but
Martin Fenner
and
Michael Nielsen
have been handed Administrator status like McDawg.
-- plus
equals
-- I, or should I say we have no idea how successful or not this concept will be. That said, like the other Rooms mentioned above, providing we can attract a reasonable amount of room members, the idea is:- Open Access Day is on October 14th. This day is organised by
SPARC ,
Students for FreeCulture
and
PLoS . This room has been set up to capture events before during and after the day on FF.
Feel free to join the Room, participate and join the discussion that will gather in pace over the next ten days.

"Science v's Sport" - The New Online Debate
Please do go and check out
this
rather excellent post on Dr Jenny Rohn's tip-top blog,
Mind The Gap .
I tend to agree with Dr Rohn on all fronts thus far, and as she said in her closing para:-
"...At that moment, I wondered how we could get more coverage of science into the world; not rehashed, regurgitated and mangled press-released data, but the sweaty, messy, human endeavor as it unfolds before us, outcome uncertain and all to play for. Such attention might not be comfortable for scientists, but if mere athletes can stand the heat, why couldn’t we?" Midway through the comments thus far is the following in terms of the coverage of sport.
From
Stephen Curry :- "Sport also has the advantage over science that it is utterly, utterly pointless and therefore lends itself to hyping/trivialisation by the media as so wonderfully demonstrated here:"
Cue this rather majestic piece.....
