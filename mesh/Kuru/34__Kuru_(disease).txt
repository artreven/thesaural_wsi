Check For Shaking Hands
While watching the movie, " The Book of Eli ", last night, one aspect gave me pause. Repeatedly in the movie, people were asked to show their hands. It was a test of sorts, and you didn't pass unless your hands could be held perfectly still while the stranger inspected them. The reason for the hand-checking wasn't explained until towards the end of the movie, during a very odd scene at an elderly couple's house. The elderly woman's hands are shaking violently, and Sonara asks Eli why. Eli replies quietly, "Too much human meat."
Well, in that case, I'd probably be asking to see people's hands as well!
Of course, the first thing I did this morning was google to see whether or not there was any truth to support the movie's claim. The answer? Sort of.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease is a human version of mad-cow disease, caused by eating contaminated meat (human or otherwise) - and one symptom is loss of muscle control.   Kuru
disease is a related disease, caused specifically by consuming human prions - and the primary symptom is uncontrollable shaking. Both diseases are loosely referenced as prion diseases, because they are caused by misfolded versions of the prion protein, which lead to clumping prions in the brain and the resulting neurological disorders and symptoms.
These diseases have caused epidemics in the past among
cannibal
societies. Scientists can even detect a mutation in some humans to protect against prion diseases - suggesting at one time cannibalism wasn't that uncommon. So, it is possible that all of the cannibals in the movie developed some version of prions disease, but it is unlikely that all cannibals would have shaking hands - only if they lacked the mutation for resistance.
In any case, I suppose if you ever found yourself wondering whether or not someone may view you as a potential food source, you could check to see if their hands were shaking. Couldn't hurt, right?

Eeewww! I had totally forgotten that movie until now. Funny how movie-makers can always find something sort-of plausible that makes a good story line :)
