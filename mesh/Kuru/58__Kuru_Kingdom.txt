KAURAV-the historial soul
Kaurava The term Kaurava ( Sanskrit :कौरव) is a
Sanskrit
term, that means a descendant of
Kuru , a legendary king who is the ancestor of many of the characters of the
Mahābhārata . The term is used in the Mahābhārata with two meanings: The wider meaning, to represent all the descendants of Kuru. This meaning, which includes the
Pandava
brothers, is sometimes used in the Mahābhārata, especially in some of the earlier parts. The commoner and narrower meaning, to represent the elder line of the descendants of King Kuru. This restricts it to the children of King
Dhritarashtra , as his line is the elder line of descent from Kuru. It excludes the children of the younger brother
Pandu , who founds his own line, the
Pandava . The rest of this article deals with the Kaurava in the narrower sense, that is the children of Dhritarashtra, by Queen
Gandhari . When referring to these, a more specific term is also frequently encountered - Dhārtarāṣṭra, a derivative of Dhṛtarāṣṭra (Dhritarashtra). According to the standard texts, Gandhari wanted a hundred sons, and
Vyasa
granted her a boon that she would have these. Another version says that she was unable to have any children for a long time and she eventually became pregnant, but did not deliver for two years, after which she gave birth to a lump of flesh. Vyasa cut this lump into a hundred and one pieces, and these eventually developed into a hundred boys and one girl. This story should be read in view of the dispute over the succession to the throne of the kingdom. It attributes a late birth to
Duryodhana , the eldest son of Dhritarashtra, despite his father's early marriage. This legitimises the case for his cousin
Yudhisthira
to claim the throne, since he could claim to be the eldest of his generation. Although all hundred sons have been named, only the first few are normally mentioned in the Mahābhārata. The first five are: Duryodhana Dushasana Dussala
(daughter) Jalagandha Sama All the male sons of Dritarashtra were killed in the great battle at
Kurukshetra . Sons of the Kauravas fought in the Great War. Duryodhana had 29 sons of which few survived. Upon the death of Dushasan, the second kaurava, Purujit was made Kaurava Yuvaraja. After his death, Sudarsha was made the Yuvaraj. After the defeat of all, Ashwathhama crowned Durmukha, youngest son of Duryodhana as next King and continued struggle. They migrated to the west and formed the Kathi tribe now living in Kathiawar, Gujarat.[ citation needed ] [ edit ] The Kauravas Duryodhana Dussaasana Dussaha Dussala Jalagandha Sama Saha Vindha Anuvindha Durdharsha Subaahu Dushpradharshana Durmarshana Durmukha Dushkarna Vikarna Saala Sathwa Sulochana Chithra Upachithra Chithraaksha Chaaruchithra Saraasana Durmadan Durvigaahana Vivilsu Vikatinandana Oornanaabha Sunaabha Nandana Upanandana Chithrabaana Chithravarma Suvarma Durvimochana Ayobaahu Mahaabaahu Chithraamga Chithrakundala Bheemavega Bheemabala Vaalaky Belavardhana Ugraayudha Sushena Kundhaadhara Mahodara Chithraayudha Nishamgy Paasy Vrindaaraka Dridhavarma Dridhakshathra Somakeerthy Anthudara Dridhasandha Jaraasandha - (It Is questionable if Jaraasandha(n?) is a part of the Kaurava Clan.

During that year, O king, was begotten upon her by the illustrious Dhritarashtra a son endued with great intelligence who was afterwards named Yuvutsu. And because he was begotten by a Kshatriya upon a Vaisya woman, he came to be called Karna// "Thus were born unto the wise Dhritarashtra- a hundred sons who were all heroes and mighty chariot-fighters, and- a daughter over and above the hundred, and- another son Yuyutsu of great energy and prowess begotten upon a Vaisya woman.'"
