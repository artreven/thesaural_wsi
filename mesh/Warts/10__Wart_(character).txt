Transcript
{Open to a dull flat red background with lighter shades in circles going towards the top of the screen. The King of Town's head appears on the screen. As the singers sing, the words "Very Own Popular Cartoon" appear below the King of Town head. The King of Town head moves to the music a little.}
SINGERS:
The King of Town's Very Own Quite Popular Cartoon Show!
{The words "The King of Town's" appear above the King of Town's emblem.}
SINGERS:
The King of Town's Very Own Quite Popular Cartoon Show!
{The word "Quite" is written between "Own" and "Popular", and "Show!!" is inserted after "Cartoon". The music stops.}
THE KING OF TOWN:
For reals this time!
{Cut to a stylized King of Town's Castle surrounded by sheep. A segment of the theme tune played on the double bass is heard. A silhouette of The Chef goes to the door and rings the doorbell}
THE KING OF TOWN:
Somebody get the door! I'll get it!
{Cut to the inside of the castle, where the King of Town stands by the door. The door opens and reveals The Chef with a pizza box with his face on it.}
THE CHEF:
{in a strong accent}
Pizza for you... Kingy-ding?
{The King of Town takes the pizza; cut to him.}
THE KING OF TOWN:
Thanks, Chef!
{pronounces "chef" with a hard CH; closes door hard on The Chef}
{Cut to a long table with The Hornblower, The Cleric, The Blacksmith, and The Knight. A segment of the theme tune played on the piano is heard. The King of Town walks over.}
THE KING OF TOWN:
Here ya go, boy-o's!
{drops pizza box on table and looks other way}
Poopsmith! Pizza's here! Don't forget to forget to wash your hands!
{A stylized Poopsmith walks in, with green clouds surrounding him. The King of Town's eyes pop bigger and his crown pops up and falls back on his head}
THE KING OF TOWN:
Woo! What is that reek?
{looks at The Poopsmith}
The Poopsmith, you smell like a crapsmith.
{The Poopsmith hangs his head sadly}
Have you tried showering?
{Cut to The Poopsmith, who nods his head. Cut back to King of Town}
THE KING OF TOWN:
Bathing?
{Cut back to The Poopsmith, who nods his head. Cut back to King of Town}
THE KING OF TOWN:
Wearing a baseball cap and putting deodorant on outside your shirt?
{Cut to The Poopsmith, who pauses and then nods. Cut back to King of Town}
THE KING OF TOWN:
Well, I'm out of ideas.
{looks over to the table}
Anyone else?
{Cut to the table}
THE KNIGHT:
Have you tried...
{Cut to the mountains where The Knight, holding a spear, stands next to The Poopsmith, who is tied to a log stuck in the ground. A dragon looks at both of them. A sign is pointing up to The Dragon reading "multi function dragon"}
THE KNIGHT:
{to The Poopsmith}
So, I'm gonna set this thing to "sanitize", and it'll burn the stink right off ya!
{The Knight throws his spear at the Dragon's stomach. There are different labels on the Dragon's scales: "pots n pans", "instant death", "sanitize", "puree", and "tumble dry". The spear hits "instant death".}
THE KNIGHT:
Ooooooh...
{In a mood of regret, then returning to a normal mood}
yeah! This is gonna be awesome!
{The Dragon leans back, skull symbols appear on its eyes, and it falls with much force on The Knight, embedding its teeth in the ground. A circle with The Blacksmith inside appears.}
THE BLACKSMITH:
Have you tried...
{Wipe to The Blacksmith pouring "Përfüme" in some bellows. He sprays it at The Poopsmith. The perfume goes straight toward the Poopsmith but comes to a screeching halt at the clouds of stink and goes back a bit.}
PERFUME BALL:
Ooooh! Ooh! I've lived a terrible life! I was a horrible husband and father! I watched too much sports! WOOAAAAHHHH!
{The perfume puffs out into several clouds and disintegrates. A circle with The Cleric inside appears.}
THE CLERIC:
Have you tried...
{Cut to a church like scene. The Cleric is holding up a scroll.}
THE CLERIC:
I now pronounce you man and pleasant odor!
{Cut to The Poopsmith, who is wearing a bowtie, standing next to a bouquet of roses. The Hornblower starts playing Mendelssohn's "Wedding March" with his horn. The Poopsmith kisses the flowers, which keel over and turn brown, along with the horn. The Hornblower becomes annoyed. A circle containing The King of Town appears.}
THE KING OF TOWN:
Have you tried...
{Wipe of The Blacksmith and The King of Town, throwing a football in the air.}
THE KING OF TOWN:
A little tackle football? Me and The Blacksmith
{zoom out to reveal a shower next to The Poopsmith}
versus The Poopsmith and that shower!
{The Poopsmith and The Blacksmith get ready}
Hut one, hut two, and a hike!
{The Blacksmith rushes forward and tackles the shower while The King of Town and The Poopsmith look on.}
THE KING OF TOWN:
Uh, way to protect this house, but uh... that wasn't really what I had in mind.
{Cut to the inside of the castle where The King of Town stands with everyone but The Poopsmith. A few bars of the theme tune is heard. The Poopsmith's Whatsit pile is visible outside.}
THE KING OF TOWN:
Well, beezos, I hoped it wouldn't come to this, but there's only one thing left to do!
{Cut to the mountains, where everyone flies through the air while music plays.}
SINGERS:
{singing}
Jumping fun!
You're jumping through the air.
Jumping fun!
{The King and his men all fall toward the pile of whatsit. Freeze-frame just before they all hit the pile, then fade through white to the table, where everybody is covered in whatsit, has odor clouds and is eating pizza.}
THE KING OF TOWN:
Well, you know what I always say, "If you can't beat make The Poopsmith smell good, join... beat make The Poopsmith smell good!" Right? Everybody?
{Inset to The Poopsmith while more of the jump music plays. The Poopsmith gives a "thumbs up sign"}
SINGERS:
{singing}
Jumping fun!
{The scene zooms out to The Dragon rotting in front of the castle, complete with flies.}
THE KING OF TOWN:
{voiceover}
Whoo! Did I say Crapsmith? I shoulda said rotting-Dragon-smith! That is ripe!
{The screen dims and the word "end." appears along with a "back." button}

Fun Facts

Trivia
Original title card
The animation style is much more loosely
stylized
than it was in the teaser at the beginning of
senior prom . Also, the background has changed from a reflective red background with horizontal lines to a dull flat red with lighter shades in circles towards the top of the screen.
This is the first appearance of The Little Chef Guy and The Cleric since
The King of Town DVD .
This is the first time The Knight and The Cleric have spoken in a cartoon.
The Little Chef Guy and The Blacksmith previously had very small speaking roles in
The King of Town DVD .
[ edit ]
Remarks
The Cleric is now clad in purple, the traditional color of bishops' vestments in the
Roman Catholic
and
Anglican
churches.
While the Blacksmith is spraying the Poopsmith with perfume, there are still sounds of a hammer hitting an anvil in the background even though the anvil is in picture and there is no indication that the Blacksmith has other employees.
The Knight is voiced by
Mike Chapman .
[ edit ]
Goofs
When the Chef comes to the door on the tongue, the tongue's line disappears.
When the King of Town answers the door, the chef isn't standing on a tongue.
When the Poopsmith is tied to the stake, he no longer has an odor cloud around him.
In the last scene, the Hornblower doesn't have an odor cloud around him.
When the Blacksmith is pouring perfume into his bellows, some of the perfume pokes through the neck of its container.

Commentary Transcript
( Commentary by:
Strong Bad ,
Mike Chapman , and
Ryan Sterritt )
STRONG BAD:
Who allowed this to happen?
Who allowed this to happen!?
MIKE:
Strong Bad!
We— We owed him.
STRONG BAD:
We've owed him what?
MIKE:
We owed him a cartoon.
A very own, quite popular cartoon show.
STRONG BAD:
No, but it was the big fake-out, right?
I got him cancelled, 'cause I'm too great.
MIKE:
Well, uh, what do you think about the chef here?
STRONG BAD:
He's creepier than ever!
MIKE:
Do you ever get, uh, pizzas delivered by the chef?
STRONG BAD:
No!
I would not let that guy near me.
Kingy-ding?
MIKE:
What does he call you?
The chef.
STRONG BAD:
Me?
MIKE:
Yeah, does he have a little—
STRONG BAD:
Strongy-bong.
MIKE:
Strongy-bong?
STRONG BAD:
Yeah.
MIKE:
Oh.
STRONG BAD:
And I smack him.
MIKE:
Yeah, I can see that.
STRONG BAD:
So, why does he— Why does everyone look so weird and different, The Poopsmith—
MIKE:
It's style, Strong Bad!
It's called—
STRONG BAD:
The Poopsmith looks like he's like a— a, like, middle-aged man.
MIKE:
Yeah, he looks—
STRONG BAD:
He doesn't look like his usual, uh... what do you call them? ...albino self.
MIKE:
It's style Strong Bad, trust me.
STRONG BAD:
That's your voice, Mike.
MIKE:
It is.
I was never real happy with that voice.
STRONG BAD:
Yeah, me neither.
MIKE:
Yeah?
STRONG BAD:
Yeah.
MIKE:
You shoulda done it, Strong Bad.
STRONG BAD:
Me?
MIKE:
Yeah.
You—
STRONG BAD:
Okay, here I'll redo it.
"Oh, I'm dead!
Oh, let me out of this dragon's mouth, 'cause I'm—"
MIKE:
Um, a little less Strong Bad.
A little less Strong Bad.
STRONG BAD:
{in a higher pitch}
"—'cause I'm dead!"
MIKE:
Uh, talk to Ryan now, Strong Bad.
STRONG BAD:
Ryan, say something about that puffy cloud of perfume.
RYAN:
It's not penetrating... the defense.
STRONG BAD:
The— The stink-fense?
RYAN:
The stank.
MIKE:
That, uh, puffy perfume cloud used to have a face, and looked like a... much more of a human cloud, and we changed it.
STRONG BAD:
I'm so bored, you guys, of this cartoon.
RYAN:
{laughs}
Really?
STRONG BAD:
Really bored.
MIKE:
But look at this!
Football!
You like football, don't you?
Don't you watch football?
STRONG BAD:
I love that blacksmith, man!
The Blacksmith— why isn't The Blacksmith the star of everything?
Of, like, the world.
He should be the President, and the Universe, and, uh, Andre the Giant.
He should win all the high offices.
MIKE:
Andre the Giant's not a— that's not a— he's not an elected official.
"The Giant"— that was just a nickname.
STRONG BAD:
No, but it's Andre the Giant.
Who's like— Who's running for Andre the Giant this year?
MIKE:
Uh... King Kong Bundy?
STRONG BAD:
He'll— he— he can get it.
He's a contender.
MIKE:
Maybe... One Man Gang?
STRONG BAD:
Ooh.
MIKE:
So, they're all covered with dirt, right?
STRONG BAD:
No, dude.
That's wat-sit.
MIKE:
Wat-sit?
STRONG BAD:
Mm-hmm.
Disgusting wat-sit.
That's too bad.
I like the skulls in that dragon's eyes, though.
MIKE:
I wish that would— I hope that happens to me when I die.
STRONG BAD:
Yeah.
I want mine— eyes turning to Xs.
MIKE:
I hope my tongue comes out, too.
STRONG BAD:
Yeah.
That means you're dead.
MIKE:
Right.
