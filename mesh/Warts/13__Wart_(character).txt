#1 Legend Of Zelda
Release Date:1987           ESRB:E           System:NES        Rating:6.1/10
Due to space limitations,
The Legend of Zelda 's plot heavily relies on backstory given in the short in-game prologue and the instruction manual: [4]
Hyrule was engulfed in chaos after an army led by Ganon, the Prince of Darkness, invaded the kingdom and secured the
Triforce of Power , a magical artifact bestowing great strength. [5]
Hyrule's Princess Zelda split the artifact's counterpart, the Triforce of Wisdom, into eight fragments, hiding them in secret dungeons throughout the land to prevent them from falling into Ganon's hands. She commanded her most trustworthy nursemaid,
Impa , to escape and to find a man courageous enough to destroy Ganon. Upon hearing this, Ganon grew angry, imprisoned the princess, and sent a party in search of Impa. [5]
Link, carrying the many items he acquires in his quest.
According to the manual, Impa fled for her life but was overtaken by her pursuers. As Ganon's henchmen surrounded her, a youth appeared to drive the monsters off. The boy's name was
Link , and Impa told him of Hyrule's dilemma. [6]
Link resolves to save Zelda, but to fight Ganon he must find and reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom. Undeterred, Link sets off for Hyrule in an epic adventure. [6]
During the course of the game, Link locates the eight dungeons and retrieves the Triforce fragments from the clutches of powerful guardian monsters. Along the way, he picks up a collection of useful items and weapons, including the powerful Magical Sword (possibly the
Master Sword , according to the official
Zelda
website [7] ) to aid him against Ganon's minions. With the Triforce of Wisdom, Link is able to infiltrate Ganon's fortress high upon
Death Mountain . He confronts the Prince of Darkness himself, destroying him with a Silver Arrow which he had discovered deep within Ganon's dungeons. Link picks up the Triforce of Power from Ganon's ashes and returns both Triforces to Princess Zelda, whom he releases from her nearby cell. According to Zelda's words, peace would then return to Hyrule.
A symbol of callow youth and raw courage, [8]
Link was designed by Miyamoto as a coming-of-age motif for players to identify with: the silent protagonist begins the game an ordinary boy but grows in strength and fortitude to triumph over the ultimate evil. [9]
The name of the eponymous Zelda was inspired by
Zelda Fitzgerald : "Zelda was the name of the wife of the famous novelist
Francis Scott Fitzgerald . She was a famous and beautiful woman from all accounts, and I liked the sound of her name. So I took the liberty of using her name for the very first
Zelda
title," Miyamoto explained. [10]
Gameplay
Link battles three
Octoroks
in the
Overworld .
When
Zelda
was released, its gameplay defied categorization, incorporating elements from
action games ,
adventure games ,
computer role-playing games , and
computer puzzle games . The game begins with the player controlling Link, armed with a small shield. A sword is immediately available in a cave behind him. To advance, Link must explore the
overworld , a large outdoor map with varied environments. Scattered across the overworld and hidden in caves, shrubbery, or behind walls are merchants, gamblers, old ladies, and other people who guide Link with cryptic clues. Barring Link's progress are creatures he must battle to locate the entrances to nine underground dungeons.
Each dungeon is a unique, labyrinthine collection of rooms connected by doors and secret passages and guarded by monsters different from those found on the overworld. Link must navigate through each dungeon to obtain the eight pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom. Items, many required to complete his quest, are also stored in dungeons. The third dungeon, for example, contains a raft needed to reach the entrance to the fourth dungeon. Other accessories include upgrades for Link's sword and shield, bombs for uncovering secret caverns, a boomerang for retrieving items and freezing some enemies in their tracks, and a recorder with magical properties. The first six dungeons have visible entrances, but the remaining three are hidden. The order of completing the dungeons is arbitrary, but it is recommended to complete them in sequential order, because the higher the level number, the more difficult it is, but the final dungeon can only be entered after assembling the entire Triforce of Wisdom.
Nonlinearity, the ability to take different paths in completing the game, separated
Zelda
from its contemporaries. Link can freely wander the overworld, finding and buying items at any point. This flexibility enables unusual ways of playing the game; for example, it is possible to reach the final boss of the game (but not defeat him) without taking a sword. [4]
Nintendo's management initially feared that players may become frustrated with the new concept, left wondering what to do next.
After completing the game, the player has access to a more difficult quest, officially referred to as the Second Quest, [11]
where dungeons and the placement of items are different and enemies stronger. [11]
Although a more difficult "replay" was not unique to
Zelda , few games offered a "second quest" with entirely different levels to complete. [4]
This adds a great deal to the replay value of the game. Entering "ZELDA" as the player's name at the start of the game begins the second quest automatically. [12]
However, only the first five letters must be "ZELDA", there is still space for 3 more letters in the name. The Second Quest can be replayed each time it is completed
#2 Zelda 2:Adventure of link
Release Date:July 1988          ESRB:E              Rating:8.0/10          System:Nintendo entertainment system
Zelda II
has been seen as Nintendo's version of
Sleeping Beauty .
[1]
Shortly after the events of
The Legend of Zelda , near LinkĄŻs 16th birthday, he notices a strange mark on the back of his left hand. He seeks out Impa, and she tells him the Ą°Legend of Zelda.Ąą Long ago, a king ruled the land of
Hyrule
with a son and daughter. When the king died, the Triforce should have passed onto the Prince. However, he could only inherit the Triforce in part, and thus sought the remaining pieces. When he learned that Zelda knew of their location, he questioned her. She refused, and so the prince sent his wizard to question her. When he failed, the wizard became furious and cast a sleeping spell on Princess Zelda. The wizard fell dead, but the Prince was left grieving. The prince moved Zelda to a room in the North Castle and had her placed on a bed, hoping that one day she would awaken and return to life. To ensure this event was never forgotten, the Prince ordered all females born to the royal family from that point on to be named Zelda.
Impa also gives Link an old brown chest containing six crystals and an old message that claims that the restoration of the crystals to the six palaces in Hyrule will open the path to the Great Palace in the Valley of Death, where the Triforce of Courage is kept. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their places, defeating powerful palace guardians and learning magic spells to aid him as he seeks to find the Triforce of Courage and break the enchantment on the sleeping Zelda. Meanwhile, the henchmen of the slain
Ganon
are still seeking to murder Link. If they can obtain Link's blood and sprinkle it on Ganon's ashes, they would be able to resurrect their leader once again.
Link is able to place the six crystals in the palaces, crossing the sea by raft to the Eastern Continent of Hyrule in the process. With the crystals in place, the path to the Great Palace is opened, where Link defeats the great winged beast
Thunderbird , and a
doppelganger
of himself called
Dark Link . Link is then given the Triforce of Courage by a small old man within the palace. He returns to Zelda in the North Castle, who awakens and embraces Link as the curtains fall.
[
Gameplay
Zelda II
resembled the original very little. Rather than the top-down view of the previous title,
Zelda II
featured
side scrolling
areas within a larger world map. The game also incorporated a strategic combat system and more
RPG
elements, including an
experience points
system,
magic spells , and more interaction with non-player characters.
[
Experience levels
In this installment of the series, Link gains
experience points
to upgrade his attack, magic and
life points
by defeating
enemies . He can raise these areas to a maximum of eight levels. Raising a life level will decrease the damage Link receives, raising a magic level will decrease the cost of spells, and raising an attack level will strengthen his offensive power. Link can also find
Heart Containers
and
Magic Containers
that increase his
life points
or
magic points . Though Heart Containers appear in other
Zelda
games,
Zelda II
is the only game in the series that allows Link to build levels.
Like many other RPGs,
Zelda II
allows the player to fight weaker enemies to raise levels before tackling more difficult challenges. Most other games in the
Zelda
series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, defensive items, and Heart Containers. Unlike the majority of experience systems for other RPGs, Link can lose experience by being touched by certain enemies, though he will never drop to a previous experience level.
[ Overworld map and side-scrolling
The side view mode (GBA)
The second
Zelda
welcomes players to a two-mode world. The
overworld , which was previously where the majority of the action occurred, is still from a top-down perspective, but serves only a means to get from one place to another. Whenever Link is attacked or finds a place that can be explored, the game switches to a side-view mode. The palaces and towns are all viewed in this way as well. Likewise, if Link strays from the roads of the overworld (into a forest, desert, or swamp, for example) black enemy silhouettes appear and pursue him. If one is touched, a battle ensues in the side-scrolling mode. The fighting remains action-oriented, not menu-based like most RPGs, yet the separate modes for traveling and combat are very characteristic of traditional RPGs.
[ Combat system
Of the entire series, this
Zelda
installment is also distinguished for its relatively complex and strategic-minded combat system. It utilizes an expansive manual method of offensive and defensive techniques that include alternating between different positions which are standing (while neutral or running) and crouching, for defending against high and low attacks, respectively. Each combat encounter is a guaranteed struggle even against the weakest of opponents because there has to be switching from high and low attacks while keeping an eye on the opponent's next attack orientation. At times the AI of an opponent would cause it to guard only one direction to force the player to open up so it could get a free attack. For example, an
Iron Knuckle
would guard high while releasing a high attack and if the player attacked him low, the player would surely get hit because he was not guarding high on time for there to be a recovery of the player's low attack.
This gives the game a great deal of strategic gameplay since an enemy such as a Scrub or Tough has the chance of being victorious in beating the player, especially if attacking from both sides. This is quite different from the rest of the series where button-smashing and shield blocking are relied-upon combat maneuvers (holding up a shield, the player would remain impenetrable to his direct opponent.)
Zelda II
is arguably known as the toughest
Zelda
in its combat system due to these offensive and defensive capabilities.
[
Magic
In place of actively-used items,
The Adventure of Link
features spells for Link to use during action scenes. Each spell is learned from a wise man, each one in a different town. Before they teach Link their spells, he often has to complete sidequests such as retrieving lost items.
[ Versions
The Adventure of Link
was re-released in 2003 on the
The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition
disc for the
Nintendo GameCube , and again in 2004 as part of the " Classic NES Series " for
Game Boy Advance , with several changes. The death animation removed flashing colors in an effort to prevent
seizures . Several graphical and audio tweaks were made, and an enemy formerly titled Barba is named
Volvagia , keeping with the naming in the Japanese release.
#3 BS Zelda     Release Date:June 1990  Esrb:E    System:SNES/Broadcast Stellaview
The gameplay was identical to its predecessor, but the maximum
Rupees
was increased to allow you more than a thousand (rather than 255 as in
The Legend of Zelda ), the overworld was altered, and dungeons were completely different. There is some allusion to this game being a Ą°Third QuestĄą, much like
The Legend of Zelda ĄŻs
Second Quest .

[ The clock
The game was played in real-time. An onscreen clock showed the current time, and at various times on the clock certain events would happen. The game pauses for a moment before making a change. Sometimes the enemies are killed or stunned, sometimes a fairy appears, and occasionally the player is granted unlimited quantities of one of their items for a limited time. Bombs, boomerangs and candles can all be auto-upgraded this way, and will never run out of ammunition until the clock reaches the ending value, at which point the playerĄŻs bombs are returned to the amount they had before the unlimited amount was activated, or the boomerang will downgrade, or the candle will turn from red back to blue.
[ Presentation
The game was divided into four weekly episodes. These episodes were played live, at the same time as a videogame tips show was running on the satellite network (it probably contained ads and such to promote the games currently being played). Due to technical limitations, the download time was a whole seven minutes just for one episode.
[]
Character selection
The player could configure their name and gender in the
Satellaview
game-selection interface. This then carried across to the game. This was the third time a female character had been a playable protagonist in a Zelda game--the previous two occurrences having been in
Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon
and
Zelda's Adventure
(two of the three Zelda titles released for the
Philips
CD-I , wherein Princess Zelda herself was the playable character). The characters themselves are nameless in-game. In actuality, theyĄŻre SatellaviewĄŻs mascots, and Ą°come from another worldĄą in this game. These two characters would later reappear in
BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban , known as the Heroes of Light.
[
Live voice
BS ZeldaĄŻs implementation of Live Voice was significantly different to that in
BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban . When the clock hit certain times the game would pause and display Japanese writing onscreen (that apparently reads Ą°listenĄą), and the player would hear a narrator (apparently playing the part of the
Old Man , and allegedly the same voice actor as Sahasrahla) give a hint or suggestion. It is unknown as to how long these tips were, but under emulation the pauses are about two to three minutes long. After that time the text disappears and gameplay resumes as before.
[ Free gifts
In one issue of Nintendo Online Magazine, there is some allusion to players with good scores receiving free gifts (see
[1] ). The article states that players received a password that recorded the degree of completion of that dayĄŻs featured dungeon. Players would then submit this password to the company, with players who completed the most receiving prizes. Due to costs involved, it is assumed that the prizes were
Gashapon -style trinkets; many Zelda-themed merchandise items with unknown origins do exist, and some of these may originate from here. As a player had to be subscribed to the
St. GIGA
network to play, their mailing addresses would be known, and it is quite possible that these gifts were mailed. Still, information on this program has been very difficult to obtain, and its full extent might never be known.

Emulation
Due to the live nature of the game in its original incarnation, the gameĄŻs
ROM
could not be played properly on
emulators . Many hackers have since created
patches
that removed the gameĄŻs download pauses and time limits, pieced together all four episodes and given the game a title screen and file selection screen (both of which are reminiscent of the title screen and file selection screen from the original
Legend of Zelda ), all of which has ultimately allowed BS Zelda to be played as like a traditional, non-Satellaview game. Some patches have even replaced the gameĄŻs
protagonist
with
Link
himself, or allow the player to select Link or one of the gameĄŻs original characters via the file selection screen.

#4 Legend Of Zelda:A Link To The Past
Release Date: April 13 ,
1992         ESRB:E      RATING:8.5/10    System:SNES
Long before the period during which the game's events occur, stories were told in
Hyrule
about a
Golden Land , with unknown powers and controlled by an
omnipotent
and
omniscient
golden power; known as the
Triforce . Once the vile
Ganon
gets into the Golden Land, he holds the Triforce and turns it into the Dark World. To lock Ganon there, the Seven Wise Men, (Sages in the Game Boy Advance remake) created a seal to the Dark World, which can only be broken by the Sages or their descendants. This story became a legend, and it is told to the player as the game unfolds.
Right before the game starts,
Agahnim , who had achieved an important advisory role in the kingdom, gets rid of the King of Hyrule and starts searching for seven maidens, descendants of the sages, in order to send them to the Dark World and break the seal.
At the beginning of the game, a young boy named
Link
receives a
telepathic
message from a girl named
Princess Zelda . She says that she is locked in the
dungeon
of the castle, and Link goes to rescue her. On the way, however, Link finds his uncle severely wounded in the sewers, and receives his uncle's sword and shield before his uncle dies. Link and Zelda escape the castle via a
secret passageway
to a Sanctuary where Zelda stays while Link collects three pendants needed to free the
Master Sword
from its resting place.
Two ending scenes,
Princess Zelda
and other maidens at
Hyrule Castle
(left), and
Master Sword
back at the Pedestal (right).
Link retrieves the Master Sword only to learn that Zelda has been taken to the castle by Agahnim. Link goes to the castle to rescue her but arrives too late; she is the seventh girl Agahnim needed to break the seal. Zelda disappears into the Dark World and Link and Agahnim battle. Agahnim falls, but sends Link into the Dark World.
Once in the Dark World, Link finds himself standing atop the Pyramid of Power where Hyrule Castle stood in the Light World. The only way to destroy Ganon's Dark World (and subsequently save the once-peaceful Light World) is to defeat Ganon and take the Triforce from his clutches. In order to do that, Link must first rescue the maidens (including Zelda) from seven dungeons within the Dark World.
Once the girls have been freed, Link fights Agahnim one more time before confronting Ganon inside the Great Pyramid. As in the first Legend of Zelda game, Ganon can only be slain with the Silver Arrows. When Link touches the Triforce, his wishes cause the Dark World to disappear and peace returns to the Light World. With his quest completed, Link returns the Master Sword to its resting place.
[
Chronology
The true
chronology of the
Zelda
series
is an issue of much debate among fans. According to the text on the back of the game's packaging,
A Link to the Past
precedes the adventures of the Link and Princess Zelda from the NES games
The Legend of Zelda
and
Zelda II: The Adventure of Link .
The
Nintendo 64
game
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
arguably serves as a backstory to the events of this game. Several of the maidens that Link rescues in
A Link to the Past
describe Ganon's rise to power, and their stories contain many plot elements portrayed in
Ocarina of Time . One refers to him as a thief named "Ganondorf," the first time that he is called by that name in the series. In
Ocarina of Time , Ganondorf steals part of the Triforce, as chronicled in
A Link to the Past , and only after Link defeats him at the end of
Ocarina of Time
does he turn into "Ganon," the giant, pig-like monster that Link fights in
A Link to the Past . At the end of
Ocarina of Time , Ganon swears to Link that he will return one day to exterminate his descendants. These references likely place
A Link to the Past
after
Ocarina of Time
in the
Zelda
timeline. However, it is not clear how the Triforce ends up in the Sacred Realm with Ganon between the events of
Ocarina of Time
and
A Link to the Past .
[]
Characters
Link :
A young boy who lived with his uncle in a lone house outside of Hyrule Castle until one stormy night when he would be contacted telepathically by Princess Zelda. His uncle, also hearing the call, urged him to stay behind while he investigated the situation, yet Link followed and soon found his uncle on the brink of death within the castle walls. Realizing he was the princess' only hope, the aged swordsman bestowed upon Link the secret sword arts of their family before losing consciousness. Link's destiny was then revealed to be the protector of Zelda, and after her eventual re-capture by Agahnim, he was forced to enter the mysterious Dark World to rescue her and save Hyrule.
Princess Zelda :
As a descendant of the royal family of Hyrule, Zelda's ancestors were the very people who sealed away the fabled Golden Land years ago, and she has thus become a target of Agahnim as a catalyst for re-opening that very world. She is captured before the start of the game, yet is rescued by Link before she and the other maidens can be sent to the Dark World. After hiding in a church safe house while Link searches for the legendary Master Sword, Zelda is captured by Agahnim once again, and is at once sealed away in a magic crystal at the top of Death Mountain.
Agahnim :
A mysterious sorcerer who arrived at the Hyrule Kingdom not long before the beginning of the game. Although his motives were at first unclear, he gained favorable reputation with the royal family by ridding them of a number of problems plaguing their kingdom using unknown magic. He later developed an interest in the wise men who sealed away the mythical Golden Land ages ago, and realized that once this land was found, he could have all of its power for himself. He then placed a spell on the knights of the land, putting them under his direct control, and ordered them to find the descendants of these sages of lore, not the least of which was Princess Zelda herself. After murdering her father, King Hyrule, Agahnim was about to send Zelda to the Dark World when Link intervened, and escaped to the other world himself. Eventually Link returns to challenge him again in the Dark World, winning again and defeating Agahnim in the process. Link then learns that Ganon is the true enemy, and that he(Ganon) was merely possessing Agahnim to avoid suspicion. He is knocked out/off of Agahnim when Link defeats him(Agahnim) a second time.
Sahasrahla :
An aged, learned man who happens to be a descendant of the seven sages. Link meets him early in the game, and Sahasrahla informs him that in order to obtain the Master Sword, he must release its magical seal with the power of the three pendants. Whenever Link finds a Triforce-shaped glyph on a wall inside of a dungeon, Sahasrahla is able to communicate with him telepathically, and regularly offers advice on how to approach a certain situation. At the end of the game, he manages to return back home to the village, safe and sound.
Link's Uncle:
A former knight in service to the royal family of Hyrule, Link's uncle has been his caretaker for sometime, and taught him how to effectively use a sword. When he is summoned to the aid of the princess, he takes off for the castle, only to be critically wounded by the palace guards. He tells Link the secrets of his family's sword techniques, and urges him to protect Zelda. After Ganon is defeated, Link's uncle is shown to be alive and well.
Early in the game, Link's uncle says "Zelda is your..." before falling unconscious. This caused some people to speculate that the full sentence would have read "Zelda is your sister", possibly in relation to the film
Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi
(less popular sentence endings included "ally" and "only hope"). The Japanese version of the game confirms that the translation of the sentence should have read, "Zelda is your destiny". The later GBA release would alter the text to read "It is your destiny to save Zelda".
[]
Gameplay
Gameplay in both the Light and Dark Worlds.
Though not completely ignoring the changes made to the gameplay in
Zelda II ,
A Link to the Past
was largely a throwback to the original
Zelda . Instead of building on
Zelda II 's overhead/sidescrolling hybrid system,
A Link to the Past
returned to the original's formula of both exploration and combat taking place in the same environment, with an overhead perspective.
A Link to the Past
also did away with the RPG-style leveling system implemented in
Zelda II , but retained some elements of the game's magic system.
The overall control of Link is more flexible than in previous games, as he could now walk diagonally instead of just vertically and horizontally. And for the first time, he slashed his sword sideways instead of merely thrusting it forward like before. This gave his sword attacks a broader range and made combat easier. Link continued slashing his sword as the default attack in future Zelda games (although thrusting was also a possible attack in the later 3D incarnations).
A number of new items and techniques were created for this game, many of which would continue to appear in later incarnations of the series. Such items include the Hookshot, the Master Sword, and the Pegasus Boots. The Heart Containers that increased the player's maximum life points in the earlier two games are present, but many are split into
pieces of heart , four of which make up one Heart Container. Most of them are hidden, adding replay value to the game. Another innovation was the multi-level dungeon, which allowed for Link to traverse up and down floors, and even fall through holes in a floor to land in lower levels.
A Link to the Past
is also the first appearance of what would later become a major
Zelda
trademark: the existence of two parallel worlds that the player can travel between. The first, called the Light World, is the ordinary
Hyrule
where Link grew up with his uncle. The second was once the Sacred Realm, but became a corrupted version of Hyrule called the Dark World because of changes made by Ganon's evil power. Everything in the Light World (Hyrule) looks fairly normal, while the Dark World is true to its name by being creepy and depressing ĄŞ the water is a dull shade, the grass is dead, there are skulls everywhere, and the trees have distorted faces. People even change forms when entering the Dark World, based on their nature. Each location in the Light World corresponds to a similar location in the Dark World, usually with a similar physical structure but sometimes with an opposite nature (e.g. a desert in the Light World corresponds to a Dark World swamp).
Unlike
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time , where there is only one location at which Link can travel back and forth in time,
A Link to the Past
allows Link to travel from the Dark World to the Light World at almost any outside location by using a magical mirror. Once in the Light World, the player can only return to the Dark World by stepping into the stationary portal created by the mirror or by finding other hidden warp locations. This flexibility enabled a variety of puzzles that exploited slight differences between the Light and Dark Worlds.
[
Development
At the time, most
SNES
game cartridges had 4 Mbit (512 KB) of memory. This game broke the trend by using 8 Mbit (1 MB), allowing the Nintendo development team to create a remarkably expansive world for Link to inhabit. Like
Super Mario World , this game used a simple graphic
compression
method on the
SNES
by limiting the color depth of many (but not all) tiles to 8 colors instead of the SNES's native 16-color tiles. The tiles were decompressed at runtime by simply adding a leading zero or one bit to each pixel's color index. Memory was saved by eliminating duplication: The Light World and the Dark World are almost identical and only the differences were saved, otherwise they would have needed to wait for a 16 Mbit ROM.
A Link to the Past , like the previous two entries in the series on the NES, featured a counter that registers how many times you died on your file. (With some work, you can finish the game with 000). This total is featured in the ending sequence upon finishing the game. However, the SNES version added to the counter every time the user selects "Save and Quit", so the only way to achieve 000 is to go through the whole game without dying or powering off the system. The GBA remake fixed this, such that saving and quitting does not advance the counter.
The
English language
localization
includes a number of changes to the original Japanese game. The most common type of change was the removal of religious references to conform with Nintendo of America's content guidelines. The most obvious change was made to the subtitle of the game, which was changed from
Triforce of the Gods
to
A Link to the Past . The font used in the game to represent an unreadable language, Hylian, originally had designs of a
vulture
and an
ankh . These designs were based on
Egyptian hieroglyphs
which carry religious meanings, and were altered in the English version. The localization also made changes to plot included in the
manual . The
priest
Agahnim became a
wizard , and his background, which originally implied that he was sent by the gods, was altered to remove any celestial origin.
Front cover to the official soundtrack,
The Legend of Zelda: Sound & Drama .
[
Music
The score to
A Link to the Past
was composed by
Koji Kondo . The overworld theme of the original
Legend of Zelda , (the
Hyrule Overture ) was carried over to
A Link to the Past
and played in the Light World, redone in
SPC700
style. The game introduces several musical sub-themes to the series, such as the
Theme of Princess Zelda (Zelda's Lullaby) , the
Royal Family Theme (Hyrule Castle) ,
Kakariko Village
and the
Select Screen / Fairy Cave . Each of these tunes was reused in later games of the series.
[ Chris Houlihan room
The Chris Houlihan Room
The
Chris Houlihan Room
is a secret room in the game. Chris was a
Nintendo Power
subscriber who won a contest in which the winner's name would be included in a secret room in the game. In the Super NES version, the room can be accesed by entering the hole under the bush near the castle wall within the first few seconds of starting a saved game file. Several other locations have been reported as potential entrances to the room, as the game program sends the player to Chris's room whenever an error condition occurs when loading the next screen. It is not present in any future builds of the game, or in any version of the Japanese builds.
The Chris Houlihan room has a message on a tile on the wall, and 45 blue rupees (225 rupees total). It can be entered many times, but the rupees can only be taken once. After going out of the room, you will be transported to the outside of Link's uncle's house, even when you entered the secret room in the Dark World. In the
Game Boy Advance
port, the message is changed.
[
Versions
A Link to the Past
was also made available for the
Satellaview , the Japanese add-on for the
Super Famicom . The game was completely unchanged, except for being converted into a downloadable format. A Satellaview-exclusive sequel,
BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban , was released in Japan in
1997 .
In 2002,
Capcom
ported
A Link to the Past
to the
Game Boy Advance . The Game Boy Advance version was released in North America on
2 December
2002
and in Japan on
13 March
2003 . This port was packaged with a Capcom-developed multiplayer
Zelda
game called
Four Swords . The two games worked together; extra features could be unlocked in one game by completing tasks in the other. Additions to
A Link to the Past
include voice clips, an additional dungeon, an additional end sequence for clearing the new dungeon, and the ability to unlock a continuous spin slash attack. Other changes include an easier puzzle in the fifth dungeon of the Dark World and a text overhaul.
[]
Reception
A Link to the Past
was critically acclaimed upon release and has since been recognized as one of
the greatest video games of all time . It is noted for its exceptionally long stay on
Nintendo Power 's top games list: when the SNES list was finally retired,
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
had more than five consecutive years in the number one spot.
[ Legacy
A Link to the Past
established several recurring elements in the
Zelda
series, such as the
Master Sword ,
Sacred Realm
(the Golden Land), and Cuccos.

The next
Zelda
title,
The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening
was released in 1993 for the Nintendo
Game Boy . It retained many of
A Link to the Past 's gameplay mechanics including the top-down perspective. It is a direct chronologic sequel to
A Link to the Past

Further information:
Manga from The Legend of Zelda series
A
comic book
miniseries by
Shotaro Ishinomori
based on
Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
appeared in
Nintendo Power
magazine beginning in
January 1992 , and ran for 12 issues. Many portions of the game were omitted, and several new story segments were added.
In the manga, a new character named Roam was introduced who was a knight with the ability to take on an
avian
form. While at first meeting Link as an enemy, the two quickly became allies and joined forces to help take down Ganon. Roam has a large nose, a common trait in Shotaro's designs.
Another manga written by the same writers who wrote the 'Ocarina Of Time' and 'Majora's Mask' manga. It was only released in Japan and introduced a new character called 'Ganty'. She was a thief with a single devil's horn and a star under her eye. This manga had a more 'beautiful' style then the Shotaro Ishinomori manga and the plot was a bit more faithful to the game then Shotaro's, however it was not completely faithful to the game.
[ Soundtrack
A soundtrack to
A Link to the Past , entitled
The Legend of Zelda: Sound and Drama
was released in Japan. All of the game's themes are featured, and a bonus track is also included. The soundtrack has 2 disks, with disc one being 44 minutes long and disk two plays lasting 54 minutes.

Trivia
Mario
makes a cameo appearance in the game, appearing in paintings hanging inside certain houses. A
Chain Chomp
also makes a appearance inside the 7th Dungeon in the Dark World.
In recent years a Japanese commercial of the game has become famous for its quirkiness. In the commercial a large cast of characters from the game are seen dancing (similar to
Michael Jackson 's
Thriller ) while a pop song plays in the background. Link (who is allegedly played by a woman) soon uses his spin attack to block a fireball and rescue Zelda as Ganon appears, leading to more dancing until the end of the commercial. The television show
X-Play
commented that it is one of their all-time favorite commercials from Japan.
[1]
. It is also similar to the ending sequence of the
DCOM
High School Musical
( We're all in this Together )
The Legend of Zelda: LinkĄŻs Awakening
( ĽźĽëĽŔ¤ÎťŐh ô¤ň¤ß¤ëu ,
Zeruda no Densetsu Yume o Miru Shima ? , lit. "The Legend of Zelda: Dreaming Island")
is an
adventure
video game
developed by
Nintendo
and released for the
Game Boy
in
1993 . It is the first game from the
Legend of Zelda
series
to appear on a
handheld game console .
A remake called
The Legend of Zelda: LinkĄŻs Awakening DX
( ô¤ň¤ß¤ëuDX ,
The Legend of Zelda: LinkĄŻs Awakening DX ? )
for the
Game Boy Color
was released in
1998 . The latter is compatible with the
Game Boy Printer
and features a new color-based dungeon. It can be played on a regular Game Boy, but the new dungeon and printing features are inaccessible.
This is the first game in the series to take place outside
Hyrule
and the main Ą° Triforce Ąą storyline. This is also one of the few
Zelda
games not to feature
Princess Zelda
at all.
Link on his ship in the opening scene of the
DX
version
After training abroad,
Link
is sailing back to Hyrule, but is shipwrecked in a violent storm. He awakens on
Koholint Island , and is taken to the house of a kind man named
Tarin , and his daughter
Marin
(who bears a strong resemblance to
Princess Zelda ). A mysterious owl tells Link that to return home, he must awaken the Wind Fish by gathering and playing the eight Instruments of the Sirens. The bosses in
LinkĄŻs Awakening , who guard the SirensĄŻ Instruments, are said to be the Nightmares of the Wind Fish. When Link plays the
Ballad of the Wind Fish
with all eight Instruments, he can enter the giant egg atop Mt. Tamaranch, where the Wind Fish slumbers. There he must face the final Nightmare, shadowy apparitions which include umbral visions of foes from LinkĄŻs past. Upon defeat of this nightmare, it is revealed that the entire island is merely a dream of the Wind Fish. By playing the instruments again, Link ends the dream. He and the Wind Fish are returned to the waking world.
[ edit ]
Gameplay
As all games are in the
Legend of Zelda
series,
LinkĄŻs Awakening
is an
action-adventure game . Being played from a viewpoint above the playfield looking down at Link and his surroundings, it followed its closest relative from the
Legend of Zelda
line of games,
A Link to the Past , in its sense of gameplay and the possible actions that could be performed in the game.
LinkĄŻs Awakening
was the first of the topview games in the series to feature jumping and platformer action scenes. The treasure caves from
Legend of Zelda
(platformer scenes seen from the side found in dungeons where treasures lay hidden) make a cameo appearance in LinkĄŻs Koholint adventure, and other side-view scenes were added also to make full use of LinkĄŻs new jumping abilities. Also appearing for the first time in a
Zelda
game were
fishing , and flying around using a
cucco .
LinkĄŻs Awakening
was also the first Zelda game where both buttons could be assigned to different items, neither of which had to be the sword, wheras previously one button was the sword by default.
In addition, this is the first
Zelda
game to include a "trading sequence"
side quest . This minigame consists of trading a series of otherwise useless items, and lasts for most of the game. The last item, however, is useful: a mermaid scale that the user can put on the mermaid statue in Martha's Bay (need Hookshot to get to it). This reveals a cave, and inside is the Magnifying Glass, which can be used to read the library book in small print. This opens up a hidden cave in Toronbo Shores, and inside one can find the boomerang, the game's most powerful weapon.
[ edit ]
Development
Title screen of
Link's Awakening
The graphic style was developed in a similar style to that of a
cartoon , with the
intro
and ending utilizing nearly fullscreen comic stillframes. The music was composed by
Yuichi Ozaki ,
Kazumi Totaka ,
Minako Hamano , and
Kazue Ishikawa . This was the first
Zelda
game to feature different background music for each major dungeon.
[ edit ]
Versions
In 1998,
LinkĄŻs Awakening
was re-released as
The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX
for the
Game Boy Color
on a
black hybrid cartridge
that is also compatible with the original Game Boy. This was one of the few
deluxe
versions of Game Boy games, along with
Wario Land II DX ,
Tetris DX ,
Super Mario Bros. DX
and the cancelled
Metroid II: Return of Samus DX
and
KirbyĄŻs Dream Land 2 DX .
One addition to the
DX
version was the entirely new color dungeon. The color dungeon made use of the
Game Boy Color ĄŻs capabilities to deliver puzzles based on color. Once the player beat the dungeon, Link was given the choice of a Red Tunic or a Blue Tunic. The Red Tunic allowed Link to become more powerful (the equivalent of always holding a Piece of Power), while the Blue Tunic raised his defense (the equivalent of always holding a Guardian Acorn).
Another new feature of the
DX
version was a Camera Shop and photo album. Certain actions trigger cutscenes in which the Camera Shop owner would appear and take a picture. The pictures could be viewed in the playerĄŻs photo album at the Camera Shop, and printed using the
Game Boy Printer . This feature included the addition of an invisible Zora in the Animal Village as one of the triggers.
The
DX
version also contains a
Super Game Boy
enhanced border and color palette. The original game does not have those features, since it was released a year before the peripheral.
[ edit ]
Reception
IGN gave
Link's Awakening
a 10, citing its excellent gameplay. [1]
Link's Awakening DX
was well received on the market and was able to outsell the successful
Pok¨Śmon
games in Japan for a brief time.
[ edit ]
Trivia
Link's Awakening
stands out among the
Zelda
titles in its lightheartedness and humor. Contributing to this atmosphere, many characters from other Nintendo games make cameo appearances in Link's journey.
Bow-Wow, the Chain-Chomp, tied to a post
A
Chain Chomp
from
Super Mario Bros. 3
appears in this game as a domesticated pet in Mabe Village named Ą°Bow-WowĄą, who assists Link at one point in the game. Smaller Ą°puppyĄą Chomps are also present in the vicinity of Bow-WowĄŻs doghouse, one of which can talk and contributes to the trading sequence. Chain Chomps did appear previously as enemies in
A Link to the Past .
Various other
enemies from the
Mario
series
appear throughout the game, including
Goombas ,
Thwomps ,
Boos ,
Cheep-Cheeps , Bloopers, Pokeys, Bob-Ombs,
Shy Guys ,
Piranha Plants , Podoboos, and Sparks.
Princess Peach
of the
Mario
series appears in a picture sent to Mr. Write by his pen-pal.
Yoshi
appears as a doll. The doll is the first item collected in the trading game.
Wart
from the United States version of
Super Mario Bros. 2
appears in a cave beneath the Signpost Maze as Mamu (his Japanese name). This is Wart's only appearance outside of
SMB2
and both games take place in a "dream world".
In the EagleĄŻs Tower, there is an enemy called an Anti-Kirby (an evil version of the Nintendo character
Kirby ), who will try to suck Link up into his mouth as he passes by.
Richard , a character from the Japanese Game Boy game
Kaeru No Tame Ni Kane Wa Naru
(translated as
A Bell Tolls for the Frog ) makes a deal with Link for the Slime Key. A remixed version of the main theme from his game plays in Richard's villa.
Mr. Write , a character based on
The Sims
creator
Will Wright , from the SNES version of
SimCity
and
SimCity 64
(Japan-Only) makes an appearance in the trading sequence. Called Ą°Mr. WriteĄą in this game, his
Sim City
theme music plays in his house.
Totaka's Song
can be heard in this game after waiting two and a half minutes in Richard's villa. This song first appeared in
Mario Paint , and showed up in many games whose music was composed by
Kazumi Totaka .
In
Majora's Mask , Link performs the ballad of the Windfish using all of the instruments acquired in that game.

( BSĽźĽëĽŔ¤ÎťŐh šĹ´ú¤ÎĘŻąP ,
BS Zeruda no Densetsu Kodai no Sekiban ? , lit. "The Legend of Zelda: The Ancient Stone Tablets")
is a video game developed by
Nintendo
for the
Satellaview , a
Japanese -only attachment for the
Super Famicom . The game was broadcast in 1997 and again in 1998.
BS stands for
Broadcast Satellaview ; the Satellaview unit is comonly referred to as the BS-X. Using this addon, gamers could download the game from the BS-5 channel of
St. GIGA 's satellite radio network and save it onto either the BS-X base unit's
flash-RAM
(included) or a BS-X Special Broadcast Cassette (an additional purchase or
prize ).
[ edit ]
Storyline
In the context of the game, the player "come[s] from another world" and is referred to as the Hero or Heroine of Light (the original Japanese this title is genderless). This was the fourth time a female character had been a playable protagonist in a Zelda game.
Spoiler warning :
Plot and/or ending details follow.
At the end of the game, the hero solemnly places the Master Sword in its pedestal to rest once more, and then vanishes. They have gone back into their own world whence they came. They saved all of Hyrule, and the others did not even know their name (characters in the game never refer to the player by their name despite entering it at the BS-X BIOS screen). Sahasrahla walks off. Zelda walks away, turns to take one last look back, and then she too departs (whether this ending scene was voice acted is unknown).
Spoilers end here.
[ edit ]
Gameplay
Gameplay in
Kodai no Sekiban .
The game and its gameplay was mostly identical to
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
(hereafter abbreviated
ALttP ), which it is modified from. It is similar to a " second quest " or " Master Quest ".
Many gameplay mechanics were tidied up. The most notable change was to the Pegasus Boots; the player could now change directions when running with the Boots, and could also move between rooms and screens without automatically stopping as in
ALttP . The dungeon items were also changed. Instead of three pendants and seven crystals the player now collected the titular Ancient Stone Tablets, of which there were only eight.
Bombable walls, which in
ALttP
were noticeably cracked, are in this game completely invisible. Only prodding with a sword will lead to their discovery by making a hollow ringing sound. Each and every bombed-out area rewarded the player with
Rupees , or pots containing bomb and arrow refills, and so on. Sometimes the wall concealed an "Upgrade Thief"; the thieves who in
ALttP
knocked into the player and stole the items they dropped now appeared in a helper role; he would upgrade their maximum of one ammo type (either bombs or arrows, each thief only upgrades one type, and once only), but for a cost. The price increased as the player progressed through the game. When discovered in caves found on the overworld, these thieves gave out large quantities of Rupees.
[ edit ]
Presentation
The game was divided into four weekly episodes. These episodes were played live, and a video game advice show simultaneously ran on the satellite network, possibly containing advertisements that promoted the games currently being played.
Overworld week 1
Overworld week 2
Overworld week 3
Overworld week 4
In each week the player could only access certain portions of the
overworld . Areas shrouded in clouds were unreachable. Two
dungeons
were accessible per week, however the episode ended only when time expired, not when the player had completed all the objectives for that week. In the meantime, the player could complete sidequests and hunt for Rupees, bottles, and Pieces of Heart. Once they acquired certain key dungeon items, new areas of the overworld become available. For example, once a player has the Magic Hammer, he or she can knock previously unpassable pegs into the ground, allowing access to the area it blocked. At one point in the game large and heavy rocks lie in the hero's path; when he or she acquires various types of Gloves he or she can lift some or all of these rocks and throw them out of the way.
[ edit ]
Live Voice
All cutscenes were fully voice acted, live, much like a radio play. The players constantly heard the "narrator" (playing the part of the voice of Sahasrahla, a character from
ALttP ) give various tips and hints during play. During the final minutes his statements become more demanding and forceful as time was running out.
The non-mandatory sidequests were also fully voice-acted [ citation needed ] ; however since the player could come across that event at any point rather than at a forced time, and there was no viable way for the console to convey proximity information to the voice acting center, it is assumed that the voice actor for that character kept saying their script over and over for the entirety of the designated time (they can each be saved from about 18:43 until 18:56), whether any player was actually on the same screen (and thus in "earshot") or not.
The
Zelda no Video
documentary shows several minutes of Live Voice-enhanced gameplay in action, both of the opening cutscenes and of a sidequest, with the voice actor for
Princess Zelda
calling for help desperately (and very realistically) for the entirety of the clip.
[ edit ]
Character selection
Satellaview
players configured a profile and gender using its game-selection interface. This information then carried across to the games, where they are represented by the unnamed Satellaview mascots. In the case of this game, the female character was the ALttP Link model with hair replacing the traditional green hat, while the male character was Link with a baseball cap.
[ edit ]
Real-time clock
The game was played in real-time. Each episode was one whole hour, and so the gameplay was intense and compressed, with cutscenes in between. However, the game in its entirety took one hour, that means the cutscenes counted as part of the gameplay time.
There were several optional sidequests available, each with its own mostly text-only cutscene (they were not activated at any set time so could not feasibly feature live voice) [ citation needed ] , the completion of which netted a score bonus and some Rupees, but getting this reward meant deviating and delays while reading through all the thanks responses, thus shortening the available game time even further. The player could also choose to bomb walls and explore caves and find countless chests full of Rupees (and, in turn, get points for opening them). While doing these sidequests netted more points for players hoping to win prizes, every minute of delay subtracted points from the value of that week's Tablets, and if the player got lost or waylaid in the dungeon or overworld and ran out of time it is assumed that they got nothing at all (judging by the specific wording of the "bad ending" scene in week 4).
Unlike other games where any clock feature stops when the player open a menu or pause it, in this game the clock kept on ticking no matter what. The enemies and everything else in the world as a whole do pause when the item menu opens, but the clock does not. So the player could not leave it paused and go off to the bathroom or get a snack or something like that, he or she
had
to keep playing or he or she would lose precious time.
The clock affected gameplay enormously. At particular times on the clock various things might happen: health-restoring fairies appear, a Bombos or Ether magic attack destroys enemies onscreen, the player gets unlimited bombs or arrows or magic or can shoot magic rings from their sword, etc. An enormous variety of things could happen each week, and the events and the times they occur vary between weeks.
At a different time each week, fog descended on the overworld. A few minutes afterward a thunderstorm would break loose, restricting exploration by defusing any bombs and increasing the difficulty by replacing any normal overworld (i.e. not in a dungeon) enemies with
Zoras , fierce lizard-like creatures that home in on the player and could not be stunned with the Boomerang like their
ALttP
forefathers. After a few minutes the rain and thunder cleared leaving. The fog remained, although it too disappeared shortly after.
[ edit ]
Rental shops
ALttP
veterans may notice many changes to the overworld, most notably the additions of many rental shops. At these a player can purchase a sword upgrade (unless he or she already has the L-4 sword) or a Shovel (unless he or she already has it), for 100 Rupees each. However these items are
rented , as the title indicates, for only ten minutes, so the player must make the most of them in order to make his or her purchase worthwhile.
It was most advisable to buy the Shovel, because with it the player could dig for a hidden Piece of Heart; there were an even number of these in each week, and the dug-up ones could not be retrieved in later weeks, so if the player intended to have the maximum hearts when he or she faced
Ganon
he or she needed to buy a shovel and get digging. The first time a shovel was rented each week, the shop owner marked the location of the digging spot on the map. Each week this could be one of four different locations, and the locations that are randomly chosen between change from week to week.
Since the Shovel could now dig up Rupees almost anywhere in the overworld - it couldn't in
ALttP
- it became a very lucrative way to fill up any spare time before the gameplay hour ended.
[ edit ]
Mole
The Mole is a strange character unique to this game. At a certain time he will burrow out somewhere (the location is different from week to week). If the player talks to him he or she will get 10,000 points, but then he burrows down once more. If the player can again locate his diggings, he or she will find he has discovered a Rupee treasure trove. He will have opened a cave containing six treasure chests, and the quantity of Rupees found inside increases for each successive week.

Scoring and prizes

Rescuing someone

Talking to the Mole

Tablet
40,000 points*
Each event on their journey, both major and minor, will net the player points. Every event in the chart to the right has a score value associated with it. The scores add up, so a chest will give points to the player, even if it contains a points-bearing item in turn. However, 500 points are deducted from the player's score for every minute that passes (including the six minutes before play starts).
Strangely enough, there are no points given for collecting Rupees, slaying enemies, or defeating bosses. The items the player acquires after defeating bosses
do
give points.
There is no feasible score limit; while the game allows for 8 digits worth of scoring, there is no way a player can ever reach this even if they do absolutely everything and collect the tablets as soon as possible. This is because the amount of score-giving items in the game world are strictly finite; there is thus no way to discover what the game would do if the score was surpassed.
While scoring had absolutely no effect on gameplay whatsoever, there were other post-game benefits. At the end of each hour of play the gamer was given a score readout. By submitting these game high scores (probably a coded password sent by mail, but perhaps sent directly via the satellite link) his or her score would be recorded. If the player scored high enough, he or she might receive a free gift, such as a phonecard or flash-cart.
[ edit ]
Replaying the game
Because the Live Voice content was absolutely central to gameplay (and was not stored on the base unit or flash-RAM cartridge in any way whatsoever) and also due to the fact that the timer was based on a real-time clock set by the satellite itself, this game could not be played whenever the player chose like some of the other BS-X games, but only during the set hours. The game would not run outside these broadcast times. The game was rebroadcast in the following year, but other than that the game was rendered completely unplayable (until the advent of
emulation ). It is possible to play the entire game in four separate parts (sans the cutscenes and voice acting) using the latest version of SNES9x. A certain patch must be applied to each part in order for the game(s) to be playable. Nintendo has yet to include
Kodai no Sekiban
in any collection of Zelda re-releases, nor has it become completely available in emulated form.

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
( ĽźĽëĽŔ¤ÎťŐh r¤ÎĽŞĽŤĽęĽĘ ,
Zeruda no Densetsu Toki no Okarina ? )
is a
video game
for the
Nintendo 64
console . It is the fifth game in
The Legend of Zelda
series , the first of the series to be released on the Nintendo 64. It was released in Japan on
November 21
1998 . It was followed by a direct sequel,
Majora's Mask .
The story follows a young boy called
Link , whose adventure begins when he is called by the
Great Deku Tree
and given a great quest. Link discovers he must stop the evil
Ganondorf
from obtaining the legendary
Triforce , an object that can be used to control the land of
Hyrule , where the game is set. During his journey, Link is helped by the
fairy
Navi
and
Princess Zelda , a member of Hyrule's Royal Family. He must also travel through time, interact with various races and beings, and gain numerous weapons and items.
Within six months of its release,
Ocarina of Time
sold over five million copies [2] , and over 8.6 million copies have been sold worldwide
[3] . In addition to its commercial success,
Ocarina of Time
is also frequently ranked as the
greatest video game ever made [4] , due to its groundbreaking graphics, free roaming gameplay, original puzzles and epic storyline
Ocarina of Time
is a third-person adventure game which takes place in the fictional kingdom of
Hyrule . As in previous
Zelda
games, Hyrule takes the form of a large, fully connected overworld containing several dungeons ĄŞ large self-contained areas with a single entrance in the overworld. Within most dungeons, Link must battle and puzzle his way through, finding items such as a Dungeon Map and Compass to aid him. A dungeon typically contains a special weapon, often needed to defeat the
boss
at the end, which can be reached by finding the Boss Key and using it on the door to the boss's lair.
Ocarina
has nine major dungeons (ten if you split the Spirit Temple into present and future): Inside the Deku Tree, Dodongo's Cavern, Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly, the Forest Temple, the Fire Temple, the Water Temple, the Shadow Temple, the Spirit Temple, and Ganon's Castle, in intended order of completion. It is possible, however, to complete the Water Temple before completing the Fire Temple, and the Spirit Temple before the Shadow Temple. Interestingly enough, the first three dungeons require no Small Keys or Boss Keys whatsoever. The first three dungeons each yield a Spiritual Stone; the next five, a Medallion representing an awakened Sage. There are also three mini-dungeons: the Ice Cavern, the Bottom of the Well, and the Gerudo Training Ground, which yield useful items. However, it is not necessary to complete the Gerudo Training Ground, or even enter.

Items
Main article:
The Legend of Zelda series weapons and items
Music plays a considerable part in the gameplay of
Ocarina . The titular Ocarina of Time is a magical wind instrument on which melodies can be played at any time except on bosses (to prevent teleporting out) to various effects - changing day to night, causing rain to fall, warping to new locations and so on. A total of twelve songs can be found throughout the game. In addition, the gamer is free to play any notes they wish with the ocarina. The ocarina was able to play most musical notes with considerable accuracy. Magazines at the time, including
Nintendo: The Official Magazine
routinely published combinations to mimic famous theme tunes such as
The Simpsons .
Reappearing from
A Link to the Past
is the
Master Sword , a legendary blade with the power to repel evil. In this game it can be used to travel through time in the Temple of Time, though it is primarily used for regular combat.
Many other items also appear. Link is able to use different tunics, boots, swords and shields. Items re-used from other
Zelda
games, including magic arrows (fire, ice and light), bombs, and the Hookshot, appear alongside new items such as the Lens of Truth, which shows things which are otherwise invisible and the Longshot, a longer reaching version of the Hookshot.

The kingdom of Hyrule is connected to a mythical Sacred Realm which holds the
Triforce , an object left behind by the creator goddesses of Hyrule after they finished creating it. The Triforce is capable of granting whoever holds it their heart's every desire. The Triforce, and Hyrule's door into the Sacred Realm, are protected by the Door of Time in the Temple of Time, which was built many ages ago by a group of ancient Sages.

enemies
The Kingdom of Hyrule is inhabited by six different humanoid races.
The
Hylians
look basically human, except for their pointed, elf-like ears. They mostly live in
Hyrule Castle
Town, though some live in nearby Kakariko Village and others are scattered sporadically throughout Hyrule. They are ruled by a king (present but out of frame in the game), whose daughter is
Princess Zelda .
The
Kokiri
are forest children who were created by the guardian spirit of
Kokiri Forest , the
Great Deku Tree . They never age and can never leave the forest.
Link , the hero of the game, lives among them at the start of the game. His closest friend is a Kokiri named
Saria . Link is not a true Kokiri but a Hylian, orphaned in the forest as a baby, and raised by the Great Deku Tree, who sensed Link to be a child of destiny. The Kokiri are led by
Mido .
The
Gorons
are large, brown, rock-eating creatures that vary immensely in size and live in
Goron City , halfway up
Death Mountain , an active volcano. They are led by
Darunia .
The
Zoras
are blue fish-like creatures, who live at the top of Zora's River, the kingdom's source of water. The river runs all the way through Hyrule to Lake Hylia at the very opposite end of the kingdom. The Zoras are ruled by
King Zora
(who, unlike most Zoras, happens to be enormously fat) who has a daughter,
Princess Ruto . The guardian spirit of Zora's River is
Lord Jabu-Jabu , an immense fish.
The
Sheikah , sworn "shadow guardians" of the royal family, appear to be
Hylian
with red eyes. They possess various magical abilities and are known to operate from within the shadows.
Impa , Zelda's childhood nanny and bodyguard, is said to be the last remaining Sheikah. She helped establish
Kakariko Village , at the base of
Death Mountain .
The
Gerudo
are an almost entirely female race of thieves who live in the desert to the west. Only one man is born to the Gerudo every hundred years, and he is supposed to become their king. The most recent of these is
Ganondorf , a man with black armor and "evil eyes" who acts as adviser to the king of Hyrule. Ganondorf is the primary antagonist of the game. The Gerudo, however, are supposedly led by
Nabooru , who refuses to acknowledge Ganondorf as her king.
Other notable characters in the game include Link's fairy companion
Navi , his horse
Epona , the twin witches
Twinrova
(named Koume and Kotake), Zelda's alter-ego
Sheik , and ranch hands
Talon ,
Malon
and
Ingo . Talon and Malon are highly reminiscent of the characters Marin and Tarin in the previous title in the series,
The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.

Story
In the outset of his journey, Link approaches the Great Deku Tree.
The game opens with Link dreaming about standing in front of Hyrule Castle on a stormy night, seeing a young girl being carried away on horseback, pursued by a dark stranger. While Link sleeps, the
Great Deku Tree , guardian of the
Kokiri Forest
where Link lives, is talking to the fairy
Navi . The tree reveals that Link's destiny is to save Hyrule, and Navi must guide him. Navi summons Link to see the Deku Tree, and he arrives after convincing Mido, the
Kokiri
tribe leader, to let him pass.
The tree tells Link that it is cursed and dying. Link enters the massive tree through its trunk and battles many foul creatures, including an enormous spider named
Queen Gohma . Though the curse is now broken, the Deku Tree is beyond saving. It tells Link of a man in black armor who cast the dreadful curse upon him. It also gives Link the Kokiri Emerald, the Spiritual Stone of the forest, and sends him to meet
Princess Zelda
at
Hyrule Castle . As Link begins his journey, his closest friend
Saria
wishes him luck.
En route, Link meets a strangely wise owl named Kaepora Gaebora, who offers advice. Link is able to find a secret passage into Hyrule Castle and sneaks past the guards to find Zelda. She tells Link that she has been having dreams about the future of Hyrule that she believes are prophetic, and that she foresaw Link's arrival. She believes that Ganondorf, the king of the
Gerudo
thieves, is trying to obtain an item known as the
Triforce , a legendary item rumored to be so powerful that anyone who possesses it can control the world. It is also revealed that it was he who laid a curse on the Deku Tree. The Triforce is held in another dimension called the " Sacred Realm ", which is secured by the
Master Sword
in its pedestal in the nearby Temple of Time. To keep the Triforce from Ganon, Zelda tells Link that he must obtain three sacred stones, of which Link's Kokiri Emerald is one, to unlock the Master Sword and open the Realm. Link is safely led out of the castle by Zelda's attendant,
Impa .
Link heads first to
Goron
City on Death Mountain, home to a race of large rock-eating creatures, where the Spiritual Stone of Fire is located. The Goron leader,
Darunia , tells him that Ganondorf had already visited the Gorons and their city, and that he has blockaded the
Dodongo 's Cavern, the source of the Gorons' food. Link manages to enter the cavern, where slays the mighty King Dodongo. Darunia is so relieved when he hears that the Gorons can eat again that he hands over the spiritual stone of fire, the Goron's Ruby. He also becomes Link's sworn brother.
With only one stone left to collect, Link travels to
Zora 's Domain, where a race of aquatic creatures live. Upon arrival, however, he discovers that the Zora princess,
Ruto , has disappeared. Link eventually finds out that Ruto has been swallowed by
Lord Jabu-Jabu , a giant fish. Link gains entrance into Jabu-Jabu's belly, and finds that it too, has been cursed by Ganondorf. He then discovers that the Princess Ruto was not swallowed against her will, but simply chose to go into Jabu-Jabu. When she entered, she found that Jabu-Jabu was acting strangely. After defeating a monster called
Barinade , Ruto is rescued and Jabu-Jabu is freed from his curse. Ruto is so impressed by Link's abilities that she hands over the Zora's Sapphire (the Spiritual Stone of Water). Ruto's mother, however, had instructed her that the stone should be given only to her fianc¨Ś, and so Ruto gives it to Link as a symbol of their engagement, much to Link's confusion.
With all three stones, Link heads back to the castle, only to find trouble. Ganondorf has shown his true identity and is after the
Ocarina of Time , another artifact also required to access the Sacred Realm. Link sees Zelda and her attendant, Impa, fleeing the castle on horseback, with Ganondorf following close behind, as seen in Link's previous nightmare. (This is the same scene shown in the game's opening narrative.) While fleeing, Zelda throws the Ocarina of Time into the moat surrounding the town and disappears into the night. Link then sees Ganondorf for the first time. Link draws his sword but is struck down by Ganondorf's magic. Ganondorf laughs at Link's weakness, and then continues his pursuit of Zelda and Impa. Link then retrieves the Ocarina from the moat and upon doing so, he sees in his mind a message that Zelda left for him. She explains what happened and teaches him the song that will open the door of time, the "Song of Time." He then heads to the Temple of Time, the resting place of the Triforce. Using the three stones and the Ocarina, he opens the Door of Time. Inside however, instead of finding the Triforce, he finds the legendary Master Sword. Link pulls the sword from its pedestal, and is transported to the Sacred Realm. However, the opening of the door of time also opens the Sacred Realm to Ganondorf, and he then claims the Triforce for himself.

Link awakens to find himself in late adolescence. He is in a strange ethereal room called the Chamber of the Sages and is met by an old man named Rauru, who informs Link of how he was frozen in time for seven years until he was old enough to wield the Master Sword to defeat Ganon. Rauru then reveals himself as the ancient Sage of Light, one of the seven sages that protect the Triforce. He tells Link that if he can find the six other sages, they can imprison Ganondorf within the Sacred Realm. According to Rauru, each Sage is unaware of his or her true identity because of the evil now in the world, which clouds their spiritual resonance. Link must find six Spiritual Temples and free them of Ganon's monsters. When cleared, each temple will awaken its respective Sage. Link returns to Hyrule to find a completely different land. Ganondorf, with the power of the Triforce, has conquered Hyrule and transformed it into a land of darkness. Seeing how the world has changed is all Link needs to devote himself to the enormous task of slaying the evil king and redeeming his homeland. Link is met by a mysterious character (a young man, in appearance) named
Sheik , who appears periodically to guide him in his quest.
Sheik guides Link to the Forest Temple in the Lost Woods. Deep within, he destroys a puppet named Phantom Ganon, and awakens the Forest Sage, who turns out to be his old Kokiri friend Saria. He returns to the Deku Tree's resting place to find that a Deku Sprout has started to grow. The sprout informs Link that he is actually a Hylian, who was entrusted to the Great Deku Tree's care briefly before his mother's death. In that age, Hyrule was burdened with a civil war (due to many searching for information on the whereabouts of the Sacred Realm, according to A Link to the Past and Twilight Princess). This explains why Link has grown up, while all of the other Kokiri have remained children.
Next, Link ventures into the Fire Temple atop Death Mountain, where many Gorons have been imprisoned. He frees the Gorons and he defeats a snake-like dragon named Volvagia, and awakens Darunia as the Fire Sage. The Goron King then gives Link the Fire Medallion.
Link moves on to Zora's Domain and finds that it has been abandoned and completely frozen over. Investigating further, he eventually locates the Water Temple in Lake Hylia. Within the temple, Link battles an evil, shadowy form of himself called Dark Link, and also defeats an aquatic monster called Morpha. Princess Ruto is awoken as the Water Sage (and realizes that perhaps her engagement with Link was never meant to be).
After that, Link and Shiek arrive in the village of Kakariko, where he finds Sheik and discovers the town is on fire. A dark presence is coming up from the depths of the well and is terrorizing the people. It attacks Sheik and then goes for Link. After regaining consciousness, Link learns that the evil in the well broke its seal and went into the Shadow Temple. Impa, Zelda's former attendant went after it, and Sheik speculates that she is the next sage. He retrieves the Master Sword and enters the Shadow Temple. Link conquers the evil creature (called Bongo Bongo), and wakes the Shadow Sage, Impa.
Link goes to the desert (where Ganondorf was born) and finds the fortress of the Gerudo thieves. At first they imprison him because they are a strict female-only group, except for their leader. After escaping, he continues through the Haunted Wasteland to the Spirit Temple. Unable to enter the temple without the Silver Gauntlets, Link is directed to go back in time to his childhood and obtain the powerful gloves. In doing so, he meets Nabooru, the second in command of the Gerudos. She tells him that she disagrees with Ganondorf's style and wants to stop him. Together, they retrieve the Silver Gauntlets, but a pair of witches kidnap Nabooru. With no other options, he turns back to an adult and uses the gauntlets himself to enter the temple. The two witches soon confront him and send an Iron Knuckle to fight him, who turns out to be Nabooru under a spell. He kills the witches, who form a being called Twinrova, and finds that Nabooru is the Spirit Sage.
Eventually, Link returns to the Temple of Time in the future, where Sheik meets him once more. Sheik reveals that she is actually Princess Zelda in disguise. Zelda is also the seventh sage, the Sage of Wisdom, and the leader of all Sages. She tells Link that when Ganondorf took the Triforce, his heart was not in balance, so the Triforce split into three pieces. He kept the Triforce of Power, while Zelda gained the Triforce of Wisdom. Finally, through his perseverance, Link has been assigned the Triforce of Courage. Zelda also gives Link the magic Light Arrows needed to defeat the Lord of Darkness. Unfortunately, the meeting is observed by Ganondorf, who captures Zelda and takes her prisoner in his huge tower (which has replaced Hyrule Castle).
The remaining six Sages help Link enter the tower, and Link finally engages Ganondorf in battle. With all of his strength, Link defeats Ganondorf and rescues Zelda. Link and Zelda barely escape the tower as it crumbles, but out of the fallen rubble, Ganondorf rises again. Using the Triforce of Power, Ganondorf transforms into an extremely powerful form called Ganon. Link engages his nemesis, and with the help of Zelda and the other Sages, Ganon is defeated. Zelda and the Sages then use their power to lock Ganon away in the Sacred Realm where he will supposedly stay for the rest of time. Ganon vows, however, that the day in which the seal is destroyed or corrupted, he would return to exterminate their descendants.
In the aftermath, a great celebration ensues with all of the residents of Hyrule. Zelda plays the Ocarina of Time one last time to send Link back in time to become his child self, before Ganon took over. As a child, Link sneaks into the castle once more to see the young princess. As they look at each other, the game ends (leading into the beginning of
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask .)

Music
Link playing the Ocarina.
See also:
Songs from The Legend of Zelda series
Ocarina of Time' s
music
was composed by
Koji Kondo ,
Nintendo 's traditional in-house
composer . The music is culturally and worldly inspired, as exemplified in its diversity from cartoonish music in the Kokiri Forest to Spanish
flamenco
in the Gerudo Valley. In some locations, the music is a variation of an important ocarina tune related to that area. For example, in Lon Lon Ranch, the theme is Epona's Song, with small and large variations.
The Hyrule overworld theme from past
Zelda
games, which is considered by most fans as the "official"
Zelda
tune, is not in
Ocarina of Time
in its entirety, although its opening phrase is subtly present in the Hyrule Field theme.
The theme for the Fire Temple is most likely inspired by an Islamic prayer call, with a male chorus chanting in the second half of the song. Due to some protest, Nintendo changed this in later cartridges to a vague Gregorian chant.
[ edit ]
Triforce rumors
The Triforce from a beta movie of
Ocarina of Time
A very early work-in-progress screenshot of
Ocarina of Time
shows Link receiving the
Triforce
itself from a treasure chest. Such a scene never occurs anywhere in the final game, and the plot as it stands does not appear to allow for Link to gain the Triforce at any point. Despite this, there has been great speculation as to whether the Triforce exists in
Ocarina of Time
as an obtainable item, as it does in other
Zelda
games, rather than simply being referred to in the storyline.
Even when hacking the game, it is impossible to actually gain the Triforce. The only thing possible is to see it's model. Some, however, point out a technicality that, in the storyline, Link obtains the Triforce of Courage when Ganondorf first enters the golden realm and obtains the Triforce of Power, and thus has it through the majority of the game.
[ edit ]
Leftovers
Ever since its release,
Ocarina of Time
has been examined by members of the ROM and emulation community to find any leftovers in the game. So far, several major items have been found. While some have been found only through a
GameShark , the leftovers indicate that various revisions (older, incomplete areas) have been left in the gameĄŻs code, and can be accessed by hacking them back in the game (or at least temporarily, with the GameShark and other cheat devices). The following has been found inside the Ocarina ROM that shows proof of unfinished concepts that were lost over time.
Leftover text (in Japanese) in the item banks reveals that there were two extra medallions (from
A Link to the Past ) called the Wind and Ice Medallions at one point in development (it appears on the item selection screen and in different slots). The data for all six elemental medallions to be used as usable items exist, without any assigned spell effect.
An unused version of the warp-pad, dubbed the 'ocarina pedestal' can be found in Zora's Fountain if a specific GameShark code is used. The pedestal itself does not react to Link in any way.
A red ice platform (used to block access to a chest) can be found in the Ice Cavern by using a specific GameShark code. The same item can be found in the GCN release of Master Quest while doing the same dungeon. However, it does not appear in the same area it once was in.
Various areas throughout the game that were slightly modified before release, or have various NPCs normally not seen in that area. The areas with minor differences are: Kakariko Village (Adult), Lon Lon Ranch (Kid), and Goron City (Either).
By using the
GameShark
and the Expansion Pak, people can search through the data loaded into memory when playing the game. Several text
strings
are there, making reference to the Expansion Pak (which was required to use the
Nintendo 64DD ) and inserting an expansion disk (again referring to the planned 64DD expansion that became the "Master Quest" on the GameCube Zelda preorder disc).
There is a path on one side of the Temple of Time which cannot normally be accessed, as it is blocked by four Gossip Stones. These could not be blown up because no item (other than Masks, trading items, or the ocarina) can be used in the area. Using the moonjump code, it is possible to go behind the gossip stones and walk around; however, nothing else will happen, and if the player makes it past an invisible wall in that area, the game will freeze. A theory as to why this happens is that the player may have been able to go back there at one point in development but this idea was removed. There is a beta screenshot that looks similar to the back of the Temple of Time.
The hidden
Star Fox
Arwing .
A Gameshark code was discovered that allowed any NPC to be replaced with any other NPC in the game. Examples include various enemies, Ganondorf's organ,
Dark Link , and even portions of Dark Link's "Illusion Room". Among these NPCs was found a fully coded
Arwing
enemy. The enemy has a full attack and movement AI programmed, shooting at Link with lasers with original sound effects. When destroyed, it crashes to the ground resulting in unpolished explosion and flame effects. A similar code can be found in
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask .
Adult Link using the boomerang.
It is possible through using a certain
Gameshark
code for the Adult Link to use the boomerang. It can be used by Adult Link to stun and harm enemies, but there is no graphic of him holding the boomerang. This may suggest that, early on in the game's development, Adult Link was able to use the boomerang.
[ edit ]
Release
Ocarina of Time
itself gained a ferocious amount of hype before release, the end result of which was that only those who had pre-ordered the game had any guarantee of receiving a copy.
Ocarina of Time Collector's Edition
gold cartridge.
The first two
Zelda
games released for the NES had golden cartridges, rather than the standard gray-colored cartridges used for almost every other licensed game for the console. Keeping with the tradition, pre-ordered copies of
Ocarina of Time
were also golden. Also, the box cover had a thick, plastic card glued over the original cover. However, this was not the case in Europe where the game had a standard gray-cartridge owing to
Nintendo of Europe
(although there were actually some gold cartridges, they were only available very briefly). A possible incentive was an economic one, as standard gray cartridges are inexpensive compared to custom made golden models. It should be noted that Australia (which is, like Europe, part of the
PAL region ) had golden cartridges. Also, the sequel to
Ocarina of Time ,
Majora's Mask , had a golden cartridge in Australia, Europe (and in North America).
Ocarina of Time Collector's Edition
box.
PAL cartridges are very noticeably different from NTSC cartridges. PAL, having a golden
Ocarina of Time
picture with a black background on a gray cartridge, and NTSC having a normally colored
Ocarina of Time
picture with a goldish background on the noted gray, or golden cartridges. The Australian PAL versions also come in either gold or gray cartridges.
[ edit ]
Versions
Several changes were made to the game after the initial release of
Ocarina of Time
in 1998. All of the gold cartridges, and some of the gray cartridges, that came out that year are version 1.0. Version 1.1 gray cartridges began to be released in early 1999, in which Nintendo fixed a number of bugs and glitches from the first version. This was followed by a version 1.2, which has the Player's Choice Million Seller seal on the cartridge and box.
The most notable difference between version 1.0 and the later versions is that version 1.0 contains a trick that allows one to play the game without the Master Sword, which in turn allows one to use any item on Epona. Version 1.1 is very similar to Version 1.0 except that players cannot perform the above trick (there is a different known method that works on all versions, including GameCube ones). Another difference between the two versions is the coloring of Ganon's blood at the end of the game. In Version 1.0, Ganon's blood is red; Version 1.1 is known to have two variations, one with green blood, and one with red blood. Meanwhile, Version 1.2 only has green blood. Finally, the original theme for the Fire Temple angered the Muslim community because of its similarity to an Islamic prayer call.
[5]
In response, Nintendo redid the theme for version 1.2 and the two GameCube versions.
Ocarina of Time was re-released in two different forms for the
Nintendo Gamecube
as part of the
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest
and
The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition
compilation discs. In both the
Master Quest
and
Collector's Edition , the game was an emulated
ROM
instead of a port.
One significant difference in these versions is that Nintendo altered the original crescent moon and star symbol of the Gerudo to a design later used to represent the pirates in
Majora's Mask , again due to Muslim protest.
[ edit ]
Master Quest
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest
was available for those who pre-ordered
The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker
in America, as well as in a special Gamecube
bundle
at
Wal-Mart . In
Europe
and
Australia
the disc came in the same case as the initial pressings of The Wind Waker. The "Master Quest" in the title refers to a remixed version of the game that contained rearranged dungeons, much like the Second Quest of
The Legend of Zelda . Both the original game and the
Master Quest
are available on the disc.
[ edit ]
Collector's Edition
The game was also re-released as part of the compilation
The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition , which was available in GameCube bundles in Europe and North America, as well as by registering hardware and software, or by subscribing to official magazines or clubs. The disc also contained several other
Zelda
games and a
Zelda
retrospective.

was second in 2005 (behind
Resident Evil 4 ) [11] , and first in 2006
[12] . Nintendo Power
called

the greatest game to ever appear on a Nintendo console. [13]
GameFAQs
users chose
Ocarina
as the second best game of all-time in 2005 (behind
Final Fantasy VII )
[14] . As a result of these and other high scores,
Ocarina
is placed first on both
Metacritic [15]
and
Game Rankings [16]
sites which rank games by averaging review scores from many sources. In addition, when the
UK 's
N64 Magazine
reviewed
Ocarina , they delayed the full review by one month in order to fully appreciate the game and its nuances. Finally, after an exhaustive review covering every reviewer in the magazine's favorite moments and some coverage of
The Best Game Ever , the game was awarded 98% by the N64 staff. The music from
Ocarina of Time
was praised for its quality and seamless incorporation into the game, [17]
Very few were disappointed with the game, something which is a startling rarity in gaming. Critically, the game was commended as a seamless transition from 2D to 3D in the
Zelda
series, since it supported the main feel and many details of the previous flagship
Zelda: A Link to the Past . Many gamers, especially Nintendo fans, would argue that no game since
Ocarina
has matched its classic standard.
Ocarina of Time
immediately became the standard by which all future
Zelda
games were measured;
Majora's Mask
and
The Wind Waker
have both received comments that they fail to match the "newness" of
Ocarina of Time , sometimes receiving lower scores as a result. [18]
Some notable minor flaws and annoyances in
Ocarina
which have kept the game from obtaining perfect scores from critics and gamers more generally include the inability to fast-forward text and cut scenes (which add up to over one entire hour in the game, and players often do not wish to rewatch them on a second playthrough) and also the inability to rematch defeated bosses and play through completed dungeons again, though the former is not possible in any of the Zelda games, except for
Majora's Mask , and, to an extent,
The Wind Waker .
[ edit ]
Impact
Ocarina of Time
gave the Nintendo 64 a lot of extra support, being released at a time in which the lack of games for the system was becoming a big problem for Nintendo. Much like
A Link to the Past
before it, it helped Nintendo sell more consoles after the hype from the launch game, in this case
Super Mario 64 , had finally died down.

The game sold approximately 314,000 copies during its first week of sales in Japan [2]
and it went on to sell three million copies worldwide. [3]
Majora's Mask
is the sixth installment in
The Legend of Zelda
series, which began with
The Legend of Zelda
in 1986. It was the second
Legend of Zelda
video game to feature
3D
graphics.
Majora's Mask
features a broader and darker storyline as well as deeper gameplay than its predecessor,
Ocarina of Time . The protagonist of the series,
Link , is placed in the land of
Termina , rather than
Hyrule , where most of the series is set. A mysterious mask-wearing
imp
known as the
Skull Kid
has persuaded the
moon
to abandon its
orbit
and crash into Termina. The player repeatedly lives three days through
time travel
in order to prevent this catastrophe.
Majora's Mask
is widely known as the darkest game in the
Zelda
series to date, largely due to its plot leading up to an impending apocalypse.
The gameplay is centered around a repeatedly-played three-day cycle and the use of
masks , some of which are required to proceed and complete the game. A variety of songs control the flow of time and open passages to the four Temples that Link must complete. Unlike
Ocarina of Time ,
Majora's Mask
requires the use of the
Expansion Pak , which allows for a larger number of on-screen characters and improved
graphics .
Majora's Mask
was generally received well by critics, who cited the graphic improvements as well as a deeper storyline.

Gameplay
Link has three days to prevent the moon from abandoning its orbit and crashing into Termina.
The gameplay of
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask
is based on the 3D computer graphics engine used in its predecessor. Link retains a variety of basic actions, including walking, running, somersaulting, and limited jumping.
Majora's Mask
is the second game in the official
Zelda
series to take place outside of the land of
Hyrule , placing the protagonist Link in a land named
Termina . A brainwashed Skull Kid has been wreaking havoc in Termina - they start as petty crimes such as ruining a marriage and poisoning a swamp, but then transforms the moon into a demonic, horrifying, haunting face that will collide with Termina in three days. The player repeatedly returns to the point of his first appearance three days before the crash of the moon using a song called the Song of Time on the Ocarina of Time; he relives these three days collecting the knowledge and abilities required to prevent the catastrophe, as well as repairing the lives the Skull Kid ruined.
As in previous installments of the series, Link uses a variety of weapons to battle enemies and to solve puzzles. The
sword
is his standard weapon and is the most frequently used weapon in the game. Link has several different sword techniques and several more can be learned throughout the course of play. The
shield
is used for defending. The
bow and arrows
are typically used to attack a distant enemy or to activate a switch, although they can also assist in close-range combat. Link can stun enemies with deku nuts, then inflict damage with another weapon. Bombs can be used to damage enemies and clear other obstacles, while the hookshot is capable of latching onto an enemy and pulling it towards Link or vice versa.
The gameplay in
Majora's Mask
expands upon that of
Ocarina of Time ; while retaining puzzles based on the use of bombs, arrows, and music,
Majora's Mask
also includes masks, character transformations, and the limit of a three-day cycle to add further difficulty and variety to many quests in the game.

Masks and transformations
Main article:
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask masks, weapons and items
Masks
first appeared as a sidequest in
Ocarina of Time , but they play a much more important role in
Majora's Mask . Whereas
Ocarina of Time
has a few masks of which only one can be carried at a time,
Majora's Mask
has a complete inventory of twenty-four masks, many of which are necessary to progress through the game. Some masks are invaluable, others are helpful, and a few are used only once.

Dodongo
in the northern Termina Field.
Unlike previous
Zelda
titles, Link is not limited to his human form; three special masks allow Link to transform into different species: the Deku mask transforms Link into a
Deku Scrub , the Goron mask into a
Goron , and the Zora mask into a
Zora . Each transformation grants unique abilities: the Deku Scrub can perform a spin dash, shoot bubbles from its mouth, and skip on water a limited number of times. The Goron transformation can roll around at high speeds and stomp the ground with his massive body. The Zora transformation can use its sleek body to swim rapidly, throw
boomerang -like fins from his arms and generate a
force field . Many areas of the game can only be accessed by Link's use of these abilities.
Link and his three transformations receive different reactions from various non-player characters. For instance, the Goron and Zora are allowed to exit Clock Town, but the Deku Scrub looks like a child and the guards do not permit him to pass. Many animals also interact differently with all four forms of Link. For example, Link's normal form receives an indifferent response from dogs, which will go about their business as they would in
Ocarina of Time . The Deku Scrub transformation, however, will be attacked if he goes near a dog, the Goron transformation will frighten the dog away, and the Zora transformation elicits an attraction from the dog.

A special mask called the Fierce Deity's Mask can be obtained at the end of the game if all of the other masks have been located. The Fierce Deity's Mask transforms Link into a larger, more powerful version of himself, with characteristic face markings, malicious-looking white eyes, a silver tunic, and mystical torso armor. He also uses a large two-handed sword which is capable of shooting bursts of energy when targeting an enemy. To counter its power, the mask may only be used during boss battles. The Fierce Deity features the same voice as Adult Link from
Ocarina of Time .
Aside from the transformation masks, many masks provide some sort of situational benefit. For example, the Great Fairy's Mask helps retrieve the
stray fairies
scattered throughout the four temples; the Bunny Hood allows Link to run faster; and the Stone Mask turns Link invisible to most
non-player characters
and enemies. Less valuable masks, however, are usually involved only in optional sidequests or very specialized situations. Examples are the Postman's Hat, which allows Link access to an item hidden in a
mailbox , and Kafei's Mask, which initiates a long and complicated sidequest that offers several masks as prizes.
[ edit ]
Three-day cycle
Since its debut, the
Legend of Zelda
series has always placed a heavy emphasis on free, open-ended exploration. Shigeru Miyamoto's
The Legend of Zelda
(1986) is a vastly different game from
Super Mario Bros.
(1985): the timed, linear levels of the latter are replaced with an expansive world that the player may explore at will, provided he has the tools to reach his destination. Link may revisit areas he has been to and proceeds with the game only when he is ready. The game has no numerical
score , just the satisfaction of finding hidden treasures and collecting every item. This concept is retained in
Majora's Mask , but for the first time in the series (excluding the
Legend of Zelda
titles released on Nintendo's
Satellaview ), a time limit of sorts is imposed. Link is not free to wander around a Temple forever; by the end of the third day he must travel back in time, restarting from Clock Town. Players must plan what to accomplish in one cycle; attempting to complete too much could result in running out of time half-way through a task. That in turn could result in being forced to abandon it and start over in another cycle.
Link can easily keep track of time by a persistent timer at the bottom of the screen. One hour in the game is approximately one real-time minute. Before the end of the seventy-two game hours, Link must return to the beginning of the first day to repeat the cycle. By doing so, Link is stripped of minor items collected during that cycle, but major items such as masks, key event items and weapons remain.
Link is not the only character who plans his time. Non-player characters have schedules they follow during the cycle and most of them are in need of help in some way. Using a schedule book of sorts given to him in Clock Town, Link can keep track of the schedules of multiple persons and identify the crucial points at which he may intervene to assist. By timing his actions to arrive at the correct moment and resolve problems ranging from providing a
soldier
with
medicine
to reuniting an engaged couple, Link can earn masks and other beneficial items to aid him.
[ edit ]
Songs
The Ocarina of Time, a mystical instrument given to Link, plays an important role in
Majora's Mask . Link learns to play magical songs from those he meets in order to gain special abilities, ranging from controlling the weather to such powers as teleportation and time travel. Each transformation mask uses a different instrument: Deku Link plays the Deku
pipes , Goron Link plays a set of
bongo drums , and Zora Link plays the
guitar .
The most important song in the game is the Song of Time. It is used to return Link to the beginning of the first day; this is the only way to revisit the three-day cycle and permanently save one's progress. Other songs are primarily used for a plot-related effect, such as opening a new path. The Elegy of Emptiness is unique in that it is used extensively as a puzzle in one of the dungeons. Also, the Song of Healing is used in both the main storyline as well as several side-quests to unlock more items. Finally, songs like the Song of Soaring exist for the player's convenience, allowing teleportation to major locations.

Plot

Setting
Main article:
Termina
Further information:
Characters from The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask
A map of Termina. Areas are revealed as the player buys maps from
Tingle .
Termina appears to be an alternate version of Hyrule: the majority of the
Ocarina
characters were reused in
Majora's Mask
with slight differences. For example, the younger and older versions of
Malon
from
Ocarina of Time
appear as sisters named
Romani
and
Cremia
living on a
farm
on Milk Road. Also, the unnamed red-head whose
Cucco
could be retrieved for a reward in
Ocarina of Time , is a resident of Clock Town named
Anju , and is a key element to a very intricate
sidequest . Several other characters were also reused in
Majora's Mask , some of which include the
Ocarina
vagrant , who administrates the Clock Town
bank , The gravekeeper Dampé, who runs the Graveyard in both games, and the
Ocarina
carpenters , whose occupations remain the same.
The land of Termina contains a wide variety of terrain. Clock Town lies at the center of Termina and is the place Link starts from when he returns to the beginning of the three-day cycle. The centerpiece of Clock Town is the large clock on Clock Tower that counts down the three days before the Carnival of Time. Termina Field surrounds Clock Town; beyond lie a swamp, a mountain range, a bay, and a canyon in each of the four compass directions. The main portion of the game features Link traveling to dungeons in these areas and defeating the boss within.
To the south of Clock Town is the Southern Swamp. The resident Deku population has set up a hereditary monarchy within the confines of the jungle-like area. The most prominent feature of this area is the Woodfall Temple, an ancient shrine that has fallen into disuse and now plays home to various monsters that have been poisoning the local swamp. North of Clock Town is the Snowhead mountain range where the Gorons live. Though normally temperate, the area has been experiencing an unusually long winter caused by a monster in Snowhead Temple. The western area of Termina is the Great Bay. The Zoras live here along with a society of Gerudo pirates. Unfortunately, a monster in the Great Bay Temple is causing a large number of storms and contaminating the water. The Ikana Canyon lies to the east. It is a desolate and barely inhabited area filled with the wandering spirits of the dead. A monster from the Stone Tower Temple is casting an evil aura over the land.

Story
The Skull Kid wearing Majora's Mask.
Majora's Mask
begins with Link riding his horse
Epona
through the Lost Woods, searching for his fairy friend,
Navi . He is ambushed by a Skull Kid wearing a strange mask and his two fairy friends, Tatl and Tael. They steal Epona and the Ocarina of Time from Link and run off into a mysterious cave. Link follows behind and catches up with them, only to be changed into a Deku Scrub through the Skull Kid's mysterious power. The Skull Kid and Tael race off, but Tatl is left behind after a door closes in front of her. Because she is a fairy, she cannot open it and appeals to Link for help. Tatl apologizes and offers to aid him in restoring his natural form. Link proceeds past the cave's obstacles with Tatl as he comes to terms with his new body.
Link travels across the land of Termina at sunrise.
Link chases the Skull Kid through the cave and somehow ends up in an alternate dimension called Termina. Inside some sort of clock tower, Link meets the
Happy Mask Salesman , who says that he can help Link if he retrieves the Ocarina of Time and
Majora's Mask
from the Skull Kid. As they leave the clock tower, Link and Tatl find themselves in the middle of a city named Clock Town, which is preparing for its annual festival, the Carnival of Time. Link learns that a looming catastrophe is threatening Termina: the moon in the sky has abandoned its orbit and is travelling towards the land. In just three short days, it will crash into Clock Town and destroy Termina. Link eventually locates the Skull Kid and Tael at midnight on the third day at the top of the clock tower. He manages to retrieve his Ocarina of Time from the Skull Kid but is unable to get the mask. Instead, he plays the Song of Time and its power sends him back in time to the beginning of the first day he arrived in Termina.
Once Link discovers how to transform himself back into a young boy, the real adventure begins. Link has to fight, solve puzzles, and think his way through the four major lands of Termina: a poisonous
swamp , an icy
mountain , a murky
bay , and a deserted
canyon . Each region contains its own
dungeon
that Link must go through. Once he successfully defeats the masked
boss
at the end of a dungeon, Link obtains the friendship of one of the four giants. When the dungeons are completed and a sequence of events are triggered, Link is able to call the giants, who halt the moon's passage towards Termina. Link must then enter the moon and face Majora's Mask itself to determine the fate of Termina. [4]
[ edit ]
Development
Scenes featuring the fairies Tatl and Tael were some of the first introduced into the video game's production.
Following the release of
The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening
in
1993 , fans waited five years for
Ocarina of Time , the active development of which took four years. By re-using the
game engine
and graphics from
Ocarina of Time , a smaller team required only two years to finish
Majora's Mask . According to director
Eiji Aonuma , they were "faced with the very difficult question of just what kind of game could follow
Ocarina of Time
and its worldwide sales of seven million units", and as a solution, came up with the three-day system to "make the game data more compact while still providing deep gameplay." [5]
Majora's Mask
first started to appear in the media in May 1999, when
Famitsu
stated that a long-planned
Zelda
expansion for the
64DD
was underway in Japan with no release date set. This project was tentatively titled " Ura Zelda ", "Ura" translating approximately to "Hidden" or "Behind". This expansion would take
Ocarina of Time
and make changes to the level designs, similar to how the " second quest " of
The Legend of Zelda
expanded upon the original game. [6]
In June, Nintendo announced that " Zelda: Gaiden ", which roughly translates to "Zelda: Side Story", would appear as a playable demo at Nintendo's
SpaceWorld
exhibition on
August 27 ,
1999 . [7]
It was assumed by the media that
Zelda: Gaiden
was the new working title for
Ura Zelda . [7]
Screenshots of
Zelda: Gaiden
released in August show unmistakable elements of the final version of
Majora's Mask , such as the large clock that dominates the center of Clock Town, the persistent timer at the bottom of the screen, and the Goron mask. [8]
Story and gameplay details revealed later that month show that the opening story of Link's travel to a parallel world where the moon is threatening to crash as well as the use of masks to transform into a Goron, a Zora, and a Deku Scrub are already in place. [9]
That same month, Miyamoto confirmed in a
Famitsu
article that
Ura Zelda
and
Zelda: Gaiden
are separate projects. [10]
It is unclear if
Zelda: Gaiden
is an offshoot of
Ura Zelda
or if the two were always separate.
Ura Zelda
would become the
Master Quest
outside Japan, eventually released on a bonus disc for the
GameCube
given to those that preordered
The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker ; a
PAL / NTSC
Nintendo 64 release was cancelled due to the failure of the
64DD
in Japan.
In November, Nintendo announced a "holiday 2000" release date for
Zelda: Gaiden . [11]
By March 2000, new tentative titles were announced that would become the finalized titles:
The Legend of Zelda: Mask of Mujula
in Japan and
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask
elsewhere. [12]
[ edit ]
Improvements from
Ocarina of Time
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask
runs on an upgraded version of the game engine used in
Ocarina of Time
and requires the use of the 4MB
Expansion Pak . [13]
The requirement is thought to be due to
Majora's Mask' s possible origin as a 64DD title, which would necessitate an extra 4MB of
RAM . [13]
The use of the Expansion Pak allows for greater draw distances, more accurate
dynamic lighting , more detailed
textures , more detailed
animation , complex framebuffer effects such as motion blur, and more characters displayed on the screen. [13]
The expanded draw distance permits the player to see extremely far in Termina, and eliminates the use of fog to obscure distant areas that had appeared in
Ocarina of Time . [13]
IGN
considered the texture design to be one of the best created for the Nintendo 64, saying that although some textures have a low resolution, they are "colorful and diverse", which gives each area "its own unique look". [13]
Finally, all building interiors are rendered in real-time, unlike the
fixed 3D
featured in
Ocarina of Time .
The music was composed by
Koji Kondo
and Toru Minegishi, [14]
whose score featured new interpretations of familiar melodies from
Ocarina of Time
and other previous titles in the
Zelda
series along with new material. The main overworld theme from the original
Legend of Zelda
returned, after being conspicuously absent from
Ocarina of Time . [15]
Fujiko Takimoto , who contributed to the voice of Link in
Ocarina of Time , returned for
Majora's Mask .
Nobuyuki Hiyama , who voiced adult Link, contributed to the voice of Fierce Deity Link and Zora Link.
[ edit ]
Reception
The game sold approximately 314,000 copies in its first week of sales in Japan, [2]
and has sold three million copies worldwide. [3]
Despite superficial similarities to
Ocarina of Time ,
Majora's Mask
is often described as different from and much darker than the rest of the series.
Edge
magazine referred to
Majora's Mask
as "the oddest, darkest and saddest of all
Zelda
games". [16]
Reviews were generally favorable, although opinions are mixed regarding whether the game is as good as its predecessor. Some feel that
Majora's Mask
is significantly better than
Ocarina of Time
in certain areas. According to
Famitsu , "The difficulty level of the game is drastically improved [from
Ocarina of Time ], the limited saves, and the time limit to finish the game all help to make the game more enjoyable to play". [17]
IGN
described
Majora's Mask
as " The Empire Strikes Back
of Nintendo 64. It's the same franchise, but it's more intelligent, darker, and tells a much better storyline". [13]
Majora's Mask
was one of the last major titles for the Nintendo 64, and may have suffered in terms of popular interest due to the familiarity of the technology. Nevertheless,
GamePro
described the game as "living proof that the N64 still has its magic". It has been ranked the 7th-greatest game of all time by
Electronic Gaming Monthly . [18]
One common criticism is that
Majora's Mask
is not as accessible as
Ocarina of Time .
GameSpot
wrote that some might "find the focus on minigames and side quests tedious and slightly out of place". [19]
Game-Revolution
wrote that it "takes a little longer to get into this
Zelda ", but also that "there are moments when the game really hits you with all its intricacies and mysteries, and that makes it all worthwhile". [20]
[ edit ]
GameCube re-release
In 2003, Nintendo re-released
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask
on the
Nintendo GameCube
as part of the
Collector's Edition , a special promotional disc which also contained
Ocarina of Time
as well as the original two 8-bit
NES
Zelda
games,
The Legend of Zelda , and
Zelda II: The Adventure of Link . [21]
This disc could be purchased with a GameCube console, as part of a subscription offer to
Nintendo Power
magazine, or through Nintendo's official website by purchasing and registering a certain number of first-party Nintendo games. [22]
The offer expired in early 2004.
Similar to some other GameCube re-releases, the game is not a
port
in the traditional sense, but rather the
ROM
of the original game running on a software
emulator . [21]
The only differences are the colors of the action buttons due to the GameCube's green A button and red B button and the pause screen's use and depiction of the L button as the left page scroller, as opposed to Z. Aside from these, because it is only emulated (rather than altered for the new console), there are some timing discrepancies between the two consoles; some of the music sounds inaccurate on the GameCube and the framerate is noticably lower. [21]
Another issue that has been raised is that the game unexpectedly crashes on the GameCube occasionally; this is once again caused by the inaccuracies of the emulator. Furthermore, the GameCube's controls are different than the
Nintendo 64 's. This results in occasional difficulties in performing maneuvers such as back-walking. Despite these problems, the GameCube version has a cleaner look since it runs at a higher resolution than its Nintendo 64 counterpart. [21]
In addition, the GameCube version supports component video connections and
progressive scan
( 480p ). [21]

Story
Veran, Link, and Nayru in
Oracle of Ages .
According to the instruction manual, the
Triforce
called out to
Link
from within its Temple. Link approached it, and was sucked into a vortex that tossed him out into a dark forest where upon landing, the young hero heard screaming. Running blindly through the bushes, Link entered a clearing and found a lady on the ground screaming and being circled by animals. When the monsters saw Link approach them, they scattered off in all directions.
Link soon realized that the woman lying on the ground was
Princess Zelda 's nurse,
Impa . Impa said that there was a singer in the forest and that she had to go look for her. The nurse asked Link if he could help her. He agreed and the two went off in search for the songtress.
Continuing through the forest, they finally found who they were looking for. A young lady with blue hair sat on a tree stump surrounded by forest creatures that were listening to her beautiful song. The girl's name was
Nayru
and then Impa broke the solo with an evil laugh.
A shadow had emerged from Impa and was cackling as it swirled through the trees. The silhouette revealed itself as
Veran , Sorceress of Shadows. The shadow began soaring around before flying into Nayru's body and disappearing in a flash of light.
Nayru was the Oracle of Ages to a land called Labrynna and now that she was taken by Veran, the time flow between the past and present became disrupted.

Nayru, Oracle of Ages
is responsible for keeping the flow of time in Labrynna running smoothly. The main part of the quest involves rescuing her from Veran.
Ralph
is a childhood friend and guardian of Nayru. He assists Link in his quest.
Queen Ambi
was the queen of Labrynna many years ago. Veran goes to her time in Nayru's body and corrupts her, encouraging her to build a huge tower to the sky.
The Maku Tree of Labrynna
is a large magical tree similar to the
Great Deku Tree . She aids Link in his quest by locating lost Essences of Time and the Harp of Ages.

Gameplay
Link at the beginning of his journey through the land of
Labrynna .
Oracle of Ages
and
Seasons
each focus on a different aspect of the classic
Zelda
formula.
Ages
is puzzle-heavy while
Seasons

Though they are self-contained games, they also have the ability to link with one another, using either passwords or a cable, so that a person could play one game and transfer his or her progress to the other. This technique is also the only way to reach the "true" ending of the game.
Upon completing
Oracle of Ages , players will receive a 20-character
password . When starting a new game, players can input the password to play an alternative version of
Oracle of Seasons . The alternative version features people who will mention passwords. Upon telling these passwords to people in
Oracle of Ages , their
Oracle of Ages
file will receive items of some sort. Then, by taking a new password back into
Oracle of Seasons , the new item can be brought to the game. Rings can also be traded this way, either by password or by Link Cable.
The alternate game also has many extras. Some items move around and must be found in different places.
Princess Zelda
appears and must be rescued. The
Oracle of Ages
character Queen Ambi appears in the game, and after searching for her long-lost sea-faring lover, finds him in Subrosia. Also, once Onox is defeated, the witch Twinrova appears. Veran and Onox were ploys to light the Flames of Sorrow and Destruction. Upon kidnapping Princess Zelda, the third Flame of Despair lights, and Twinrova attempts to offer Zelda as a tribute, along with the energy of the 3 Flames, to revive
Ganon . Link must then enter Twinrova's lair and stop the ritual. Upon completing the alternative game, players receive yet another password. When used to start a new game, players receive the Victory Ring, which commemorates their defeat of Ganon.

Development
Initially, Nintendo planned to make a series of
Zelda
games called
The Legend of Zelda: The Triforce Trilogy , remakes of the
Nintendo Entertainment System
(NES) games
The Legend of Zelda
and
Zelda II: The Adventure of Link , plus a third original title. However, early in the development of the first title, it was clear the original NES
Zelda
games did not port over to
Game Boy Color
properly, and that it would be better to make new games from scratch. Originally there was to be a third
Oracle
game (tentatively titled
The Legend of Zelda: Mystical Seed of Courage ), but this was cancelled due to the increased complexity in creating a password system to coordinate three games.

Reception
Gamespot gave
Oracle of Ages
and
Seasons
each a 9.2, and IGN gave it their perfect rating of 10.

Sequels
Oracle of Ages
and

[ edit ]
Comics
A
manga
novelization of the game was made by the
mangaka
Akira Himekawa
as a sequel to the
Oracle of Seasons
manga. It introduced plotlines and story elements that weren't included in the original game. New characters included Raven (Link's ancestor who travelled to Labrynna and worked as Queen Ambi's chief guard), the bumbling Ralph (a young man who assists Link on his quest), and Link's grandparents. It also included the link-up segment of the game, with Ganon making an appearance. Unlike the game, Zelda does not kiss Link at the end of the story.

Plot
[ edit ]
Story
Din, Link, and Onox in
Oracle of Seasons .
According to the instruction manual, the
Triforce
called out to
Link
from within its Temple. Link approached it, and was sucked into a vortex that tossed him out into a dark forest where upon landing, the young hero heard heard music and voices from just beyond a group of trees. In a clearing, a group of traveling entertainers were cheering a beautiful red head who was dancing around a fire. The dancer motioned to Link for him to join her. She welcomed the Hylian to Holodrum, and mentioned that her name was
Din . Din took Link's hand and the two began to dance around the fire. Din notices a strange triangle mark on Link's hand, but won't say much about it ... The other people started cheering them on, but the happy moment was short lived. The sky over the forest became covered in black clouds followed by several strikes of lightning and booming thunder from which an ominous voice spoke. The speaker declared himself as
Onox , General of Darkness and added that Din was the Oracle of Seasons.
After his short speech, a funnel cloud dropped from the sky blowing back everyone including Link before sucking up Din into its dark heights. As the tornado dissipated, the seasons of Holodrum fell into disarray with them changing rapidly.
The Rod of Seasons is a powerful item that holds some of the power of the Oracle of Seasons, Din. The item is hidden in the world of Subrosia where it is said that the Temple of Seasons is buried. When obtained, swinging the rod results in a change of season.
[ edit ]
Characters
Link , as always, is the hero of the game.
Princess Zelda
requests that Link saves the Oracle of Seasons, yet unknowingly is also a target as she is the key to releasing Ganon.
Impa
is Zelda's messenger.
The Maku Tree
is a large magical tree similar to the
Great Deku Tree .
Din
the Oracle of Seasons who was captured by
Onox
General of Darkness and must be saved by Link.
[ edit ]
Setting
Holodrum is much larger than Labrynna in
Oracle of Ages , but it has no underwater or past to explore. It does, however have the small subterranean world of Subrosia beneath it. The name Subrosia is derived from
subrosa , meaning "secret", and the people of Subrosia are very secretive about their rare movements in the overworld.
Subrosia acts as a go-between with the upper world, with shortcut portals to take Link to different parts of Holodrum quickly; similarly, warping to a different location on the overworld can lead to different Subrosia portals to access isolated areas of Subrosia that cannot be reached via the underground plane alone.
[ edit ]
Gameplay
Link at the beginning of his journey through the land of
Labrynna .
Oracle of Seasons
and
Ages
each focus on a different aspect of the classic
Zelda
formula.
Ages

file will receive items of some sort. Then, by taking a new password back into
Oracle of Ages , the new item can be brought to the game. Rings can also be traded this way, either by password or by Link Cable.
The alternative game also has many extras. Some items move around and must be found in different places.
Princess Zelda
appears and must be rescued. The pirates appear in a different place, and in the alternative version of
Oracle of Seasons , it is mentioned that the pirate captain was the long-lost lover the
Oracle of Ages
character Queen Ambi has been waiting for. Also, once Veran is defeated, the witch Twinrova appears. Veran and Onox were ploys to light the Flames of Sorrow and Destruction. Upon kidnapping Princess Zelda, the third Flame of Despair lights, and Twinrova attempts to offer Zelda as a tribute, along with the energy of the three Flames, to revive
Ganon . Link must then enter Twinrova's lair and stop the ritual. Upon completing the alternative game, players receive yet another password. When used to start a new game, players receive the Victory Ring, which commemorates their defeat of Ganon.

It also introduced more of Din's troupe and gave names to the unidentified characters. They included Johvan the troupe leader, Barrot the guitarist, Mel and Rom, tamborine-playing twin sisters, and finally Johvan's son Rishu, who aspires to become a fighter. Also included was a small
Cucco
chick named Pyoko, who acted as one of Link's companions.

Further information:
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
The single-player portion of the cartridge is a
port
of
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past , the
SNES
Legend of Zelda
title originally released in
1991 . A handful of cosmetic changes are made for this version, including voice samples originally used for young Link in
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
and an additional dungeon, the Palace of the Four Sword.
The Palace of the Four Sword can be unlocked by completing the
Four Swords
multiplayer game, creating a new doorway in the east side of the Dark Pyramid of the
Sacred Realm . In it, Link battles several new bosses to obtain the four aspects of the
Four Sword , before confronting four dopplegangers of himself. Completion of the Palace of the Four Sword allows the player to see a "Quest Log" revealing certain statistics on the current game.
[ edit ]
Four Swords
Four Swords
is the multiplayer portion of the of the cartridge. In
Four Swords , two to four players must work together to work their way through a series of puzzle-laden dungeons, while competing to collect rupees.
[ edit ]
Plot
Vaati
kidnaps
Princess Zelda , and Link must use the Four Sword, a magical sword that splits him into four copies of himself, to track down and defeat him.
[ edit ]
Gameplay
Creating a file for the Game Boy Advance game will give players a profile in both
A Link to the Past
and
Four Swords .
A Link to the Past
is single player, but
Four Swords
is for 2-4 players. Some of the features in the two games are linked. For example, when players learn a new sword move, the sword move is transferred between games. Player 1 is the green Link, player 2 is red, player 3 is blue, and player 4 is violet. Once everyone is connected, Player 1 chooses one of the four basic stages to play on. The gameplay is similar to
A Link to the Past , though it is cooperative in that stages require teamwork to complete. All of the dungeons are randomized before play.
[ edit ]
Legacy
The next
Zelda
game that was released on any platform after
A Link to the Past/Four Swords
was
The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker
for the
Nintendo GameCube
in
2003
(U.S. release), which did not have a story involving the Four Sword although it had a similar graphic style.
Four Swords
was followed in
2004
by a GameCube sequel,
The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures , which continued its story and expanded upon the gameplay concepts while including a single-player adventure. In
2005 , the
Four Swords
prequel
The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap
for the Game Boy Advance became the next handheld
Zelda
game, and was also developed by Flagship.

The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass
is a direct sequel to
The Wind Waker .
The game is set on a group of islands in a vast sea  a first for the series. The player controls
Link , the
protagonist
of the
Zelda
series. He struggles against his nemesis,
Ganondorf , for control of a sacred relic known as the
Triforce . Link spends a significant portion of the game sailing, traveling between
islands , and traversing through dungeons and
temples
to gain the power necessary to defeat Ganon.
The Wind Waker
follows in the footsteps of
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time , retaining the basic gameplay and control system from the
Nintendo 64
title. A heavy emphasis is placed on using and controlling
wind
with a
baton
called the Wind Waker, which aids sailing and floating.
Critics
enjoyed the similarity to
Ocarina of Time , but often complained that the large amount of sailing became tedious. [1]
Despite this, the game has met commercial and critical success and is the fourth of only six games that have received a perfect score from
Famitsu
magazine.

Story
Set hundreds of years after the events of
Ocarina of Time ,
The Wind Waker
finds the hero
Link
in a sea scattered with several islands, which necessitates frequent sailing and naval combat. Link lives with his grandmother and younger sister
Aryll
on
Outset Island , one of the few inhabited islands in the Great Sea. The people of the Great Sea pass down a legend of a prosperous kingdom with a hidden
golden power . An evil man found and stole this power, using it to spread darkness until a young boy dressed in green sealed the evil with the
Blade of Evil's Bane . The boy became known as the Hero of Time and passed into legend. One day the sealed evil began to return, but the Hero of Time did not reappear. The inhabitants of the
Great Sea
are unsure of the kingdom's fate, but it is clear that this legend is the story of
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
where the Hero of Time, Link, fought Ganondorf.
When children of Outset Island come of age they are customarily dressed in green, like the Hero of Time. The elders hope to instill the
courage
of the Hero of Time in the children. It is Link's
birthday
as
The Wind Waker
opens, and he receives the familiar green clothes and cap. Aryll's present to Link is permission to use her
telescope . As he looks through the telescope, he sees a large bird, the
Helmaroc King , carrying a girl to a nearby forest. After retrieving a
sword , Link sets out to investigate. Link rescues the girl, only to have Aryll kidnapped by the Helmaroc King as he returns.
Spoiler warning :
Plot and/or ending details follow.
The girl rescued in the forest is
Tetra , captain of a
pirate
ship. At Link's request, they sail to the Forsaken Fortress, where a mysterious figure is holding Aryll and several other girls. Following an unsuccessful raid, Link is thrown from the fortress. A talking boat called the King of Red Lions rescues Link and tells him that the master of the Forsaken Fortress is
Ganon , the evil of legend. After purchasing a
sail , Link travels to Dragon Roost Island at the King of Red Lions' suggestion.
[ edit ]
Goddesses' Pearls
Link, on board a pirate ship with Tetra, waves goodbye to his home.
Once at the island, the King of Red Lions instructs Link to find a
dragon
named
Valoo
and ask him for a jewel called Din's Pearl. Link receives the Wind Waker, a
baton
able to control the
wind , from his boat and sets out towards the dwelling of the
Rito tribe , a bird-like race. Link learns that
Prince Komali
has Din's Pearl, but is unwilling to relinquish it. Prince Komali is of the age when members of the Rito tribe traditionally climb to the top of Dragon Roost Island to get a
scale
from Valoo, which allows a Rito to grow
wings . However, Valoo has grown violent and unpredictable and Prince Komali is fearful to attempt the journey. He agrees to give Link the pearl if Link can reach Valoo. With the help of Rito tribe member
Medli , Link makes his way to Valoo and defeats
Gohma , the monster that had been upsetting the dragon. Afterwards, Link receives Din's Pearl from Prince Komali, who is finally ready to ascend the mountain and gain his wings.
The King of Red Lions has Link sail south to the Forest Haven to ask the
Deku Tree
for Farore's Pearl. Inside the
haven , Link saves the Deku Tree from a group of
ChuChus
and is introduced to the
Koroks , spirits of the
forest . Aware that Ganondorf has returned, the Deku Tree agrees to give Link the pearl after the annual
ceremony
to replenish the forests. Linder, one of the Koroks, enters and informs the Deku Tree that fellow Korok
Makar
has fallen into the Forbidden Woods. The Deku Tree, believing that Link's appearance is not a
coincidence , asks Link to help. Link rescues Makar from a large plant monster named
Kalle Demos
and returns to the Forest Haven. The ceremony is completed and Link receives Farore's Pearl.
Link then travels to Greatfish Island seeking
Jabun , a great
water
spirit, but finds that the island has been demolished by Ganon. After a trip to Windfall Island to obtain
bombs , Link returns to Outset Island and blows open the entrance to a cave in which Jabun is hiding. During a conversation between Jabun and the King of Red Lions, Jabun gives Link Nayru's Pearl.
Link takes the three pearls to the three Triangle Islands, inserting one into a
statue
on each island. An image of the
Triforce
appears and the Tower of the Gods rises from the sea in the center of the islands. Link enters the
tower , where he battles
Gohdan
to prove his worth. After defeating Gohdan, a ring of light appears on the surface of the water below. Link sails into the ring of light and is taken beneath the waters to
Hyrule Castle , overrun with enemies and frozen in time. Link descends a hidden staircase, where he finds the
Master Sword , the evil-repelling blade that the Hero of Time used to seal Ganondorf. Link removes the sword, which awakens the castle; he destroys the enemies and returns to the surface.
[ edit ]
Restoring the Master Sword
Details such as explosions are rendered in a stylized form.
With the Master Sword in hand, Link returns to the Forsaken Fortress and joins Tetra and the pirates. He frees the
captives
and kills the Helmaroc King, but is easily defeated by Ganon. Ganon tells Link that taking the Master Sword has fully lifted the seal, unbinding his full power; furthermore, the Master Sword has lost its power to repel evil. Ganon raises his sword to attack Link, but Tetra intervenes. Ganon grabs Tetra, causing the Triforce of Power held within him to resonate. He realizes that Tetra is wearing a Triforce fragment on a
necklace
and calls her
Princess Zelda . Prince Komali, having grown wings, flies in and takes Link and Tetra away. Valoo swoops into view, breathing fire and sending Ganon's room up in flames.
Link and Tetra sail back to the castle at the bottom of the sea and descend the staircase. There they meet
Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule , the king of Hyrule and the voice of the King of Red Lions. He tells Link and Tetra that the
prayers
of the people in the legend were answered  the gods sealed Ganon and all of Hyrule with him by flooding the kingdom with a torrential
downpour , ordering those chosen to rebuild to take refuge on the
mountaintops . King Hyrule gives a Triforce fragment to Tetra. Combining it with the fragment on her necklace, Tetra now holds the complete Triforce of Wisdom and is revealed to be Princess Zelda. Ganon is seeking the Triforces of Wisdom and Courage to complete the entire Triforce, which grants its holder's
wish . Leaving Zelda, Link returns to the surface.
At Dragon Roost Island, Link plays the
Earth God's Lyric
to Medli, which awakens in her the knowledge that she is the sage of Earth, able to help restore the power of the Master Sword. Link and Medli battle through the Earth Temple and defeat a massive
Poe
named
Jalhalla . Medli begins to pray, restoring some power to Link's sword. Link leaves Medli to continue praying and sails to the Forest Haven. He finds Makar and plays the
Wind God's Aria , giving Makar the realization that he is the Sage of Wind. They travel to the Wind Temple and defeat the
sandworm
Molgera . Makar prays and restores the Master Sword's full power.
Link then goes on a variety of
quests
to find and decode eight
nautical charts
that mark the locations of the pieces of the Triforce of Courage. Link raises the pieces from the sea and restores the Triforce of Courage, which then dwells inside Link, marking him as the Hero of Wind.
[ edit ]
Confrontation with Ganondorf
Link delivers the deathblow to Ganondorf.
With the restored Master Sword and the Triforce of Courage, Link returns once more to Hyrule Castle, where Zelda disappears before him. Link breaks through the barrier beyond Hyrule Castle and enters Ganons Tower. Link reaches Zelda and fights large puppets created by Ganondorf. When these are defeated, Ganondorf reveals himself to Link, acknowledging that Link must be the Hero of Time
reincarnated . Link follows Ganondorf to the
rooftop
of the tower. There, Ganon tells Link why he wanted to rule Hyrule. He tells Link that his country lay within a desert, where the searing winds of the day and the frigid gale of the night always brought death with them, whereas the cool breeze of Hyrule brought life to its people. He coveted those winds, wishing to rule a land that wasn't destroyed by them. Ganon remarks that it must be
fate
that has allowed him to bring all of the pieces of the Triforce together, just as he had with the Hero of Time. The three Triforces are extracted from Ganondorf, Link, and Zelda and combine to form the complete Triforce. Ganon demands to the
gods
to expose Hyrule to the sun once more, under his control. Before he can reach the Triforce, however, King Daphnes suddenly appears, touching the Triforce. He asks the gods of the Triforce to give Link and Zelda a future and to wash away Hyrule. The Triforce splits apart and water from the
ocean
above begins to pour down all around the tower.
Believing that the King has just ensured Link's and Zelda's destruction, Ganondorf laughs maniacally, calling the idea of hope for them "foolishness". He then draws his swords, wishing to deny King Hyrule his wish and prove the power of the Triforce wrong, and begins battling Link (this can be interpreted as a signal that Ganon's sanity is fading). Zelda assists by using Link's bow and shooting Ganon with
Light Arrows . After Ganon is paralyzed by Zelda's Light Arrows, Link plunges the Master Sword into Ganons head, turning him to stone. Link and Zelda float to the surface in a bubble, leaving Ganondorf and the king to be buried underwater with Hyrule. Link and Zelda sail away in search of a new land  with the wind as their guide. This scene marks the beginning of the upcoming DS Zelda game,
Phantom Hourglass .
Spoilers end here.
[ edit ]
Gameplay
Link uses the Deku Leaf to float on the wind.
The control scheme of
The Wind Waker
is largely unchanged from
Ocarina of Time
and
Majora's Mask . Link's basic actions of walking, running, attacking, defending, and automatic jumping at ledges are retained. Link also uses the control system introduced in
Ocarina of Time
that allows him to "lock-on" to an enemy or other target. An addition to this basic control scheme is the ability to
parry . When Link is locked-on to an opponent and not actively defending, certain attacks by the opponent will trigger a visual cue, a vibration of the controller, and a chime. Attacking at that point causes Link to dodge or parry then counter-attack from the rear. This tactic becomes crucial for defeating armored enemies or bosses.
The new art style used in
The Wind Waker
gives Link
eyes
that are much larger and more expressive than in previous games. This allows Link to focus his gaze on approaching enemies or important items. For example, if Link needs to solve a puzzle by lighting a
torch
to set a distant object on fire, his eyes might turn to look at a nearby
stick , giving a hint to an observant player on how to proceed.
As with all
Zelda
games,
The Wind Waker
features several dungeons  large, enclosed, and often underground areas. Link battles enemies, collects items, and solves puzzles to progress through a dungeon, fighting a
boss
at the end. To complete a dungeon, Link primarily uses a sword and shield. Other weapons commonly used by Link include a
bow and arrow , a
boomerang ,
bombs , and a
grappling hook . Certain enemy weapons can be picked up and used, a feature new to the
Zelda
series.
Further information:
The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker weapons and items
The Wind Waker , like most
Zelda
games, includes many
sidequests , such as the Nintendo Gallery. When Link is in the Forest Haven, he can float to a
cylindrical
island with a hatch containing the sculptor Carlov and his gallery. Once Link obtains a color camera called the Deluxe Picto Box, he can take pictures of
non-player characters
and enemies, which Carlov uses to sculpt figurines. There are a total of 134 figurines to collect, but Link can only hold three pictures at a time.
After completing the game, the player can replay it with minor modifications: Link starts with the Deluxe Picto Box, making the Nintendo Gallery sidequest easier; Aryll wears a skull dress given to her by pirates; Link can understand the
Hylian language ; and Link wears blue crayfish pajamas throughout the game instead of the traditional green
tunic
and cap.
Another popular sidequest present in all
Zelda
games, collecting pieces of heart, returns.
The Wind Waker
also includes the addition of hunting for Treasure Charts, which are scattered throughout the Great Sea. The player must find, recover, and hunt for whatever is on the map. Treasures include rupees, pieces of heart, and other various charts such as the "Big Octo Chart" and the "Island Platforms Chart."
[ edit ]
Wind and travel
Link uses the Wind Waker to control the wind.
The Wind Waker
is set on a sea consisting of 49 sections arranged on a seven by seven grid. Each section contains an
island
or small group of islands. Therefore, a significant portion of the game is spent
sailing
between islands, allowing the game to mask loading times by accessing data while the player is approaching an island.
To sail between areas quickly, Link uses the Wind Waker, a
baton
that manipulates wind direction with a series of songs. Additionally, wind is often needed to solve
puzzles . The Deku Leaf allows Link to use wind to spin
turbines
or to float for short distances. By creating a
tailwind , Link can float farther distances to reach remote areas. An on-screen
weather vane
displays the current wind direction.
[ edit ]
Tingle Tuner
A new item to the
Zelda
series  the Tingle Tuner  allows the player to receive assistance from
Tingle . Use of the Tingle Tuner requires a player to attach a
Game Boy Advance
(GBA) to the
GameCube
using a
Nintendo GameCube-Game Boy Advance cable . The GBA, which controls Tingle on a map more detailed than the one provided by the GameCube, can be operated by a second person, or the player can choose to alternate between the GameCube and the GBA. Among other services, Tingle can uncover hidden treasures, give hints, restore Link's health, or sell a few items. These services are provided for a fee, but Link can earn
discounts
through the completion of sidequests. Use of the Tingle Tuner is optional, but the ability to examine a more detailed map and place remote bombs is often helpful. Players who want to complete every sidequest will find the Tingle Tuner necessary; Tingle
statues
hidden throughout dungeons can only be found by using Tingle and the Nintendo Gallery sidequest cannot be completed without first completing a separate sidequest requiring the Tingle Tuner.

Development and history
Feeling pressure from
Sega 's
Dreamcast
and
Sony 's impending
PlayStation 2 , Nintendo announced on
3 March
1999
that a new video game system was under development. This system, the
GameCube , was revealed on
24 August
2000 , the day before Nintendo's
SpaceWorld
2000 exposition. [2]
Along with the specifications and designs for the console, Nintendo had several software demonstrations on-hand to showcase the power of the GameCube, one of which was a realistically-styled
real-time
duel between
Ganon
and
Link . Despite being a hastily assembled
technical demonstration , fans and the media speculated that the battle might be from a game under development or at least an indication of the direction the next
Zelda
game would take. [3]
Staff at
IGN
referred to the demo as an "unofficial sequel", calling it "absolutely everything we could have hoped for in a Gamecube Zelda title" and stating that "the future looks very bright for Nintendo loyalists". [3]
Nintendo said nothing more about the possibility of a GameCube
Zelda
game until one year later at SpaceWorld 2001, where a completely new
Zelda
was shown. Replacing the dark, gritty demo of 2000 was a new
cel-shaded
look, which resembled an interactive
cartoon .
Shigeru Miyamoto
said the new look was designed to "extend Zelda's reach to all ages". [4]
The cel-shaded approach was a radical shift and IGN staff wondered if two separate games might be in concurrent development.
An interesting note is at night time, 2 star formations are seen( the stars making the formation are really bright) Also, there are only 5 moon phases, the new moon and 2 half moon phases are absent from the game. ( the ring light chart proves this) [5]
While some at the event enjoyed the new look, there was a backlash from disappointed fans who had been expecting a realistic
Zelda
game. Many critics referred to the game as "Celda", a
portmanteau
of Zelda and
Cel-shading . Miyamoto was surprised at the reaction to the footage and the media's claim that Nintendo was shifting its focus to a younger audience
[6]
and he refused to reveal anything further until a playable demonstration became available. It was hoped that once critics played the game, they would focus on the all-important gameplay, rather than simply reacting to the new graphic style.
Miyamoto promised a playable version for
E3
2002 and a release later that year. [7]
When Nintendo did exhibit a playable demo at E3 2002 it was well-received. An editor at IGN said the cartoon look "works very nicely" and that "it feels very much like Zelda". [8]
The whimsical style was compared to
A Link to the Past
and promotional artwork from previous
Zelda
games. E3 also introduced new features, such as the ability to connect to the
Game Boy Advance
and receive help from
Tingle . [9]
On
15 October
2002 , the Japanese subtitle
Kaze no Takuto
( Takt of Wind ) was revealed, to emphasize the role of wind in the game. [10]
Nintendo announced the official translation,
The Wind Waker , on
2 December
2002 , [11]
and a
North American
release date of
24 March
2003
was set two days later. [12]
A new
Zelda
game using a heavily modified version of
The Wind Waker
engine has recently released for the GameCube and
Wii . This game,
The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess , features darker, more realistic graphics while retaining some cel-shaded elements.
[ edit ]
Bundling
On
22 November
2002 , an update to Nintendo's Japanese
Kaze no Takuto
website revealed that a special
bonus disc
was being offered to
pre-ordering
customers. [13]
This bonus GameCube disc, given at the time of the pre-order, contained an emulated version of
Ocarina of Time
and
Ura Zelda , an expansion for
Ocarina of Time
with modified dungeons and other small changes that never saw a North American release due to the failure of the
Nintendo 64DD . On
4 December
2002
this offer was extended to North American consumers, with
Ura Zelda
translated to
Ocarina of Time Master Quest . [14]
Some retailers made the mistake of giving the bonus discs away then allowing consumers to cancel their pre-orders without returning the disc. As a result, the European bonus disc was included with
The Wind Waker
in a two-disc case. [15]
On
17 November
2003 , Nintendo released a new GameCube bundle that included
The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition , a compilation disc containing versions of
The Legend of Zelda ,
Zelda II: The Adventure of Link ,
Ocarina of Time ,
Majora's Mask , a twenty-minute playable demo of
The Wind Waker , and two short
featurettes . The disc was also given to consumers who registered a GameCube and two games at Nintendo's website or subscribed or renewed a subscription to
Nintendo Power . [16]
Wal-Mart
customers could buy a special
Nintendo GameCube
bundle, including
The Wind Waker , the
Ocarina of Time
bonus disc (each in the same case), and a
Nintendo GameCube-Game Boy Advance cable
for a limited time. In Australia,
The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition
was available with the purchase of two GameCube games or a GameCube console; Australians can also purchase a bundle with the console,
The Wind Waker
and
The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition
for a limited time.

The Wind Waker
is the fourth of six games to receive a perfect score from
Famitsu
magazine, despite claims that it lacks the sense of newness that accompanied
Ocarina of Time , the first 3D
Zelda
game. [20]
Reviewers favorably noted the gameplay similarities to
Ocarina of Time
and praised the cel-shaded art style that had initially met a cold reception.
GamePro
called the game "a combination of vivid artistry and timeless gameplay"; [21]
IGN
advised gamers to "forget that
Wind Waker
looks totally different from
Ocarina of Time " since "these two games are very much alike". [22]
The 2004
Game Developers Choice Awards
and the Seventh Annual
Interactive Achievement Awards
gave
The Wind Waker
awards for Excellence in Visual Arts [23]
and Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction, [24]
respectively.
The game's most common criticism is the heavy emphasis on sailing.
GameSpot
noted that the game "starts out in a very brisk manner", but that in the last third of the game, the "focus on sailing ... is pretty tedious". [1]
IGN complained that viewing the animation of using the Wind Waker "hundreds of times" became "a tedious nuisance", and that the lack of an option to skip the animation "is more bothersome still". [22]
Some critics also felt that the game was easier than previous
Zelda
games.
GameSpot
thought that some players would be "a little put off" by the "easy puzzles and boss battles"; IGN called the boss battles "slightly simplistic" and noted that enemies "inflict little damage onto Link".
GamePro , on the other hand, felt that the dungeons tended to be "huger and more challenging with new twists", with treasure hunts that would "tax even the most accomplished Zelda gamer". [21]
Despite these negative comments, critics consistently gave
The Wind Waker
high reviews, with
Nintendo Power
calling the game the fourth best game to ever appear on a Nintendo console. [25]
The game also met commercial success, propelling sales of the GameCube console [26]
and becoming the most successful pre-order campaign in Nintendo history. [27]
The Wind Waker
is the 13 th
highest selling game of the 21st century. [28]

Story
The story begins with the land of Hyrule being in a state of fear due to strange happenings that have occurred in recent days. On a stormy night, Princess Zelda and the shrine maidens fear that the reason for these events is that Vaati's seal is weakening. She summons Link and brings him to the castle so he can protect her and the other maidens while they open the portal to the Four Sword Sanctuary. When they do however, a dark figure appears from the portal. This figure was Dark Link who then kidnapped the shrine maidens and sealed them in crystals. Link follows him to the sanctuary where he retrieves the Four Sword to destroy this evil version of himself. When he does, Vaati is once again released and wreaks havoc on the once peaceful kingdom.
As the game progresses, Link learns that the creation of his evil counterpart and the release of Vaati is only a small part in an insidious plot to take control of Hyrule. Things complicate as the dimension of the Dark World appears and people are being abducted throughout Hyrule. Link learns that not only have the knights of Hyrule mysteriously disappeared, but evil versions of them have been creating havoc. The castle has been taken over and monsters were appearing everywhere.
It's revealed later in the game that the true villain is none other than Ganon, King of Darkness. He has stolen a powerful trident and used it to take control of parts of Hyrule. He stole the dark mirror and used it to create Dark Link and then sent him to kidnap the shrine maidens and trick Link into releasing Vaati. Ganon wanted to gain control of as much power as possible and build up his army. To this end, he wants to take control of the shrine maidens' power as well as abducting people and sending them into the Dark World where they would become part of his army. Vaati furthered his plans by creating monsters to add to his army and allowed Ganon to use his power to transform Hyrule into a land of darkness. It is also revealed that the knights of Hyrule were murdered by Ganon and their souls were trapped in the Dark World where they became creatures of Darkness. Link eventually saves the shrine maidens, retrieves the Dark Mirror, destroys Dark Link and Vaati, and faces Ganon in an ultimate showdown. Link defeats Ganon and seals him firmly in the Four Sword. Peace returns to Hyrule and the people celebrate as all traces of the evil that plagued Hyrule are vanquished.
[ edit ]
Gameplay
The main mode of
Four Swords Adventures
is Hyrulean Adventure, an episodic, cooperative multiplayer adaptation of the conventional
Legend of Zelda
gameplay. Shadow Battle is a competitive multiplayer battle mode. Navi Trackers, present only in the Japanese version of the game (and displayed briefly at
E3
before the US release), is a multiplayer stamp rally race.
[ edit ]
Hyrulean Adventure
Hyrulean Adventure is the main campaign
Four Swords Adventures , and can be played by one to four players. It consists of eight worlds, each with three stages and a
boss
battle. The graphics are similar to that of the Game Boy Advance version, but the maps are static rather than randomly generated and the game includes GameCube-designed effects taken from
The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker . Music is based on that of
A Link to the Past
but is rearranged in places.
In Hyrulean Adventure, most of the same mechanics as the previously-released
Four Swords
for the
Game Boy Advance
(GBA) are used. The multiplayer version requires each player to have a GBA, which is used as a controller and to which the action transfers when that player's character goes off the main screen, but the single player game may be played with either a GameCube controller or a GBA. There are always four Link characters (differentiated by different colors: the main green, red, blue and purple) in play, regardless of the number of people playing; "extra" Links are attached to those directly controlled and positioned around the controlling character. Normally, the extra Links just follow the player, but players can separate an individual Link and control it alone, or put the four Links into formations. These techniques are required to solve some puzzles and defeat certain enemies.
Players are also allowed to play mini-games at Tingle's Towers (in multiplayer mode) found in every world, to gain extra multiplayer lives. These eight games are earned by playing though certain stages in multiplayer mode. The mini-games include horse racing, a hammer tag, monster hunting, and five others.
[ edit ]
Shadow Battle
In Shadow Battle, two or more players battle each other until only one is left standing. As in Hyrulean Adventure, each player uses a different-colored Link character and wields various tools to attack the other Links. Initially, there are five stages which players can choose to fight in. Five bonus maps are unlocked upon completion of Hyrulean Adventure (these "dark stages" are almost the same as the first five maps, but the player has limited vision). In each stage, items randomly appear. These are usually similar to the items in Hyrulian Adventure. There are also many special objects in each stage. Players can use these objects to their advantage. There is also a time limit; when it reaches zero, Vaati arrives, meaning an instant tie.
[ edit ]
Navi Trackers
Navi Trackers (formerly planned as a stand alone game titled
Tetra's Trackers ) is only on the Japanese version of
Four Swords Adventures
( Four Swords + ). In this game, multiple players, using a combination of the
television
screen and Game Boy Advances, search for members of
Tetra 's pirate gang (Tetra is a pirate captain in
The Wind Waker ) to gain stamps from them, as many as possible within a given time limit. All action takes place on the
Game Boy Advance
used by each player, with the television screen showing a basic map and Tetra narrating the action.
Unlike most other
Zelda
games, players could enter their name as well as choose their gender; however they played as one of the Links regardless of this choice.
Unique in the
Zelda
series (except, to an extent,
BS
The Legend of Zelda: Stone Tablets of Antiquity ), Tetra and her pirate crew have full voiceovers in place of text-only dialog, with Tetra also synthesizing the two-character name that each player inputs at the beginning of the sessionpossibly why this game was not localized for the English release. In an early version of the game showed to review sites Tetra apparently spoke Englishreportedly, one line was something like " Let's hear it for Mrs. A! "and was able to pronounce at least some synthesized phonetic letters, A, B, C, and D, as shown in screenshots (it is to be assumed the full alphabet was available).
However, while the two-symbol rule worked fine for Japanese players, English is written with the
Latin alphabet
and has much more complex
spelling
and
phonetical
constraints. For example, if a player's name was Sarah that is two
syllables , so if a soundalike equivalent of that name was entered via Japanese characters, Tetra could easily pronounce "Sar-ahh" as a fairly realistic representation of the player's name. But this would not work with the Japanese version's implementation of English characters. Each of the two permissible characters being pronounced, the aforementioned player's name could only be "SA". Since the English voice had already been added, this technical barrier is the likeliest reason for its omission.
A single-player mode is also available, either collecting alone or in competition with
Tingle , the aspiring fairy found also in
Majora's Mask ,
Oracle of Ages ,
The Wind Waker
and
The Minish Cap .
[ edit ]
Development
Despite the fact that all translation for the PAL Version were finished in October, the game did not see its way to Europe until early January 2005. Reasons for the delay is unknown, but many may argue that
The Minish Cap ' s earlier release was compensation for the delayed release of
FSA . Though, some say this isn't enough compensation, as it was out in the US about two months after it's European release, while
Four Sword Adventures
was delayed for six (from the US release) or four based on the official release of the translation being finished.
[ edit ]
Comics
A
manga
novelization of the game was authored by the manga-ka
Akira Himegawa . In it, each of the four Links have a distinct personality: the Link in green (nicknamed "Green") acted similarly to his normal self, aggressive and brave, the Link in red ("Red") was portrayed as a childish optimist, the one in blue ("Blue") was quick-tempered and over-confident, and the one in violet ("Vio") was aloof and self-possessive. This of course caused the four Links to argue amongst one another due to their conflicting personas. The four decided to use nicknames of the color they're wearing so they wouldn't confuse each other.

The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap
( ゼルダの伝説 ふしぎのぼうし ,
Zeruda no Densetsu Fushigi no Bōshi ? , lit. "The Legend of Zelda: The Mysterious Hat")
is a
The Legend of Zelda series
game for the
Nintendo
Game Boy Advance
released in
2004
in Japan and Europe, and
2005
in North America. It was not developed by Nintendo, but instead by
Flagship , with Nintendo overseeing the development process.
The Minish Cap
is the first original single-player
Zelda
adventure to be released for a handheld platform since
The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages
and
Seasons
in
2001
(though the original multiplayer game
Four Swords
was included with the
2002
Game Boy Advance release of
A Link to the Past ).
Minish Cap
is the third
Zelda
game to be released that concerns the legend of the
Four Sword , the other games being
The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords
and
The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures . The game is based around the idea of a magical 'cap' called Ezlo that
Link
can use to shrink to the size of the
Picori
(who call themselves the Minish), a race of thumb size people that live in
Hyrule .

The mystical creature Ezlo helps Link find his way through the most dangerous parts of Hyrule kingdom in
The Minish Cap .
The Minish Cap
game reveals some background information about the story in
The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords
and
Four Swords Adventures .
A Long, Long time ago, when Hyrule was about to be consumed by darkness, the tiny picori descended from the sky, and bestowed upon a young boy dressed in green a sword and a shining golden light. With wisdom and courage, the young hero drove out the darkness. Now, every 100 years the Picori return to Hyrule, to provide humans with magical gifts.
The coming of the Picori is celebrated in Hyrule with a large fair and a sword fighting tournament called the Picori Festival. On one such day,
Princess Zelda
and her childhood friend
Link , grandson of Smith the royal blacksmith, decide to visit Hyrule town to join the festivities. These are short-lived however, as the winner of the tournament, the unknown stranger
Vaati , is in fact a powerful sorcerer who breaks the Picori Blade and turns Zelda to stone.
In
Hyrule Castle
the king of Hyrule and his counselor Potho are desperate to bring Zelda back home. They place all their hopes in the tiny Picori who had been invaluable allies, and send Link to seek the legendary beings' help. It is an old belief in Hyrule that the Picori show themselves only to children.
On his way to Minish Woods, home of the Minish, Link rescues Ezlo, a strange being resembling a green
cap
with a bird head, who joins him in his quest and can make Link shrink to the size of the Minish themselves through a ritual he can perform on Minish altars. Link then meets the Forest Minish elder Gentari, who tells him that to restore power in the magic sword broken by Vaati, he must find four elemental artifacts and imbue the blade with their essence. He directs Link and Ezlo to Melari on Mt. Crenel, as Melari is the only one who can fix the broken sword. When Link meets Melari he gives the sword to him and goes on to a human mine for the second element. When he comes back Melari tells him about the elemental sanctuary found in Hyrule Castle. Only after he fuses the four elements can he face Vaati and defeat him.
It is later revealed that both Ezlo and Vaati were once Minish, Ezlo being a renowned sage and craftsman and Vaati his apprentice. Vaati eventually became corrupted by the madness and egotism of men and took a magic hat Ezlo had made for the humans in Hyrule. The hat granted the bearer any wishes, and Vaati chose to become a powerful sorcerer. He then turned his old master, who had tried to stop him, into a hat. Devoured by his desire for power, Vaati took a twisted, vile appearance and set out to search for the mystic Light Force of Hyrule, which would make him even stronger.
When Link completes the Picori blade (also known as the Four Sword), Vaati turns Hyrule Castle into Dark Hyrule Castle - the final dungeon in the game. Link gets to Vaati just before he drains Zelda of all the Light Force (this would kill her), but the Wind Sorcerer states that he already has enough power to defeat Link. Link then fights Vaati in two different forms, the first being a larger form of himself and the second being a large sphere with an eye, and prevails. He frees Zelda from her curse as the castle is collapsing, and then he and the Princess go to the elemental shrine to avoid being crushed. Vaati was waiting there for Link, and faces him one more time. His final form is like his previous form but with arms, and seeming to be indestructible at first. Link managed to defeat the evil Minish again. Vaati disappears, after saying that he is confused as to how Link beat him, claiming he has the power of a god. Ezlo floats off of Link's head and is returned to his original form. He finds the cap of wishes he created and gives it to Zelda, since she has a pure heart, saying "Let your wishes come true!" The cursed people are cured and the castle is turned back to normal. The doorway to the Minish world is closing and Ezlo states he must go. He says he enjoyed his time with Link, and in return provides him with a cap, saying, "I have never seen you with a cap until now, it fits you, little hero." He shrinks down and goes through the doorway, just as it vanishes.

Characters
Link
is the hero of the
Zelda
series. In this game he is the grandson of the Royal Blacksmith.
Princess Zelda
is frequently a
damsel in distress
(though sometimes a heroine) of the
Zelda
games. In
Minish Cap , she and Link are childhood friends. In this game, she's been turned to stone by Vaati.
Ezlo
is a talking green hat that resembles a bird. He was once a Minish sorcerer that was changed into this form by Vaati.
Vaati
is the main villain of the
Zelda
games involving the Four Sword. He is a Minish sorcerer who seeks a "light force" to conquer Hyrule.
The Minish
are a tiny,
gnome -like race of people who traveled from their land to Hyrule. The relative size of a Minish is about that of a human's thumb. Despite this, they possess magical abilities to forge and make magical items, and they purposely tend to leave them where humans can find them. It is said that the Minish will only show themselves to children. Various types of Minish live throughout Hyrule.
The
Forest Minish
live in the fields and forests. They like to leave
Rupees
and other various items hidden in the grass for adventurers to find. Minish Village is the highest concentration of Minish in the entire land of Hyrule and is solely populated by Forest Minish. They don't hate humans, but instead like to keep their distance away from them and help them from afar. They tend to wear red caps.
The
Town Minish
love humans so much that they live near or in the cities of Hyrule. Town Minish do various things for the humans, including making shoes for Rem, baking goods for Wheaton and Pita, cleaning, sorting books in the Hyrule Library, etc. They have a good relationship with the Forest Minish and are visited often by them. Their clothing is different from Forest Minish, and they mainly have blue caps instead of red.
The
Mountain Minish
are a special type of Minish that live solely in the mountains. Their primary jobs are mining and smithing items. Mountain Minish tend to sing a special song, called the Ting Tong Song, while working, but this is a privilege given to Minish who are accepted as full-fledged Mountain Minish. Their caps tend to be orange coloured.

Gameplay
Screenshot of gameplay
The Minish Cap
features a number of enhancements that benefit from the more powerful Game Boy Advance platform and draws heavily on the gameplay of previous Zelda titles. The game's camera angle is much closer to the ground, allowing more detail. In the overworld and in
dungeons , the game replaces the traditional item interface with pictures associating items or actions with buttons on the Game Boy handheld, similarly to the item interface in
3D
titles like
Ocarina of Time
and
The Wind Waker . Enemies include familiar creatures from the
Zelda
universe, such as the
Keatons . Link can also perform special actions, triggered by the L and R buttons. With the R button, Link can, for example, roll while running; a move also inspired by 3D
Zelda
games.
[ edit ]
Kinstones
Link
(right) digs in his Kinstone Bag for a piece that will match the one held by the Picori (left).
Kinstones are special artifacts which Link can find throughout his quest. Kinstone pieces are fragments of a complete
medallion . In order to successfully form a complete Kinstone, two pieces of the same color and with complementary notches must be used.
After completing the first dungeon, Link receives a Kinstone Bag. This allows him to collect and store the pieces he finds or receives. The most common variety of Kinstone piece is green, with blue being slightly rarer and red considerably rare. There are also special gold pieces that are used to make fusions that advance the story. These gold fusions are the only required fusions; the others are completely optional and are not needed to finish the game.
Throughout the game world there are characters holding Kinstone pieces waiting for a matching piece to fuse with. They are identified by thought bubbles appearing above their heads when Link approaches; the symbol in the thought bubble gives an indication of what sort of special event the fusion will result in.
Different kinds of Kinstones
For example, fusing Kinstones can reveal a secret passageway in a different area, or make a
treasure chest
appear. Green Kinstones are, with few exceptions, minor things such as golden enemies and treasure chests due to this color's abundance, while the rarer red and blue Kinstones often produce unique results, such as
beanstalks
and Pieces of Heart, inspiring characters to perform a certain task or sell a certain item, and so forth.
[ edit ]
Figurines
The Minish Cap
also features a
figurine -based sidequest, similar to that in
The Wind Waker . The player can collect Mysterious
Shells , which sometimes appear when defeating enemies and can also be found or bought in different locations throughout the world. These can then be used in a
gashapon -like machine in Hyrule Town to obtain figurines of characters, enemies or locations that Link has encountered in the course of the main quest. New figurines only become available once Link has met or killed the subject of that figurine. Each figurine has a short description revealing information about the game, that particular enemy's weaknesses, or the series in general. The
probability
to win a previously uncollected figurine from the machine can be increased by spending more shells at once, with an increase of 1% per shell. There are a total of 136 unique figurines for Link to collect.
[ edit ]
Development
The Minish Cap
is artistically very reminiscent of its predecessors
The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords ,
The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures , and
The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker
as it features the same cartoon-inspired visuals. Link, as well as several other characters in the game, strongly resemble characters in
The Wind Waker , although some characters' visuals take their cue from the
Nintendo 64
titles
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
and
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask .

Plot
Spoiler warning :
Plot and/or ending details follow.
The game begins with
Link
living in Ordon Village, working as a ranch hand. He is asked by Rusl, the village's blacksmith, to deliver the Ordon Sword to
Hyrule Castle . Before he can begin his journey, Link, the mayor's daughter Ilia, and Rusl's son Colin are ambushed by a group of monsters. Ilia and Colin are kidnapped, and Link is knocked unconscious. Upon awakening, he pursues them, only to be pulled into the Twilight Realm, transformed into a wolf, and imprisoned in a castle. An imp-like creature named
Midna
helps him escape from his cell, and the two join forces.
Link and Midna travel through the castle until they meet another one of its prisoners -
Princess Zelda
herself. She explains that a member of a race known as the Twili is trying to merge the Twilight Realm and
Hyrule
to fuse them into one land of darkness. In order to defeat the king who rules over twilight, Midna is searching for a forbidden weapon called the Fused Shadow that she can use to defeat the evil king and save the Twilight Realm. However, Midna cares nothing for the fate of Hyrule.
During the quest to assemble this weapon, it is discovered that the Twili are a race of beings who were banished to the Twilight Realm by the gods of Hyrule. The Twili were interlopers with great magic who went to the holy
Sacred Realm
in order to establish dominion over it, causing a war to break out in Hyrule. After these sorcerers became too powerful, the goddesses sent three light spirits to seal away the beings' magic, and sealed the beings themselves away into another realm known as the Twilight Realm. The Twili who are left are the descendants of the original beings who were banished. The goddesses created the Mirror of Twilight, a device to banish beings into the Twilight Realm (though it can also be used to enter the realm normally). [10]
After many trials, Link and Midna re-assemble the Fused Shadow. However, the king of the twilight, Zant, appears, takes the Fused Shadows, and curses Link by embedding a stone into his forehead causing him to be trapped in his wolf form, and fatally injures Midna. Zant leaves, and Link rushes Midna back to Hyrule Castle to seek aid from Princess Zelda. At Hyrule Castle,
Princess Zelda
reveals that the only way Link can return back to his normal form is to find the Master Sword. Midna's life is fading away, and Zelda sacrifices herself to save Midna by turning herself into light and putting herself in Midna, this allows Midna to be her normal self in the world of light, not just a shadow, Midna and Link then venture deep into the Sacred Grove, and obtain the Master Sword. He also gains the ability to transform between wolf and human form through use of the stone that cursed him and the Master Sword.
Midna explains that the only way to save Hyrule and stop Zant now is to find the Mirror of Twilight and use it to confront Zant with the Master Sword. However, when Link and Midna reach the Mirror, Zant had already broken it into four fragments. Only one fragment of the Mirror of Twilight is present. The ancient Sages who guard the Mirror appear, and reveal that an evil man named
Ganondorf
was sealed into the Twilight Realm after he was captured by the Sages. The Sages reveal that only the true ruler of the Twili could destroy the Mirror of Twilight, and that Zant could only fragment it.
Link and Midna venture out and recover the fragments of the Mirror of Twilight, reconstruct the mirror, and use it to warp to the Twilight Realm, where Zant rules in the Palace of Twilight. Link and Midna confront Zant and finally learn that Zant was actually in line to become the true Twilight King, but was passed over. When Zant was passed over in the choice for ruler, he went into a crazed rage, and was approached by the spirit of Ganondorf, who selected him to be a vessel for his power and help him regain his previous power (and unknown to Zant, be his puppet). It is revealed that Midna is the true Twilight Princess, and was overthrown by Zant and turned into an imp using Ganondorf's power.
Link defeats Zant, who claims that as long as Ganondorf lives, he will revive Zant, this proves to be untrue as Midna accidentally
kills
him using the regained Fused Shadows, they were a lot more powerful than she realized. Link leaves and returns to Hyrule to save Zelda. The castle is engulfed by a barrier erected using Ganondorf's power, and Midna uses the Fused Shadow to break it. Link and Midna infiltrate Hyrule Castle and reach the top throne room to find Ganondorf sitting at the throne, and Zelda's lifeless body suspended above him. Ganondorf possesses Princess Zelda's body, and fights Link. Link wins the battle, and Midna then uses the Fused Shadow to purge Zelda of Ganondorf. He then turns into a beast-like form,
Ganon , and attacks Link. Link defeats him, and Midna returns Zelda's soul to her body. Before the three of them can celebrate, Ganon's soul appears. Midna warps Link and Zelda to safety in Hyrule Field, and then tries to destroy Ganon using the Fused Shadow.
As Link and Zelda appear in Hyrule Field, they turn to Hyrule Castle and see a giant explosion eminating from it. They then see Ganondorf on horseback, holding Midna's helmet  he has defeated her. Princess Zelda uses her magic power to summon the Light Spirits. The spirits bestow upon her the Light Arrows, and then Link and Zelda re-appear in Hyrule Field on Epona and battle Ganondorf. Ganondorf falls in battle, but rises one last time to challenge Link to a one-on-one sword duel. In the end, Link defeats Ganondorf with the Master Sword. As Ganondorf stands impaled, the Triforce symbol fades from his hand. As this happens, Zant's neck snaps, killing him.
Now that the threat made by Ganon is over, Hyrule and the Twilight Realm are saved. Additionally, the curse that Zant put on Midna using Ganon's power has been lifted, and Midna regains her true form. After Link and Zelda are reunited with her, they travel to the Mirror of Twilight, to see Midna off before she returns home. Before Midna warps away, she shatters the Mirror of Twilight with a tear, sealing off the link between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm. Link is then seen riding away from his home town after staking the Master Sword in the Sacred Grove.
Spoilers end here.
Gameplay
Twilight Princess
features a stylized, naturalistic art style (similar to, but more advanced than, that found in
Ocarina of Time ), rather than the cel-shaded look that
The Wind Waker
exhibited  although it still makes use of
cel-shading
effects, using a very heavily modified version of
The Wind Waker s engine. [1]
In a further departure from
The Wind Waker ,
Link
is once again a young man, as opposed to a child, as in the latter part of
Ocarina of Time ,
Link's Awakening ,
A Link to the Past , and in
The Adventure of Link . The game also takes on a darker tone, rivaling that of
Majora's Mask . [11]
Link transforms into a wolf when entering the Twilight Realm, a void that has ensnared
Hyrule . This is not a wholly separate place like the Dark World in
A Link to the Past , but an evil transformation that slowly spreads across Hyrule. [12]
The Wii version uses the "point-and-click" of the Wii Remote as a "fairy" cursor, for accessing menus, and for using various tools such as the Hero's Bow, Clawshot, and Fishing Rod; it uses the Nunchuk attachment analog stick for movement. In order to swing the sword, the player makes a slashing motion with the Wii Remote. A jab with the tilt-sensitive Nunchuk will cause Link to perform one of his secret moves, the shield attack. To use Links spin attack, the player swings the Nunchuk horizontally.
In order to use items, the game allows the player to equip the items to the left, right, and down positions of the D-pad using the item screen (-). When an item's respective direction button is hit, the item is switched into the B button for easier use. The built-in speaker on the remote is used for sounds like the bowstring being drawn and released, as well as the classic  Zelda
chime. [13]
By comparison, the GameCube version uses a control scheme similar to
The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker , with the B button used for sword attacks, other items mapped to the X and Y buttons, the L button for lock-on, and the C-stick used for manual camera control. [14]
In
Twilight Princess , Link learns more moves than in any other
Legend of Zelda
game to date. Link also shares similar moves between human and wolf, for example when an enemy is on the ground, Link has the option to finish them off by plunging his sword into their chest or in wolf form (on
poes , to rip out their souls). Link can communicate with animals in wolf form as if they were people. When transformed into a wolf, Links sense of smell, is greatly improved. With these abilities come some disadvantages. While he is a wolf, Link cannot utilize any of his items, or open any doors with handles until he can transform into human.
There is no extensive voice acting in the game. The characters laugh, scream, and make other such noises, as they have in previous installments on the
Nintendo 64
and Nintendo GameCube.
Weapons and Items
See also:
Weapons and items from The Legend of Zelda series
Spoiler warning :
Plot and/or ending details follow.
Link first acquires a wooden sword, but later upgrades to the Ordon Sword (a regular metal sword) and then the Master Sword. In the Palace of Twilight, the Master Sword is infused with light. Link obtains a wooden shield early in the game called the Ordon Shield. Although this can catch fire (similar to the Deku Shield in
Ocarina of Time ), Link can replace it with the Wooden Shield, or the metallic Hylian Shield, which does not catch fire.
The Slingshot also returns from previous installments of the series. Link obtains this item early on in the game so that the player can get accustomed to aiming. A Lantern is also in the game. Any use of the Lantern drains the oil, for sale at certain places. The Dominion Rod is used to bring some statues to life, making them mimic Link. The game features many classic
Zelda
armaments, some with new twists, such as the Gale Boomerang. It can create a small whirlwind capable of picking up items. The Iron Boots also return, which can now be used in conjunction with magnetic surfaces to attach Link to the ceiling. Link has three types of bombs available: Bombs, Water Bombs (bombs that can be used in water), and Bomblings (bomb with legs, similar to Bombchu). Link can combine items such as the bombs and arrows to create bomb arrows, among other items. This recalls the same feature of
Link's Awakening
for the
Game Boy .
Twilight Princess
also introduces a new version of the Hookshot called the Clawshot. This item functions similarly to the Hookshot, except that Link can hang from the claw, and when hanging from a ceiling he can extend or retract the chain to move up or down (reminiscent of the Grappling Hook item in
The Wind Waker ). Later, he acquires a second Clawshot which he wears on his other hand, creating a pair dubbed the Double Clawshot, which allows him to extend one while holding on with the other.
There are three different outfits for Link: The original outfit he starts in, the green "Hero" tunic, another Magic Armor that makes Link invincible (though it quickly drains rupees while equipped and will make it heavier for him to walk once he runs out of Rupees) and a Zora Armor (with flippers and diving mask) that lets him breathe and swim freely underwater, yet increases the damage taken from fire and ice hazards. The Zora Armor is a gift from the late Zora queen for saving her son.
Classic items such as Potions and Bottles also return. Potions restore hearts. A new item that can be held in bottles is bee larva. They can be used as fishing bait, or to eat and regain a quarter of a heart per larva.
In wolf form, Link receives a "sense" ability which is somewhat similar to the Lens of Truth from previous games. [ citation needed ]
Using the sense ability, Link can track down certain characters by following their scents with his enhanced senses. As a wolf, he is also able to find and dig holes to find new passages and uncover buried items such as hearts and rupees. He can also search for Poes in his wolf form, which can only be attacked when using his wolf senses. These are collected for a side-quest.
The "Twilight Realm"
The Spinner is a large top-like object which Link uses to move over quicksand and attack enemies. It is also used to ride along tracks in Arbiter Grounds and other locations.
Another new item is the Ball and Chain, a heavy ball at the end of a chain which Link swings and uses to hit enemies and break through weak walls.
Golden bugs roam around Hyrule. Catching these bugs and giving them to a girl will give wallet upgrades.
A
heart container
now consists of five heart pieces instead of the traditional four.
Ooccoo is a character present in most dungeons. When discovered, she behaves as a warp item, much like Farore's Wind in
Ocarina of Time . She will let Link set a warp point inside a dungeon, and return to it later on.

is more advanced than in
The Wind Waker. [15]
Staple enemies such as
Keese
and
Moblins
return. Another classic enemy in the
Zelda
series,
Stalfos , appear. [ citation needed ]
A Stalfos is a walking skeleton, usually equipped with a shield and sword. Darknuts return, as well. They are more powerful than in previous installments. Removing their armor allows them use of their broadsword. Beamos make a comeback in
Twilight Princess . They are now stone blocks with red eyes on spinning heads, which shoot laser beams. The reptilian Lizalfos and Dinolfos return from
Ocarina of Time . A Skull Kid makes an appearance in Faron Woods's Sacred Grove. Skulltullas return with an overhauled appearance, now black with white stripes, instead of mostly white. They now drop from their webs and attack Link on the ground.
Twilight Princess
version of the Skulltula.
Poes return, and Link may collect their souls for trade. Link also encounters fire breathing lizards, Dodongos. Other returning enemies include Deku Babas, Stalchilds, Tektites, Wolfos, and Bokoblins. The Moblins and Bokoblins also appear in the game riding giant boars. All of these returning creatures have a darker, more detailed look. Some returning creatures are given more abilities, or lack there of. One such example are the Redead Knights of Arbiter's Grounds. While retaining the freezing scream of the Redeads present in both
Ocarina of Time
and
The Wind Waker , these new creatures attack with swords and have armor, traits that were not present in the previous incarnations. Also, it should be noted that the Octoroks do not make an appearance in this game. However, in one of the groves Wolf Link digs into, they seem to have evolved into a fish like creature that resides in the grove. The "Octofish" swim around in the water and then jump out to shoot rocks at Link.
There are several new enemies as well. Shadow Beings, from Portals from the Twilight Realm, attack Link in various locations. When they attack in groups, if one remains, it will revive all other beings. When a group is defeated, their portal can be used to warp. Shadow Insects must be destroyed in the twilight. They carry Tears Of Light, which restore power to the light spirits, purifying the land of twilight. A giant fly is fought at Lake Hylia as the last insect. There are new enemies called Wolf Stalfos which attack Link in several trailers. They look like skeletal wolves, and are another form of
Stalfos . The Wolf Stalfos appear at night when traveling across Hyrule Field.
Races
Goron
The
Goron
race has returned in the latest installment of the
Zelda
series. Aside from being taller, they retain many of the same features as the Gorons from past
Zelda
installments, only differing in that they now have a more rock like appearance with a rocky crust that can be seen on their head and back areas, and also wear tribal markings on their skin. Early on in the game they serve as enemies that attack Link upon noticing him, but it is possible to knock a Goron off balance by first blocking the attacks with a shield, or by dodging them, until the Goron begins to lose balance. The player can then strike the Goron, causing it to curl up and allowing the player to use it as a spring to reach higher areas. Using this method the player can get from one place to others which are normally unreachable. The Gorons are found around Death Mountain near the beginning of the game, and later around Kakariko Village once the player has obtained the second Fused Shadow.
A much larger Goron featured in early game artwork serves as a Mini-Boss in the second dungeon guarding the Hero's Bow. This Goron is noticibly different as it is much larger than most Gorons (albeit not as large as Biggoron featured in
Ocarina Of Time ) and also features large pieces of metal grafted onto its back and arms.
Zora
The
Zora
people also make a comeback. They live along Zora River and Link plays an important role in helping the Zora with multiple tasks. The warriors of the Zora tribe now carry spears and wear distinct, fish-shaped helmets.
Sheikah
Though the name is not directly stated, Impaz is known to be a Sheikah because she said she was named after the one who made the Hidden Village ( Impa
from
Ocarina of Time ) and is in the same clan as they were. It could also be assumed the shaman of
Kakariko Village
is a Sheikah, as he has the characteristic cheek bones and lips that Impa, a fellow Sheikah, had. During
Ocarina of Time , many Sheikahs also resided in Kakariko Village, although that was some time before the events of
Twilight Princess .
Gerudo
The
Gerudo
race as a whole do not return, but Ganondorf does, and he himself is one. The desert to the east (or west, in the GameCube version) is also known as the Gerudo Desert. Also, the
barmaid , Telma, who is featured prominently in the story greatly resembles the Gerudo women of past games, although neither she nor anyone else makes any comment about her connection with them, ancestral or otherwise. Whether or not the Gerudo still exist is not known. The game hints that the Twili people of the Twilight realm are distant relatives, or ancestors, of the Gerudo race.
Twili
The latest race to be revealed in the
The Legend of Zelda
series is the Twili. Both Zant and Midna are members of this race, which was sealed away in the Twilight Realm long ago. They are the descendants of a group of mages who defied the gods and attempted to take over the sacred realm. As a result, they were banished for their actions.
Oocca
Another new race, the Oocca, are said to be an ancient race that created the Hylians. They are small creatures that have human like heads and birdlike bodies. They live in the City in the Sky which Link visits in order to find the last shard of the Twilight Mirror, before entering the Twilight Realm.
Ooccoo is the member of this race that can aid Link in each of the first 7 dungeons. Her main goal is to go back to her home, the City in the Sky, after finding the keeper of the "Dominion Rod". She has a child, Ooccoo Jr..
Places
Main article:
Places in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
Kakariko Village
Renado, a shaman, lives in Kakariko Village.
Lake Hylia
An expansive lake, Lake Hylia is the home to the
Lakebed Temple , underwater. Above water is a man selling transportation via cannon.
Lost Village
A barren, western-style town, the Lost Village was once occupied be protectors of the Royal Family of Hyrule. It is widely speculated that the race that previously lived in the town were the
Sheikah . This is reinforced by the fact that the only person in the town is named
Impaz , similar to the Sheikah Impa of
Ocarina of Time , who Impaz alludes to.
Ordon Village (Earlier known as Toaru Village, which means the word unnamed in Japanese)
Link starts his journey in Ordon Village. He helps many of the town residents, for example rescuing a woman's cradle. The mayor of Ordon Village asks Link to travel to Hyrule Castle.
Music
Music once again plays a role in
Twilight Princess . While Link does not carry a musical instrument of any type until well into the game, he can pick grass from certain patches and whistle with it to call an animal, either a Hawk or Epona (later on, an instrument shaped similarly to the grass used to summon Epona is given to Link and has the same effect as the aforementioned grass). Also, while as a wolf Link can howl near the same patches, to the same effect. When Link is in his wolf form, there are "howling stones" located around the world where, after Link howls a certain melody shown onscreen a few times, a golden wolf appears and jumps somewhere else in the world. Link must then change back to his human form and find the wolf to learn a hidden sword technique. Some of the songs howled by Wolf Link are songs learned in previous games, such as the Oath to Order, and Song of healing from
Majora's Mask
and the Minuet of Forest from
Ocarina of Time .
In a first for the
Zelda
series, at least part of the soundtrack has been orchestrated as opposed to using
MIDI . [16]
The fact that Nintendo has decided to use mostly
MIDI
for the soundtrack, however, has been a point of criticism. MIDI allows the background music to be more dynamic, but the sound quality suffers.
Koji Kondo , the lead composer for the game's soundtrack, originally stated that he "would really like to push for" the music to be orchestrated. [17]
Part of the full soundtrack is received when a
Nintendo Power
subscription is purchased (the subscription also comes with a game guide for
Twilight Princess ).
Development
A number of rumors about the game were confirmed at Eł 2005. The official title,
The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
was announced. (The title was actually first revealed in a pre-Eł scan from
Game Informer . [18] [19] )
The game falls chronologically about a hundred years after
Ocarina of Time , though the reference to being before
The Wind Waker
has been omitted in recent interviews with the developers. [20]
Interviews and a playable demo exposed many new details, such as Link beginning the game as a ranch-hand, Link battling on horseback, changes in the horse controls from
Ocarina of Time , thematic differences between dungeons, and so on. [21]
The game received
Game Critics Awards
at E3 2005 for Best Console Game and Best Action/Adventure Game [22] , and the award of Best Playable Game at E3 2005 by
G4 TV 's
X-Play .
Twilight Princess
received the same awards, except for Best Console Game, at E3 2006 as well.
The game was delayed extensively; Its original release date was somewhere in
November 2005 , until
August 16 ,
2005 , when Nintendo announced it would be released some time after
March 31 ,
2006 , because the development team needed more time to work on the game. [6]
In February, Reggie Fils-Aime stated in an interview on
Spike TV
that
Twilight Princess
would be released in the Fall of 2006, [23]
well past the expected spring or early summer release but still in time for the holiday shopping season. At Nintendos pre-Eł 2006 press conference, Reggie Fils-Aime announced that two versions would be released simultaneously in the Americas: one for GCN, and one for Wii.
On
September 15 ,
2006 , Nintendo officially announced the release dates of
Twilight Princess . The Wii, along with the Wii version of
Twilight Princess , was released first on
November 19 ,
2006
in
North America , with the GameCube version coming on
December 12 ,
2006 . Both the GameCube and the Wii version launched simultaneously in
Japan
on
December 2 ,
2006 .
Europe
and
Australia
saw the Wii-version launched on
December 8 ,
2006
and
December 7 ,
2006
respectively, while the GameCube-version was launched on
December 15 ,
2006
and
December 14 ,
2006
respectively.
Character art, depicting the new Link
The cloaked figure, first revealed in the opening of the third official trailer released by Nintendo at E3 in 2005, is Zelda, wearing traditional
funeral
robes and bearing a
rapier
at her side. On this cloak there is also shown a
Sheikah
symbol.
According to statements from Nintendo, such as from translator and localization manager
Bill Trinen , it took the Twilight Princess game testers an average of 70 hours to beat the game on the first run-through. He stated that he was working on his second play-through of the game and even knowing what to do, where to go, and skipping cut-scenes, he had logged about 27 hours to make it about two thirds of the way through the temples themselves - and that didn't account for any of the side quests or time sinks like fishing. [24]
Twilight Princess
on Wii
British publication
NGC Magazine
claimed, in December 2005, that when the GameCube version is played on Wii, the player will be given the option of using
Wiis unique controller ; [25]
and it was not suspected that two versions of the game would be released. Reggie Fils-Aime denied these claims, stating that across the board, GCN games played on Wii would not be compatible with Wii's controller. [26]
Nintendo of France Director of Marketing Mathieu Minel stated in a subsequent interview with Jeux-France that
Twilight Princess
would include Wii controller functionality one way or another, [ citation needed ]
but Nintendo quickly requested that this be removed from the interview. [27]
In the end, however,
Shigeru Miyamoto
himself was reported to have confirmed the Wii controller functionality in an interview with Nintendo of Europe. [28]
Time
reported this also soon after. [29] [30]
Finally, at Eł
2006 , Nintendo announced that there would be two versions of
Twilight Princess : one for GameCube (released on
December 12 ,
2006 ), and one for Wii (released on its launch date,
November 19 ,
2006 ).
Shigeru Miyamoto had said in an interview that the only differences between the GameCube and Wii versions of the
Twilight Princess
are technical [31]
(as described above). The Wii version also displays in a 16:9 (wide screen) format in 480p, where the GameCube version plays only in 4:3 [32] .
In the Wii version of
Twilight Princess , Link is
right-handed , despite his famous
left-hand
preference. Miyamoto noticed that players preferred wielding their "swords" right-handed, but by that point, all the maps, bosses and models had already been designed with a left-handed stance in mind. The "simplest" solution was to invert the entire game horizontally. (Ironically, there is no mode for left-handed people.) In the GameCube version, Link remains left-handed, and the maps and player guides for the two versions are mirror versions of each other. [33]

The game has universally received positive reviews in printed and online media. The review from the US portal of
IGN
claimed it was the greatest Zelda game ever created, beating
Ocarina of Time
(itself often featuring in lists of
the greatest games of all time ). Most reviews have praised its art direction.
Reviewers have criticized some aspects of the game's design. Reviewing the Wii version,
GameSpot
reviewer
Jeff Gerstmann
complained about the feeling of "tacked-on" Wii controls and out-dated graphics, a consequence of the game being designed primarily for the older GameCube platform.
At
Game Rankings , a web site that compiles game reviews and averages reviewers' scores, both versions of
Twilight Princess
have achieved an average of 95%, making them the 11th and 12th highest-reviewed games ever. The Wii version is currently the highest-ranked Wii game.
At
Metacritic , another review aggregate site,
Twilight Princess
has received an overall average of 95 out of 100, 4 points fewer than
Ocarina of Time .
The game received
Spike TV 's Critic's Choice
Video Game Award [45]
Also, the game won
Game of the Year
along with
Best Action Adventure Game
on
X-Play .
[3]
Sales
During its first week of sales,
The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
sold 454,000 copies in United States, [46]
and 139,011 during its first two days in Japan. [47]
Glitches
Not long after Wii version of
Twilight Princess
was released, a glitch was discovered that renders a player's saved game uncompletable. In the latter half of the game the player must find a room containing a large cannon and warp it to a specific location. However, should the player save their game and quit in this room before warping, a glitch occurs upon their return which prevents them from leaving the room or warping the cannon out. Since the glitch is a result of saving inside an enclosed room, it is not possible to restart the game and appear in a different location. At this point, the player is completely stuck and must restart his file or transfer another save file via SD card to their Wii.
It is unknown whether or not Nintendo will release a patch through download with the Wii's online update function.
The glitch is not found in the GameCube version.

The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass
( ゼルダの伝説 夢幻の砂時計 ,
Zeruda no Densetsu Mugen no Sunadokei ? , lit. "The Legend of Zelda: Infinite Hourglass")
is an upcoming
video game
in
Nintendo s
The Legend of Zelda
series , for the
Nintendo DS . It will feature
3D
cel-shaded
graphics with an overhead camera perspective primarily, but incorporating different views based on context.
The graphics take a similar style to
The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker , and it is confirmed by the Nintendo of America website that this is the official sequel of this game. The game was unveiled along with a trailer by
Satoru Iwata
during his keynote address at the 2006
Game Developers Conference
in San Jose. Phantom Hourglass will be released in North America on October 15th, 2007. [2]

Gameplay
Phantom Hourglass
uses the lower Nintendo DS screen for gameplay and the upper for maps.
The gameplay is mostly overhead, similar to most 2D
The Legend of Zelda
titles, but the character models and the environments are in 3D. The rendering environment is similar to
Animal Crossing
for the
Nintendo GameCube , and somewhat like the
Nintendo DS sequel
to
Animal Crossing . The touch screen is used to show the main gameplay, used to control Link, or to solve puzzles (such as the hourglass shape at the beginning of the trailer shown at GDC), while the upper screen is mostly used as a map screen. The map can also be brought down to the touch screen, allowing the player to write notes on it. It will also be used to create a taller screen in some events, such as the battle scene in the trailer. All boss battles will use both the top and bottom screen. [1]
The microphone will be used in some way as well. [1]
Link will have a fairy yet again, similar to
Navi
and
Tatl
from
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
and
The Legend of Zelda: Majoras Mask , respectively. The fairy acts as the cursor for touch screen input with the stylus, as the trailer shows the fairy directing Link.
There will be sailing in this title similar to the sailing system found in
The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker . Instead of a sail boat however, a steam boat is Links mode of transportation, requiring no manipulation of the wind. The boats course is plotted ahead of time using the stylus, allowing the player to concentrate on attacking foes with its cannon as the boat travels to its destination point.
There is one "master dungeon" that Link must complete in the game. However, he can only make limited progress, and must work through other dungeons before he is able to proceed further in the primary dungeon. [1]
In the "master dungeon" and other locales there are enemies known as "Chasers". These enemies follow the player, cannot be defeated, and can kill Link with one hit. [1]
Screenshots from Zelda.com, as well as the official trailer, show a few items included in the game, including bombs, a bow, the boomerang, and a cannon for the boat. An icon in the lower right corner of the touch screen showing the word "Item" will obviously bring up a menu in which you can choose your current item, which will appear in the upper right corner.
Multiplayer battle mode will be included.
[ edit ]
Multiplayer
The multiplayer mode in
The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass
is a 1-on-1 game best described as Pac-Man meets Capture the Flag. In an open maze, one player takes on the role of Link, while the other player, the Stalker, controls three Darknuts. Links goal is to grab a Force Gem from one of the center bases and carry it to one of his own areas at the side of the maze. The other player, controlling the three Darknuts, must try to catch Link before he scores any points. When Link is caught, players switch sides.
[ edit ]
Story
Spoiler warning :
Plot and/or ending details follow.
The game is a sequel to
The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker , set several months after that game.
Link ,
Tetra
and her pirates are at sea exploring, questing to find a new homeland. In the middle of a dense fog, they find an abandoned ship, and Tetra goes to explore. When she gets into trouble, Link tries to rescue her, but he falls into the ocean and loses consciousness. Washed up on the shores of a mysterious island, he awakens to the sound of a fairys voice. With the fairys help, he sets off in search of Tetra, and a way back to where they belong. The fairy could be Navi. [3] [4] .
According to Eiji Aonuma it is not likely
Ganondorf
will return in
Phantom Hourglass 
[5] . However, before his defeat in
The Wind Waker , his evil influence spread across the Great Sea.
The King of Red Lions
will not return in
Phantom Hourglass
either
[6] .
Spoilers end here.
[ edit ]
Development
The main objective in the games creation was to fully utilise the DSs hardware, having a
Zelda
game controlled by the stylus/touch screen alone.
Eiji Aonuma
hopes the new control scheme will follow through into future
Zelda
titles, and maybe even other adventure games for the DS.
The project initially started out as a
Four Swords
game for the DS, and the same team, having discovered the potential of cel-shaded graphics on the machine, ultimately decided to opt for a single player adventure instead.
When Nintendo first announced the Nintendo DS at E3 2004,
Eiji Aonuma
also hinted at a
Legend of Zelda
title for the system.
Shigeru Miyamoto
stated in October 2004 "We're thinking of bringing
Zelda: Four Swords
to the DS" [2] , but Aonuma later denied that the idea ever reached the development stage.
[3] . In late 2005, Aonuma told
Electronic Gaming Monthly
in an interview that the new
Legend of Zelda
game for the Nintendo DS would not be a
Four Swords
title. Rumors were put to rest when Nintendo announced
Phantom Hourglass
as the actual DS project at the 2006
Game Developers Conference .
[ edit ]
Awards
At
E3
2006, the game won the
Game Critics Awards : Best Handheld Game.

Swords
Link's most common weapon is a
Sword . Games usually begin with Link posessing or acquiring a weak sword such as the
Wooden Sword , but more powerful swords are usually obtained as the game progresses.
[ edit ]
Wooden Sword
The
Wooden Sword
is the trademark beginning weapon of Link in many
Zelda
games, particularly the 2-D iterations. It is composed of
wood , and usually the weakest melee weapon the player can attain. The wooden sword often allows Link to perform a trademark spin attack, but in some incarnations cannot fire magical beams or smash pots. A sword with a brown blade is also the initial weapon in the original
Legend of Zelda
though it is only referred to as regular "Sword" in the manual and game introduction.

Kokiri Sword
Kokiri Sword
The
Kokiri Sword
is the basic sword that Link is able to use while a child in
Ocarina of Time . The sword is hidden in a small cave at the back of the Kokiri forest near the beginning of the game. It is considered the legendary weapon of the small Kokiri people, and is ideal for children but is too small to be useful for an adult. Link keeps the sword in the sequel
Majora's Mask , where gold dust is used by a blacksmith to reforge it into stronger forms.

Four Sword
Four Sword
The
Four Sword
is a weapon that is needed to defeat the villain
Vaati
in several
Zelda
games. Enchanted by the three goddesses of Hyrule, it has the ability to split Link into up to four
clones . It was created by a secretive race of small creatures who call themselves the
Minish
(but called the Picori by the rest of Hyrule). When not empowered with the four magical elements of wind, water, earth, and fire, it is reduced to the less powerful
Picori Sword
(or
White Sword ). It also serves as a prison for the villain
Vaati .
In
The Minish Cap , there is a large
fair
and swordfighting contest annually in
Hyrule
to honor the Minish. The winner of the contest gets to touch the Picori Sword, which was given long ago as a gift to the Hylians by the Picori. Link, the grandson of the Royal Grand
Blacksmith , is watching the contest with
Princess Zelda
when a strange swordsman named Vaati wins. When Vaati touches the Picori Sword, he breaks it at the
hilt , then turns Zelda into stone and escapes. The king sends Link to seek help from the Picori because they are said to show themselves only to children.
In his search, Link finds a talking green
cap
named Ezlo. Ezlo has the knowledge of how to shrink Link and speak with the Minish. It is later revealed that Ezlo was once a skilled Minish craftsman who was transformed into a cap by Vaati, his apprentice. Link meets the Minish, and is able to have the Picori Sword fixed. The new blade is called the White Sword, which is later imbued with the powers of the four
elements
and becomes the Four Sword. Vaati, who becomes a demon at the end of
The Minish Cap , is defeated by Link and sealed into the Four Sword. The sword was sealed in an altar and Princess Zelda was revived.
In
Four Sword Adventures , Link again must wield the Four Sword to save Hyrule. In this game, it causes Link to immediately split into four versions corresponding to the four elements. Green Link represents wind (a reference to
The Wind Waker
and the green goddess of courage, Farore); Red Link, fire (a reference to the red goddess of power, Din, as in
Ocarina of Time ); Purple Link, earth; and Blue Link, water. Every time one of the Links collects over 2,000 force gems, the Four Sword powers up, turning into the Ultimate Four Sword.
In the game, seven maidens have been kidnapped by
Ganon . When Link pulls the Four Sword from the pedestal to use on his rescue, however, Vaati is released. The four Links are able to overcome Vaati and save the maidens, but encounter Ganon, who has been empowered by a magical
trident . Wielding the sword, the four Links defeat Ganon and their story becomes a
myth .
The events of the multiplayer
Zelda
title
Four Swords
(not to be confused with
Four Swords Adventures ) takes place many years later, Zelda and the seven maidens sense a disturbance in the Four Sword, and Link pulls it out of the pedestal, releasing Vaati once again. Link is again split, and the four Links defeat Vaati and replace the Four Sword in the pedestal.
It is possible that the name "White Sword" given to the sword in
The Minish Cap
was to imply that the Four Sword and White Sword of
the original game
are in fact one and the same, albeit at different power levels.
In
manga
based on the games, the Four Sword also divides the wielder's personality into four, with one possessing a persona similar to that of the original ( see:
Manga from The Legend of Zelda series ).

Giant's Knife
Giant's Knife
In
Ocarina of Time , the
Giant's Knife
can be purchased from the Goron blacksmith Medigoron as adult Link. The sword must be wielded two-handed due to its size, making Link unable to hold his shield, so instead of blocking normally, he bends over and ducks to dodge the attack (it does not protect you from falling rocks, like the Hylian Shield on child Link), and while Z-Targeting, holds the sword to cover his face (which isn't an effective defence). The sword breaks after 100 slashes on regular enemies or three strikes with walls or other hard objects. When unbroken, it deals the same amount of damage as Biggoron's Sword. After it breaks, the power remains unchanged, but the range of the weapon is significantly decreased, and the broken shaft can no longer charge magic for a Spin Attack. It disappears when Link receives the Biggoron Sword, though can be repaired repeatedly before attaining the Biggoron Sword.
Appears in:
Ocarina of Time

Biggoron Sword
Biggoron's Sword in
Ocarina of Time
Biggoron's Sword
is received from the immense Goron smithy
Biggoron
in various
Zelda
games after the completion of a rather long and complicated trading sequence. The sword resembles a
Zweihander . It is identical to the Giant's Knife, except it is unbreakable. The sword is a reward to Link for getting Biggoron eye drops to cure the eye irritation caused by the fumes from
Death Mountain . This powerful blade is twice as strong as the
Master Sword
and its length and power make it effective against monsters with good defences, like
Stalfos , but comes with one major setback: it forces Link to keep his shield on his back.
In
Oracle of Ages
and
Seasons , the Biggoron's Sword is gained by a long trading process between versions of the games, and similar to the Ocarina of Time version, deals more damage than the Master Sword. However, it leaves Link unable to equip a second item in its slot, but allows the longest reach of any melee weapon. In
Soul Calibur II , the Biggoron Sword is used as a very long one-handed sword, that Link partners with the usual Hylian Shield. Because it is the same sword that required two hands in
Ocarina of Time , Link is penalized for the greater power of the sword by losing a small sliver off his health meter every time he swings the sword.

Great Fairy's Sword
The Great Fairy Sword
The
Great Fairy Sword
is a gift to Link from the Great Fairy in
Majora's Mask . It is a large purple sword with black roses etched in its blade, and four times stronger than his
Kokiri Sword . Unlike other swords in Link's arsenal, it is treated as an item, and must be used by assigning it to a C-Button.
The sword also appears in
Soul Calibur II . In this game, it has the ability to restore Link's health.

Magical Sword
The Magical Sword
The
Magical Sword
is the most powerful sword Link receives in the original
Legend of Zelda . In the game, the Magical Sword is twice as strong as the White Sword, and four times stronger than the regular Sword. According to the instruction manual to
Zelda II: The Adventure of Link , Link carries an otherwise unnamed "magical sword" in the sequel, which may be this sword. The official
Zelda
website suggests the Magical Sword may be the same as the
Master Sword . [1]
The Magical Sword also makes an appearance as a weapon for Link in
Soul Calibur II , but with a different design. In this game, it is a separate weapon from the Master Sword and deals damage even if the target is guarding or blocking.

Ranged Weaponry
[ edit ]
Ball and Chain
The
Ball and Chain
fills a similar role to the
hammers
in other
Legend of Zelda
games. The Ball and Chain can break large objects, like ice barriers, but is extremely heavy, and thus Link cannot run while holding it and must swing it around over his head before throwing. It can be noted that the Ball and Chain has limited uses but can be used on walls and objects that can be broken by bombs, allowing for the conservation of bombs, and can be used at a considerable distance to inflict damage.

Boomerang
Boomerang in
Ocarina of Time
The
Boomerang
( ĽÖŠ`ĽáĽéĽó ,
B¨ąmeran ? )
is a common weapon in the
Zelda
series. It is usually regarded as a weaker ranged weapon than the
bow and arrow
although it is infinitely reusable, can retrieve certain distant items, and often can immobilize larger enemies in their tracks. In
The Wind Waker
and
Twilight Princess , the boomerang can target and strike multiple enemies with each throw. In some games an upgrade called the
Magical Boomerang
is available, which allows for a longer throwing distance and/or the ability to control the boomerang's flightpath after being thrown. The
Twilight Princess
version, known as the
Gale Boomerang , can unleash a small tornado when charged, which can trigger wind-operated switches (like the Deku Leaf in
The Wind Waker ) or carry small items.

Bow and Arrow
The
Bow and Arrow
is a staple weapon of the
Zelda
series that Link uses to fight enemies or trigger switches from a distance. It is similar in nature to the
slingshot , although usually more powerful. The bow and arrow uses a depletable source of ammunition, though the ability to upgrade the carrying capacity of Link's
quiver
has been introduced in the later games.
Two-dimensional
Zelda
games usually feature standard, nameless bows which only shoot in the four cardinal directions on the screen. In these games there are usually upgrades to the standard arrow, such as the
Silver Arrows
of the original
Legend of Zelda
and
A Link to the Past .
Bows and arrows in the three-dimensional
Zelda
games ( Ocarina of Time ,
Majora's Mask ,
The Wind Waker ,
Twilight Princess ) are more interactive tools than their 2-D counterparts. When aiming a shot, the player's perspective is taken to Link's
point of view , and can be fired in almost any direction within the three dimensions.
The
Fairy Bow
introduced in
Ocarina of Time
was the weapon Link gained as an adult in lieu of his childhood projectile weapon, the
Fairy Slingshot .
The
Hero's Bow
has appeared in
Majora's Mask ,
The Wind Waker , and
Twilight Princess.
It is small enough that it can be used by a child while still being a powerful weapon.
The Fairy Bow in Ocarina of Time
The Hero's Bow in Majora's Mask
The Hero's Bow in The Wind Waker
The bows and arrows of the 3-D
Zelda
games can use special
elemental
arrows along with the standard arrow for more powerful attacks and for puzzle-solving. Firing these types of elemental arrows expends an amount of "magic power", or
magic points , and there usually is a delay between consecutive shots.
[ edit ]
Fire Arrows
The heads of the
Fire Arrows
are set aflame, allowing them to burn their targets upon contact. They are very effective against undead enemies, and are often needed in order to melt ice that blocks Link's path. It is often possible to shoot a makeshift fire arrow without using magic power by shooting a normal arrow through an existing flame. In
Super Smash Bros. Melee , Young Link uses Fire Arrows as his B-Button attack.
[ edit ]
Ice Arrows
Ice Arrows
can render their target temporarily frozen and, in
Majora's Mask , create ice platforms in water or encase enemies in blocks of ice on which Link can stand. They are sometimes necessary to extinguish flames or freeze water streams in puzzles throughout the games. However, in
Ocarina of Time , the Ice Arrows have little practical use besides attacking enemies. In
The Wind Waker , one can freeze the enemy and then break them with the Skull Hammer or with a Fire Arrow.
[ edit ]
Light Arrows
The
Light Arrows
of legend can pierce pure evil and are possessed by few ĄŞ most commonly, the Royal Family of Hyrule. They are useful or required to defeat
Ganondorf
on several occasions. The Light Arrows are analogous in this respect to the Silver Arrows from previous
Zelda
games. Because of the power and importance of these arrows, twice as many magic points will be consumed than when firing the other magic arrows. One notable effect of the arrows is the power to leave large sums of money behind when they are used to defeat an enemy. The Light Arrows are usually powerful enough to kill any enemy (except bosses and other strong enemies) in a single hit. In
Majora's Mask ,
the Light Arrows can also be used to activate light-sensitive switches.
Light Arrows are also featured in
The Minish Cap
as an arrow upgrade. With this ability, a regular arrow can be charged into a Light Arrow while nocked in the bow.
Light Arrows are only used in
Twilight Princess
once in the final battle by Princess Zelda.
[ edit ]
Bomb Arrows
Bomb Arrows
are normal arrows combined with bombs to blow up distant targets. It should be noted that this feature was an Easter Egg in Link's Awakening and as such were not needed to complete the game. In
Twilight Princess , Link can combine the arrows with any type of Bomb. Unlike the
Link's Awakening
type, if held for too long, the Bomb Arrows can detonate, damaging him.

Grappling Hook
Appearing only in
The Wind Waker , the
Grappling Hook
is a versatile item. It's mainly used to swing over gaps, but is also used to dredge the ocean floor for treasure and to steal spoils from enemies.
[ edit ]
Hookshot
The
Hookshot
is a spring-loaded, trigger-pulled grappling hook attached to a lengthy chain. Since its first appearance in
A Link to the Past , the Hookshot's main purpose has been to pull Link across large distances by hooking onto certain surfaces (like wood), but it also can be used as an offensive weapon similar in effect to the
boomerang . In certain situations (such as when wearing the
Iron Boots ) Link can use it to pull a target towards him instead. In
Ocarina of Time
the Hookshot can be upgraded to become the
Longshot , which expands twice as far. In
Majora's Mask , the device receives a different aesthetic design, appearing golden in color, and its chain length lies somewhere between those of
Ocarina of Time 's Hookshot and Longshot. It also makes appearances in
Link's Awakening
and
The Wind Waker . In
Oracle of Ages
and
Seasons , an alternate version called the
Switch Hook
is obtained, which switches your position with the object it attaches to. Also, a version of the Hookshot known as the
Clawshot
is found in
Twilight Princess . The clawshot can be upgraded to the
Double Clawshots , allowing Link to hang from one target and then fire at another. Unlike Hookshots, Clawshots cannot latch onto wood.
Hookshot from Ocarina of Time
Hookshot from Majora's Mask

Slingshot
Fairy Slingshot
The
Slingshot
is Link's alternative weapon to the
bow and arrow
in many games. In earlier games, it uses rocks as ammunition and stores them similar to arrows in the inventory. In later games, the slingshot has been compatible with other projectiles such as
Deku Seeds . In
Oracle of Seasons , it fires various
magical seeds
whose effects range from igniting enemies to creating whirlwinds.
The slingshot also returns in
Twilight Princess
as the first projectile weapon that is obtained.
[ edit ]
Shields
Shields
assist the player in reflecting projectiles and preventing damage to Link. In some cases, Link's shield is important in solving puzzles. Shields, like weapons, come in many different sizes, shapes and designs.
[ edit ]
Wooden Shields
The
Wooden Shield
is a common defensive device Link gains at the beginning of the games. It features no special attributes and is the weakest of the defensive items.
Deku Shield
The
Deku Shield
is
Link 's first shield in the
Ocarina of Time . It is a flammable wooden shield with an engraved red design resembling the Kokiri Emerald. It must originally be purchased in the shop in the
Kokiri Forest , but can be found later in the game if it is lost or incinerated. Link can only use this shield as a child. When Link becomes an adult, the Deku Shield is replaced by the Hylian Shield.
The
Ordon Shield
is the first shield obtained in
Twilight Princess.
[ edit ]
Metal Shields
The
Hylian Shield
( Hylia Shield
in the Japanese version) is a large, adult-sized shield made of wood overlaid with metal and bearing the crest of the
Hylian
Royal Family. It can be purchased at the Bazaar in Hyrule Castle Town or found in a tomb in Kakariko Graveyard. It is able to deflect most projectiles back at enemies.
Link can use the Hylian Shield as a child, but only by strapping it on his back and crouching for protection.
The
Hero's Shield
is a smaller metal shield similar to the Hylian Shield from
Ocarina of Time , and young Link can wield it as a regular shield. Link retains this shield in the beginning of the sequel
Majora's Mask . A similar-appearing shield is seen in
The Wind Waker
as Link's family shield. Many people think that this shield is made of wood due to what Tetra said in
The Wind Waker , "Are you sure you won't get splinters from that thing and cry?" It turns out she was talking about the handle.
The
Magical Shield
is an item from the original
Legend of Zelda . It can be purchased for 90, 130 or 160 rupees, depending on the store. This shield allows Link to block all magical attacks except those from bosses.
Hero's Shield
Hylian Shield
[ edit ]
Mirror Shield
The
Mirror
Shield
is a shield made of highly polished metal usually inscribed with the insignia of the
Triforce . It has slightly differing designs in games, but its main purpose is the reflection of light or magic projectiles.
The shield first appeared in
A Link to the Past
as an upgrade that allowed Link to block (but not reflect) lasers. It also appears in
Link's Awakening
and reflects lasers and fire. The reflected lasers do not however cause damage to enemies. In
Ocarina of Time , it is used to defeat several bosses but is ineffective against Ganon's attacks (but strangely, the Hylian Shield is protective). In
Majora's Mask , the shield bears an image of a screaming face that is reflected when exposed to light. In
Oracle of Ages
and
Seasons , the Mirror Shield was simply a defensive upgrade from Link's Iron Shield. The Mirror Shield is also required in order to solve several puzzles in
The Wind Waker . In
The Minish Cap ,
whenever an enemy fired a projectile and you block it with the Mirror Shield, the shield emits a small damaging beam of light (roughly equivalent to half the power of the Four Sword) back to the enemy.
This shield is also available in
Soul Calibur II
where any normal damage (as in everything but being thrown) was dealt back to the attacker by a factor of one half, though may cause Link to lose his balance from strong strikes.
Interestingly enough, the crescent moon design for the Mirror Shield of
Ocarina of Time
was changed for the
GameCube
re-release. Several other appearances of this design in the game (which resembles an
Islamic
symbol) were changed as well. In general, the Gerudo symbol has been changed in all Zelda games where it is featured.

Jewelry and clothing
A variety of
Jewelry
and
Clothing
accessories are found by Link throughout the games.
[ edit ]
Tunics
[ edit ]
Kokiri Tunic/Green Tunic/Green Jerkin/Hero's Clothes
Link's standard choice of clothing, which he starts without in some games.
[ edit ]
Blue & Red Tunic
In
Link's Awakening DX , these tunics are acquired in the bonus color dungeon. The player has a choice of the blue tunic, which raised defense, or the red tunic, which raised his attack power. The player could always go back to switch between those two tunics, but couldn't switch back to his green one.
[ edit ]
Blue & Red Mail
Found in
A Link to the Past , these tunics, oddly, had differentiating color hats, in which the blue mail has a yellow hat and the red mail a purple. The blue mail increased defense and guarded against ice magic, while the red mail further increased defense and guarded against fire magic.
[ edit ]
Goron Tunic
A red adult size tunic made by the gorons, hence it's name, in
Ocarina of Time
protected Link from the extreme heat within Death Mountain Crater and the Fire Temple. Its weaved from
dodongo
hide and
bomb flower
fibers.
[ edit ]
Zora Tunic
A blue adult size tunic with the remarkable ability to prevent Link from drowning while wearing the Iron Boots underwater. It's absolutely neccesary while trying to complete the Water Temple. It's acquired in
Ocarina of Time . It was made from fish gills.
[ edit ]
Four Swords
Tunics
In
Four Swords
and
Four Swords Adventures
the four Links had tunics with different colors that seem to be based on the elements: green for wind, red for fire, blue for water, and violet for earth. The tunics don't affect their abilities, but let's the player know the difference and not get confused.
[ edit ]
Zora Armor
In
Twilight Princess
this tunic allows Link to breathe and swim well underwater, but lowers his defense against fire and cold.
[ edit ]
Magic Armor
Found in
Twilight Princess
and
The Wind Waker , the
Magic Armor
has different effects depending on the game:
The Wind Waker : A protective spell. Uses up large amounts of magic and prevents Link from losing hearts, but he can still be knocked away.
Twilight Princess : A physical suit of armor. Link loses rupees rather than hearts when attacked but if he runs out of rupees, the magic armor will turn from gold to silver and make him move as if he's wearing iron boots.
[ edit ]
Boots
Pegasus Boots
Boots
first appeared as an item in
The Adventure of Link , allowing Link to walk over certain sections of water.
[ edit ]
Pegasus Boots
The
Pegasus Boots , named after the mythological Greek horse
Pegasus , allowed Link to charge up for a few seconds then make a mad dash that's about four times as fast as his normal speed. Link holds his sword in front of him while running, making it a sort of an attack. He can run into objects, like trees, to knock things loose and quickly cut through foiliage. When combined with Roc's Cape or Roc's Feather in
Link's Awakening , they made Link jump farther than usual.

Iron Boots
These heavy, metal boots, allowed Link to resist strong winds and sink underwater without floating. In
The Wind Waker , they allowed Link to push down spring boards, and, after taking the boots off, they would snap back to their normal position and launch him. They also let him push down strong switches. In
Ocarina of Time
Link used them along with the Zora Tunic to walk around underwater and complete the
Water Temple . They also greatly increased traction on ice. In
Twilight Princess , Link can use the Iron Boots to walk on magnetic surfaces.
Appears In:
Ocarina of Time ,
The Wind Waker , and

Hover Boots
The amazing
Hover Boots , appearing in
Ocarina of Time , allow Link to walk on air for about three seconds without any cost. They're activated once Link steps off solid ground. A downside is that they have very low traction, so walking around in them is like walking on ice. They're also required for walking over quicksand.
[ edit ]
Power Bracelet
In the original
The Legend of Zelda , this item allowed Link to move certain large stones, which led to a series of secret underground passages, connecting various regions of Hyrule.

Roc's Feather and Cape
Roc's feather
The
Roc's feather
and
Roc's Cape
are enhancing items that allow Link more jumping ability or maneuverability in the air. The Roc's Feather commonly allows Link to jump higher and farther, with the Cape being an upgrade that allows Link to glide for a limited amount of time.
These items are similar to the feather and cape from
Super Mario World , another Nintendo game, both for their appearance and ability.

[ edit ]
Explosives
[ edit ]
Bomb
A bomb from
Ocarina of Time
The
Zelda
series commonly uses
Bombs . They are round in shape and require the fuse to be lit to explode. Link can use them to damage enemies, break walls and barriers and solve puzzles. If Link holds a bomb too long before throwing it, however, it will explode in his hands, damaging him in the process.
The amount of bombs Link can carry is limited by the capacity of his
Bomb Bag , which can be expanded through side-quests. In
Ocarina of Time
and
The Wind Waker , Link must utilize Bomb Flowers before obtaining the bomb bag. In
Twilight Princess , can aquire two additional Bomb Bags (which can be used to carry the two other types of bombs as well as regular bombs).
If used at sea in
The Wind Waker , bombs can be shot out of a cannon.
[ edit ]
Bombchu
A bombchu
A
Bombchu
is a bomb in the shape of a chu ( mouse ). When
Link
uses one, the
fuse
is lit (if Link does not release it, then it will explode in his hands), then when he releases it, it will travel for a while then explode. Bombchus will travel on any surface, so if the user faces a wall and releases it, it will climb the wall until it explodes.
[ edit ]
Bomblings
These insect-shaped bombs appear only in
Twilight Princess . Similarly to Bombchus, they run forward once Link places them on the ground. Oddly enough, they also appear as enemies early in the game.
[ edit ]
Powder Keg
Powder Keg
A large, explosive barrel of blackpowder, the
Powder Keg
is powerful enough to break barriers and cause extensive damage. It is also very unstable, so one must be certified to buy and use it, and only one can be carried at a time. This device is very large, so only a person of substantial strength (i.e. a
Goron ) can hold and use it. Like bombs, they can damage the user if Link is nearby. This item only appears in
Majora's Mask .
[ edit ]
Remote Bomb
A special type of bomb that appears in
The Minish Cap
and
A Link To The Past . Unlike regular bombs (which are timed)
Remote Bombs
can be detonated remotely and are therefore safer to use (they can be picked up and carried without fear of detonation). In
The Minish Cap
it was invented by the Minish "Belari" as the result of a Kinstone Fusion with the Forest Minish Elder "Gentari."
[ edit ]
Super Bomb
A large, pulsing, orange bomb, it is so heavy, it must be dragged around instead of being stored in the inventory. In
A Link To The Past
the Super Bomb was a one-time-use bomb used to destroy a wall that contains the fairy who gives Link the Golden Sword and Silver Arrows.
[ edit ]
Water Bomb
These bombs, shaped like piranhas, can be used when Link is under water. They appear only in
Twilight Princess . They also appear as
Bomb Fish
in the
Lakebed Temple , which can be caught bobber fishing.

Masks
[ edit ]
Bunny Hood
Screenshot of a Bunny Hood in
Super Smash Bros. Melee
The
Bunny Hood
is a clothing item in several
Nintendo
video games. Its first appearance was in the
Ocarina of Time
in
1998 , in which the main character,
Link , can wear it to stimulate unusual responses from the
NPCs
and participate in a trading sequence which ultimately results in the reward of another wearable item, the
Mask of Truth . It also has the curious side effect of stopping Stalchildren from appearing in Hyrule Field, when worn at night.
The second appearance of the hood was in
Majora's Mask , as one of the 20 non-transformational masks. In this particular game, wearing the Bunny Hood increases Link's agility, allowing him to run 1.5 times faster than normal. The hood has also made an appearance in
Super Smash Bros. Melee , where the player can pick up the item in battle to be able to jump higher, run faster, and fall faster. However, this can be a hazard on small levels during gameplay.
A Bunny Hood can be purchased for the player to wear in the
Nintendo DS
game
Animal Crossing: Wild World . However, the hood differs in appearance. The hood covers much of the player's head and is white in color, with short rigid ears. Therefore, this may not be a direct reference.
[ edit ]
Mask of Truth
The
Mask of Truth
is a clothing item in several Nintendo video games. Its first appearance was in the
Ocarina of Time . In this game, Link can wear the mask after selling all of the other masks. This allows him to read the minds of
NPCs
and talk to Gossip Stones, revealing interesting trivia, hints, and secrets.
The mask later appeared in
Majora's Mask , serving much the same purpose. However, this time, it came with the ability to talk to animals.
[ edit ]
Hero's Charm
The
Hero's Charm
appears only in
The Wind Waker . This mystical mask was given to Link by the school teacher on Windfall Island after he gave a large number of Joy Pendants to her. Once it is equipped, it shows a bar above an enemy or boss showing how much damage is needed to slay the monster. There is also a device called "Horse Call" in
Twilight Princess
which you can obtain after you restore Llias memory. This device allows you to call your steed, Epona, at any time without call grass.
[ edit ]
Hawkeye
The
Hawkeye
mask appears only in
Twilight Princess . This mask can be purchased from the Malo Mart in Kakariko Village after completing test of the player's archery skill. Once it is equipped, it allows the user to zoom in similarly to the telescope in
The Wind Waker . Similar to bombs, it can be combined with the Hero's Bow to create a scope for more accurate shooting. Interestingly, when equipping the scoped bow on the Wii version of the game, aiming reverts to the less accurate control stick aiming as opposed to the Wii remote aiming the game was designed for. The mask is not worn like masks in other games, Link cannot move while using it, and with no third person camera it is impossible to see Link wearing it.
The Hawkeye is the only mask available in
Twilight Princess .
[ edit ]
Musical Instruments
See:
Musical instruments from The Legend of Zelda series.
Various
Musical Instruments
are used throughout the
Zelda
series. Tunes played on these items may have a variety of effects, including damaging enemies, transporting Link, or revealing secrets.
[ edit ]
Nuts/ Seeds
Various
Nuts
and
Seeds
are used by Link in many games as an offensive measure. He can either use them manually by use of throwing them, or he can use the
Slingshot
weapon to fire them long distances.
Deku Nut
[ edit ]
Deku Nuts
Deku Nuts
are natural stun-grenades harvested from the great Deku tree. In
Ocarina of Time , they allowed the player to paralyze enemies when they made contact. Deku Nuts cause a powerful flash of light when used, permitting Link to attack an enemy or reveal a space for counter attack. Sheik and Impa use the quick flash to make veiled escapes. They return in
Majora's Mask
in a similar capacity and when in Deku form they can be dropped from above to attack. The also return in
The Wind Waker
as items that cannot be stored in your menu, they are only found in the "Forbidden Woods" as items that you pick up and throw at several eye-targets.
[ edit ]
Deku Seeds
Gained from the Deku Tree, the
Deku Seeds
are used as ammunition for Link's Fairy Slingshot in
Ocarina of Time . The hard, brittle surface makes it ideal against enemies such as Skulltulas and Keese.
[ edit ]
Guardian Acorn
The
Guardian Acorn
only appears in
Link's Awakening . This item is randomly dropped by enemies, and has the effect of reducing the damage Link takes from enemies by half, for a limited amount of time.
[ edit ]
Magical seeds
Various types of
Magical Seeds
with elemental or other strange qualities appear through out the series. They are present in the
Oracle of Ages
and
Seasons
games as ammunition for Link's seed shooter(in
Ages ) or slingshot ( Seasons ) , although he can use them by hand as well. In both games, seeds grew in a limited capacity. In
Seasons , certain seeds grew at different times of the year, while seeds grew at different time periods in
Ages .
Ember Seeds : The first seed Link comes in possession of. It ignites monsters, nature and various torches for puzzle solving. It uses the element of
fire .
Scent Seeds : Seeds that can be used by Link to inflict physical damage by Link's Seed Shooter or Slingshot. If dropped, they will attract nearby enemies.
Pegasus Seeds : Seeds that Link can consume and increase his running speed expotentially. If shot, they will either freeze an enemy or physically damage it.
Gale Seeds : A magical transportation seed, using these will allow Link to instantly warp to a location he has previously been before. When fired at enemies, they encompass the victim in a whirlwind and send them away from the field of battle.
Mystery Seeds : A seed shaped like a question mark which does a number of things. It can open owl statues which give Link advice, transform or switch properties of monsters and landmarks, or have the random effect of one of the other four seeds.
In addition, there are 3 types of Magical seeds in
A Link to the Past/Four Swords .
Razor Seeds : Increase attack power.
Armor Seeds : Increase defense power.
Pegasus Seeds : Increase walking speed.
[ edit ]
Containers
Many items that can be obtained by Link are
Containers
that allow him to carry other things, such as ammunition, small objects, and even life power.
[ edit ]
Bait Bag
In
The Wind Waker , Link must first purchase a
Bait Bag
for 20
rupees
from
Beedle
before he can buy and use
All-Purpose Bait
and
Hyoi Pears . It is a pink, teardrop-shaped sack which resembles a pig's head in appearance. It is tied into a knot at the top, the two ends of which resemble the pig's ears. It has eight pouches for storing bait. When Link buys this satchel from Beedle, he will also make Link a "Member's Card", which allows Link to keep a running tally of the number of purchases he makes at Beedle's Ship Shop. If Link attains 30 points, he will receive a Silver Membership. The purchase of the Bait Bag counts as Link's first point on his card.
[ edit ]
Bottles
Bottles
are an essential part to many of Link's quests. These containers are used and often required to carry various things, such as:
Potions
Fairies
Milk
Various types of Water
Normal Water
Spring Water
Forest Water
Mineral Water
Hotspring Water
Fish
Bugs
Poes/Big Poes
Bees ( A Link to the Past )
Blue Flame ( Ocarina Of Time )
Ruto's Letter ( Ocarina Of Time )
Deku Princess ( Majora's Mask )
Gold Dust ( Majora's Mask )
Zora Egg ( Majora's Mask )
Chateau Romani ( Majora's Mask )
Mushrooms ( Majora's Mask )
Elixir Soup ( The Wind Waker )
Fireflies ( The Wind Waker )
Charms ( The Minish Cap )
Dog Food ( The Minish Cap )
Picolyte ( The Minish Cap )
Bee
larva ( Twilight Princess )
Chu Jelly ( Twilight Princess )
Lantern Oil ( Twilight Princess )
Fairy Tears ( Twilight Princess )
Nasty, Simple, Good or Superb Soup ( Twilight Princess )
Due to their usefulness they are highly sought after and up to four bottles can be found, with the exception of six in
Majora's Mask , in a single game. Amusingly, a bottle can be used to knock back Ganondorf's magic spells in
Ocarina of Time ,
Phantom Ganon 's attacks in
The Wind Waker
and Ocarina of Time, and Ganon's Puppet Zelda's attacks in
Twilight Princess .
[ edit ]
Heart Containers
A screenshot from
Ocarina of Time
showing Link receiving a Heart Container.
Heart Containers
are obtainable items which increase the character's maximum health meter. While it is of course possible to lose health, it is not normally possible to lose a heart container (for example, to go from having ten hearts worth of health maximum to nine hearts maximum). The only exception is from the second quest of
The Legend of Zelda
where it is possible to give up a heart container in order to proceed through certain dungeons.
Heart Containers appear in one of two forms:
As full containers (generally after beating a
boss ) which give the player one additional heart.
And as quarter containers, found at certain locations in the game or as a reward for completing a
mini-game
or
sidequest . The games refer to these items as
Pieces of Heart . In
The Wind Waker , Pieces of Heart can also be found by lowering the Grappling Hook at locations marked on the Treasure Charts. Four of these must be collected to complete one more heart and increase the player's health meter. The completion status of the current Heart Container (a quarter full, half full, three quarters full, or empty) is visible on the game's Quest Status/Item Subscreen.
In
Twilight Princess , a heart container consists of five pieces of heart instead of four. Certain sidequests enable the player to gain more than one Piece of Heart total, but never more than one piece at once. For example, a heart piece can be obtained from the mail sorting minigame on Dragon Roost Island in
The Wind Waker , and a second one can be obtained by completing the minigame again. It is not possible to be given a Piece of Heart worth more than a quarter of a heart, or to be given two in succession without visiting another character or completing another task in between.
Most
Zelda
games have a limit of approximately twenty hearts maximum if the player does all the tasks required to get all possible Heart Containers and Pieces of Heart. However, a player can use a
GameShark
or similar cheating device to gain more than twenty hearts.
[ edit ]
Appearances in other games
Heart Containers also appear in the
Super Smash Bros.
series- however, these perform a slightly different function to the Heart Containers in
The Legend of Zelda
series. In
Super Smash Bros.
a player using a heart container will lose all damage inflicted upon him (that is, 0%). In all modes of
Super Smash Bros. Melee
except "All-Star", the container will drop the user's current damage count down 100 points (in the game, 100%, but this does not mean all of the damage is lost). It appears in very limited quantities in this game, but most commonly in "All-Star" mode, where only three are available in the intermediate "park" stage between each battle. These containers remove all damage, as they did in the original
Super Smash Bros.
Once one has been used, the player cannot use it again until he has beaten the mode. Heart Containers have no effect if the user's damage counter is at 0%.
[ edit ]
Mail Bag
The
Mail Bag
is an item which contains all the mail Link receives over the course of his adventures. Link receives the Mail Bag over the natural progression of the game, usually when he receives his first piece of mail. Link usually receives letters from NPCs, either thanking him for some event he has done, or informing him about an event or item that is now available. The Mail Bag appears in
The Wind Waker .
[ edit ]
Magic
[ edit ]
Canes
[ edit ]
Cane of Byrna
The
Cane of Byrna
appears in
A Link to the Past . When swung, it creates a sphere of raw magic that circles Link, repelling enemies and attacks. Unfortunately, it drains magic quickly. It appeared in the
Gamecube
version of
Soul Calibur II
as one of Link's selectable weapons, wherin it regenerated a small portion of health and increased Link's defense when Soul-Charged.
[ edit ]
Cane of Pacci
Appearing in
The Minish Cap , the
Cane of Pacci
creates a sphere of yellow energy that flips whatever it strikes upside down. It's best used to flip shelled monsters and for creating platforms. In addition, when aimed at a hole, it will charge that hole with energy, allowing Link to shoot up out of it when he jumps in.
[ edit ]
Cane of Somaria
The
Cane of Somaria
appears in
Oracle of Ages
and
A Link to the Past . When swung, it creates a block in front of Link and is used to complete various puzzles. The block will take a few hits before exploding. By swinging the Staff again, Link can also intentionally make the block explode, sending projectiles in four directions. It can also be used to make platforms in Turtle Rock.
[ edit ]
Rods
[ edit ]
Dominion Rod
The
Dominion Rod
allows Link to control ancient statues, similarly to the Command Melody from
The Wind Waker . It appears only in
Twilight Princess .
[ edit ]
Fire and Ice Rods
The
Fire
and
Ice Rods
are weapons that have only appeared in the 2D versions of the
Zelda
games. In
A Link to the Past , they are found at different places and take magic power to use. In
Link's Awakening , the
Magic Rod
appears in Turtle Rock Dungeon. The Magic Rod is the same as the Fire Rod, but doesn't use magic, as
Link's Awakening
doesn't have a magic meter. In recent 3D games, the fire and ice rods have no use, for the fire and ice tipped arrows have taken their place. The Fire Rod also appeared in
Four Swords Adventures .
[ edit ]
Magical Rod
A weapon that makes its first appearance in
The Legend of Zelda , the
Magical Rod
allows Link to shoot a blast of energy at enemies. If used in conjunction with the
Book of Magic
the blasts of energy turn into fire when they hit a wall or enemy.
[ edit ]
Rod of Seasons
The Rod of Seasons
The
Rod of Seasons
is a staff-like device used by Link in
Oracle of Seasons . By standing on the location of a tree stump and waving the rod, the user can change the seasons at a whim. To control the seasons, the rod holds four amulet-like devices in hollowed sections of its base, with one allowing the staff to dictate that season. In the game, this allowed Link to pass puzzles, find magical seeds and find new places to explore. In battle, the device could be used to hold back attackers at a distance, such as enemies and people that could not be normally struck with the blade. It is found in the Temple of Seasons in Subrosia after Din is kidnapped.
[ edit ]
Crystal Spells
[ edit ]
Din's Fire
Din's Fire
is the first magic spell Link learns in
Ocarina of Time . It produces an expanding ball of fire from Link's body used to defeat enemies and solve certain puzzles.
It is used by
Zelda
in
Super Smash Bros. Melee , albeit in a completely different manner (a roving ball of fire that does no damage until it explodes).
[ edit ]
Farore's Wind
Farore's Wind
is a magic spell that can be cast in
Ocarina of Time . It is learned when a player encounters the Great Fairy of Wisdom. It takes a significant amount of magic to cast. When the spell is used, it allows a player to create a point in a dungeon where they can teleport back to if they are in danger.
Farore's Wind is used by Zelda in
Super Smash Bros. Melee , albeit in a different manner (long range, linear, antigravitational teleportation).
[ edit ]
Nayru's Love
Nayru's Love
is the third magic spell Link can learn in
Ocarina of Time . It covers Link in a blue aura and prevents him from taking any damage. He can, however, still be knocked down. In
The Wind Waker
Link also obtains the Magic Armor, which is a purple diamond that does the exact same thing as Nayru's Love, but instead of making a blue aura shaped as a diamond, it make a purple aura that goes around Link's body and when used it does not feature a cutscene of Link performing the spell.
Nayru's Love is used by Zelda in
Super Smash Bros. Melee , albeit in a different manner (a crystal that both attacks and reflects projectiles).
[ edit ]
Other Magic
[ edit ]
Deku Leaf
The
Deku Leaf
is a magic
leaf
given to Link by the Great Deku Tree in
The Wind Waker . Link can use the Deku Leaf to blow gusts of wind in a certain direction. The magic of Link is used when he uses this to glide with. Once the magic is gone, Link must replentish it before he can glide again.
[ edit ]
Gust Jar
Link using the Gust Jar
A magic jar which can suck in air then shoot it out, Link can also use the
Gust Jar
to bring objects closer to him and suck in enemies, much like the
Half Life 2
gravity gun . The longer the player holds the button, the farther it will shoot the air when the button is released. It appears in
The Minish Cap .
[ edit ]
Lens of Truth
A magical
magnifying glass , the
Lens of Truth
allows its user to see the invisible and see through illusions, while slowly draining magic power. It appears in
Ocarina of Time
and
Majora's Mask . Wolf Link's
Sense
ability in
Twilight Princess
performs a similar function.
[ edit ]
Magic Armor
Magic Armor
is obtained in
The Wind Waker
through a complex trade sequence. Like
Ocarina of Time 's Nayru's Love, Magic Armor prevents Link from taking damage, but not from falling down. It depletes Link's magic meter at an alarming rate when used. There is also a Magic Armor in
Twilight Princess , purchased at Malo Mart's Hyrule Castle Town shop, which uses rupees instead of magic. It drains several rupees per second and also consumes a number of rupees when Link is hit, instead of taking away hearts. However, upon running out of rupees, Link's movement while the Magic Armor is equipped becomes equal to that while wearing the Iron Boots.
[ edit ]
Dungeon Items
These items can only be used in dungeons.
[ edit ]
Big Key
The
Big Key
originated in
A Link to the Past , where it unlocks specific doors with large keyholes and large treasure boxes holding one-of-a-kind items. It returns in most later
Legend of Zelda
games, but only unlocks the door to the bosses lair. In some games it is referred as the "Boss Key".
[ edit ]
Compass
A handy
Compass
allows adventurers to locate treasure and enemies while exploring dungeons, temples, and palaces. It has appeared in every game in the series so far, with the exceptions of
The Adventure of Link, Four Swords
and
Four Swords Adventures
In
Link's Awakening , the compass makes a tone when you enter a room with a key in it.
[ edit ]
Dungeon Map
Made by previous adventurers, these explorers made meticulous
Maps
of their findings, and left them hidden within the walls of some dungeons to aid future explorers. The dungeon map shows Link the entire dungeon in which it was found. It has appeared in every game in the series so far, with the exception of
The Adventure of Link, Four Swords
and
Four Swords Adventures .
[ edit ]
Magic Key
In the original
Legend of Zelda
and the sequel
The Adventure of Link , the
Magic Key
was a key that could be used an unlimited number of times, eliminating the need to find or buy small keys.
[ edit ]
Ooccoo
Ooccoo from
Twilight Princess
Ooccoo
is a being who acts like a warp item in
Twilight Princess , much like
Farore's Wind
in
Ocarina of Time . She will let you set a warp point in a dungeon by staying there and having
Ooccoo Jr.
warp you outside of the dungeon, and back to the warp point inside the dungeon. Unlike other warp items, she must be found again in each dungeon. She also doesn't appear in the final two dungeons for storyline reasons.
[ edit ]
Small Key
Each
Small Key
can open only one door. In the original
Legend of Zelda , not all keys found in a dungeon were necessary to complete it. Unused keys could be used in other dungeons, and extra keys could be bought at shops. In all subsequent
Zelda
games, small keys can only be used in the dungeon they are found in, and frequently, all keys must be found to complete each dungeon.
[ edit ]
Tools
[ edit ]
Book of Mudora
The Book of Mudora
is used as a translation guide for the ancient languages in
A Link to the Past .
[ edit ]
Bug Catching Net
The
Bug Catching Net
is a net given to Link with which he can catch bugs and fairies to put in his bottles. It appears in
A Link to the Past . Amusingly, it can be used to reflect Agahnim's magic spells as if it were the Master Sword. It does not appear in any 3-D games as Link can swing the bottles themselves to capture things inside. It appeared in the Gamecube version of
Soul Calibur II
as Link's "gag" weapon.
[ edit ]
Cross
The
Cross
allows Link to see enemies that were previously invisible in
The Adventure of Link .
[ edit ]
Fishing Rod
The
Fishing Rod
(sometimes called Fishing Pole) is a tool which enables Link to fish. The Fishing Rod first appeared in
Link's Awakening , were Link participated in a fishing mini-game. Link did not actually obtain the Fishing Rod, but was merely lent it by a Fisherman. Link can also rent a Fishing Rod in
Ocarina of Time , and can obtain one of his own in
Twilight Princess , along with the
Fish Log , which keeps track of the fish Link has caught.
[ edit ]
Lanterns and candles
In some
Legend of Zelda
games, a
Lantern
or similar item is used by Link. Its primary function is to light up darkened areas, but it can also be used for offensive purposes. In the original
Legend of Zelda , the
Blue Candle
and
Red Candle
can be used to light up darkened rooms. In
The Adventure of Link
and
A Link to the Past
a lantern is the first item acquired by the player. In
Link's Awakening ,
Magic Powder
can light up torches, while
Ember Seeds
play a similar role in
Oracle of Ages
and
Oracle of Seasons . A lantern reappears in
The Minish Cap
as the
Flame Lantern , where it can also melt ice. A lantern also appears in
Twilight Princess , where it is used to light up darken areas, set things aflame and drive away dangerous fog, requiring a supply of oil, with the option to store additional oil in bottles.
[ edit ]
Letter
Letters
are sometimes used in sub-quests in
Legend of Zelda
games. Often times in exchange for delivering a letter a character will offer Link a special item or service. In
The Wind Waker
and
Twilight Princess , Link can receive letters addressed to him.
[ edit ]
Picto Box
The
Picto Box
allowed Link to take snapshots of the people and places he encountered throughout his adventure. In
Majora's Mask , it could only hold one photograph, but in
The Wind Waker , it could hold up to three photographs. It could only take sepia photos until one upgraded it to the
Deluxe Picto Box , which could take full-color photographs. Pictographs of monsters and characters could then be given to Carlov, who would create a figurine of the picture's subject.
[ edit ]
Raft
Rafts
are used as water transportation in several games in the series. Later games have introduced items such as the
Zora Flippers
and
Mermaid Suit
which allow Link to swim instead.
[ edit ]
Shovel
The
Shovel
first appeared in
A Link to the Past
as an item that allows Link to dig up soft ground, sometimes revealing an item or object. You could also buy one in Links Awakening. In
Twilight Princess , Link's wolf form could dig without aid.
[ edit ]
Spinner
The
Spinner
is a large
top-like
device that Link can ride in
Twilight Princess . It can be used to inflict damage on enemies, ride over quicksand, or ride on rails in the wall to gain speed or access otherwise unreachable areas.
[ edit ]
Stepladder
The
Stepladder
is one of the rare items that only appears in the original
Legend of Zelda . It is used to cross narrow passages of water.
[ edit ]
Telescope
In
The Wind Waker , the
Telescope
allows Link to see far off into the distance, which can trigger certain cutscenes.
[ edit ]
Bait
In the original
Legend of Zelda ,
Bait
resembling meat on a bone is available for purchase in certain shops. This item can distract certain enemies and is required to pass certain rooms inhabited by hungry
Goriya .
All-Purpose Bait and a Hyoi Pear.
In
The Wind Waker , Link can buy
All-Purpose Bait
at
Beedle 's Shop Ship and store it in his
Bait Bag . It is purchased for ten
rupees
in groups of three servings. A purchasable group of this bait will occupy one pouch in the Bait Bag, regardless of how many servings are left. Throwing some bait on the ground can cause pigs to dig there; throwing it near a rat hole causes rats to offer various helpful items for purchase. It can also distract
miniblins , and if thrown onto the sea near
Fishman , he can fill in Link's Sea Chart and offer advice about the area.
In
The Wind Waker , the
Hyoi Pear
is an item similar to bait that is also available for purchase from
Beedle 's Ship Shop for ten
rupees . It is a lightly-freckled
pear
with three indents or bruises that resemble an open-mouthed face, similar to
Edvard Munch 's
The Scream . Link uses the pear by balancing it atop his head in hopes that a nearby
seagull
will be attracted to it. When it is eaten by a bird, the player's point of view and control shifts to the seagull. Link enters a trance state, waving his arms in front of him slowly, as if telepathically guiding the seagull's motions himself. Seagulls can be used outdoors to trigger switches in out-of-reach places on islands. A seagull has no defense, however, and running into an enemy or pressing the R button will revert the control back to Link.

Deku Stick
Deku Stick
A
Deku Stick
is a long wooden branch that can be swung by using the assigned "C" button. They inflict double the damage to that of the Kokiri Sword, and double still when set ablaze, making them the most powerful weapon available to Young Link. Deku Sticks can be acquired mainly by destroying a
Deku Baba
while it is in the upright position. The downside of the Deku Sticks is their lack of durability, as they break on impact with most surfaces. They can also be used to carry fire from torches to other objects that require lighting, but will burn to ashes if left alight. Initially, Link can only carry 10 Deku Sticks, although his carrying capacity can be upgraded as the game progresses.
In
The Wind Waker , there is a similar variant called the
Boko Stick . It also obtained from a Boko Baba. These sticks do not break, and are not stored in the inventory. When on fire, the flame eventually extinguishes and the stick does not turn to ash.
