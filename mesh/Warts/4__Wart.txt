Genetial Warts!!! ewwww (Anastasia has this btw, and although I haven't seen it... According to Google this is what it looks like)
(or
Condyloma
acuminata ,
venereal warts ,
anal warts
and
anogenital warts ) is a highly contagious
sexually transmitted disease caused by some sub-types of
human papillomavirus
(HPV). It is spread through direct skin-to-skin contact during
oral ,
genital , or
anal sex
with an infected partner.
Warts
are the most easily recognized symptom of genital HPV infection. They can be caused by strains 6, 11, 30, 42, 43, 44, 45, 51, 52 and 54 of HPV; types 6 and 11 are responsible for 90% of genital warts cases. [ 1 ]
Less than 1% of those infected develop clinically obvious warts, but those infected can still transmit the virus, [ 2 ]
although another source states that 70% of those who have sexual contact with an infected partner develop genital warts. [ 3 ] [ dubious
–
discuss ]
Other types of HPV also cause
cervical cancer
and probably most
anal cancers .
