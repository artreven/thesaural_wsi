Treating Plantar Warts
May 8, 2012
Plantar
Warts
are non cancerous skin growths that affect the sole of the feet. They are caused by the virus human papillomavirus (HPV) which enter your skin through tiny cuts on the skin.
Plantar
warts
may be painful and very ugly and develop beneath the pressure points in your feet such as the heels or balls of your feet.
Treatment
Plantar
warts
are non cancerous so they are not harmful but you may seek treatment if they make you feel uncomfortable or if they are painful.
Treatment can be done through use of salicylic acid which is available from drug stores. Apply daily to the affected areas.
You can also use home remedies like placing doughnut shaped piece of moleskin around the wart, this is available from the local stores.
You can also use an abrasive material to do a simple non traumatic removal of the skin. This should be done after the sole of the feet has been soaked in water for about 20 minutes to soften the wart.
Minor surgery.
This involves cutting away the wart or destroying the wart by using an electric needle in a process called electrodessication and curettage. Your doctor will anesthetize your skin before this procedure. This treatment is avoided if possible with plantar warts because of the risk of scarring.
Laser treatment.
A type of laser treatment called pulse dye laser treatment burns closed (cauterizes) tiny blood vessels. The infected tissue eventually dies, and the wart falls off. This treatment can cause pain and scarring.
Freezing (cryotherapy).
Your doctor can apply liquid nitrogen with a spray canister or cotton-tipped applicator to freeze and destroy your wart. The chemical causes a blister to form around your wart, and the dead tissue sloughs off within a week or so. The application itself can be painful, and cryotherapy can result in painful or tender blisters that resolve on their own.
Immunotherapy.
This therapy attempts to harness your body’s immune system to remove tough-to-treat warts. This can be accomplished in a couple of ways. Your doctor may inject your warts with interferon, a medication that boosts your immune system’s instinct to reject warts. Or your doctor may inject your warts with a foreign substance (antigen) that stimulates your immune system. Doctors often use mump antigens, because many people are immunized against mumps. As a result, the antigen sets off an immune reaction that may fight off warts. Interferon treatment may result in flu-like symptoms for a few hours after treatment. Both treatments may cause pain.
With each of these treatments, your doctor will provide instructions about how to cover a wart or wound, remove dead tissue between appointments, clean the site, and change a dressing if needed.

HPV Wart Treatment
May 6, 2012
Warts
are a highly infectious disease caused by some type of
human papillomavirus
(HPV). Its spread through skin to skin contacts with an infected partner.
Warts
are the most easily recognized symptom of genital HPV infection, where types 6 and 11 are responsible for 90% of genital warts cases. While those infected by genital HPV are a small percentage, those infected can still transmit the virus.
Warts appear as bumps or growths. They can be flat or raised, single or many, small or large. They tend to be whitish or flesh colored. They are not always easy to see with the naked eye, and many times a person with genital warts doesn’t know that they’re there.
How do you treat warts?
There is no HPV treatment or cure for the virus. There is also no cure for warts. However, warts can be treated, either at home or your doctor’s office. Your doctor will do an examination, make a diagnosis, and then provide treatment, if necessary. A number of different treatments might be used depending on where the warts are located, how big they are, and how many there are. The doctor might put special medications on the warts.
For medication purposes, you can ask your doctor to prescribe either podofilox (Condylox) or imiquimod (Aldara). Both of these topical medications you can apply yourself at home. These medications should not be used if you are pregnant; it is not recommended that you use either podophyllin or podofilox as both can be absorbed by your skin and possibly cause birth defects in your child. Additionally, Aldara is designed to be used only on external warts.
The doctor can also prescribe electrodessication :
This technique uses an electric current to destroy the warts. It can be done in the office with local anesthesia. Of note, the resulting smoke plume may be infectious.
Laser treatment is also used for extensive or recurrent warts. It may require local, regional, or general anesthesia. The laser physically destroys the HPV-induced lesion. Disadvantages include high cost, increased healing time, scarring, and potentially infectious viral particles in the air caused by the laser plume.
Cryotherapy
treatment technique freezes the wart using liquid nitrogen or a “cryoprobe.” It is an excellent first-line treatment because response rates are high with few side effects.
Finally take home care precautions to prevent trauma in the area which can result in bleeding. Be careful to prevent transmission to a sexual partner which can result to genital warts. Also avoid touching them because they are highly infectious.
