The CDP's Top 15 NES Games Of All-Time.
If you're reading this on Monday and not in the distant future, my Internet connection is currently shut down, and my computer is sitting in a shipping crate on the way to the all-new
CDP
Headquarters ( location unknown ). The moving process has been slow and trudging, and I didn't have enough time to write a
Lost Monday
that I was anything close to proud of. Another way to say it is that
Lost Monday
was nowhere
near
the top of my Priorities List. So, in substitution, here's a far-better essay I've been working on for a few weeks;
The CDP's Top 15 NES Games Of All-Time . It's loaded with links, clips, pop culture goodness and various other things that will entertain you thusly if you have the patience to check out everything I've thrown into it ( and if you are a child or man-child of the 80's ). Please enjoy; the
CDP
will return when Headquarters is fully functional. Thanks, and enjoy the next few days. It should also be noted that this is a list of
my
favorite NES games, not some be-all-to-end-all list that I think you'll agree entirely with. Furthermore, if you feel the need to explain in detail why
Castlevania
was better than
Metal Gear , chances are that we're going to end up being friends anyway. Let's go. Pre-Countdown Honorable Mentions go to:
Castlevania
( for being scary ),
Contra
( for being extremely difficult without the
Konami Code ),
Ghouls-'N-Ghosts
( for being absolutely impossible ),
Ninja Gaiden
( for the kickass storyline ),
Final Fantasy
( for being Final freaking Fantasy ) &
Double Dragon II
( for the Cyclone Spin Kick ). 15. Super Mario Bros. 2 SMB2
is hard.
Really
hard.
Interest-rate mortgage calculation over 30 years, adjusted for inflation with
PMI
included- hard, as far as this guy is concerned. In fact, I've never actually won
SMB2
without the assistance of a certain
Game Genie -esque device that allowed me to leap over levels and attack
Wart
with
Matrix -style bullet-time speed. Furthermore,
SMB2
wasn't even a Mario game until it was repackaged for American audiences in 1988 ( and was featured in the first issue of
Nintendo Power , which I proudly own ). That all being said, the music, cartoonish boss appeal and multiple-character selection were all fairly groundbreaking at the time ( not to mention the bizarre androgeny of
Birdo ), and I put many a
controller
through the drywall trying to reiterate myself with the jumping scheme and new
Mario
features. I played this game so much as a child, that I named my cat at the time 'Meowser,' a take-off of the bad-ass
SMB2
boss,
Mouser . Don't laugh, asshole, I was 7. It's still one of the more clever things I've done. YouTube Goodness - The Mouser Battle. 14. Ring King Where to start with the awesomeness that is
Ring King ? The fighters that ranged in color from
Simpsons
yellow to nearly-dead
E.T.
gray? The knockouts that could literally
eject your opponent from the stadium ? Or how about the most unintentional sexual act in NES history, the imfamous 'cornerman bob-n'-weave?'
Ring King
was a game that was simple to play ( the button-mashing controls assured that first-timers could kick any seasoned pro's ass ), which meant that the multi-player tournaments were always a blast. An underrated NES party game, especially when two
n00bz
would duke it out for the first time. It normally looked like a
Toughman
competition; just two guys teeing off on the other's face until someone up and died. And what's more fun than that? YouTube Goodness - Knocked Out Of The Stadium. 13. R.C. Pro-Am There are many NES-related moments that we can all, as retro gamers, remember fondly. In my opinion, there was never anything funnier than watching someone attempt to play
R.C. Pro-Am
for the first time. The control scheme, completely impossible to explain or understand ( until it became a permanently ingrained part of your
central nervous system ), virtually assured that the first 20 attempts at Track 1 would consist of 90-degree pinwheeling into every barrier, wall or oil slick in existence. Once you got it down, you were unstoppable, but when your friend took the reins for the first time, the epic failure was pure bliss. Special attention goes out to the Yellow Car and its 'impossible speed' bursts in later stages of the game; one of the first examples of outright ' cheating ' by computer
AI . Go to hell, unnamed driver. You're the reason my trophy room is full of bronze wrenches. YouTube Goodness - Opening Tracks & The Trophy Room. 12. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game I have an extremely fond memory of attending a birthday party at
Aladdin's Castle
in the 3rd Grade ( remember when
arcades used to be amazing? ). Myself and my three closest friends pooled our ridiculously large amount of game tokens into a small mound under the
TMNT
cabinet and went to town, winning the game
two times in a row . Girls were gently patting the sweat off of our brows and assisting us with generous sips of
Mello Yello
as we stayed focused and united. I was
Donatello ; I was
always
Donatello . It was one of my most treasured video game achievments; I think we pumped $80 into that damn machine. I can't even remember who's
birthday
it was that day, solidly proving that the best memories aren't necessarily the ones that you purposely set out to create. YouTube Goodness - Rocksteady's Got April! 11. The Legend Of Zelda If you ever find yourself talking to me at length about something
I couldn't care less about
( and chances are that you
are ),
The Legend Of Zelda
theme music is probably running through my head on a constant loop. I'm ashamed to admit that I jumped on the
Zelda
train a little late in my childhood, but the joy and reward was just the same. Summer nights spent in a friend's garage, drinking copious amounts of
Kool-Aid
and listening to
C+C Music Factory
on the
boom box . It's what memories are made of. Come to think of it, I don't think I ever got that C+C Music Factory
tape
back. I have a phone call to make. YouTube Goodness - One Of The Best Commercials Ever. 10. Excitebike The overwhelming frustration of overheating mere inches from the finish line. Creating a custom track that launched you directly into a wall
on purpose . Tripping up opponents just before an obstacle that sent them slo-mo tumbling for fifteen seconds straight.
Excitebike
was one of those games that absolutely everyone had, so we're mostly united in our gaming experiences. I was playing
Grand Prix
for the
Atari 2600
a few weeks ago ( a game that I called 'Grand Pricks' in
1988 , because I didn't know any better ), and it made me long for
Excitebike ; the image of your character standing yards away from the Top 3 finishers, head bowed in shame, is one of the more
psychologically damaging
moments of failure in early gaming history. They should have just showed me a picture of my mom getting kicked in the stomach by
Darth Vader ; it may have hurt a little less. YouTube Goodness - Knocking Out Track 5. 9. Tecmo Super Bowl Forget
Madden . It's well-documented that
Tecmo Super Bowl
is the greatest football game in history. Tournaments are still held all over the nation on a weekly basis, and YouTube clips of 500-yard, quarter-length scampers are plentiful. This is the game that will keep the fond memory of
Christian 'The Nigerian Nightmare' Okoye
in my head forever, as the game designers simply threw their hands in the air one night and said, "You know what? Screw everything; let's just make him
impossible
to tackle." That, my friends, is awesome. " No fair; you can't be the Chiefs! " YouTube Goodness - Superman Okoye Destroys The Colts. 8. Mega Man 2 Taken from the
Mega Man 2
Wikipedia
page: " Mega Man 2 was named by
GameSpot
as one of 'The Greatest Games of All Time.' It was also honored in Nintendo Power's 'Top 200 Nintendo Games Ever' list, ranked at number 33. Creator Keiji Inafune claims the success of Mega Man 2 is what made the Mega Man series a hit that continues to spawn
sequels . " I couldn't have said this better myself. Furthermore, I can't tell you how many 'Wood Man' jokes I've made over the years. Heh-heh.... ' wood .' Penis. YouTube Goodness - The Timeless Introduction To Mega Man 2. 7. Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! Well, here's one we can all probably agree on. The cast of characters was comedic and all-encompassing. The 'Dream Fight' code is etched in our
subconscious
until the end of time ( right
off the top of my head: 007-373-5963 ). The sweat-drenched survival of the first 90 seconds with Iron Mike. Trailing behind
Doc Louis'
bike while jogging in a pink tracksuit past the
Statue Of Liberty .
King Hippo . It's all here. Punch-Out!!
is one of those games that I will still be playing and enjoying
when I'm 50 , and maybe by then I'll get the timing down with
Super Macho Man . I once had to dodge his 'Super Spin Punch' 38 damn times in a row. As a side note, I didn't actually win this game until I was in my
late teens , and as I celebrated this long-awaited accomplishment alone in my bedroom, I became acutely aware that good memories are worthless unless they can be shared. Hours later, however, I lost my
virginity , so I'd say it was a pretty good day for me. YouTube Goodness - Iron Mike Gets Owned. 6. Super Mario Bros. I once read an
IGN
or
GameSpy
article proclaiming that " Super Mario Bros.
IS
gaming. " This is unquestionably true; it launched a
rebirth of video gaming
that has been doing nothing but pick up steam and generate
billions of profitable dollars
from losers like me for the last 22 years. I cannot offer anything that hasn't already been said in praise of
SMB , nor can I properly convey its importance to technology and global culture. What I
can
tell you is that the first time I won
SMB , I was horribly sick with
the flu , and in my overly-hyper celebration,
yodeled groceries
directly into the
box fan
whirring in my grandparents' living room. Whatever splatteriffic result you're imagining in your head, I can assure you it was actually far worse. It still didn't deter my celebration; how could it? YouTube Goodness - Amazing SMB Race. 5. Metroid Metroid
has been considered by many to be the greatest NES game ever made, for a number of reasons. The
amazing weapons , storyline and unparalleled
code system . The weeks of
sleepless nights
it took to finally take down the
Mother Brain . The twist ending of having to escape the lair to avoid death, even
after
defeating the boss. And of course, the ultimate twist ending, revealing that our main character and bad-ass hero was actually a
woman . That revelation alone transcended
Metroid
into the
stratusphere
when it comes to games that had a cultural impact, with endless sequels and legions of fans. The first time I battled a
Metroid , I distinctively remember
yelping in terror . Those things were a goddamn nightmare, as I've always had a problem with things that latched onto other things and sucked their lives dry. Like
David Spade . YouTube Goodness - The Final Battle & Best Ending. 4. Metal Gear The beginning of what is probably the greatest action franchise in gaming history. This one had it all:
Spying .
Traitors .
Intrigue .
Weapons galore . The glorification of
cigarettes . The final twist and realization that your trusted boss has been setting you up for the fall from the very beginning, and it's up to
you
to take him out once and for all. My 'Official Metal Gear Map' is tattered and held together exclusively with
Scotch tape
and memories, but thinking back to insomniac weekends spent conquering this game is the perfect definition of childhood happiness. This game is also noted for its 'Engrish,' with phrases such as " The truck have started to move! " and " I feel asleep! " Oh, and you get penalized if you shoot the prisoners that you're trying to capture, so try not to do that, even though they're sitting there, all tied up and pathetic. Show restraint, Solid Snake ( To this day, I'm still baffled that the game designers decided to name their main character after what amounts to nothing more than an erection joke ). YouTube Goodness - The Opening Levels To Metal Gear. 3. River City Ransom River City Ransom
has received a cult following and legions of devoted fans ( ironically ) after being named the 'Most Underrated NES Game Of All-Time' by
Nintendo Power
magazine. And as far as start-to-finish, vague storyline-driven games go, this was one of the most fun games you'll probably ever play. Follow the map, beat the piss out of every gang in River City and save your girlfriend. Rob the thugs, hit the stores to buy goods that will make yourself stronger. Nowadays, most games follow this structure; back in the day,
River City Ransom
was the only game in town. The music was tight, the locations were great, the weapons and violence were supreme and the replayability factor is off the charts. I
still
play this game. YouTube Goodness - Basic Clip That Will Convince You Of
RCR's
Awesomeness. 2. Tetris Here it is. The game that gave almost all of its fans Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. The game that actually spawned a psychological after-effect known as the ' Tetris Effect. ' The game that is so ingrained into our minds and memories that we can actually fantasize about playing a game. Tetris deserves to sit right next to Chess and Poker as one of the greatest games in the history of mankind; a premise so simple and addictive that it changed the lives of arguably
billions
of people. It's f***ing
Tetris , man! YouTube Goodness - You're Nowhere
Near
The Best Player On Earth. 1. Super Mario Bros. 3 February 12, 1990. I had just turned 8 years old one week earlier, and pooled every penny I had received as a gift and ran to Toys-R-Us. There, behind the glass, hung the greatest Nintendo game of all-time.
Super Mario Bros. 3 . After seeing
SMB3
for the first time in Fred Savage film
The Wizard
the year before ( and what a brilliant marketing ploy, by the way ), I knew that it was my destiny to conquer this game like a five-dollar whore. I had the strategy guide. I had the maps. I had the entire Summer to hone my craft, and indeed I did. In the Summer of 1990, I won
SMB3
an astounding
100 times , something that I'd argue that nobody else has ever done. I'd get up in the morning, eat breakfast, play some basketball and win
SMB3 . The next day, I did the same; so on and so forth, until school was back in session. As depressing as that may sound, it was actually quite amazing. Friends would come over and win with me. I'd win with one life. I'd win using no Warp Zones. I even won some levels by looking into a mirror. It was probably the best Summer ever. YouTube Goodness - Mario! Mario! Thanks for reading. Sound off in the comments section and let us know what
your
favorite NES games are.

You're joking right? please tell me you didn't just leave Legend of Zelda out of the Top 10 in favor of Excitebike!
And Mike Tyson's Punch out doesn't even land a spot in the Top 3? This list is weaker than a jab from Glass Joe!

I was going to mention the

slight too, but someone already took care of that. I would like to put
Kid Icarus
in for an Honorable mention. I used to play the HELL

out of that game. Nice list though.

I agree with Blu, JT.
Bubble Bobble
was weak. I'm pretty disappointed in the Zelda issue as well. Zelda and Contra were two of my favorites. Then again, I only had Zelda and Contra.

Although I was born 4 years after it's release I had a NES cartridge collection that rivaled God's. I'm pretty much there with you on most of you list, but you really got to move Zelda up... *still Tetris god*

Shit dude, you just brought back so many memories. For the record, I say that SMB1 was the most difficult to win.
I still haven't.
Mario 2, however, I beat a number of times without too much trouble (and what a fuckin' lame ending), and Mario 3?
Shit, son, I could beat that game in my sleep. Loved Metroid, loved Excitebike, loved MT's Punchout.
Additions to my personal list would be Double Dragon and Double Dribble, alike in name only but both totally awesome.
Oh and
Adventure Island
and
Mighty Bomb Jack .
I loved those games, obscure as they were. It's funny; we were the first kids in our area to get both Atari and NES, but then we kind of gave up on keeping up with new consoles.
Really, after NES, do you really need anything else?

It's been a long time since I've commented... I've been reading, no doubt.
I was even preparing an emotional piece on how nice it is to come to work on Monday morning to reading Lost Monday.
It was missing this morning and replaced by something just as good, if not better. I share the same sentiment as most everyone here in the fact that Zelda is far too low on the list.
Honestly, though, it was Kevin that brought me back.
I needed to see someone else mention Baseball Stars.
My Top Ten 1. Super Mario 3 2. Baseball Stars 3. Zelda 4. Mike Tyson's Punch Out 5. Wall Street Kid 6. Little League Baseball 7. Tecmo Bowl 8. Vegas Dreams 9. Paper Boy 10.
Excitebike The original Super Mario is above a Top Five list, though.
Without Super Mario, we have none of the above.
I'd also point out that Tetris was, to me, much better for the Gameboy.
I'm sure you feel the same way, too. Lastly, I hadn't seen The Wizard in over 15 years until I watched it again late last year.
Now, it's played non-stop in the family mini-van with our three kids reciting nearly every line (7/f, 3/f, 2/m)

I’m back at the office, and things at CDP World Headquarters are starting to take shape. Let’s see if I can blaze through these comments and keep this thread going; it has to last us a few more days while I catch up on…well, everything. 1. As I stated in the list, Zelda ended up lower on the countdown because I didn’t become a fan of it until later on in life. It didn’t get a proper chance to become permanently ingrained into my psyche. Furthermore, it’s one of those games that I’d probably never play as an adult. Doesn’t mean I don’t love it, though. 2. Excitebike is good for the ‘friend factor.’ You play with your friends, and it will keep you entertained for hours. At least it did with my friends; although Zelda was always somewhere in the mix. This, however, isn’t a list of my friends’ favorite NES games. 3. Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!! Doesn’t deserve to be in the Top 3 because it’s essentially a memorization game with little-to-nothing concerning anything else. Don’t get me wrong, it rules like nobody’s business, but at the end of the day, it simply is what it is. 4. Kid Icarus was a good game, and it would have made my Top 20 list. 5. Same goes for Bubble Bobble. I truly did play the crap out of that game, masculinity be damned! 6. Contra was awesome, but I had a terrible experience with that game that I’ll shed more light on in my next book. It involves nudity, so you’re going to want to check it out. 7. I like that Cargirl had a NES with two games. I find that adorable. 8. There will be a Tetris tournament at CDP Headquarters this Summer. Keep an eye out for an invitation. I’m serious. 9. I don’t think I’ve ever heard someone say that SMB2 was easier than SMB1, crazy. SMB3 is probably the hardest in terms of difficulty, but most of us have played it to oblivion at this point. Damn, I love that stupid little game. 10. After the NES, there’s barely any reason to keep up with new consoles. When I get sick of the Wii, I always go back to the old standby. 11. I’ve never played Baseball Stars. D’oh! I have some Wikipedia’ing to do. 12.
Welcome back, Moe! I thought I had pissed you off or something. Nice list; Tetris for the GameBoy is indeed the superior version. 13. Paperboy was freaking awesome. Remember that song ‘Ditty?’ Still one of my favorite hip-hop tracks of all-time. Wait….what? 14. I will watch Gladiators tonight. Is the Evanator back?

This post has been getting a ton of traffic
(because the Internet is fueled by nostalgia and lists) . Here's what one commenter had to say over at Reddit: "Metal Gear for the NES is an absolute abomination. To be in anyone's Top 10 NES games list you must be heavily clouded by nostalgia and peer pressure. Not a single hidden gem on that list, like Journey to Silius. What an average list." Wow, geez. I wasn't training to be an elitist douchebag at the age of
8 , dude. I was just playing games that I really liked, not attempting to uncover rare titles that would boost my schoolyard cred and impress irrelevant, miserable bastards on the Internet 20 years later. Some people make me wonder. Who takes the time to spout something like that?

I met Bo Jackson at a track meet once when I was in 6th grade. His daughter was there in a race and he came to watch. He was a douchebag and wouldn't talk to anyone. Speaking of LOST, I'm a few episodes away from being done with Season 3, and I'm thinking I might miss the real-time finale. I'm trying to up my daily viewing time, but I'm also becoming a bit sensitive to sunlight and I'm losing sleep to images of Ethan Rom. I've also stopped bathing, started caking dirt on myself before school, I only dress in burlap, and for no reason I killed a man with a crossbow that I fashioned out of bones and sticks. *that's not true

"Metal Gear for the NES is an absolute abomination. To be in anyone's Top 10 NES games list you must be heavily clouded by nostalgia and peer pressure. Not a single hidden gem on that list, like Journey to Silius. What an average list." This criticism would have made sense if the list was "Top 15 Hidden NES Gems." What a d-bag...that person clearly didn't even read your intro which explained why you chose the games. I repeat, WHAT A D-BAG. I enjoyed reading the list, and I've only played like 3 of those games in my life.

See, now, the problem is that when I think of "pop a cap in someone's ass" I immediately picture stuffing a baseball hat up someone's wazoo.
This is why I'll never be cool. Nerdcore, though, maybe I could do.

If you make me a beat, I'll write a Nerdcore rap about the
CDP . We'll tour the globe; the French would love us. Shoving a hat up someone's ass is the funniest abstract concept I've heard all day. I snortled.

Emily/CDP- You mean "popping a cap..." isn't hat v. wazoo? I guess I owe some people an apology.

There you were, shoving caps where the sun don't shine, when all this time you should have been murdering them.

I always kind of picture "popping a cap in someone's ass" as using someone's butthole as a bottle-opener. Gross.

Anxiety disorder is considered to be one of the worst mental conditions that affect human beings by making them prone to baseless and groundless worries but with the arrival of anti-anxiety medications like
xanax
in the pharmaceutical market, successful treatment of anxiety related disorders has become an instant possibility. But, instead of straightway moving ahead to use Xanax and other medicines to treat anxiety such as Buspar and Tenormin, you can log in to
http://www.pill-care.com
and get hold of fundamental tidbits on these medicines first.

Oh man, great memories. I had so many terrible NES games - Friday the 13th, Monster Party (rare, but not good), freaking Hydlide - but I played some great games too and I couldn't agree more with SM3 being #1 - and also, love for The Wizard.

Stumbled onto your blog, great stuff! These games are a piece of my childhood in tangible form. If I hear a certain sound from Metroid or see a screen shot on some forum of games like these, I am instantly transported back to the NES days of my youth. Awesome choices, I agree on many. Blaster Master is another classic I would add, and yes, the Ring King cornermen always brought forth fits of laughter. I remember my Dad going, "Uh...whatta they doing?!" Great work. be cool...
