What treatment is available for Anxiety?
Because
anxiety
is a 'behavioural' condition, it can only be successfully
treated
by behavioural techniques.
Conventional methods of
treating anxiety
focus on drug therapy and 'talking therapies' as a combined approach, but drug therapy is inappropriate and 'talking therapies' fall short of providing an
anxiety treatment
which provides the support and assurances that are so vital to a full and lasting recovery.
Successful
anxiety treatments
must address the root cause of the
anxiety disorder , addressing the 'catalyst' for the
anxiety
or superficially treating the
symptoms
is not sufficient to remove the underlying
anxiety disorder .
The root
cause of anxiety
is the way a small organ in the brain, called the
Amygdala , has become re-set at a higher than normal
anxiety
level, so an
anxiety treatment
which addresses this is the only route to re-setting this in order to regain a normal, resting
anxiety
level.
