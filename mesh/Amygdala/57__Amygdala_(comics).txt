Thoughts On The Dark Knight Rises Trailer
It’s funny, when it comes to movies, I’m actually not that hard to impress.
While I consider myself well-versed in the world of film, at the end of the day all it really takes to peak my interest, is:
A): A decent cast.
B): A decent concept.
and C): The promise of people punching one another at some point in the movie.
In some cases that last one, if represented well enough, is the
only
excuse I need to see a movie, regardless of how dumb or crappy it is.
I rented the shit-fest that was
Unknown
purely in the hopes of seeing a handful of
Liam Neeson
related beat downs.
I saw
Fast Five
solely
for the purpose of seeing
Vin Diesel
and
The Rock
(not Dwayne) bro-out and put each other through particle board walls.
Pictured: Either The Rock is about to get suplexed, or Vin Diesel's in the process of getting Speared. I honestly can't tell...
And when it comes to
The Dark Knight Rises , as utterly incalculable as the build-up has, and will
continue
to be for the next 6 months or so, at the end of the day I will see it because it, unlike any other movie in film history; will deliver the long anticipated spectacle of
Batman
and
Bane  duking it out on the big screen.
That these 2 titans of comics are to be portrayed by capable actors such as
Christian Bale
and
Tom Hardy
respectively, is merely the icing on the cake.
I find this funny. Does that make me less of a man?
Christopher Nolan’s
track record when it comes to cinematography and fight choreography suggests that the ensuing bout will be clumsy and edited through a meat grinder, but even so, I’ve been waiting to see this fight brought to life on the silver screen since I was 6 years old; and crappy or not, I will not be denied.
That being said, Batman and Bane grudge match aside, what did I think of the new trailer for The Dark Knight Rises?
Well, to answer your question, I felt it was quite good by most standards, but much too enigmatic and fractured in it’s presentation to pack the same visceral punch that the later trailers for
The Dark Knight
did.
Here’s a refresher in case you need it:
I’d prefer not to compare the 2, as it’s obvious the people cutting the trailers for these movies came at it from very different tonal and thematic standpoints; but I feel it needs to be said that, to me, The Dark Knight really did have some of the
best
trailers of all time.
Everything, from the shot selection, to the music cues, to the overall pacing of the trailers for The Dark Knight was absolutely spot on.
What’s more, thanks to the dialogue-heavy nature of the trailers, as well as his untimely death, an absurd amount of buzz was generated for
Heath Ledger’s
portrayal of
The Joker , (*Sigh* “Why So Serious?”) not to mention the overall plot of the film was made crystal clear.
Though it sounds silly in this cynical age of ours, in many ways I feel the catchphrases and buzzwords of The Dark Knight actually served to make it’s advertising campaign both effective and memorable on the whole.
The trailer for The Dark Knight Rises has a lot of neat shots in it, promising quite a few interesting set piece moments, however, perhaps due to the lack of dialogue, many of these shots are difficult to interpret from a purely visual standpoint.
Early on we see the reflection of a man with a cane approaching a shiny dinner platter while
Alfred
drones on about the Wayne dynasty:
Pictured: I have no fucking clue. Maybe a Ra's Al Ghul flashback?
At some point we see someone stumble onto the set of
Kenneth Branagh’s
Hamlet :
Pictures: Ballrooms + Flower Petals = Hamelt. It's science.
Later, we see a bearded Bruce Wayne wandering around what appears to be the prison equivalent to
Discovery Zone :
I know it's probably supposed to be a prison, but honestly, I kind of wanna' play on it...
There’s
that French lady
from
Inception  n’shit.
A FOOTBALL FIELD was just DESTROYED! WHY ARE YOU SMILING!?
There’s
Joseph Gordon-Levitt .
Pictured: Joseph Gordon "Still Not Sure Where To Put The Hyphen" Levitt.
There’s
A SHIT TON
of rappeling.
The Dark Knight Rises: A Story of Men On Ropes.
And then we have
Anne Hathaway
as a mean lady that may or may not be
Catwoman .
Seriously, if you take into account the fact that maybe,
just maybe , the people viewing this trailer haven’t been blogging about every step of the script writing process, or staring at leaked production photos for the past several months, (oddly enough, not me!) then this trailer basically offers no hint as to her role being that of Selina Kyle.
Oh wait excuse me, she’s wearing a mask at a masquerade ball that, if you look
really
hard, has
cat ears :
Direct quote: "WHOOOOOOOO!!!!!!"
Sarcasm deployed, mystery solved.
Much like
Aaron Eckhart’s
Two-Face , unless you’ve been following the production or are familiar with the Batman universe, chances are you’d never know Anne Hathaway was supposed to be Catwoman in this trailer.
Indeed, I’m curious to know what this trailer meant to people who
aren’t
familiar with Batman outside of the movies.
In many ways, when I watch this trailer, I feel my perception is skewed by the fact that I already have an attachment to and understanding of many of the characters based on their comic book equivalent.
When I think “Bane,” I already have an image in mind of what I expect from him.
When I hear Tom Hardy speaking through his mask I say to myself:
"I can see how people could find that hard to understand, but goddamnit that sounds like Bane!"
When I see scenes from the trailer like the prison break, I think to myself:
"Nice. That looks straight out of Knightfall!"
To the average Batman virgin however, I’d imagine imagery such as this would be provocative, but purely in a “oh, so that’s gonna’ happen at some point” kind of way.
Hell, I’m willing to bet the average Bat Virgin doesn’t have the slightest clue as to
who
or
what
Bane even is.
What I think I’m trying to say, is that the style of editing and presentation of this trailer is enticing, as anything with a budget and pretty pictures can manage to be, but at the same time I feel frustrated by the numerous vagaries it throws in my lap.
As you can probably tell, I’m not a fan of the
J.J. Abrams -style marketing.
It’s not that I prefer my trailers to spell their plots and structure out to me, I simply value coherence and context over sound cues and pretty pictures.
Much like all of Christopher Nolan’s blockbusters, The Dark Knight Rises appears to be an audio-visual powerhouse, though in some ways it appears a little less so at this point.
The set pieces looks suitably big, but the color palette appears more gray-ish and natural than The Dark Knight and
Batman Begins , and curiously enough, despite it being an almost comical trademark of his, there’s not a single (gorgeous) overhead shot of a cityscape.
Instead he decided to pull a 180 and do an INVERTED overhead shot for the poster!
That last part troubles me, as I’m a big fan of Nolan’s wide open establishing shots, particularly in outdoor scenes, and though it may just be the editor’s doing; there are none to be found in this trailer.
Perhaps the strangest thing though, at least to me, is the fact that they re-used the mood building drone AKA The Joker’s theme from The Dark Knight in this trailer.
I always thought of that particular piece of music as “belonging” to The Joker, which made it somewhat puzzling to hear played over a trailer for a film that, almost certainly; won’t feature him.
Despite everything I’ve said about this trailer, both good and bad, at the end of the day it’s a very good piece of advertising for a sequel that, unfortunately, benefitted from some of the best advertising and pre-release buzz in recent memory.
Not only that, it’s only the
first
trailer, for a huge movie that isn’t dropping until late in the summer.
As good as the advertising for The Dark Knight was from the get go, the 2nd trailers for it,
Iron Man , and Inception were all
MONUMENTALLY
better than the first, which leads me to believe the same will likely be the case with The Dark Knight Rises.
In addition to this, one also has to consider the fact that virtually all of Christopher Nolan’s blockbusters up to this point, while heavily advertised, also did well to avoid showing a great deal of the major story beats and action set pieces.
I mean hell, neither the teaser nor the trailer saw any mention of
Morgan Freeman’s
Lucius Fox , nor any of stuff from the prologue sequence that made the rounds through theaters last week.
I don’t know about you, but up until it’s release I really thought the “truck flip” from The Dark Knight trailer was going to be the climax of the movie.
Instead, the entire skyscraper based finale of the movie ended up playing that role, while never once being hinted at in the trailers.
I guess what I’m trying to say, is that though I may seem overly critical, in truth I’m just a fanboy hoping for the best.
In the meantime though, as weird as it seems, I think I actually liked the almost universally panned
teaser
for The Dark Knight Rises somewhat better than the trailer.
True, most of the footage was borrowed from Batman Begins.
True,
Commissioner Gordon’s
dialogue was hard to understand.
True, virtually nothing Commissioner Gordon had to say was even
worth
hearing in the first place.
BUT , at the very end of the teaser, there is a single, barely 2 second shot that made it all worth it:
Pictured: All I needed to see.
Batman in the rain, taking a deep breath, while Bane slowly approaches from the foreground.
The whole thing was crap up until then, but that last shot instantly sold me.
The trailer, while bigger and much more coherent, didn’t have this shot or even a suitable equivalent.
True, it featured a few shots of Batman and Bane throwing down in the snow, however I felt the subtlety and dramatic implication of the teaser shot did more to appease the fanboy in me than the entirety of the full trailer.
That’s just me though.
Do I ever need a reason to post this? Didn't think so...

Thoughts On The Dark Knight Rises Rumor Mill
Jim Lee Batman FTW.
I happened upon
an article on IGN
earlier today that ruminated on some possible plot details of
Christopher Nolan’s
upcoming
Batman
three-quel,
The Dark Knight Rises .
Said article made mention of
Talia al Ghul
and the
League of Shadows
(“Assassins” in the comics) likely having a role in the central plot of the film, which most likely points to
Tom Hardy’s
previously announced role as
Bane
taking a hit in screen time and dramatic relevance.
"Bane takes backseat to NO ONE!!!"
My personal objections to this potential snubbing of Bane aside, I honestly feel that Talia could be an interesting element to the overarching story of the Nolan-verse of Batman lore.
With
Catwoman
already announced for the cast of the film, we now have
2
very potent femme fatales of Batman’s rogues present in 1 film.
Combine that with a Bruce Wayne who’s very likely still shaky around the lady-folk due to his previous love getting, y’know; blown the fuck up in the
previous movie , and you have the makings of a very intricate and deceptive love triangle.
Eew! Batman has cooties!
In addition to this, Talia serves as an effective anchor to
Batman Begins
in the form of her familial relation to the primary villain of that film,
Ra’s al Ghul ; making for an epic plot thread that, if executed properly; will lend a sense cohesiveness to the whole trilogy.
While nothing is certain, least of all the plot elements mentioned above; the thought of Bane being cast as anything less than a primary villain feels like kind of a letdown.
When Bane was initially announced as a villain for The Dark Knight Rises, I was hoping against hope that he was going to be
the
villain, that is; the main foil for Batman regardless of whatever notables of his rogues gallery ended up being cast in the film.
Upon reading that Talia was a possible element of the film though, it makes it hard to picture Bane as little more than the muscle, or worse yet; a pawn to the machinations of the League of Shadows.
Despite my
personal
disappointment in said news, (anything short of a live-action
Knightfall
will probably fall short in my eyes…) it’s interesting to note that this particular plot rumor actually follows the Batman comics pretty closely.
Not long ago, I was fortunate to acquire a copy of the somewhat rare Batman story arc entitled
Legacy .
I PAID!
In Legacy, the Bat-Family (including Catwoman) is charged with preventing Ra’s Al Ghul, his daughter Talia, Bane, and the entire League of Shadows
from unleashing a catastrophic plague on humankind.
While the story is indeed “comic booky” to the point of being unfeasible for live-action adaptation, the
one
element of the story that drew to pick it up, was that Legacy was known to contain the
only
legitimate rematch between Batman and Bane post-Knightfall.
While I honestly can say, grudgingly; that the rematch was not at all worth the
considerable
price of admission, it was fascinating to see Bane incorporated into a Ra’s Al Ghul story nonetheless.
In Legacy, Bane’s role was that of a stand-in for Bruce Wayne as Ra’s Al Ghul’s potential heir.
A key storyline that has often been used in interactions between Batman and Ra’s Al Ghul has always been that of Ra’s wishing to marry Talia off to Bruce and have him take control of the League of Shadows.
Hell, at one point Batman actually went through with all of the above; only to turn his back on Ra’s and Talia after a moral disagreement.
"Moral Disagreement" of course being code for "Naked Swordfight."
The point is, Bane is and always has been somewhat of a cracked mirror image of Batman, such that their origins and motivations are nearly opposite, but their abilities and steadfast natures are nearly identical.
Going with this line of thinking, the writers cleverly wrote Bane into Legacy as Ra’s new heir, as well as future husband to Talia.
If Christopher Nolan and his crew were to associate Bane with the League of Shadows in a fairly logical (by comic book standards) manner, such as the one listed above; I see no reason why it wouldn’t work out.
My hope remains that Tom Hardy is given free reign to take center stage as
the
villain of The Dark Knight Rises, but with
Anne Hathaway’s
Catwoman, the yet to be cast role of Talia, and
Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s
yet to be announced (or confirmed) role in the film also floating around somewhere in the script; it seems unrealistic to think that
anyone
will be claiming this film as their own.
Much like every Christopher Nolan film of the post-Batman Begins era, I’d expect The Dark Knight Rises to be very much an ensemble affair, making it unrealistic to expect a singular, commanding performance from anyone in the cast ala
Heath Ledger
and
Jack Nicholson’s
Joker (s).
Bane’s a heavy for sure, but his charisma and personality can’t hold a candle to the endless possibilities that a character like The Joker presents to actors.
That being said, I’m a Batman nut,
and
a Bane fanatic; so The Dark Knight Rises is basically the biggest comic book movie
ever
for me.
Gonna’ be hard to wait for this one…

Bane + Christopher Nolan = I Love You Christopher Nolan
It finally happened folks.
Bane
has been officially cast for
Christopher Nolan’s
next, and likely last;
Batman
film,
The Dark Knight Rises .
When I first read about it, I was floored.
I, along with God knows how many comic fans; have been asking for Bane in every Batman film since his debut in
Knightfall .
And no, THIS doesn't count.
He’s one of my favorite villains in Batman’s pantheon, and I have no doubt that Nolan will do him justice in bringing him to the silver screen.
Curiously enough,
Tom Hardy
of Nolan’s
Inception ; is cast as the titular South American juicing genius.
While I honestly don’t
see
Bane in Hardy at first glance, my perception of his as an actor is strictly limited to his performance in Inception, so I don’t think it fair of me to pass judgment based on that alone.
Even so, Hardy’s physical presence seems rather puny when compared to the hulking physique of the character, not to mention I’d be curious to see if he’ll be able to pull of a South American accent, but these are questions that only come to mind given my love for the character.
... Tom Hardy everyone!
Aside from the glee that shoots through my heart as I think of how awesome it’s going to be to see one of my favorite comic villains brought to life on the big screen, the best part of casting Bane for The Dark Knight Rises, is the fact that his character brings a very different dynamic to the mix.
Batman Begins
and
The Dark Knight
featured numerous villains of Batman’s gallery of rogues, however with the exception of perhaps
Ra’s Al Ghul , none of them stood as
physical
match to the caped crusader.
I like you Carrey, but Batman would turn your face inside out with one punch.
While Bane has shown (in the comics) that he is very much on par with Batman in terms of intelligence and cunning, the element of his character that stands out the most is that he is physically as strong as, or stronger; than Batman.
Aside from
Amygdala ,
Killer Croc , and maybe a few others, Batman rarely has to contend with opponents that physically outmatch him, let alone one’s that can count to 5.
Man, I love that clip…
Much like how I’ve been waiting (and continue to wait…) for another
Superman
film to cash in on the amazing success of the wholly under-appreciated
Superman II
by giving him villains he can slug it out with, I’ve spent much of my life waiting for a Batman film to put him up against someone that can duke it out with the dark knight.
As my “Sequential Visual Narrative” teacher once told me:
“Superman is only fun when he has something to punch.”
Which is why this FAILED and should have been titled: "Superman Lifts Progressively Heavier Things"
While I’m of course excited to see what Christopher Nolan’s script has in mind for Bane, the comic fan in me can’t help wonder/worry how Tom “Fish Lips” Hardy will do when it comes to embodying the beast that is Bane.
As evidenced by Nolan’s casting methods since Batman Begins, he’s a man very much keen on casting his films with actors he’s comfortable/familiar with, or failing that; lots and lots of English people.
Seriously man, you try an’ count how many actors in his movies come from across the pond, and you’re likely to run out of fingers
and
toes.
Oh well, it’s probably a comfort thing; and based on his success in the industry up to this point, I’d say it’s working for him.
Anyway,
Catwoman
has also been cast for The Dark Knight Rises, with
Anne Hathaway
filling the role.
Anne Hathaway's Eyes: The Only Thing That Can Compete With Jennifer Garner's Forehead in terms of hogging a shot.
She’s a decent actress, and definitely has a way about her that seems appropriate for Selina Kyle; however aside from
Michelle Pfeiffer’s
multi-faceted performance in
Batman Returns , I bear no love for the character whatsoever.
Honestly, as of this point I’m on board for The Dark Knight Rises for Bane and Chris Nolan; that’s about it.
Oh yeah, and
Michael Caine , ’cause he’s fuckin’ pimp.
Michael Caine on any given Thursday. That's your mom on the left, by the way.
Anyway, that’s it for today, hopefully you’re all as excited/elated as I am for this one!

Batman: Arkham Asylum Is Good. Like, Really Good.
So,
Arkham Asylum
is a good game.
Like,
really
good.
Last night I parked my butt in front of the TV for a good solid 4 hours straight playing it, and by golly, I enjoyed every minute of it.
4 hours might not sound like a helluva’ long time to some of the more hardcore gamers out there, so allow me to elaborate.
These days I’m what is commonly referred to as a “casual gamer.”
Pictured: The Exact Opposite of A "Casual Gamer."
Not only that, I have this weird personal issue where after about an hour or so of playing videogames, I start to feel anxious; like I need to get up and do something else
RIGHT NOW .
More often than not, I tend to prioritize activities like working out, going to bed early, or writing
this fucking blog , over playing videogames.
In the case of my maiden voyage on Batman: Arkham Asylum last night though, this was not the case.
Near as I can tell, the game’s greatest success, is the constant feeling of progress and accomplishment that the game imparts to it’s player.
Last night I mentioned
how I really don’t care much for
Metroid -style games.
Like many non-Metroid fans, my biggest objection to the structure of those games, is not the fault of the designers, but rather my own stupidity.
Thought I’ve always said that
Zelda
games made me feel dumb as a kid, Metroid games made me feel downright “special.”
Like,
helmet
“special.”
Stone Cold demonstrating the image crippling power of The Retard Helmet.
Something about the layout of the map, and how the player was expected to wade their way through shit storms of enemies and hazards without knowing where to go, just never did it for me.
Though I’ve heard Arkham Asylum referred to as a Metroid- Vania
style game, (a description which is fairly accurate) the experience is nowhere near as lonesome, nor the map layout as cryptic as either of those games.
Trust me, having
Oracle
on staff to order you around via radio every now and again is a godsend for exploration newbs such as myself.
Well hello there madam.
Feel free to call me on my Bat Phone anytime you like...
In short, it’s similar to a Metroid-Vania game, but with a more structured and objective based progression.
Which is a good thing, seeing as I can think of no dumber element to a Batman game than having the player get lost.
Think about it, would the fuckin’ Batman ever get
lost , much less at Arkham?
Pictured: Batman upon realizing he is in fact, a retard.
Batman is a man on top of shit in any situation, so I feel it is a wise decision on the part of the developers to have made the game’s structure reflect this.
Aside from the strength of the layout of the game, I feel that the games 240 or so collectibles really add a lot to making the player feel like their making some headway into the game, even in it’s early stages.
While part of me wants to say that, like
Mega Man X3 , there are in fact too many hidden items in the game, to the point in which you literally can’t turn a corner without accidentally bumping into
something
useful, thus far I think I actually like this element of Arkham Asylum.
It is kind of silly, walking into a room and finding
Riddler
trophies n’shit strewn about; but in a game with a map as large as this, any form of progress, no matter how minute, goes a long way towards making neurotic players like myself feel like they know what their doing.
Near as I can tell, this is Batman’s greatest success:
Spoon-feeding the player little rewards throughout the entire game so as to effectively stamp out the possibility of frustration.
It’s an incredibly elementary approach to game design, but it’s working for me so far.
As of writing this, I have had firsthand encounters with 2 major supervillains of Batman’s rogue’s gallery:
The Scarecrow , and
Bane .
The developers take on Scarecrow was mighty impressive.
Both the level design and his costume for his sequence reflect a definite
Freddy Krueger -esque sensibility, but given the seedier nature of Arkham Asylum’s art design, I feel it works very well.
Ninja + Freddy Krueger + Batman Begins Scarecrow + Psycho Mantis = Arkham Asylum Scarecrow.
From a gameplay standpoint, I found this “boss fight” (wasn’t really a fight…) to be quite entertaining.
Shifting the game into 2-D sidescrolling mode so as to allow for more streamlined movement and coordination really worked, and I applaud the efforts of the developers.
Bane, on the other hand, was a fun battle on a visceral level, however the comic fan inside me was kind of miffed by his brutish persona.
Bane as envisioned by the marketing department of the UFC...
As a kid that grew up reading
Knightfall , Bane has a special place in my heart as one of my favorite Batman villains, and yet every time he’s used in media other than the comics, his character is grossly misinterpreted.
Um... No. Just, no...
Bane isn’t a massive brute or meathead, he’s a cunning and wily villain that could be called Batman’s equal on almost every level.
Oh well, my inner-comic dork’s objections aside, I’m happy that Arkham Asylum took a few seconds to at least explain
why
Bane suddenly went retard, not to mention
Hulk -ed out beyond the realm of believability.
Essentially, Bane serves as key element to the game’s plot, not as a mastermind, or even hired hand; but as an instrument forcibly implemented by the combined will’s of
The Joker
and a mysterious Dr. Young.
From what I know at the 4 hour mark, the plot involves Joker using Dr. Young to extract and deconstruct the Venom Derivative from Bane, which they then mutate and enhance to create a more powerful Titan Formula which causes people to Hulk Out.
Basically, Joker plans to use the Titan Formula to create an army of Hulk-ed Out thugs to let loose on Gotham.
It’s kind of stupid, in a Silver Age comic-y sort of way, but the real experience of a game is
playing
it, and the minute to minute experience of Arkham Asylum thus far goes a long way towards making up for a slightly retarded plot.
Anyway, I’ve said about as much as I feel I can about Arkham Asylum for now.
I will say this though:
The combat system is a little simplistic for my
Devil May Cry
trained thumbs, but it’s rewarding in a “look what I just did with 2 buttons!” sort of way.
Now excuse me, I’m gonna’ go beat the shit out of some more Bat-Villains…

Batman Games and the Azn Badger
Today, after more than a month since my last PS3 game purchase, ( Demon’s Souls ) I went out and bought
Batman: Arkham Asylum .
This one has been a long time coming for me.
As you may have guessed, the Azn Badger is very much a fan of the
Batman .
The
comics , the
animated series , the first 2 and last 2 live-action movies, (those other ones never happened…)  if it’s Batman related media; I’ve probably seen it or
want
to see it.
In my eyes, few characters in the realm of fiction better represent the embodiment of a persona crafted through sheer will than Batman.
He’s a man that
chooses
to be what he feels he must, and that simple element of his character has led to a seemingly neverending stream of great stories surrounding him.
It
hasn’t
however, led to all that many videogames that represented him all that well.
Batman Begins: The only game where seasoned criminals are paralyzed with fear at the sight of moving boxes.
The
Tim Burton
Batman
movie-tie on the
NES , and the
Batman Returns
game on the
Super NES
stand as my favorite Batman games of yesteryear, however aside from borrowing the sounds and aesthetic of their respective movies, neither really made use of the
character
of Batman in their gameplay.
The NES game was a handsome and vaguely
Ninja Gaiden -esque shooter/platformer that still receives acclaim to this day.
It also has quite possibly the most awesome, and totally fucked up endings to a Batman story ever in the history of everything:
The Batman Returns game was essentially a sidescrolling beat ’em up with a few extra bells and whistles in the form of a mildly expanded repertoire of moves, (including being able to throw dudes into the background scenery!) but other than that; was little more than standard genre fare.
Pictured: The coolest element of Batman Returns - slamming 2 clowns faces together for twice the pwnage.
I love both of these games, and find them to be quite fun in their own right; (especially Batman Returns, which I own to this day) however I have to admit, neither game really feels like a Batman game
should .
In the comics, Batman never jumped around giant factories with a laser gun strapped to this forearm.
Hmm, I don't remember this in the comics...
In the comics, Batman never walked from left to right and beat the piss out of a clone army of clowns for hours at a time.
Although I must admit, such a comic would definitely be on my "must read" list.
Man, I hate clowns...
In the comics, the detective work to beating up of goons ratio is generally 2:1.
Let’s get one thing clear:  Batman is
really
fuckin’ strong.
Batman has told villains on numerous occasions that he could “crush their head like an egg,” and for all intents and purposes, I don’t doubt that fact.
Batman is supposed to be a man trained to the peak of human ability, so I would think crushing a human skull with his bare hands would be well within his capability.
When you think about it from that perspective, it’s hard to envision all that many people that could take a patented
Batman Sucker Punch
(TM) and not go right to sleep.
Pictured: The Batman Sucker Punch (TM) in all it's glory.
Though in many ways it might be a product of the unique and condensed structure of American comic book storytelling, I’ve always thought that Batman’s penchant for separating bad guys from their senses within a panel or 2 to be well in line with the facets of his character.
Batman is not a character that engages in dramatic and overblown, 5 minute kung fu brawls with his opponents, he is a silent predator that, more often than not, lays people out rather than battling them directly.
Although far be it from me to say that I don’t appreciate the few instances in which ‘ole Bats gets dragged into an all out slug fest:
Even though this was intensely one-sided, and I never got to read the rematch, this still ranks as one of most awesome moments in Batman history.
This is what initially drew me to Batman: Arkham Asylum.
Yeah, it’s been critically acclaimed up the ying yang.
Yeah, it’s gameplay is supposed to be a
Metroid – Vania * mish-mash of backtracking heavy awesomeness.
Yeah, it even has always awesome
Kevin Conroy
and
Mark Hamill
reprising their roles from Batman Animated series.
"Always awesome" or not, Father Time has officially backed his truck up over Mark Hamill's face and taken the mother of all corn-filled shits on it for good measure
While I obviously don’t discount any of the above, as I did in fact just buy the game today; what
really
got me hyped for this game ever since it came out, was that most of the reviews I was reading about placed a great deal of emphasis on the fact that in this game, you really
feel
like Batman.
Everything from the exploration of the detective mode, to the stealth and counter heavy combat system has been said to reflect the Batman sensibilities we all know and love to a T.
Try saying that about
Batman: Vengeance , or
Dark Tomorrow , or any of the dozens Bat-Failures in videogame history.
I like how me and my friend used to pretend that this was fun... Man I was a dumb kid.
Every kid that loves Batman has wanted to
be
him at some point in their life.
We do it because goddamn it, he’s just a man.
Aside from the billionaire fortune, gadgets, and unlimited resources, at his core; Batman is just a man that woke up one day and committed himself to
being
Batman.
Even if it’s total bullshit, and has a 99% chance of never coming true, at some point in our lives, even if just for a moment; we trick ourselves into thinking that with enough time and dedication, we could
be
Batman if we really tried.
And there's kids like this that are destined to be loser-ly for the rest of their days. Seriously, who in their right mind would want to be Robin?
While I’ve long since grown beyond thinking that, it doesn’t stop me from thinking that playing a game like Arkham Asylum could make me relive those feelings in some capacity.
As of writing this, I haven’t actually started the game, but I was feeling nostalgic, so I figured a little Bat-Ruminating was in order.
Anyway, here’s hoping the game lives up to my insanely high standards!
*It should be noted that I am
not
a fan of Metroid, nor am I a fan of the
Symphony of the Night
style Castlevania games.  This could lead to some issues in terms of my overall enjoyment of Arkham Asylum, however I am hopeful my experience will lean towards the contrary.
