The Trap: What Happened to Our
Dream of Freedom
is a
BBC
documentary series
by
English
filmmaker
Adam Curtis , well known for other
documentaries including
The Century of the Self
and
The Power of Nightmares . It
began airing in the
United Kingdom
on
BBC Two
on 11 March 2007. [ 1 ]
The series consists of three one-hour
programmes which explore the
concept and definition of freedom, specifically, "how a simplistic
model of human beings as self-seeking, almost robotic, creatures led to
today's idea of freedom." [ 2 ]

Production
The series was originally entitled
Cold
Cold Heart
and
was scheduled for transmission in Autumn 2006. Although it is not known
what caused the delay in transmission, nor the change in title, [ 3 ]
it is known that the DVD release of Curtis's previous series
The Power of Nightmares
had been delayed due to problems with copyright clearance, caused by
the high volume of archive soundtrack and film used in Curtis's
characteristic
montage
technique. [ improper synthesis? ] [ 4 ]
Another documentary series (title
unknown) based on very similar
lines—"examining the world economy during the 1990s"—was to have been
Curtis's first BBC TV project on moving to the BBC's Current Affairs
Unit in 2002, shortly after producing
Century of the Self . [ 5 ]
Episodes
1.
"Fuck You Buddy" (11 March 2007)
In this episode, Curtis examines the
rise of
game theory
during the
Cold War
and the way in which its mathematical models of human behaviour
filtered into economic thought. The programme traces the development of
game theory with particular reference to the work of
John Nash ,
who believed that all humans were inherently suspicious and selfish
creatures that strategised constantly. Using this as his first premise,
Nash constructed
logically consistent
and mathematically verifiable models, for which he won the
Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences ,
commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Economics. He invented
system games reflecting his beliefs about human behaviour, including
one he called "Fuck You Buddy" (later published as " So Long Sucker "),
in which the only way to win was to betray your playing partner, and it
is from this game that the episode's title is taken. These games were
internally coherent and worked correctly as long as the players obeyed
the ground rules that they should behave selfishly and try to outwit
their opponents, but when
RAND 's
analysts tried the games on their own secretaries, they instead chose
not to betray each other, but to cooperate every time. This did not, in
the eyes of the analysts, discredit the models, but instead proved that
the secretaries were unfit subjects.
What was not known at the time was that
Nash was suffering from
paranoid schizophrenia ,
and, as a result, was deeply suspicious of everyone around
him—including his colleagues—and was convinced that many were involved
in conspiracies against him. It was this mistaken belief that led to
his view of people as a whole that formed the basis for his theories.
Footage of an older and wiser Nash was shown in which he acknowledges
that his paranoid views of other people at the time were false.
Curtis examines how game theory was used
to create the
USA 's nuclear strategy during the Cold War.
Because no
nuclear war
occurred, it was believed that game theory had been correct in
dictating the creation and maintenance of a massive American nuclear
arsenal—because the
Soviet Union
had not attacked America with its nuclear weapons, the supposed
deterrent must have worked. Game theory during the Cold War is a
subject Curtis examined in more detail in the
To The Brink of
Eternity
part of his first series,
Pandora's Box ,
and he reuses much of the same archive material in doing so.
Archive interview with
R.D. Laing
during episode 1
A separate strand in the documentary is
the work of
R.D. Laing ,
whose work in psychiatry led him to model familial interactions using
game theory. His conclusion was that humans are inherently selfish,
shrewd, and spontaneously generate strategems during everyday
interactions. Laing's theories became more developed when he concluded
that some forms of mental illness were merely artificial labels, used
by the state to suppress individual suffering. This belief became a
staple tenet of counterculture during the 1960s. Reference is made to
the
Rosenhan experiment ,
in which bogus patients, surreptitiously self-presenting at a number of
American psychiatric institutions, were falsely diagnosed as having
mental disorders, while institutions, informed that they were to
receive bogus patients, "identified" numerous supposed imposters who
were actually genuine patients. The results of the experiment were a
disaster for American psychiatry, because they destroyed the idea that
psychiatrists were a privileged elite able to genuinely diagnose, and
therefore treat, mental illness.
All these theories tended to support the
beliefs of what were then fringe economists such as
Friedrich von Hayek , whose economic
models left no room for
altruism , but depended purely on self-interest,
leading to the formation of
public choice theory . In an
interview, the economist
James M. Buchanan
decries the notion of
the " public interest ",
asking what it is and suggesting that it consists purely of the
self-interest of the governing bureaucrats. Buchanan also proposes that
organisations should employ managers who are motivated only by money.
He describes those who are motivated by other factors—such as job
satisfaction or a sense of public duty—as " zealots ".
As the 1960s became the 1970s, the
theories of Laing and the models
of Nash began to converge, producing a widespread popular belief that
the state (a surrogate family) was purely and simply a mechanism of
social control which calculatedly kept power out of the hands of the
public. Curtis shows that it was this belief that allowed the theories
of Hayek to look credible, and underpinned the free-market beliefs of
Margaret Thatcher ,
who sincerely believed that by dismantling as much of the British state
as possible—and placing former national institutions into the hands of
public shareholders—a form of social equilibrium would be reached. This
was a return to Nash's work, in which he proved mathematically that if
everyone was pursuing their own interests, a stable, yet perpetually
dynamic, society could result.
The episode ends with the suggestion
that this mathematically
modelled society is run on data—performance targets, quotas,
statistics—and that it is these figures combined with the exaggerated
belief in human selfishness that has created "a cage" for Western
humans. The precise nature of the "cage" is to be discussed in the next
episode.

2.
"The Lonely Robot" (18 March 2007)
The second episode reiterated many of
the ideas of the first, but developed the theme that drugs such as
Prozac
and lists of psychological symptoms
which might indicate
anxiety
or
depression
were
being used to normalise behaviour and make humans behave more
predictably, like machines.
This was not presented as a
conspiracy theory ,
but as a logical (although unpredicted) outcome of market-driven
self-diagnosis by checklist based on symptoms, but not actual causes,
discussed in the previous programme.
People with standard mood fluctuations
diagnosed themselves as
abnormal. They then presented themselves at psychiatrist's offices,
fulfilled the diagnostic criteria without offering personal histories,
and were medicated. The alleged result was that vast numbers of Western
people have had their behaviour and mentation modified by
SSRI
drugs without any strict medical
necessity.
The
Ax Fight —a famous
anthropological
study of the
Yanomamo
people of
Venezuela
by
Tim
Asch
and
Napoleon Chagnon —was
re-examined and its strictly genetic-determinist interpretation called
into question. Other researchers were called upon to verify Chagnon's
conclusions and arrived at totally opposed opinions. The suggestion was
raised that the presence of a film crew and the handing out of machetes
to some, but not all, tribesmen might have caused them to 'perform' as
they did. While being questioned by Curtis, Chagnon was so annoyed by
this suggestion that he terminated the interview and walked out of
shot, protesting under his breath.
Film of
Richard Dawkins
propounding his
ultra-strict " selfish gene "
analogy
of life was shown, with the archive clips spanning two decades to
emphasise how the severely reductionist ideas of programmed behaviour
have been absorbed by mainstream culture. (Later, however, the
documentary gives evidence that cells are able to selectively replicate
parts of DNA dependent on current needs. According to Curtis such
evidence detracts from the simplified economic models of human beings).
This brought Curtis back to the economic models of Hayek and the game
theories of Cold War. Curtis explains how, with the "robotic"
description of humankind apparently validated by geneticists, the game
theory systems gained even more hold over society's engineers.
The programme describes how the
Clinton
administration gave in to market theorists in the US and how
New Labour
in the UK decided to measure everything it could, the better to improve
it, introducing such artificial and unmeasurable targets as:
Reduction of hunger in Sub-Saharan Africa by 48%
Reduction of global conflict by 6%
It also introduced a
rural community vibrancy index
in order to gauge the quality of life in British villages and a
birdsong index
to check the apparent decline of wildlife.
In industry and the public services,
this way of thinking led to a
plethora of targets, quotas, and plans. It was meant to set workers
free to achieve these targets in any way they chose. What these
game-theory schemes did not predict was that the players, faced with
impossible demands, would cheat.
Curtis describes how, in order to meet
artificially inflated targets:
Lothian and Borders Police
reclassified dozens of criminal offences as "suspicious occurrences",
in order to keep them out of crime figures;
Some
NHS hospital trusts
created an
unofficial post of "The Hello Nurse," [ 6 ]
whose sole task it was to greet new arrivals in order to claim for
statistical purposes that the patient had been "seen," even though no
treatment or even examination had occurred during the encounter;
NHS managers took the wheels off trolleys and reclassified them
as
beds, while simultaneously reclassifying corridors as wards, in order
to falsify
Accident & Emergency
waiting
times statistics.
In a section called "The Death of Social
Mobility", Curtis also
describes how the theory of the free market was applied to education.
With league tables of school performance published, the richest parents
moved house to get their children into better schools. This caused
house prices in the appropriate catchment areas to rise
dramatically—thus excluding poorer parents who were left with the
worst-performing schools. This is just one aspect of a more rigidly
stratified society, which Curtis identifies in the way in which the
incomes of the poorest (working class) Americans have actually fallen
in real terms since the 1970s, while the incomes of the average (middle
class) have increased slightly and those of the highest earners (upper
class) have quadrupled. Similarly, babies in poorer areas in the UK are
twice as likely to die in their first year as children from prosperous
areas.
Curtis's narration concludes with the
observation that the game
theory/free market model is now undergoing interrogation by economists
who suspect a more irrational model of behaviour is appropriate and
useful. In fact, in formal experiments the only people who behaved
exactly according to the mathematical models created by game theory are
economists themselves, or
psychopaths .

3. "We
Will Force You To Be Free" (25 March 2007)
Archive interview with
Isaiah
Berlin
The final programme focussed on the
concepts of
positive
and
negative liberty
introduced in the 1950s
by
Isaiah Berlin . Curtis briefly explained how
negative liberty could be defined as freedom from
coercion
and positive liberty as the opportunity to strive to fulfill one's
potential.
Tony Blair
had read Berlin's essays on the
topic and wrote to him [ 7 ]
in the late 1990s, arguing that positive and negative liberty could be
mutually compatible. He never received a reply, as Berlin was on his
death bed.
The programme began with a description
of the
Two Concepts of Liberty ,
claiming that it was Berlin's opinion that, since it lacked coercion,
negative liberty was the 'safer' of the two. Curtis then explained how
many political groups who sought their vision of freedom ended up using
violence to achieve it.
For example the
French revolutionaries
wished to
overthrow a
monarchical system
which they viewed as
antithetical to freedom, but in so doing ended up with the
Reign of Terror . Similarly, the
Bolshevik revolutionaries
in
Russia ,
who sought to overthrow the old order and replace it with a society in
which everyone was equal, ended up creating a totalitarian regime which
used violence to achieve its ends.
Using violence, not simply as a means to
achieve one's goals, but
also as an expression of freedom from Western bourgeois norms, was an
idea developed by African revolutionary
Frantz
Fanon . He developed it from the
Existentialist
ideology
of
Jean-Paul Sartre , who argued that
terrorism was a "terrible weapon but the oppressed poor have no
others."
[ 8 ] .
These views were expressed, for example, in the revolutionary film
The Battle of Algiers .
This programme also explored how
economic freedom
had been used in Russia and the problems this had introduced. A set of
policies known as "shock therapy" were brought in mainly by outsiders,
which had the effect of destroying the social safety net that existed
in most other western nations and Russia. In the latter, the sudden
removal of e.g. the subsidies for basic goods caused their prices to
rise enormously, making them hardly affordable for ordinary people. An
economic crisis escalated during the 1990s and some people were paid in
goods rather than money. Yeltsin was accused by his parliamentary
deputies of "economic genocide", due to the large numbers of people now
too poor to eat. Yeltsin responded to this by removing parliament's
power and becoming increasingly autocratic. At the same time, many
formerly state-owned industries were sold to private businesses, often
at a fraction of their real value. Ordinary people, often in financial
difficulties, would sell shares, which to them were worthless, for
cash, without appreciating their true value. This ended up with the
rise of the
Oligarchs —super-rich
businessmen who attributed their rise to the sell offs of the '90s. It
resulted in a polarisation of society into the poor and ultra-rich, and
indirectly led to a more autocratic style of government under Vladimir
Putin, which, while less free, promised to provide people with dignity
and basic living requirements.
There was a similar review of post-war
Iraq, in which an even more
extreme "shock therapy" was employed—the removal from government of all
Ba'ath party employees and the introduction of economic models which
followed the simplified economic model of human beings outlined in the
first two programmes—this had the result of immediately disintegrating
Iraqi society and the rise of two strongly autocratic insurgencies, one
based on Sunni-Ba'athist ideals and another based on revolutionary
Shi'a philosophies.
Curtis also looked at the
neo-conservative agenda of the 1980s. Like
Sartre, they argued that violence would sometimes be necessary to
achieve their goals, except they wished to spread what they described
as democracy. Curtis quoted General
Alexander Haig
then US Secretary of State, as saying that "some things were worth
fighting for". However, Curtis argued, although the version of society
espoused by the neo-conservatives made some concessions towards
freedom, it did not offer true freedom. The neo-conservatives were
ardent supporters of the
Augusto Pinochet
regime in
Chile
which used violence to crush opponents in a virtual police state.
The neo-conservatives also took a strong
line against the
Sandinistas —a
political group in Nicaragua—who Reagan argued were accepting help from
the Soviets and posed a real threat to American security. The truth was
that the Sandinistas posed no real military threat to the US, and a
disinformation campaign was started against them painting them as
accessories of the Soviets. The
Contras ,
who
were a proxy army fighting against the Sandinistas, were—according
to US propaganda—valiantly fighting against the evil of Communism. In
reality, argued Curtis, they were using all manner of techniques,
including the torture, rape and murder of civilians. The CIA funded the
Contras by allegedly flying in cocaine into the United States, as
financing the Contras directly would have been illegal.
However such policies did not always
result in the achievement of
neo-conservative aims and occasionally threw up genuine surprises.
Curtis examined the Western-backed government of the Shah in Iran, and
how the mixing of Sartre's positive libertarian ideals with Shia
religious philosophy led to the revolution which overthrew it. Having
previously been a meek philosophy of acceptance of the social order, in
the minds of revolutionaries such as
Ali
Shariati
and
Ayatollah Khomeini ,
Revolutionary
Shia Islam
became a meaningful force to
overthrow tyranny.
The programme reviewed the Blair
government and its role in
achieving its vision of a stable society. In fact, argued Curtis, the
Blair government had created the opposite of freedom, in that the type
of liberty it had engendered wholly lacked any kind of meaning. Its
military intervention in Iraq had provoked terrorist actions in the UK
and these terrorist actions were in turn used to justify restrictions
of liberty.
In essence, the programme suggested that
following the path of
negative liberty to its logical conclusions, as governments have done
in the West for the past 50 years, resulted in a society without
meaning populated only by selfish automatons, and that there was some
value in positive liberty in that it allowed people to strive to better
themselves.
The closing minutes directly state that
if western humans were ever
to find their way out of the "trap" described in the series, they would
have to realise that Isaiah Berlin was wrong and that not all attempts
at creating positive liberty necessarily ended in coercion and tyranny.

criticised the documentary for "romanticis[ing] the past while
misrepresenting the ideas it purports to explain"; for example Curtis
suggested that the work of Buchanan and others on
public choice theory
made Government
officials wicked and selfish, rather than simply providing an account
of what happened. [ 9 ]
In the
New

coherent argument. [ 10 ]
She said that while she was glad Adam Curtis made provocative
documentaries he was as much of a propagandist as those he opposes. [ 10 ]
While commending the series,
Radio
Times
stated that
The Trap's
subject matter was not ideal
for its 21:00 Sunday time slot on the minority
BBC Two .
This placed the three episodes against
Castaway
2007
on
BBC One , the drama
Fallen Angel , the first two
of a series of high-profile
Jane
Austen
adaptations on
ITV1 , and season six of
24
on
Sky One . However, the series secured a
consistent share of the viewing audience throughout its run:
1. "Fuck You Buddy" (11 March 2007) ~
1.4 million viewers; 6% audience share
2. "The Lonely Robot (18 March 2007) ~
1.3 million viewers; 6% audience share
3. "We Will Force You To Be Free" (25

Production
The production was staged at Quay House,
in the disused former offices of the
National
Probation Service
on Quay Street, central Manchester. The
production ran between 2 and 19 July 2009, as part of the second
Manchester International
Festival .
“
Imagine walking into
a
disused building. You find yourself inside a film. It is a ghost story
where unexpected forces, veiled by the American Dream, come out from
the dark to haunt you…
”

[ 3 ]
The film and event makes extensive use of
archive footage. Upon arrival at the event groups of nine [ 4 ]
visitors are taken to a darkened sixth floor. The 54 minute film
(available for a limited time online in the UK) [ 5 ]
is only a small section ("the film club") of the event. [ 6 ]

“
I wanted to do a film
about
what it actually felt like to live through that time ... Where you
could see the roots of the uncertainties we feel today, the things they
did out on the dark fringes of the world that they didn't really notice
at the time, which would then come back to haunt us.

As with all Curtis' work, the
Helvetica

not feature narration.
Genesis
The production started life as an
experimental film by
Adam Curtis , commissioned by the
BBC . Curtis
approached Felix Barrett of the
Punchdrunk
theatre company, with the proposal that a production could be created
"as though the audience were walking through the story of the film". [ 8 ]
The film was shown to
Damon
Albarn , already associated with the
Manchester International
Festival
through the productions
Demon Days Live
in 2006 and
Monkey: Journey to the West
in 2007. He agreed to write a score for the production, which was then
recorded by the San Francisco-based
Kronos Quartet .
Themes
According to Adam Curtis the production
is "the story of an
enchanted world that was built by American power as it became
supreme...and how those living in that dream world responded to it". [ 8 ]
He has also said; "it’s trying to show to you that the way you feel
about yourself and the way you feel about the world today is a
political product of the ideas of that time”. [ 9 ]
"The politics of our time," according to
Curtis, "are deeply
embedded in the ideas of individualism...but it's not the
be-all-and-end-all...the notion that you only achieve your true self if
your dreams, your desires, are satisfied...it's a political idea". [ 7 ]
Felix Barrett has stated that the
production was influenced by his
love of ghost trains and haunted houses, and by the idea of blurring
fiction with reality: "It takes the idea of the viewer as voyeur and
asks at what point are you watching, inside or even starring in the
film". [ 8 ]
The development of new techniques of
interrogation by "everyone over Level 7" in the
CIA
during the 1960s is a theme of the production, and the suggestibility
of human beings is something that the production seeks to highlight. [ citation needed ]

The Power of Nightmares ,
subtitled
The Rise of the Politics of Fear , is a
BBC
documentary film
series, written and
produced by
Adam Curtis .
Its three one-hour parts consist mostly of a montage of archive footage
with Curtis's narration. The series was first broadcast in the United
Kingdom in late 2004 and has subsequently been broadcast in multiple
countries and shown in several film festivals, including the
2005 Cannes Film Festival .
The films compare the rise of the
Neo-Conservative
movement in the United
States and the
radical
Islamist
movement, making comparisons on their origins and claiming similarities
between the two. More controversially, it argues that the threat of
radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organised force of destruction,
specifically in the form of
al-Qaeda ,
is a myth perpetrated by politicians in many countries—and particularly
American Neo-Conservatives—in an
attempt
to unite and inspire their people
following the failure of earlier,
more
utopian
ideologies.
The Power of Nightmares
has been
praised by film critics in
both Britain and the United States. Its message and content have also
been the subject of various critiques and criticisms from
conservatives
and
progressives .

Synopsis
Paul Wolfowitz
and
Ayman al-Zawahiri , featured
representatives of Neo-Conservatism and Islamism respectively.
Part
1: "Baby It's Cold Outside"
The first part of the series explains the
origin of
Islamism
and
Neo-Conservatism . It
shows
Egyptian
civil servant
Sayyid Qutb ,
depicted as the founder of modern Islamist thought, visiting the U.S.
to learn about the education system, but becoming disgusted with what
he saw as a corruption of morals and virtues in western society through
individualism . When he returns to Egypt, he
is disturbed by
westernisation
under
Gamal Abdel Nasser
and becomes
convinced that in order to save society it must be completely
restructured along the lines of
Islamic law
while still using western technology. He also becomes convinced that
this can only be accomplished through the use of an elite "vanguard" to
lead a revolution against the established order. Qutb becomes a leader
of the
Muslim Brotherhood
and, after being tortured in one of Nasser's jails, comes to believe
that western-influenced leaders can justly be killed for the sake of
removing their corruption. Qutb is executed in 1966, but he inspires
the future mentor of
Osama bin Laden , Ayman al-Zawahiri, to
start his own secret Islamist group. Inspired by the
1979 Iranian
revolution , Zawahiri and his allies assassinate Egyptian president
Anwar Al Sadat ,
in 1981, in hopes of starting their own revolution. The revolution does
not materialise, and Zawahiri comes to believe that the majority of
Muslims have been corrupted by their western-inspired leaders and thus
may be legitimate targets of violence if they do not join him.
At the same time in the United States, a
group of disillusioned liberals, including
Irving Kristol
and
Paul Wolfowitz , look to the political
thinking of
Leo Strauss
after the perceived failure of
President Johnson's
" Great
Society ".
They come to the conclusion that the emphasis on individual liberty was
the undoing of the plan. They envisioned restructuring America by
uniting the American people against a common evil, and set about
creating a mythical enemy. These factions, the Neo-Conservatives, came
to power under the
Reagan
administration, with their allies
Dick
Cheney
and
Donald Rumsfeld , and work to unite the
United States in fear of the
Soviet
Union .
The Neo-Conservatives allege the Soviet Union is not following the
terms of disarmament between the two countries, and, with the
investigation of " Team B ", they accumulate a case to prove this with
dubious evidence and methods. President Reagan is convinced nonetheless. [ 1 ]
Part 2:
"The Phantom Victory"
In the second episode, Islamist factions,
rapidly falling under the more radical influence of Zawahiri and his
rich
Saudi
acolyte
Osama bin Laden , join the
Neo-Conservative-influenced Reagan Administration to combat the
Soviet Union's invasion
of
Afghanistan .
When the Soviets eventually pull out and when the
Eastern
Bloc
begins to collapse
in the late 1980s,
both groups believe they are the primary architects of the " Evil Empire 's" defeat. Curtis argues that the
Soviets were on their last legs anyway, and were doomed to collapse
without intervention.
However, the Islamists see it quite
differently, and in their
triumph believe that they had the power to create 'pure' Islamic states
in Egypt and Algeria. However, attempts to create perpetual Islamic
states are blocked by force. The Islamists then try to create
revolutions in Egypt and Algeria by the use of terrorism to scare the
people into rising up. However, the people are terrified by the
violence and the Algerian government uses their fear as a way to
maintain power. In the end, the Islamists declare the entire
populations of the countries as inherently contaminated by western
values, and finally in Algeria turn on each other, each believing that
other terrorist groups are not pure enough Muslims either.
In America, the Neo-Conservatives'
aspirations to use the United
States military power for further destruction of evil are thrown off
track by the ascent of
George HW Bush
to the
presidency , followed by the
1992 election
of
Bill
Clinton
leaving them out of power. The Neo-Conservatives, with
their
conservative Christian
allies, attempt to demonise Clinton throughout his presidency with
various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To
their disappointment, however, the American people do not turn against
Clinton. The Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed,
leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden
flee to the sufficiently safe Afghanistan and declare a new strategy;
to fight Western-inspired moral decay they must deal a blow to its
source: the United States. [ 2 ]
Part 3:
"The Shadows in the Cave"
The Neo-Conservatives use the September 11th attacks, with al-Fadl's
description of al-Qaeda, [ citation needed ]
to
launch the War on Terror.
The final episode addresses the actual
rise of
al-Qaeda .
Curtis argues that, after their failed revolutions, bin Laden and
Zawahiri had little or no popular support, let alone a serious complex
organisation of terrorists, and were dependent upon independent
operatives to carry out their new call for
jihad . The
film instead argues that in order to prosecute bin Laden
in
absentia
for the
1998 U.S.
embassy bombings ,
US prosecutors had to prove he was the head of a criminal organisation
responsible for the bombings. They find a former associate of bin
Laden,
Jamal al-Fadl , and pay him to testify that
bin Laden was the head of a massive terrorist organisation called
"al-Qaeda". With the
September 11th
attacks , Neo-Conservatives in the new Republican government of
George W. Bush
use this created concept of
an organisation to justify another crusade against a new evil enemy,
leading to the launch of the
War on Terrorism .
After the
American invasion of
Afghanistan
fails to uproot the alleged terrorist network, the
Neo-Conservatives focus inwards, searching unsuccessfully for terrorist
sleeper cells
in America. They then extend the
war on "terror" to a war against general perceived evils with the
invasion of Iraq in 2003 . The ideas
and tactics also spread to the United Kingdom where
Tony
Blair
uses the threat of terrorism to give him a new moral authority. The
repercussions of the Neo-Conservative strategy are also explored with
an investigation of indefinitely-detained terrorist suspects in
Guantanamo Bay , many
allegedly taken on the word of the anti- Taliban
Northern Alliance
without actual investigation
on the part of the United States military, and other forms of " preemption "
against non-existent and unlikely threats made simply on the grounds
that the parties involved could later become a threat. Curtis also
makes a specific attempt to allay fears of a
dirty
bomb
attack, and concludes by reassuring viewers that politicians will
eventually have to concede that some threats are exaggerated and others
altogether devoid of reality. [ 3 ]
Content
Adam Curtis, the director of
The Power of Nightmares
Adam Curtis originally intended to create
a film about conflict within the
conservative
movement between the ideologies
of Neo-Conservative "elitism" and more individualist
libertarian
factions. During his research into the conservative movement, however,
Curtis first discovered what he saw as similarities in the origins of
the Neo-Conservative and Islamist ideologies. The topic of the planned
documentary shifted to these latter two ideologies while the
libertarian element was eventually phased out. [ 4 ]
Curtis first pitched the idea of a documentary on conservative ideology
in 2003 and spent six months compiling the films. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
The final recordings for the three parts were made on 10 October, 19
October and 1 November 2004. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
The film uses a montage of various stock
footage from the BBC
archives, often used for ironic or humorous effect, over which Curtis
narrates. [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
Curtis has credited
James
Mossman
as the inspiration for his montage technique, which he
first employed for the 1992 series
Pandora's Box , [ 10 ]
while his use of humour has been credited to his first work with
television as a talent scout for
That's Life! [ 5 ]
He has also compared the entertainment format of his films to the
American
Fox News
channel, claiming
the network has been successful because of "[their viewers] really
enjoying what they're doing". [ 4 ]
To help drive his points, Curtis includes
interviews with various
political and intellectual figures. In the first two films, former
Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency
member
Anne Cahn
and former
American Spectator
writer
David
Brock
accuse the Neo-Conservatives of knowingly using false evidence of
wrongdoing in their campaigns against the Soviet Union and President
Bill Clinton. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Jason
Burke , author of
Al-Qaeda: Casting a
Shadow of Terror , comments in
The Shadows in the Cave
on the failure to expose a massive terrorist network in Afghanistan. [ 3 ]
Additional interviews with major figures are added to drive the film's
narrative. Neo-Conservatives
William
and
Irving Kristol ,
Richard
Pipes
and
Richard Perle
all appear to chronicle the
Neo-Conservative perspective of the film's subject. [ 1 ] [ 3 ]
The history of Islamism is discussed by the
Institute
of Islamic Political Thought 's
Azzam
Tamimi , political scientist Roxanne Euben and Islamist Abdulla Anas. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
The film's soundtrack includes at least
two pieces from the films of
John Carpenter , whom Curtis credited as
inspiration for his soundtrack arrangement techniques, [ 10 ]
as well as tracks from
Brian Eno 's
Another Green World . There is also
music by composers
Charles Ives
and
Ennio Morricone , while Curtis has credited
the
industrial
band
Skinny
Puppy
for the "best" samples in the films. [ 11 ]
Airings and
distribution
The Power of Nightmares
was first
aired in three consecutive weeks on
BBC 2
in 2004 in the United Kingdom, beginning
with
Baby it's Cold Outside
on 20 October,
The Phantom
Victory
on 27 October and
The Shadows in the Cave
on 3
November, although the murder of
Kenneth Bigley
led the BBC to curtail their
advertising prior to its airing. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 12 ]
It was rebroadcast, in January 2005, over three days, with the third
film updated to take note of the
Law Lords
ruling
from the previous December that detaining foreign terrorist suspects
without trial was illegal. [ 13 ]
In May 2005, the film was screened in a
2½ hour edit at the
Cannes Film Festival
out of
competition. [ 14 ]
Pathé
purchased distribution rights for this cut of the film. [ 6 ]
As of 1 January 2008, the film has yet to
be aired in the United States. Curtis has commented on this failure:
Something extraordinary has happened to American TV since
September
11. A head of the leading networks who had better remain nameless said
to me that there was no way they could show it. He said, 'Who are you
to say this?' and then he added, 'We would get slaughtered if we put
this out.' When I was in New York I took a
DVD
to the
head of documentaries at
HBO . I still haven't heard from him. [ 6 ]
Although the series has not been shown on
U.S. television, its three
episodes were shown in succession, on 26 February 2005, as part of the
True/False Film Festival
in
Columbia, Missouri , with a personal
appearance by Curtis. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]
It has also been featured at the 2006
Seattle International Film
Festival
and the
San Francisco
International Film Festival , with the latter awarding Curtis their
Persistence of Vision Award. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]
The film was also screened at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York,
and had a brief theatrical run in New York City during 2005. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]
The films were first aired by
CBC
in Canada in April
2005, and again in July 2006. [ 22 ]
The Australian channel
SBS
had originally scheduled
to air the series in July 2005, but it was cancelled, reportedly in
light of the
London bombings
of 7 July. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]
It was ultimately aired in December, followed by
Peter Taylor's
The New
Al-Qaeda
under the billing of a counter-argument to Curtis. [ 25 ]
In April 2005, Curtis expressed interest
in an official DVD release
due to a significant demand by viewers, but noted that his usual
montage technique created serious legal problems with getting such a
release secured. [ 26 ]
An unofficial DVD release was made in the quarterly DVD magazine
Wholphin
over a period of three issues. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ]
Reaction
Critical reaction
The Power of Nightmares
received
generally favourable reviews from critics. [ 30 ]
Rotten Tomatoes
reported that 86% of
critics gave the film positive write-ups, with an
average
score of 8.1/10, based upon a sample of seven reviews. [ 31 ]
At
Metacritic , which assigns a
normalised
rating out of 100 to reviews
from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 78,
based on six reviews. [ 30 ]
Entertainment Weekly described the film as "a fluid cinematic essay,
rooted in painstakingly assembled evidence, that heightens and cleanses
your perceptions" while
Variety
called it "a superb,
eye-opening and often absurdly funny deconstruction of the myths and
realities of global terrorism". [ 32 ] [ 33 ]
The
San Francisco Chronicle
had an equally enthusiastic view of the film and likened it to "a
brilliant piece in the Atlantic Monthly that's (thankfully) come to
cinematic life". [ 34 ]
The New York Times
had a more
skeptical review, unimpressed by efforts to compare
attacks on Bill Clinton
by American
conservatives with Islamist revolutionary activities, claiming (in a
review by literary and film critic
A.
O. Scott ) that "its understanding of politics, geo- and national,
can seem curiously thin" [ 21 ] .
In May 2005, Adam Curtis was quoted as saying that 94% of e-mails to
the BBC in response to the film were supportive. [ 6 ]
The film was awarded a
BAFTA
in the
category of "Best Factual Series" in 2005. [ 35 ]
Additional awards were given by the
Director's Guild of Great
Britain
and the
Royal Television Society . [ 36 ] [ 37 ]
Political reaction
Progressive observers were particularly
pleased with the film.
Common Dreams
had a highly
positive response to the film and compared it to the " red pill "
of the
Matrix
series ,
a comparison Curtis has apparently appreciated. [ 26 ] [ 38 ]
Commentary in the
Village Voice
was also mostly favorable, noting: "As partisan filmmaking it is often
brilliant and sometimes hilarious - a superior version of
Syriana ." [ 39 ]
The
Nation ,
while offering a detailed critique on the film's content, said of the
film itself "[it] is arguably the most important film about the 'war on
terrorism' since the events of September 11". [ 40 ]
Among
conservative
and
neoconservative
critics in the United States,
The Power of Nightmares
has been
described as "conspiracy theory",
anti-American
or both.
David
Asman
of
FoxNews.com
said, "We wish we didn't have to keep presenting examples of how the
European media have become obsessively anti-American. But they keep
pushing the barrier, now to the point of absurdity." [ 41 ]
His views were shared by commentator Clive Davis, concluding his
commentary on the film for
National Review
with "British
producers, hooked on
Chomskyite
visions of 'Amerika' as the fount of all evil, are clearly not
interested in even beginning to dig for the truth". [ 42 ]
Other observers variously described the films as pushing a
conspiracy theory . Davis and British
commentator
David Aaronovitch
both explicitly labelled the film's message as a conspiracy theory,
with the latter saying of Curtis "his argument is as subtle as a
house-brick". [ 42 ] [ 43 ]
Attacks in this vein continued after the
7 July 2005 London bombings ,
with CBN referencing the film as a source for claims by the "British
left" that "the U.S. War on Terror was a fraud" and the
Australia
Israel & Jewish Affairs Council
calling it "the loopiest, most
extreme antiwar documentary series ever sponsored by the BBC". [ 24 ] [ 44 ]
In
The Shadows in the Cave ,
Curtis stressed that he did not discount the possibility of any
terrorist activity taking place, but that the threat of terrorism had
been greatly exaggerated. [ 3 ]
He responded to accusations of creating a conspiracy theory that he
believes that the alleged use of fear as a force in politics is not the
result of a conspiracy but rather the subjects of the film "have
stumbled on it". [ 26 ]
Peter
Bergen , writing for
The Nation , offered a detailed critique
of the film. Bergen wrote that even if
al-Qaeda
is not as organised as the Bush Administration stresses, it is still a
very dangerous force due to the fanaticism of its followers and the
resources available to bin Laden. On Curtis's claim that al-Qaeda was a
creation of neo-conservative politicians, Bergen said: "This is
nonsense. There is substantial evidence that Al Qaeda was founded in
1988 by bin Laden and a small group of like-minded militants, and that
the group would mushroom into the secretive, disciplined organisation
that implemented the 9/11 attacks." [ 45 ]
Bergen further claimed that Curtis's arguments serve as a defence of
Bush's failure to capture bin Laden in the
2001 invasion of Afghanistan
and his ignoring warnings of a terror attack prior to September 11. [ 46 ]
Additional issues have been raised over
Curtis's depiction of the
Neo-Conservatives .
Davis's article in
National Review
showed his displeasure with Curtis's depiction of Leo Strauss,
claiming, "In Curtis's world, it is Strauss, not Osama bin Laden, who
is the real evil genius." [ 42 ]
Peter Bergen claimed the film exaggerated the influence of Strauss over
Neo-Conservatism, crediting the political philosophy more to
Albert Wohlstetter . [ 47 ]
A 2005 review on
Christopher Null 's Filmcritic.com took
issue with
The Phantom Victory
's retelling of the attacks on Bill Clinton, crediting these more to
the American Religious Right than the "bookish university types" of the
Neo-Conservative movement. [ 48 ]
Daniel
Pipes , a conservative American political commentator and son of
Richard
Pipes
who was interviewed in the film, wrote that the film dismisses the
threat posed by Communism to the United States as, in Pipes words,
"only a scattering of countries that had harmless Communist parties,
who could in no way threaten America." Pipes noted that the film adopts
this conclusion without mentioning the
Comintern ,
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg ,
Klaus
Fuchs
or
Igor Gouzenko . [ 49 ]
There are also allegations of omissions
in the history described by the film. The absence of discussion of the
Israeli-Palestinian
conflict
was noticed by observers. [ 21 ] [ 39 ]
Davis claimed that Leo Strauss's ideas had been formed by his
experiences in Germany during the
Weimar Republic
and alleged the film's
failure to mention this was motivated by a wish to display Strauss as
concerned with American
suburban
culture, like Qutb. [ 42 ]
Media
Lens
criticised the film for failing to explore the role of big
business in the situation it described. [ 50 ]
Comparisons
to
Fahrenheit 9/11
After its release,
The Power of
Nightmares
received multiple comparisons to
Fahrenheit 9/11 , American film-maker
Michael
Moore 's 2004 critique on the
first
four years
of George W. Bush's presidency of the United States. The
Village Voice
directly named
The Power of Nightmares
as
"the most widely discussed docu
agitprop
since
Fahrenheit 9/11 ". [ 39 ]
The Nation
and
Variety
both gave comments ranking
Curtis's film superior to
Fahrenheit
and other political documentaries in various fields; the former cited
Curtis's work being more "intellectually engaging" and "historically
probing" while the latter cited "balance, broad-mindedness and sense of
historical perspective". [ 33 ] [ 40 ]
Moore's work has also been used as a point of comparison by
conservative critics of Curtis. [ 42 ]
Curtis has attempted to distinguish his
work from Moore's film, dismissing him as "a political agitprop
film-maker". [ 6 ]

Overview
"This series is about how those in power have used Freud's
theories
to try and control the dangerous crowd in an age of mass democracy." -

(August 2009)
Sigmund
Freud , the founder of
psychoanalysis ,
changed the perception of the human mind and its workings. His
influence on the twentieth century is generally considered profound.
The series describes the ways
public relations
and
politicians
have utilized Freud's theories
during the last 100 years for the "engineering of consent".
Freud himself and his nephew
Edward Bernays , who was the first to use
psychological techniques in public relations, are discussed. Freud's
daughter
Anna Freud , a pioneer of child psychology, is
mentioned in the second part, as is one of the main opponents of
Freud's theories,
Wilhelm Reich , in the third part.
Along these general themes,
The
Century of the Self
asks deeper questions about the roots and
methods of modern
consumerism ,
representative democracy
and its
implications. It also questions the modern way we see ourselves, the
attitude to fashion and superficiality.
The business and, increasingly, the
political world uses
psychological techniques to read and fulfill our desires, to make their
products or speeches as pleasing as possible to us. Curtis raises the
question of the intentions and roots of this fact. Where once the
political process was about engaging people's rational, conscious
minds, as well as facilitating their needs as a society, the
documentary shows how by employing the tactics of psychoanalysis,
politicians appeal to irrational, primitive impulses that have little
apparent bearing on issues outside of the narrow self-interest of a
consumer population. He cites Paul Mazer, a Wall Street banker working
for Lehman Brothers in the 1930s: "We must shift America from a needs-
to a desires-culture. People must be trained to desire, to want new
things, even before the old have been entirely consumed. [...] Man's
desires
must overshadow his
needs ."
In Episode 4 the main subjects are
Philip Gould
and
Matthew
Freud , the great grandson of Sigmund, a PR consultant. They were
part of the efforts during the nineties to bring the
Democrats
in the US and
New Labour
in the
United Kingdom
back into power. Adam Curtis explores the psychological methods they
now massively introduced into politics. He also argues that the
eventual outcome strongly resembles
Edward Bernays
vision for the "Democracity"
during the
1939 New York World's Fair .
According to BBC publicity:
To many in both politics and business, the triumph of the self is
the ultimate expression of democracy, where power has finally moved to
the people. Certainly the people may feel they are in charge, but are
they really? The Century of the Self tells the untold and sometimes
controversial story of the growth of the mass-consumer society in
Britain and the
United States . How was the all-consuming
self created, by whom, and in whose interests?

Adam Curtis at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 2005
Adam Curtis
(born 1955) is a
British
television
documentary
maker who has during the
course of his television career worked as a writer,
producer , director and narrator. He
currently works for
BBC
Current Affairs. His programmes express a clear (and sometimes
controversial) opinion about their subject, and he narrates the
programmes himself.
After attending
Sevenoaks School
(a member of the 'art
room' that produced musicians,
Tom Greenhalgh ,
Kevin Lycett
and
Mark White
of
The Mekons
along with
Andy
Gill
and
Jon King
of the
Gang of Four ) Curtis studied for a
BA
in
Human Sciences
(which
included introductory courses in genetics, psychology, politics,
geography and elementary statistics) at the
University of Oxford . Curtis taught
politics there, but left for a career in television. He obtained a post
on
That's Life! , where he learned to find
humour in serious subjects.
Curtis's intensive use of archive footage
is a distinctive touch of his. An
Observer
profile said:
Curtis has a remarkable feel for the serendipity of such moments,
and an obsessive skill in locating them. "That kind of footage shows
just how dull I can be," he admits, a little glumly. "The BBC has an
archive of all these tapes where they have just dumped all the news
items they have ever shown. One tape for every three months. So what
you get is this odd collage, an accidental treasure trove. You sit in a
darkened room, watch all these little news moments, and look for
connections."
The Observer
adds "if there has
been a theme in Curtis's work
since, it has been to look at how different elites have tried to impose
an ideology on their times, and the tragi-comic consequences of those
attempts."
Curtis received the Golden Gate
Persistence of Vision Award at the San Francisco International Film
Festival in 2005. [ 1 ]
In 2006 he was given the
Alan
Clarke
Award for Outstanding Contribution to Television at the
British Academy Television
Awards .
Curtis was reported to be on the
editorial 'steering committee' of the weekly email gossip newsletter
Popbitch , [ 2 ]
but the editor of the newsletter clarified that in fact he was simply a
"friend" of the magazine. [ 3 ] .

The Living Dead
(subtitled
Three
Films About the Power of the Past ) was the second major
documentary series made by British film-maker
Adam
Curtis .
This series investigated the way that history and memory (both national
and individual) have been used by politicians and others. In three
parts, it was transmitted on
BBC Two
in the
spring
of 1995.

Episodes
On
the Desperate Edge of Now (30 May 1995)
This episode examined how the various
national memories of the
Second
World War
were effectively rewritten and manipulated in the
Cold War
period.
For Germany, this began at the
Nuremberg Trials , where attempts were
made to prevent the
Nazis
in the dock—principally
Hermann Göring —from
offering any rational argument for what they had done. Subsequently,
however, bringing lower-ranking Nazis to justice was effectively
forgotten about in the interests of maintaining
West
Germany
as an ally in the
Cold War .
For the
Allied countries , faced with a new
enemy in the
Soviet Union ,
there was a need to portray WW2 as a crusade of pure good against pure
evil, even if this meant denying the memories of the Allied soldiers
who had actually done the fighting, and knew it to have been far more
complex. A number of American
veterans
told how years later they found themselves plagued with the
previously-suppressed memories of the brutal things they had seen and
done. The title comes from a veteran's description of what the
uncertainty of survival in combat is like.
You Have
Used Me as a Fish Long Enough (6 June 1995)
In this episode, the history of
brainwashing
and
mind
control
was examined. The angle pursued by Curtis was the way in
which psychiatry pursued
tabula
rasa
theories of the mind, initially in order to set people free from
traumatic memories and then later as a potential instrument of social
control. The work of
Ewen Cameron
was surveyed, with
particular reference to
Cold War
theories of
communist
brainwashing
and the search for
hypnoprogammed
assassins .
The programme's thesis was that the
search for control over the past
via medical intervention had had to be abandoned and that in modern
times control over the past is more effectively exercised by the
manipulation of history.
Some film from this episode, an interview
with one of Cameron's victims, was later re-used by Curtis in
The Century of the Self
series.
The title of this episode comes from a
paranoid schizophrenic
seen in archive film in the programme, who believed her neighbours were
using her as a source of amusement by denying her any privacy, like a
pet
goldfish .
The Attic (13
June 1995)
In this episode, the Imperial aspirations
of
Margaret Thatcher
were examined. The way
in which Mrs Thatcher used public relations in an attempt to emulate
Winston Churchill
in harking back to
Britain's "glorious past" to fulfil a political or national end.
The title is a reference to the attic
flat at the top of
10 Downing Street ,
which was created during Thatcher's period refurbishment of the house,
which did away with the Prime Minister's previous living quarters on
lower floors. Scenes from
The Innocents
(1961), a film
adaptation of
Henry James 's novella
The Turn of the Screw , are
intercut with scenes from Thatcher's reign.

Episodes
The Engineer's Plot
This part chronicles how the
Bolshevik
revolutionaries
who came into power in 1917 attempted to industrialize and control the
Soviet
Union
with rational scientific methods. The Bolsheviks wanted to
transform the Soviet people into
scientific beings .
Aleksei Gastev
used
social engineering ,
and even a social engineering machine, to teach people to behave in a
rational way.
There was an ongoing power struggle
between
bourgeoisie
engineers and Bolshevik
politicians.
Lenin
is quoted as having said "The
communists
are not directing anything, they are being directed". In late 1930
Stalin
had 2000 engineers arrested, and eight of the most senior were accused
and convicted in the
Industrial Party
show trial .
Engineering schools were set up to train party faithfuls in only
limited engineering knowledge to not threaten Stalin's political powers.
America
was seen as a model for the industrialization of the Soviet Union. The
city
Magnitogorsk
was modelled on
Gary,
Indiana
to be the perfectly planned industrial steel mill city. A former
construction worker describes how they imagined a magnificent city with
palaces, houses and parks, and how workers created a park with trees
made of metal because trees wouldn't grow on the
steppe .
In the late 1930s Stalin arrested and
purged more engineers, this
time old Bolsheviks. The beneficiaries of these purges were engineers
who were faithful to Stalin, and were now put in charge throughout the
Soviet industry, among them were
Leonid Brezhnev ,
Alexey Kosygin
and
Nikita Khrushchev .
They had only narrow specialist training, and were completely
unquestioning of Stalin's political aims. They set out to plan the
Soviet Union as though it were a piece of engineering, with technical
solutions to everything.
Gosplan ,
was the central organization where engineers worked with
planned
indicators , rational predictions of what they knew society needed.
Vitalii Semyonovich Lelchuk, from the
USSR Academy of Sciences ,
describes how everything was planned in absurdum: "Even the
KGB
was told the quota of arrests to be made and the prisons to be used.
The demand for coffins, novels and movies was all planned."
Planners discovered that what seemed like
rational assessment could
lead to odd outcomes. Trains travelled thousands of miles for no other
reason than to fulfill a plan that measured success in tonnes carried
per kilometer. Sofas and
chandeliers
were made larger and larger because the plan measured material used.
Stalins successor,
Nikita Khrushchev ,
tried to reform the plan and among other things he insisted that
planners must take the price of things into account. The head of the
USSR State Committee for Organization and Methodology of Price Creation
is shown with a tall stack of price logbooks declaring that "This shows
quite clearly that the system is rational".
Academician
Victor Glushkov
saw
cybernetics
as the solution to the issues with the complexity of the planning.
In the mid 60s
Leonid Brezhnev
and
Alexey Kosygin
took over from Khrushchev. They tried to use computerized economic
planning to vitalize the failing economy. A group of three economists
tell of how they assess demand using a nation-wide network of consumer
correspondents, consumer panels and surveys, data which is then
processed by computers. One of the ecominist explains: "The problem is
industry responds very slowly to our scientific forecasts. For
instance, we decided people wanted platform shoes. By the time the
industry got around to increasing production they were out of fashion.
Nowadays the Soviet consumer knows that if there is enough of a
particular item in the shops it's a sure sign it's out of fashion."
In the late 1960s there were years of
economic stagnation ,
and in 1978 stagnation turned into economic crisis. By the mid-1970s
the Soviet leadership gave up attempts to reform the plan and the
industry degenerated into pointless, elaborate ritual. Quote the
narrator: "What had begun as a grand moral attempt to build a rational
society ended by creating a bizarre, bewildering existence for millions
of Soviet people".
To The Brink of
Eternity
This episode outlines how the
US
government attempted to use
systems analysis
and
game
theory
to develop strategies to control the nuclear threat and
nuclear arms race
during the
Cold War .
The focus is on the men of the on whom
Dr Strangelove
was
allegedly based:
Herman Kahn ,
Albert Wohlstetter
and
John von Neumann .
These were people who believed that the world could be controlled by
the scientific manipulation of fear - mathematical analysts employed by
the American
RAND
Corporation. In the end, their visions were the stuff of science
fiction fantasy.
Features several interview segments with
Sam
Cohen
outlining his experiences at RAND. He is the inventor of the
neutron
bomb
and was with RAND 1947-1975.
Also features
George Ball , the
Under-Secretary of State
in the
Kennedy
administration 1961-1966, and
William Gorham [ 1 ] ,
RAND Corporation Asst. Sec. Dept. Health, Education & Welfare
1956-68.
Also features an interview with science
fiction author
Larry Niven , who was instrumental in the
creating of the
Star Wars
policies of
Ronald
Reagan .
Also features
Robert McNamara ,
Thomas Schelling ,
Edward
Teller
and the
Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory .
Similar material is also covered in the
"Fuck
You Buddy"
part of Curtis' later series,
The Trap , but
To The Brink of Eternity
has the focus entirely on the nuclear
and military aspects of Cold War strategy.
John Nash
is not mentioned and the
psychological and economical aspects of game theory are not included.
The League of
Gentlemen
A programme on post-war economic
management in the United Kingdom,
and attempts to prevent relative economic decline and the perception of
the 1960s
Wilson
governments that
devaluation
would jeopardize against national self-esteem.
By the mid 1970s,
stagflation
emerged to confound the
Keynesian
theories used by policy
makers. Meanwhile, a group of economists had managed to convince
Margaret Thatcher ,
Keith
Joseph
and other British politicians that they had foolproof technical means
to make Britain 'great' again. The saga of how their experiments led
the country deeper into economic decline, and asks - is their game
finally up?
Goodbye Mrs Ant
This part focuses on attitudes to nature
and tells the story of the
insecticide
DDT , which
was first seen as a savior to humankind in the 1940s, only to be
claimed as a part of the destruction of the entire
ecosystem
in the late 60s. It also outlines how the sciences of
entomology
and
ecology
were transformed by political and economic pressures.
The episode appears to be named after the
1959 film
Goodbye, Mrs. Ant . [ 2 ]
Clips from the 1958 horror movie
Earth vs. the Spider
and the 1941
grasshopper cartoon
Hoppity Goes to Town
are also
featured.
Insects were a huge problem in the United
States and farmers saw
whole crops destroyed by pests. Emerging in the 1940s DDT and other
insecticides seemed to be the solution. As more insecticides were
invented, the science of
entomology
changed focus from insect classification, to primarily testing new
insecticides and exterminating insects rather than cataloging them. But
the insecticides had side effects. As early as 1946-48 entomologists
began to notice that other species of wildlife, particularly birds,
were being harmed by the insecticides.
Chemical companies portrayed the battle
against insects as a
struggle for existence and their promotional films from the 1950s
invoke
Charles Darwin . Darwin biographer
James Moore
notes how the
battlefield and life and death aspects of Darwin's theories were
emphasized to suit the
Cold War
years. Scientists believed that they
were seizing power from
evolution
and redirecting it by controlling the environment.
In 1962 biologist
Rachel
Carson
released the book
Silent
Spring ,
which was the first serious attack on pesticides and outlined their
harmful side effects. It caused a public outcry but had no immediate
effect on the use of pesticides. Entomologist
Gordon Edwards
retells how he made speeches critical of Carson's book. He eats some
DDT on camera to show how he'd demonstrate its safety during these
talks.
The spraying of DDT in the growing
suburbs brought the side effects
to the attention of the wealthy and articulate middle classes.
Victor Yannacone , a suburbanite and
lawyer, helped found the
Environmental Defense Fund
with
the aim to legally challenge the use of pesticides. They argued that
the chemicals were becoming
more poisonous as they spread , as
evidenced by the disappearance of the
Peregrine Falcon .
In 1968 they got a hearing on DDT in
Madison, Wisconsin . It became headline
news, with both sides claiming that everything America stood for was at
stake. Biologist
Thomas Jukes
is shown singing a pro-DDT
parody on
America the Beautiful
he sent to
Time magazine at the time of the trial. [ 3 ]
Hugh
Iltis
describes how in 1969 a scientist testified at the hearing about how
DDT appears in breast milk and accumulate in the fat tissue of babies.
This got massive media attention.
Where once chemicals were seen as good,
now they were bad. In the late 60s
ecology
was a marginal science. But Yannacone used ecology as a scientific
basis to challenge the DDT defenders' idea of evolution. Similar to how
the science of entomology had been changed in the 1950s, ecology was
transformed by the social and political pressures of the early 70s.
Ecologists became the guardians of the human relationship to nature.
James Moore describes how people try to
get Darwin on the side of their view of nature. In
The Origin of Species
nature is seen as being at war, but also likened to a web of complex
relations. Here Darwin gave people a basis for urging us not to take
control of nature but cooperate with it. In popular imagination a
scientific theory has a single fixed meaning, but in reality it becomes
cultural property and is usable by different interested parties.
Twenty years later the story of DDT
continues with a press
conference announcing the stop of construction in a skyscraper due to a
nesting Peregrine Falcon. Ornitologist David Berger criticizes the
event for fostering the myth of the sensitivity of nature.
Joan
Halifax [ 4 ]
talks about ecology as a gift to human beings and all species, a moral
lesson that gave rise to not
utopia ,
but
ecotopia .
Politics Professor
Langdon Winner
theorizes that social ideals are being read back to us as if they were
lessons derived from science itself. The scientific notions of the
1950s, the ideas of endless possibilities for exploitations of nature,
are now seen as ill-conceived. And the ideas of ecology today may in 30
or 40 years seem similarly ill-conceived.
The episode ends with a quote from Darwin
about seeking divine
providence in nature: "I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too
profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the
mind of Newton. Let each man hope and believe what he can."
Black Power
A look at how
Kwame
Nkrumah , the leader of the Gold Coast (which became
Ghana
on independence) from 1952 to 1966, set Africa ablaze with his vision
of a new industrial and scientific age. At the heart of his dream was
to be the huge
Volta dam , generating enough power to
transform
West Africa
into an industrialized
utopia .
A scheme was drawn up together with
Kaiser Aluminum ,
but as his grand experiment took shape, it brought with it dangerous
forces Nkrumah couldn't control, and he slowly watched his metropolis
of science sink into corruption and debt.
A is For Atom
An insight into the history of
nuclear
power .
In the 1950s scientists and politicians thought they could create a
different world with a limitless source of nuclear energy. But things
began to go wrong. Scientists in America and the Soviet Union were
duped into building dozens of potentially dangerous plants. Then came
the disasters of
Three Mile Island
and
Chernobyl
which changed views on the safety of this new technology. The episode
goes into some detail over attempts to find solutions for the
China Syndrome
hypothesis.
This episode was named after a 1953
General Electric
propaganda film
explaining nuclear power and features artfully chosen footage from this
film. [ 5 ]
