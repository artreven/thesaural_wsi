Thoughts On The Dark Knight Rises Trailer
It’s funny, when it comes to movies, I’m actually not that hard to impress.
While I consider myself well-versed in the world of film, at the end of the day all it really takes to peak my interest, is:
A): A decent cast.
B): A decent concept.
and C): The promise of people punching one another at some point in the movie.
In some cases that last one, if represented well enough, is the
only
excuse I need to see a movie, regardless of how dumb or crappy it is.
I rented the shit-fest that was
Unknown
purely in the hopes of seeing a handful of
Liam Neeson
related beat downs.
I saw
Fast Five
solely
for the purpose of seeing
Vin Diesel
and
The Rock
(not Dwayne) bro-out and put each other through particle board walls.
Pictured: Either The Rock is about to get suplexed, or Vin Diesel's in the process of getting Speared. I honestly can't tell...
And when it comes to
The Dark Knight Rises , as utterly incalculable as the build-up has, and will
continue
to be for the next 6 months or so, at the end of the day I will see it because it, unlike any other movie in film history; will deliver the long anticipated spectacle of
Batman
and
Bane  duking it out on the big screen.
That these 2 titans of comics are to be portrayed by capable actors such as
Christian Bale
and
Tom Hardy
respectively, is merely the icing on the cake.
I find this funny. Does that make me less of a man?
Christopher Nolan’s
track record when it comes to cinematography and fight choreography suggests that the ensuing bout will be clumsy and edited through a meat grinder, but even so, I’ve been waiting to see this fight brought to life on the silver screen since I was 6 years old; and crappy or not, I will not be denied.
That being said, Batman and Bane grudge match aside, what did I think of the new trailer for The Dark Knight Rises?
Well, to answer your question, I felt it was quite good by most standards, but much too enigmatic and fractured in it’s presentation to pack the same visceral punch that the later trailers for
The Dark Knight
did.
Here’s a refresher in case you need it:
I’d prefer not to compare the 2, as it’s obvious the people cutting the trailers for these movies came at it from very different tonal and thematic standpoints; but I feel it needs to be said that, to me, The Dark Knight really did have some of the
best
trailers of all time.
Everything, from the shot selection, to the music cues, to the overall pacing of the trailers for The Dark Knight was absolutely spot on.
What’s more, thanks to the dialogue-heavy nature of the trailers, as well as his untimely death, an absurd amount of buzz was generated for
Heath Ledger’s
portrayal of
The Joker , (*Sigh* “Why So Serious?”) not to mention the overall plot of the film was made crystal clear.
Though it sounds silly in this cynical age of ours, in many ways I feel the catchphrases and buzzwords of The Dark Knight actually served to make it’s advertising campaign both effective and memorable on the whole.
The trailer for The Dark Knight Rises has a lot of neat shots in it, promising quite a few interesting set piece moments, however, perhaps due to the lack of dialogue, many of these shots are difficult to interpret from a purely visual standpoint.
Early on we see the reflection of a man with a cane approaching a shiny dinner platter while
Alfred
drones on about the Wayne dynasty:
Pictured: I have no fucking clue. Maybe a Ra's Al Ghul flashback?
At some point we see someone stumble onto the set of
Kenneth Branagh’s
Hamlet :
Pictures: Ballrooms + Flower Petals = Hamelt. It's science.
Later, we see a bearded Bruce Wayne wandering around what appears to be the prison equivalent to
Discovery Zone :
I know it's probably supposed to be a prison, but honestly, I kind of wanna' play on it...
There’s
that French lady
from
Inception  n’shit.
A FOOTBALL FIELD was just DESTROYED! WHY ARE YOU SMILING!?
There’s
Joseph Gordon-Levitt .
Pictured: Joseph Gordon "Still Not Sure Where To Put The Hyphen" Levitt.
There’s
A SHIT TON
of rappeling.
The Dark Knight Rises: A Story of Men On Ropes.
And then we have
Anne Hathaway
as a mean lady that may or may not be
Catwoman .
Seriously, if you take into account the fact that maybe,
just maybe , the people viewing this trailer haven’t been blogging about every step of the script writing process, or staring at leaked production photos for the past several months, (oddly enough, not me!) then this trailer basically offers no hint as to her role being that of Selina Kyle.
Oh wait excuse me, she’s wearing a mask at a masquerade ball that, if you look
really
hard, has
cat ears :
Direct quote: "WHOOOOOOOO!!!!!!"
Sarcasm deployed, mystery solved.
Much like
Aaron Eckhart’s
Two-Face , unless you’ve been following the production or are familiar with the Batman universe, chances are you’d never know Anne Hathaway was supposed to be Catwoman in this trailer.
Indeed, I’m curious to know what this trailer meant to people who
aren’t
familiar with Batman outside of the movies.
In many ways, when I watch this trailer, I feel my perception is skewed by the fact that I already have an attachment to and understanding of many of the characters based on their comic book equivalent.
When I think “Bane,” I already have an image in mind of what I expect from him.
When I hear Tom Hardy speaking through his mask I say to myself:
"I can see how people could find that hard to understand, but goddamnit that sounds like Bane!"
When I see scenes from the trailer like the prison break, I think to myself:
"Nice. That looks straight out of Knightfall!"
To the average Batman virgin however, I’d imagine imagery such as this would be provocative, but purely in a “oh, so that’s gonna’ happen at some point” kind of way.
Hell, I’m willing to bet the average Bat Virgin doesn’t have the slightest clue as to
who
or
what
Bane even is.
What I think I’m trying to say, is that the style of editing and presentation of this trailer is enticing, as anything with a budget and pretty pictures can manage to be, but at the same time I feel frustrated by the numerous vagaries it throws in my lap.
As you can probably tell, I’m not a fan of the
J.J. Abrams -style marketing.
It’s not that I prefer my trailers to spell their plots and structure out to me, I simply value coherence and context over sound cues and pretty pictures.
Much like all of Christopher Nolan’s blockbusters, The Dark Knight Rises appears to be an audio-visual powerhouse, though in some ways it appears a little less so at this point.
The set pieces looks suitably big, but the color palette appears more gray-ish and natural than The Dark Knight and
Batman Begins , and curiously enough, despite it being an almost comical trademark of his, there’s not a single (gorgeous) overhead shot of a cityscape.
Instead he decided to pull a 180 and do an INVERTED overhead shot for the poster!
That last part troubles me, as I’m a big fan of Nolan’s wide open establishing shots, particularly in outdoor scenes, and though it may just be the editor’s doing; there are none to be found in this trailer.
Perhaps the strangest thing though, at least to me, is the fact that they re-used the mood building drone AKA The Joker’s theme from The Dark Knight in this trailer.
I always thought of that particular piece of music as “belonging” to The Joker, which made it somewhat puzzling to hear played over a trailer for a film that, almost certainly; won’t feature him.
Despite everything I’ve said about this trailer, both good and bad, at the end of the day it’s a very good piece of advertising for a sequel that, unfortunately, benefitted from some of the best advertising and pre-release buzz in recent memory.
Not only that, it’s only the
first
trailer, for a huge movie that isn’t dropping until late in the summer.
As good as the advertising for The Dark Knight was from the get go, the 2nd trailers for it,
Iron Man , and Inception were all
MONUMENTALLY
better than the first, which leads me to believe the same will likely be the case with The Dark Knight Rises.
In addition to this, one also has to consider the fact that virtually all of Christopher Nolan’s blockbusters up to this point, while heavily advertised, also did well to avoid showing a great deal of the major story beats and action set pieces.
I mean hell, neither the teaser nor the trailer saw any mention of
Morgan Freeman’s
Lucius Fox , nor any of stuff from the prologue sequence that made the rounds through theaters last week.
I don’t know about you, but up until it’s release I really thought the “truck flip” from The Dark Knight trailer was going to be the climax of the movie.
Instead, the entire skyscraper based finale of the movie ended up playing that role, while never once being hinted at in the trailers.
I guess what I’m trying to say, is that though I may seem overly critical, in truth I’m just a fanboy hoping for the best.
In the meantime though, as weird as it seems, I think I actually liked the almost universally panned
teaser
for The Dark Knight Rises somewhat better than the trailer.
True, most of the footage was borrowed from Batman Begins.
True,
Commissioner Gordon’s
dialogue was hard to understand.
True, virtually nothing Commissioner Gordon had to say was even
worth
hearing in the first place.
BUT , at the very end of the teaser, there is a single, barely 2 second shot that made it all worth it:
Pictured: All I needed to see.
Batman in the rain, taking a deep breath, while Bane slowly approaches from the foreground.
The whole thing was crap up until then, but that last shot instantly sold me.
The trailer, while bigger and much more coherent, didn’t have this shot or even a suitable equivalent.
True, it featured a few shots of Batman and Bane throwing down in the snow, however I felt the subtlety and dramatic implication of the teaser shot did more to appease the fanboy in me than the entirety of the full trailer.
That’s just me though.
Do I ever need a reason to post this? Didn't think so...

Conan The Barbarian Review
Hey look! Orange and Blue!
Let’s get one thing out of the way before we start this review:
I liked the
Arnold Schwarzenegger
Conan .
I liked it
A lOT .
Truth be told, I haven’t read any of the original
Robert E. Howard
Conan stories, nor any of the
Dark Horse
comics.
To that end, everything I know (and love) of Conan has been culled from the Arnold movies, and the
Conan the Adventurer
cartoon series.
Fuckin’ loved that show…
*ANYWAY*
while the examples of Conan that I’ve experienced may not be the most traditional, they’re all I have; and frankly, I don’t mind that.
Which brings us to the 2011 film version of Conan, the oddly titled reboot/retread; Conan the Barbarian, henceforth referred to as
Conan the Hawaiian .
To be perfectly frank, Conan the Hawaiian honestly felt like a double-length episode of
Hercules: The Legendary Journeys , both in terms of plotting and tone.
Sadly, no Kevin Sorbo cameos...
Aside from the names of the locations, the origin story prologue, and maybe some of the characters; much of Conan the Hawaiian’s plot could easily have been transposed onto another generic sword and sandals flick with virtually the same degree of success.
Indeed, had the Conan name not been attached to this movie; for all intents and purposes, I likely would not have bothered to go see it.
Such is the power of licensing and iconography.
Despite all this, I came into the film with fairly realistic expectations.
I would never expect a movie called Conan the Hawaiian to have brilliant writing, nor any degree of complex storytelling in it’s plotting.
For the most part, I just had my fingers crossed for a hefty dose of tasty sword related violence, and a decent performance from the lead actor,
Jason Momoa .
Way to go bra'! Represent!
Conan the Hawaiian delivered (with varying degrees of success) on
both
of my expectations for it, so why then is my opinion of the film so negative?
I think it has something to do with the inescapable elements of cheapness that are evident when watching the film.
For instance, do you want to know how you can tell a movie is cheap, even when it’s props and CGI backdrops are of decent quality?
When the film takes place in about a dozen locations, all of which are represented from afar by a CGI matte painting, and in the interior by a dining room sized sound stage.
Few things are more irksome in a fantasy film than being teased by the promise of cool cities n’shit, only to have the interior of said cities be represented by a
SINGLE FUCKING ROOM .
Also known as Star Wars disease, wherein we frequently are shown the splendor of a cityscape, only to see maybe 3 locations within it.
Despite this minor quibble, one thing that I have to commend Conan the Hawaiian for; is the fact that it represents one of the rare cases when a shitty movie both acknowledges and
revels
in it’s shittiness.
As mentioned earlier, Conan the Hawaiian’s plot is pretty lame, not even as complex or engaging as
The Scorpion King , (which is a better movie, in case you’re wondering) however one of it’s greatest strengths is the fact that it never attempts to be.
To my surprise, Conan the Hawaiian’s running time is largely dominated by action sequences, leaving little room for cheesy plot or equally cheesy dialogue from what I’d assume was it’s 5 page script.
The action/fighting is executed with some degree of competence, and it’s indeed quite bloody; however in my opinion the goryness of the violence could’ve been dialed up just a notch or 2 for effect.
Watching anonymous bad guys get cut down left and right every 5 minutes is fun and all, but it’s a lot more fun when said instances of cutting are unique and memorable.
I’m just saying, I personally would’ve appreciated a disemboweling or de-limbing here and there to spice things up.
In my book, EVERY movie needs a Mola Ram heart rip!
On that same note though, another gripe I had about the film was the fact that, early on we are teased by the villain possessing an honor guard of sorts, an elite cadre of unique villains who all participated in fucking over Hawaiian Conan at the beginning of the film.
By showing us these characters, and how they figure into Hawaiian Conan’s revenge plot, the movie makes a promise that we’ll see all of these characters meet their fate ala
Shurayukihime ,
Kill Bill , and Conan the Barbarian.
While this does in fact
happen , very little care is placed in how each of these characters are dealt with.
In fact, I only remember 2 of the characters receiving names, one of which bears a rather alarming resemblance to one of the
other
nameless honor guardsmen.
Pictured: A GOOD example of eliminating an interesting character OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE.
It’s a minor gripe, but it pains me to see a film like this, that has so little going for it in terms of plot; sweep away it’s own breadcrumbs though clumsily eliminating potentially interesting characters with little to no fanfare.
Gripes aside, the one element of the action that I can’t knock at all, was Jason Momoa’s swordplay.
Watching a man of Momoa’s size handle a sword with such grace is truly a sight to behold.
Indeed, he and
Stephen Lang’s
pair of duels in the film are very much the highlight of the film.
While I’m on the subject of Momoa, it pains me to say that his acting performance was kind of “meh,” though on the plus side; it’s hard to deny that his physical presence is the sort that can largely make up for that.
I think the problem with Momoa’s acting in the role of Conan, is the fact that the temperment of the character, at least in this film; doesn’t seem to fit him.
It’s kind of like
Christian Bale’s
turn as
Batman
in the
Christopher Nolan
films.
Bale does great as Bruce Wayne, and indeed
looks
the part of Batman, however something about the Batman voice and attitude just doesn’t work.
Momoa has these problems as Conan.
Everything seems to fit pretty well in his quieter and more contemplative moments, though whenever he’s supposed to put on his mean face and get all savage, his voice sounds forced and just doesn’t work for me.
On a side note,
Leo Howard , the kid that played the young Conan; was probably the strongest performance in the whole movie.
Seriously man, that kid was a
BEAST .
Moving on, despite having some decent actors involved, most of the performances in Conan the Hawaiian feel largely phoned-in.
Stephen Lang’s role as the villain is a little bit more complex than you’d expect given his motivations, however the paltry script affords him very little opportunities to flex his acting muscles or chew scenery.
For fuck’s sake, I can recall an instance when Lang is in battle in Conan and declares:
“I don’t like
YOU !”
Really?
You’re the fuckin’ “last boss” of the movie, and
that’s
your big menacing one-liner?
Anyway,
Rose McGowan’s
turn as Lang’s creepy-ass daughter had some thought put into it, though it came across as being hammy in the bad way.
The bad way as in
Sci-Fi Channel , “bad way.”
She does what she can to play to the morbid nature of her character, as well as her bizarre wardrobe, however at the end of the day she comes across as a shlocky villain in the tradition of
The Baroness
or
Evil-Lyn .
That's right, I made a He-Man reference in a Conan review.
Oh yeah, Ron Perlman was in this movie too.
… That’s about all I have to say about that.
Anyway, Conan the Hawaiian wasn’t a horrible movie, especially if you’re purely in the mood for blood and boobs; however it’s largely uninspired and more than a little cheap.
I will say this though:
In terms of pure entertainment value, it’s better than
Cowboys & Aliens .

Thoughts On Conan The Barbarian Teaser
I’ve posted a couple of times now regarding my thoughts on the upcoming
Jason Momoa
Conan film , however this marks the first time said thoughts have been anything less than hopeful.
That being said, while I’m completely aware of the dangers of using a teaser trailer as a quality barometer for a yet to be released film, I’ve gotta’ say; whoever is in charge of the marketing for Conan The Barbarian needs to be dick-slapped something fierce.
Speaking of which, I’m not sure when they decided to go with the title “Conan The Barbarian,” but personally I think that was a bad move.
I mean yeah, I understand that the producers are probably looking to create some brand recognition, not to mention distance their film from the similarly titled
Conan O’Brien
show, but even so; the thought of 2 films of such a short series bearing the exact same name seems a little strange to me.
Anyway, let’s back to the topic at hand, namely that of the teaser from said Conan movie.
Speaking of which, I should probably post that for you to see.
Here yah’ go:
Long story short, I found the teaser to be laughable.
Other than a few foggy images fading in and out through a smoke cloud, there’s little to no content to be found within it, making it the very definition of a teaser; which in and of itself not a bad thing.
Remember when the first teasers for
Inception
came out and we were all totally drawn in by how enigmatic and full of
Hans Zimmer
infused
BWAAHHHH!!!!
they were?
Well, that would’ve worked for Conan, had they excised
all
of the voice-over and narration and instead gone with something a little more subtle.
Unfortunately, they didn’t.
No, instead we get some of the most over the top (and cerebral) voice-over this side of
UFC
commentary.
Seriously, I don’t know if it’s just me, but the voice of the narrator sounded really fuckin’ stupid to me.
He sounded like he was trying to work from the badass
Don LaFontaine
school of
“IN A WORLD”
style voice-over, but sadly it just kind of ends up sounding really dumb and horribly forced.
To make matters worse, when the narrator is switched out for Jason Momoa’s “Conan voice;” it ends up sounding like the 2 guys were trying to one-up each other in the excessively manly voice department.
Anyway, while the teaser might be really fuckin’ stupid, and poorly imagined at that; I feel it’s worth reiterating that at it’s core it’s just a trailer, and
should
have little to no bearing on the quality of the finished product.
In any case, I’ll still end up watching the movie anyway; ’cause let’s face it, it’s Conan, and Conan’s the shit.
In the hopes of giving this post at least some element of positivity, I feel it’s worth mentioning that in perusing the Conan The Barbarian wikipedia page, I happened to note that
Bob Sapp
was listed in the cast, which at least gives the movie the added benefit of potentially playing host to a Jason Momoa/Bob Sapp smackdown.
As you can see, Mr. Sapp is pretty fuckin' awesome...
As much as I like Bob Sapp, in all honesty; the man has a pretty awful track record in his film appearances.
Seriously man,
Devil Man
and
Elektra
were shitty movies on their own; however it could easily be argued that Bob Sapp’s presence in them, actually might have contributed to making them the piles of ass they are.
Come to think of it, he’s been out of the spotlight for long enough that I’m just kind of hoping he hasn’t ballooned into a fat fuck like a lot of retired pro athletes.
In his defense, "The Fridge" was never all that slim to begin with...
Huh, guess that wasn’t all that positive after all…
Anyway, here’s hoping that despite the horrible teaser trailer, Conan The Barbarian ends up being the worthwhile movie I’ve been waiting for all these years.

Thoughts On The Dark Knight Rises Rumor Mill
Jim Lee Batman FTW.
I happened upon
an article on IGN
earlier today that ruminated on some possible plot details of
Christopher Nolan’s
upcoming
Batman
three-quel,
The Dark Knight Rises .
Said article made mention of
Talia al Ghul
and the
League of Shadows
(“Assassins” in the comics) likely having a role in the central plot of the film, which most likely points to
Tom Hardy’s
previously announced role as
Bane
taking a hit in screen time and dramatic relevance.
"Bane takes backseat to NO ONE!!!"
My personal objections to this potential snubbing of Bane aside, I honestly feel that Talia could be an interesting element to the overarching story of the Nolan-verse of Batman lore.
With
Catwoman
already announced for the cast of the film, we now have
2
very potent femme fatales of Batman’s rogues present in 1 film.
Combine that with a Bruce Wayne who’s very likely still shaky around the lady-folk due to his previous love getting, y’know; blown the fuck up in the
previous movie , and you have the makings of a very intricate and deceptive love triangle.
Eew! Batman has cooties!
In addition to this, Talia serves as an effective anchor to
Batman Begins
in the form of her familial relation to the primary villain of that film,
Ra’s al Ghul ; making for an epic plot thread that, if executed properly; will lend a sense cohesiveness to the whole trilogy.
While nothing is certain, least of all the plot elements mentioned above; the thought of Bane being cast as anything less than a primary villain feels like kind of a letdown.
When Bane was initially announced as a villain for The Dark Knight Rises, I was hoping against hope that he was going to be
the
villain, that is; the main foil for Batman regardless of whatever notables of his rogues gallery ended up being cast in the film.
Upon reading that Talia was a possible element of the film though, it makes it hard to picture Bane as little more than the muscle, or worse yet; a pawn to the machinations of the League of Shadows.
Despite my
personal
disappointment in said news, (anything short of a live-action
Knightfall
will probably fall short in my eyes…) it’s interesting to note that this particular plot rumor actually follows the Batman comics pretty closely.
Not long ago, I was fortunate to acquire a copy of the somewhat rare Batman story arc entitled
Legacy .
I PAID!
In Legacy, the Bat-Family (including Catwoman) is charged with preventing Ra’s Al Ghul, his daughter Talia, Bane, and the entire League of Shadows
from unleashing a catastrophic plague on humankind.
While the story is indeed “comic booky” to the point of being unfeasible for live-action adaptation, the
one
element of the story that drew to pick it up, was that Legacy was known to contain the
only
legitimate rematch between Batman and Bane post-Knightfall.
While I honestly can say, grudgingly; that the rematch was not at all worth the
considerable
price of admission, it was fascinating to see Bane incorporated into a Ra’s Al Ghul story nonetheless.
In Legacy, Bane’s role was that of a stand-in for Bruce Wayne as Ra’s Al Ghul’s potential heir.
A key storyline that has often been used in interactions between Batman and Ra’s Al Ghul has always been that of Ra’s wishing to marry Talia off to Bruce and have him take control of the League of Shadows.
Hell, at one point Batman actually went through with all of the above; only to turn his back on Ra’s and Talia after a moral disagreement.
"Moral Disagreement" of course being code for "Naked Swordfight."
The point is, Bane is and always has been somewhat of a cracked mirror image of Batman, such that their origins and motivations are nearly opposite, but their abilities and steadfast natures are nearly identical.
Going with this line of thinking, the writers cleverly wrote Bane into Legacy as Ra’s new heir, as well as future husband to Talia.
If Christopher Nolan and his crew were to associate Bane with the League of Shadows in a fairly logical (by comic book standards) manner, such as the one listed above; I see no reason why it wouldn’t work out.
My hope remains that Tom Hardy is given free reign to take center stage as
the
villain of The Dark Knight Rises, but with
Anne Hathaway’s
Catwoman, the yet to be cast role of Talia, and
Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s
yet to be announced (or confirmed) role in the film also floating around somewhere in the script; it seems unrealistic to think that
anyone
will be claiming this film as their own.
Much like every Christopher Nolan film of the post-Batman Begins era, I’d expect The Dark Knight Rises to be very much an ensemble affair, making it unrealistic to expect a singular, commanding performance from anyone in the cast ala
Heath Ledger
and
Jack Nicholson’s
Joker (s).
Bane’s a heavy for sure, but his charisma and personality can’t hold a candle to the endless possibilities that a character like The Joker presents to actors.
That being said, I’m a Batman nut,
and
a Bane fanatic; so The Dark Knight Rises is basically the biggest comic book movie
ever
for me.
Gonna’ be hard to wait for this one…

Bane + Christopher Nolan = I Love You Christopher Nolan
It finally happened folks.
Bane
has been officially cast for
Christopher Nolan’s
next, and likely last;
Batman
film,
The Dark Knight Rises .
When I first read about it, I was floored.
I, along with God knows how many comic fans; have been asking for Bane in every Batman film since his debut in
Knightfall .
And no, THIS doesn't count.
He’s one of my favorite villains in Batman’s pantheon, and I have no doubt that Nolan will do him justice in bringing him to the silver screen.
Curiously enough,
Tom Hardy
of Nolan’s
Inception ; is cast as the titular South American juicing genius.
While I honestly don’t
see
Bane in Hardy at first glance, my perception of his as an actor is strictly limited to his performance in Inception, so I don’t think it fair of me to pass judgment based on that alone.
Even so, Hardy’s physical presence seems rather puny when compared to the hulking physique of the character, not to mention I’d be curious to see if he’ll be able to pull of a South American accent, but these are questions that only come to mind given my love for the character.
... Tom Hardy everyone!
Aside from the glee that shoots through my heart as I think of how awesome it’s going to be to see one of my favorite comic villains brought to life on the big screen, the best part of casting Bane for The Dark Knight Rises, is the fact that his character brings a very different dynamic to the mix.
Batman Begins
and
The Dark Knight
featured numerous villains of Batman’s gallery of rogues, however with the exception of perhaps
Ra’s Al Ghul , none of them stood as
physical
match to the caped crusader.
I like you Carrey, but Batman would turn your face inside out with one punch.
While Bane has shown (in the comics) that he is very much on par with Batman in terms of intelligence and cunning, the element of his character that stands out the most is that he is physically as strong as, or stronger; than Batman.
Aside from
Amygdala ,
Killer Croc , and maybe a few others, Batman rarely has to contend with opponents that physically outmatch him, let alone one’s that can count to 5.
Man, I love that clip…
Much like how I’ve been waiting (and continue to wait…) for another
Superman
film to cash in on the amazing success of the wholly under-appreciated
Superman II
by giving him villains he can slug it out with, I’ve spent much of my life waiting for a Batman film to put him up against someone that can duke it out with the dark knight.
As my “Sequential Visual Narrative” teacher once told me:
“Superman is only fun when he has something to punch.”
Which is why this FAILED and should have been titled: "Superman Lifts Progressively Heavier Things"
While I’m of course excited to see what Christopher Nolan’s script has in mind for Bane, the comic fan in me can’t help wonder/worry how Tom “Fish Lips” Hardy will do when it comes to embodying the beast that is Bane.
As evidenced by Nolan’s casting methods since Batman Begins, he’s a man very much keen on casting his films with actors he’s comfortable/familiar with, or failing that; lots and lots of English people.
Seriously man, you try an’ count how many actors in his movies come from across the pond, and you’re likely to run out of fingers
and
toes.
Oh well, it’s probably a comfort thing; and based on his success in the industry up to this point, I’d say it’s working for him.
Anyway,
Catwoman
has also been cast for The Dark Knight Rises, with
Anne Hathaway
filling the role.
Anne Hathaway's Eyes: The Only Thing That Can Compete With Jennifer Garner's Forehead in terms of hogging a shot.
She’s a decent actress, and definitely has a way about her that seems appropriate for Selina Kyle; however aside from
Michelle Pfeiffer’s
multi-faceted performance in
Batman Returns , I bear no love for the character whatsoever.
Honestly, as of this point I’m on board for The Dark Knight Rises for Bane and Chris Nolan; that’s about it.
Oh yeah, and
Michael Caine , ’cause he’s fuckin’ pimp.
Michael Caine on any given Thursday. That's your mom on the left, by the way.
Anyway, that’s it for today, hopefully you’re all as excited/elated as I am for this one!

Thoughts on Inception
Movie Poster Fail.
Let it be known, this article is not a review.
Like
my article
on
Splice , I don’t feel adequately qualified to properly review
Inception , and as such, I will instead use this post as a vehicle for my ruminations regarding it.
Anyway, let me begin by saying that:
I liked Inception.
I felt it was an entertaining and (conceptually) innovative film, that managed to hold my interest throughout despite it’s
sinfully
long running time.
Okay fine, the movie isn’t
Braveheart
long, but hey;
you
try going to see it in the theater at 10:45 at night and tell me it didn’t whip your ass.
10:45 PM or not, he's gonna' BEAT YOUR ASS.
Inception is a film that I absolutely
will not
spend time going into detail regarding the plot and other such bullshit.
I say this, not because I don’t want to drop spoilers, but because I honestly don’t remember most of them.
Oh yeah, and it would cause me physical pain to try and explain some of the goofy shit that goes on in this movie.
Seriously, I’d need a diorama,
Powerpoint , an old priest and a young priest just to explain the
concept
of this fucking movie.
Actually, I think Von Sydow would do well enough by himself.
Max Von Sydow was BORN looking that awesome.
The basic concept of the movie involves the manipulation and invasion of peoples’ dreams, leading to a story that mirrors that of an absurdly complex and convoluted heist film.
I say “convoluted” because there are moments when, just when you think you’ve got all the rules of the film’s impressively well thought out, and seemingly
structured
universe, the movie starts throwing you curve balls in the form of
changing
it’s own logic for the sake of convenience in regards to the plot.
That’s not to say this happens all the way through, however there were at least 2 occasions in which I honestly had to scratch my head and say:
“Huh?  Why the fuck did that just happen?”
Pictured: A film where such a phrase is often uttered by the viewer, and yet no explanations are offered...
It’s interesting to note that, despite the 2 films sharing very little in common, for whatever reason I kept saying to myself in the theater:
“This hella’ reminds me of
Flatliners …”
WHY THE FUCK HAS NO ONE SEEN THIS MOVIE!?
Despite it’s complex subject matter and, at times, fuzzy internal logic; it should be noted that Inception is by no means a genius of a film.
That is, unlike
The Legend of Zelda
on the
NES , Inception did not make me feel stupid or lost at any point, rather; it succeeded in making me feel
smart .
Let it be known, the Azn Badger is a Badger of barely average intelligence.
Your average Badger.
Azn or not.
An AZN Badger.
That being said, let me just say that the screenplay of Inception, like seemingly every
Christopher Nolan
film, is
very
redundant, and much too excessive with it’s incessant dropping of “breadcrumbs” for the viewer.
In example, let’s summarize the scripts for
Batman Begins ,
The Prestige , and
The Dark Knight :
Batman Begins:
“FEAR!!!!!!!! JUSTICE!!!!!!!!! I’M BATMAAAANNNNNN!!!!!!”
The Prestige:
“REVENGE!!!! MAGICAL DAVIIIIIIIDDDDDD BOWIIIIIIIIEEEEE!!!!!!”
The Dark Knight:
“CHAOS!!!! JUSTICE!!!!!!!!! WHERE IS HE!!!!!!!????”
To those of you that don’t habla Espanol, “breadcrumbs” refers to the little droplings, or tidbits of information that are interspersed throughout a screenplay to make those “Ah Hah!” moments seem more logical, and ultimately, more rewarding to the viewer.
Inception’s script is, to pound the metaphor totally into the ground,
not
sprinkled with breadcrumbs as most films should be, but is instead simply a whole loaf of bread.
Mmmmmm.... Inception.... *Drool*
Put it this way, if you’re paying attention, and are able to keep track of wherever the fuck the film’s logic decides to go throughout the movie, then chances are you’ll be able to figure out most of the major plot points a good 20 minutes to a half hour before I
think
the movie intended you to.
Anyway, good movie, provocative screenplay, but just a little bit heavy-handed with the exposition at times.
Attention Mr. Nolan: This is not the tool you use to write a script...
The acting performances in Inception were, in a word; “solid.”
I say this because, despite the all-star cast; Inception is by no means an actor’s movie.
Due to the hardened nature of most of the main characters, the majority of the performances consist of muted expressions and flat deliveries.
Hell, even most of the humor is deadpan.
Tom Hardy
has an accent, and that’s about all he did for me.
Ellen Page , while looking uncharacteristically fetching in this movie, also failed to leave any sort of impression.
Leonardo DiCaprio
is just about the only actor allowed to emote throughout, yet despite this; most of his thunder is stolen by the script’s propensity to spill the beans on it’s big character reveals long before their intended cues.
That being said,
Joseph Gordon-Levitt
and
Ken Watanabe
managed to make an impression based purely on their facial acting.
That and Levitt looks like my brother, but Jewish.
He looks like these two, a little.
Those are the only clues you're getting though...
Oh yeah, and Ken Watanabe is pimp, so he gets a pass as well.
One thing I feel that needs to be pointed out about Inception, is that the action is typical of a Christopher Nolan film.
One thing about Nolan that truly confuses me, is that he seems to know what he likes in his movies, and how he likes to shoot it, however, when it comes to framing action, the man just doesn’t have a clue.
Maybe it’s his cinematographer, or his editor’s fault, but regardless, whoever is fucking up really needs to stop it.
RIGHT NOW.
Simply put, Christopher Nolan likes sweeping aerial shots of cities,
Check...
car chases,
Double check...
and gunplay/fighting.
Check-A-Saurus Rex...
Inception, of course, has all of these things, however only 2 thirds of it is done well.
Don’t get me wrong, Nolan’s cityscape shots are always beautiful, as are his car chases, but when it comes to framing human-on-human violence, he sucks donkey balls.
My main issue with Nolan’s action scenes, is the lack of spacial awareness the viewer is given throughout.
You know that thing that the Hong Kong cinematographers do where they shoot the actors from the toes up so you can catch the detail and
intent
in their movements?
I know, a fight scene is totally different from your standard action scene, but bear with me...
Well, Nolan’s answer to this is to frame everything all loosey-goosey, and then throw the footage into the meat grinder until it makes a
Bourne
movie look under-edited.
It should be said though, that whoever does Mr. Nolan’s sound editing, should be given some sort of award *cough!*
Oscar!
*cough!*
Seriously, the sound of the gunfire in both The Dark Knight and Inception is a thing of beauty.
Truly the definition of “ear-popping.”
No, different kind of "ear pop," yah' dipshit...
Compliments aside, I have one more gripe about the action:
I know it’s realistic to choreograph a gunfight as a fairly stationary and controlled series of tactical potshots, but for
A MOVIE THAT TAKES PLACE IN FUCKING DREAMLAND , I’d expect things to be just a
little
bit more colorful.
WOAH!!!!! TOO MUCH COLOR!!!! DIAL THAT SHIT DOWN, SON!!!!
Seriously, what the fuck is the point of having gunfire and explosions in your movie if you aren’t going to go to the trouble to highlight them in any way.
On a final note, I’d like to take a minute to give my thoughts on the
soundtrack
of Inception.
A lot has been said about the ever so prolific,
Hans Zimmer’s , soundtrack of the movie.
Lookit' this smug fuck, with his dick-eatin' lips...
By, “a lot,” of course, I mean a lot of good.
Several of my friends hyped the soundtrack for me, such that I was really excited to hear the soundtrack, much more so than I was about seeing the movie in fact.
After all, my friends and I used to refer to Inception in daily speech as simply,
“BWAAAHHHHH!!!”
due to the brass blaring teaser trailer.
In example:
“Hey, did you see
BWAAAHHHH!!!
yet dude?”
Anyway, retarded bullshit aside, Inception’s soundtrack was booming, sweeping, and all sorts of epic, however I ended up leaving the theater with little to no recollection of any sort of themes or melodies played throughout.
In essence, the music was gorgeous, and almost mystifyingly dignified, almost like a classical symphony, however, despite being excessive and overbearing throughout, to me; it just wasn’t all that memorable or engaging.
Seriously, Inception had
a lot
of music, too much in fact.
The only musical memory I walked away from the film with was bittersweet, in that I realized one of the climax themes played during the last act of the film, was in fact played
twice
within the same act of the film.
That’s just fucking lazy.
I’ve always said Hans Zimmer was overrated, and while the score for Inception does little to change my impression of him, I will say this:
He’s done better.
Just as Christopher Nolan has done better.
And Leonardo DiCaprio has done better.
Even so, Inception is a good movie, that while lacking in some areas, and full of holes in others, is a film that, regardless of how you feel about it, leaves you with something to talk about.
Just like
The Matrix
more than 10 years before it, (wow, I’m really
that
old?) it’s by no means perfect, but something about it just makes us want to sit down
talk about it
with someone, for better or for worse.
In many ways, I can think of no greater success for a film of this nature.
Now let’s just hope they don’t go and blow it by making a shit ton of sequels…
Although Mr. Nolan can go ahead and make another
Batman .
The Azn Badger
loves
him some Batman…
