Review of the movie - Enthiran
I rarely watch movies. And definitely I have never thought of reviewing
any movie. But something wanted me to review Enthiran.
Generally movies contain silly illogical things. Enthiran, being the first of its kind in Tamil,
also has silly illogical scenes and dialogues. We should and can easily ignore most of them. Before reading this review, it is better to get to know the plot of the Enthiran. At the face of it: Saloon scene was enjoyable, though scanning the telephone directory just by shaking it twice was a bit unbelievable even as a fantasy. Dialog between Traffic constable and Chitti was good. Chitti surprising vaseegaran by saying he is his creator and hence god was a well thought out scene. Chitti looking like Kali after attracting the weapons was really looking nice. Train sequence was really titillating the eyes, though we should have expected such a sequence in the movie. We have seen such super heroic scenes in the previous Rajni movies and Shankar movies. Only here, he has a better reason to do so. The rescue of people from fire was looking good, though the use of magnetic power to attach over long distances was a lot more than a fantasy. The dialogs between Vasee and Chitti while adding the feelings was really good. The normal delivery of the baby by Chitti and ultrasound video stream would titillate almost anybody. Dialog between Chitti, Sana and Vasee after the birthday party was really good. The buildup of the robot and the AIRD evaluation and the addition of feelings to Chitti and how he behaves was very enjoyable and I was wondering what is going to happen next. Then comes the section of the movie where Bohra inserts red chip and Chitti becomes Villain and a usual fight between Good and evil, Hero and Villain happens.
I agree that I really liked the villain Rajni's acting. The Graphics was good in this section. Apart from Rajni's acting and the graphics/visuals, this section was not fitting into this movie at all. Is that the best thing Shankar could come up with after giving a very good start for the movie? Like any other previous Shankar movies I expected the faster screenplay. However the unwarranted songs were a bit annoying. I was mesmerized by Sujatha's dialogues. I in fact wonder what Shankar is going to do in his future films without Sujatha's dialogues. It was a good effort from the team and I was happy when I came out of the theater. How I knew that I cannot avoid looking back at the movie and see what really looks good beyond the theater. In Hindsight:
Though we do not need to compare the real world technologies and the ones used in fiction, we should at least do the basic checks. Neural schema is talked about. Processor speed and memory are talked about. Videos are stored. Sensory inputs are analyzed by processor.
With this what I understand is that, Chitti has a neural network based on some specific neural schema. To take sensory inputs and process them and similarly to control the peripherals, Chitti must be using both the neural network and the processor and memory. With this in mind let me analyze the critical things. Chitti is shown to get skills in departments like Martial arts, Music, Dance, Memory, Magnetic, Driving skills, Linguistic skills, Rescuing from fire, Self assembling. And it is shown that all these skills are simply uploaded into memory so that chitti is able to use them.
With how Chitti is using the skills, I just infer that it will be the neural network which he would be using. Whatever the neural schema maybe, I am very skeptical that, even in future, a
robot can learn the skills just like that. Especially those skills which require humans to spend longer and longer to learn, the robots will take equally longer. Similarly developing the logical and analytical skills and power of reflection, creativity needs a lot of time. Without this Chitti could not have answered deep questions in the AIRD evaluation. But because this is the base of the movie, we do not have any other choice but to ignore this. Neural networks are not garbage in garbage out systems. The output behavior cannot be restricted to a limited range.
Chitti surprising vaseegaran by saying he is his creator and hence god was a very good example of this. The idea that chitti will kill enemies and so was not designed with Asimov's laws inbuilt is probably fine. But the idea that chitti needs feelings to identify enemies from friends seems to be a serious flaw. If not Asimov's laws, it should be some other laws and it definitely does not justify the addition of feelings to chitti. However, I agree that it might not have been interesting if feelings were not added to chitti. But the reasoning should have been better. When Vasee instructed Chitti to rescue people from fire without anybody dying, Chitti was able to accomplish without having any feelings/emotions. Similar thing applies to doing normal delivery of the baby. Vasee just needs to instruct that both the mother and baby should do fine after the delivery. Feelings/Emotions are not required for performing normal delivery.
We can give lame reasons to justify that Chitti requires emotions for this. But there is no strong base. But since people willbe mesmerized by seeing this scene, this illogical thing would not strike their mind. Sana says that it is difficult for humans to forget somebody who is very close to them but is easy for Chitti as it is just a machine. This may not be true. Only the videos stored in RAM like memory can be deleted quickly. What is stored in the neural network does not go away easily. The more something is associated in the neural network, the more time it will take to forget. Forget about Bohra polluting Chitti. Once Vasee added feelings to Chitti, he should have understood that he is now a complete human being or actually much more than that. He is now free to have his own motivations and drives. Vasee cannot force his wishes on a human being who has feelings like how parents cannot force their wishes on their kids. What I would appreciate even after a long time is the introduction of the concept of adding feelings to the machine. Because I believe that we ourselves are machines having feelings.

Why men can't compare two girls seen at different times
Assume that a man sees girl 1 on day 1. Let it generate 100 pleasure molecules in amygdala(emotional part of the brain). We do not have exact measuring instruments in brain to register the number 100.
An approximate image and descriptions of the girl will be stored in, say,
Neuron Group 1(NG1).
On day 2, he sees girl 2. Let it generate 90 pleasure molecules in amygdala. Now the man tries to compare girl 2 with girl 1.
We have NG1 which projects the approximate image of girl 1. Amygdala may generate 80 molecules for the approximate images of girl 1. And we have Neuron Group 2(NG2) which compares the approximate image of girl 1 and the now present image of girl 2.
( Actually NG2 compares the signals generated by Amygdala for approximate images of girl 1 and the now present images of girl 2)
Though, in reality, girl 1 looks more prettier than girl2 for the man, the fact that he could only use the approximate images of girl1 screws up the results of the comparison. Moral of the story: Better to keep the girls side by side when doing the comparison.
( Don' know if this will create other problems) Note: I had seen the Telugu film "Nuvostanante Neodhantana" (which is the original of Tamil remake "Something something") where Siddharth will try to recollect the image of Trisha thrice. He could only get approximate image of Trisha. That made me extend my idea to all men.

I am just a special type of non-living thing
When I was in my final year B.E , I told my friends Sarangan and Chandrasekhar that
a living thing is just a collection of different types of molecules mostly made of Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Oxygen. Nothing more, Nothing less. As expected they did not like the idea. I did not have anybody to discuss about this. I could not find any book talking about this idea. I put the idea to dormancy.
Seven years later, when I read
"Consciousness Explained" ,
Daniel Dennett
had written this - "Only a theory that explained living things in terms of non-living things could explain life at all." I got a lead from this for further continuing on my idea.
I just wanted to see if there is any magic in living things compared to non-living things. I could only find characteristics like reproduction, homeostasis, metabolism etc which can all be explained to a greater extent today by using science. We also now have scientists who are trying to create artificial DNA, artificial life, artificial meat etc.
What is then special about living things compared to non-living things? Wherever I start I could only come to the conclusion that living things are systems which decrease entropy inside them. So that is the only speciality of living things from the physics point of view.
I later found from google searches that our dear
Erwin Schrodinger had already talked about living things decreasing entropy inside them.
It also said that he had written about this in his famous book
"What is life?".
I was only knowing about this book for motivating Watson and Crick in discovering DNA. It is an awesome
31 pages book available here .
I was happy that I had found in 2007 that "I am just a special type of non-living thing obeying the laws of physics like any non-living thing". But Schrodinger had found this out in 1944 :-) So when will this be accepted and taught as a fact?

Wisdom vs Domain specific intelligence
When I read this
Paul Graham's essay
I understood that I was seeking wisdom rather than domain specific intelligence. If I refer to my earlier post named
"Three levels of Consciousness" , I can say that seeking wisdom is in the "third level of consciousness" and seeking "domain specific intelligence" is in "second level of consciousness". In the past 6.5 years I simply could not spend much time in seeking domain specific intelligence. I was completely addicted to reading books from different fields only to understand how exactly this world is working. Which I think has paid off when I finally ended my book reading stride with "Consciousness Explained". I still will read books but the rate of seeking wisdom may not be high. So finally I started applying whatever Ideas I have learnt till now. I will have to see what I end up with in my life :-)

Oneliner for Earth's happenings
The following concepts and facts made me think about what exactly is happening in this earth. 1) Universe might have formed during big bang (
Big bang theory ) 2) Living things are formed from non-living molecules which in turn are formed from basic elements. 3) Living organisms formed and evolved over 4 billions years in earth 4) Our Brain is not a complicated system but is a complex system. So whole is more than the sum of its parts. That extra in the sum is the consciousness. So consciousness is just a side effect of the working of the subsystems of our brain. 6)
Second law of thermodynamics
says that "In a closed system,
a process can occur only if it increases the total entropy of the system " 7) Living organisms are examples for decreasing entropy. (Of course in an open system) 8) Human beings have the capability to decrease entropy due to their own actions which in turn results in our illusion of having "Free will" and "Consciousness". So here is my oneliner for what exactly is happening in our earth. "The Initial state(Boundary condition) of earth happened such a way that some systems called living organisms formed which in turn decreased the entropy in earth and some systems called human beings formed which accelerated the entropy-decreasing process many times"
So none of these things seem purposeful. And of course, why should there be any purpose? Because, we are trained from our childhood to always link cause and effect and hence we are always trying to determine the purposes of all processes in this universe. So if there are no purposes, we need to gather more evidences for that.
I don't really have an idea about how long we will be able to decrease entropy in this specific part of the universe. I expect many technological breakthroughs in the coming years which in turn can be used to understand these things better.

What is brain doing ( Consciousness )
Today many theories exist to describe human consciousness. Some are:
a)
Mind/Brain dualism
b)
Cartesian theatre
c)
Hard problem of consciousness
d)
Multiple drafts theory
e)
The society of mind
( In these theories I do not find any difference between
Daniel Dennett's
"Multiple drafts theory"
and
Marvin Minsky' s "The society of mind" ) In June 2007 I finished reading
"Consciousness explained"
by "Daniel Dennett" and came to know that it could be the last book which would change my life forever. We might take two or three decades to have more strong evidences for the "Multiple drafts theory". Following are the facts I consider as strong points for this theory:- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1) None of the cells in the brain(Neurons) bother about the brain or the body containing the brain.
They just do three things.
a) Energy absorption and Survival.
b) Reproduction(Splitting into daughter cells)
c) Firing/Not firing depending upon inputs. 2) Hardware-wise our brain is just a neural network. 3) Hard-wired part of the brain takes care of the body just after the birth. Later the brain is trained(software) to analyze world more accurately. 4) Brains contain stupid demons who become boss of the body for sometime. 5) Create a virtual captain of the crew, without elevating any one of them to long-term dictatorial power. 6) We generally speak and then recognize what we have spoken. 7) The speaker gets no preview of what he is going to speak. He and his audience learn what the speaker's utterance is at the same time. 8) "You are what you speak", or rather "You are what speaks you" 9) There is no single point in the brain where all information funnels in 10) There is no single place in the brain through which all the causal trains pass through in order to deposit content in consciousness. 11) There was pressure to develop a more endogenous way of solving the meta-problem of what to think about next, pressure to create something on the inside with more of the imagined organizational power of a captain. 12) You don't have any personal familiarity with any direct access to processing happening in a thousand channels at once eventhough what is what is happening in your brain. 13) Only a theory that explained conscious events in terms of unconcious event could explain consciousness at all. Implications of this theory:- ------------------------------ 1)
There is NO SOUL in the brain 2) There is NO SINGLE BOSS in the brain 3) Creates illusion that there is one owner/boss/meaner in the brain.

Three levels of consciousness
I read a useful way of dividing our consciousness into three different levels. The idea is from the book
"Visions"
by
Michio Kaku . First level: -------------
The lowest level of consciousness is the ability of an organism to monitor its body and its environment. By this definition, even a thermostat has some consciousness since it monitors the surrounding temperature. Examples of this level: a) Bacteria going away from higher temperature area or going towards food. b) Humans taking away the hands when accidentally kept on a hot surface. c) Babies moving hands and doing other things when born.
These are mostly hard-wired functions. Second level: ----------------
The second level is the ability to carry out well-definted goals, like survival and reproduction. Higher up on this second level lies the entire animal kingdom. Once the primary goals ( e.g., finding food and mates) are preprogrammed into the animal brain, they determine the complex plans to carry out to fullfil them. Examples: a) Foxes planning how to hunt and capture rabbits. ( Most are hard-wired ) b) Rabbits planning how to avoid foxes. ( Most are hard-wired ) This level is the dominant one for human activity. Most of us do not spend inordinate amounts of time asking philosophical questions about self-awareness and pondering the paradoxes of the meaning of existence. Although we are reluctant to admit it, we spend most of our time thinking about survival and reproduction, much like animals. (Our jobs are mostly for survival) And when we are not thinking about survival and reproduction, we are usually thinking about entertainment and fun. The more sophisticated the goal and subsequently the plans necessary to carry them out, the higher the level of consciousness. In other words, there may be thousands of subcategories of consciousness within this broad level, depending on the complexity of the goal. Third level: --------------
The third and highest level of consciousness is the ability to set one's own goals, whatever that may be. Questions like "Where did the universe come from?", "How is consciousness produced?", "How is life formed from non-living things?" are some which when we think about, we are in this level. We do not spend much time in this level.
I also see that many of the people do not have any goal in their life. Also for many people their goals are set by somebody else and they simply accept it not knowing what they are doing.

What causes worries/pain
I can find only the following three things to be causing worries for anybody in this earth. 1) Wrong goals 2) Unrealistic goals 3) Not working towards realistic goals Examples for Wrong goals: ------------------------------ a) Being rich would satisfy all my needs and wants. b) My team will succeed if all my subordinates in the team do what I assign them to do without pushing back. Examples for Unrealistic goals: ---------------------------------- a) My children who are not disciplined today would be disciplined 10 years later, without any effort from anybody. b) Expecting that manager would always give the work which we like. c) Expecting that best things would always come to me automatically. d) Expecting that we will do our best even when we are tensed up. e) Expecting that if I get good grades I will get the best job in the best company. f) Expecting that others will measure my intelligence 100% accurately. g) Expecting that we would get the best knowledge from our elders and parents because they love us. h) Expecting that others would act exactly the way we want them to do. i) Expecting that everything will work as we expect them to do. Examples for "Not working towards realistic goals": --------------------------------------------------------- a) I will earn lots of money without putting any effort b) I will solve all problems without putting effort to develop knowledge and skills. c) I will develop a theory to explain a phenomena without thinking about it much.
A catch here is that any realistic goal can turn into an unrealistic goal in a second. For example, thinking that I will live for 90 years and achieve certain things can be a realistic goal. It can turn to an unrealistic goal when I come to know that I am affected by CANCER. ( As of now we don't have a cure for this. We might take few more years to find cure for this). But we are generally not prepared to accept the truth that a realistic goal has changed to an unrealistic goal when it has happened.
Similarly unrealistic goals can turn to realistic goals in a second. For example, thinking about satisfying everybody's
electric power needs with zero running cost might be unthinkable today. But tomorrow we might have efficient and cheap solar panels to satisfy everbody's needs. ( This might really become true in another decade. We receive 89000 terawatts of Solar power in earth. As of now the whole earth is using just 15 terawatts of power. And we can only use 1500 terawatts of power without affecting earth's environment )

Amygdala, the feeling part of the brain
Amygdala is the part of the brain where emotions arise. Emotions arise by way of secreting chemicals. For simplicity sake we will assume that only the following emotional states are present. Pain
- We always try to go away from this state. Peace- Might be boring after sometime. So we generally try to find something better than peace/boring state. Pleasure- We generally try to be in this state most of our life. All these states would have different chemicals secreted in
Amygdala
which is a part of the
lymbic system . This is true for all mammals. And this is what is happening for any kid/adult in this whole world(earth). There is nothing like SOUL in the brain to recognize these chemicals. Pain: ------ Caused by some problem in Real World- Following are some 1) Hunger 2) Injury 3) High/low temperature 4) Many other physical problems/sufferings 5) Seeing that our friends/relatives are suffering. Self
Induced Example: 1) Not achieving the set goal. - If achieved, it will lead to pleasure. If not we feel sad. Sadness also causes the pain chemical to be secreted. Pleasure:
( Dopamine??, Endorphins?? ) ----------- So what causes the secretion of chemical for pleasure? following are some. For kids: ----------- playing with toys/friends, listening to stories, new stimulations from outer world and many more. For Adults: -------------- Becoming famous Increasing wealth/money Achievement Solving problems Male,Female loving each other Traveling around the world Understanding how this world works(Really?) And many more All these pleasures would make Amygdala secrete the same chemical. But we dont recognize that it is the same chemical which is secreted for all pleasures. What this implies is that pain and pleasure cause the same action in Amygdala, the feeling part of the brain, but the variables are "THE OUTSIDE WORLD" and "THE THINKING PART OF THE BRAIN". What is "Thinking part of the brain" doing?
Would see that in the subsequent posts...

To better know what we do not know!!
Just a 192 pages book
"A brief history of time"
clearly explains what we understand in this world and what we do not understand and if we might understand in the future.
Now that I know what I do not know, I thought of reading books from experts of other fields to understand the universe more.
Once I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in May 2002 I joined
Novell, Bangalore
for my first job. Then I started reading all kinds of books which interested me.
Strangely enough, not many care about reading books after starting to work. Atleast I have not seen many working people who read books.
For me it was the opposite. I became a voracious reader. There is no pressure to study and get good grades. I did not really bother to spend more time after office hours for growing in the company. So I spent all my spare time in reading all sorts of books which I thought would help me understand this world. Following are some of the books which I read from 2001 till date. 1)
I'm Ok You're ok 2)
Dancing WU Li masters 3)
Brave New world - Aldous Huxley 4)
The Naked Ape - Desmond Morris 5)
A brief history of time - Stephen Hawking 6)
Black holes and baby universes - Stephen Hawking 7)
Getting results- for dummies
8)
Rich Dad, Poor Dad 9)
Staying ok 10)
Goal 11)
Emotional intelligence
- Daniel Goleman 12)
The Bridge across forever
- Richard Bach 13)
The art of thinking 14)
Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance 15) Science of breath 16) Meditation 17)
Fountainhead
- Ayn Rand 18)
Atlas shrugged
- Ayn Rand 19)
Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman 20)
7 habits of highly effective people
- Stephen Covey 21)
Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus 22) Chaos 23) The importance of living 24)
Visions - Michio Kaku 25) Naked Women - Desmond Morris 26)
In search of Schroedinger's cat 27) The God of small things - Arundhathi Roy 28) Prey- Michael Crichton 29) Catch-22 30) Billions and Billions- Carl Sagan 31) Cosmos - Carl Sagan 32) The mind's I - Douglas hofstadter and Daniel Dennett 33)
Consciousness explained - Daniel Dennett 34) Freedom evolves - Daniel Dennett 35) Sweet dreams - Daniel Dennett
And some more books which I don't remember now. And of course, these do not include the software related books. I later realized that the books are from varied fields
like, biology, genetics, Science fiction, Philosophy, Physics, Psychology, Technology, Finance, Yoga and some more fields. And the following are in pipeline :-) 36) Genome 37)
Selfish Gene
- Richard Dawkins 38) What is your dangerous idea 39) Next - Michael Crichton
So what did I understand from these books.
In the subsequent posts, I would describe that. :-)

Book costing Rs. 40/- Changing life forever!!!
I went with my friends to city from the
college
hostel to hang around and enjoy. That was around march 2002. We also went to second hand books sale shop. Everybody bought books of their choice. Sarangan bought "Chicken soup for the surviving soul".
I was thinking about buying
"The God of small things" . Sarangan said it is a good book. I decided to buy it later. I chose the small book -
"A Brief history of time"
and it just costed Rs. 40/- as a second hand sale. When I bought it I just thought that it would be an interesting one. How could I ever have thought that it would change my life forever? Following are some of the things I understood from the book which if one understands would change their life forever. 1) The concept of time has no meaning before the beginning of the universe. 2) An expanding universe does not preclude a creator, but it does place limits on when he might have carried out his job. 3) A theory is just a model of the universe, or a restricted part of it, and a set of rules that relate quantities in the model to observations that we make. 4) A theory must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations. 5) Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis: you can never prove it. No matter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the next time the result will not contradict the theory. 6) You can disprove a theory by finding even a single observation that disagress with the predictions of the theory. 7) Today we still yearn to know why we are here and where we came from. 8) Our goal is nothing less than a complete description of the universe we live in. 9)
Heisenberg's uncertainty principl e
means that "one certainly cannot predict future events exactly if one cannot even measure the present state of the universe precisely". 10) Anthropic principle says that "We see the universe the way it is because we exist" 11) Matter in the universe is made out of positive energy. Gravitational field has negative energy. So we can show that this negative gravitational energy exactly cancels the positive energy represented by the matter. So the total energy of the universe is zero. 12) It is said that there's no such thing as free lunch. But the universe is the ultimate free lunch. 13) We cannot even solve exactly for the motion of three bodies in Newton's theory of gravity. 14) We find ourselves in a bewildering world. We want to make sense of what we see around us and ask what is the nature of the universe? What is our place in it and where did it and we come from? Why is it the way it is? 15) Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing? Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?

Books!! Books!! Books!!
I was not exposed to any great books till I was in school. That probably was because none of my school friends or relatives or neighbours talked about reading any books. Not even novels. Apart from school books I just read Tamil(My mother tongue) novels. When I entered college, I found most of my colleagues reading books. Mostly novels. All kind of novels. I also read some novels. But I could not spend much time for the first 3 years, as I wanted to get a good job. The next day after getting my job, my book reading spree started. I literally got addicted to reading books. The first book I read was
"I'm OK You're OK".
This book was really good. It helped me understand that brain is not a single undivisible entity. "Thinking part of brain" is different and "feelings part of brain" is different. I was able to see this easily in me and in others. I was able to apply this easily. Then
"Dancing Wu Li Masters". This was also good. I learnt that
"Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle"
paves the way for a probablistic world rather than deterministic world. I thought that uncertain events happen in brain which cause us to have free will. (I later found that uncertain events do not happen in brain and is not the cause for free will). And some more books. I generally took more time to read books , except for novels. Each book took me a month almost. This is because I wanted to understand things and extract value out of it. Then came the next important "Turning point" in my life. That is the first book which really changed my life forever. About that in the next post. :-)

What then if God is not there
We can't prove that God is not there. But then we can also not prove the presence of the God. I dont want to wait for either of these to be proved.
But there is one logic which helped me in deciding that "God is not there". If the so called Omnipotent God is there with all possible powers in the universe, then atleast some responsibilities can be delegated to God. But if he is not there, we should be responsible for everything. Even if God is there, he is not going to kill us for assuming more responsibilities.
Now that God is not there, where did this universe(/multiverse) come from?
Who are we?
Where did we all originate from? ? What are we doing here? Where are we headed towards? Why did this universe get created? Why did we get created?
I could not
spend
my time
in searching for the answers for any of these questions
for the next four years. I spent 1998 for standard 12. Then got into a , pretty much good, engineering college called NIT Trichy, India (previously REC Trichy) for doing my Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Many of we Indians are under pressure to get a decent p aying job. So I spent the first three years of my undergraduation in studying and getting good grades and YES, I did get an offer on 16th July 2001 from
Novell Software Devlopment India Private limited
Then suddenly I felt free. I was free to do whatever I wanted during my free time. And I had a lot of free time. The stories of what I did in that free time would follow in subsequent posts :-)

Knowing that God is not there
Until March 1st 1997, when I was just 16 years old, I was a normal kid going to school and doing what would please my parents and others.
I had all the normal beliefs about life and earth and universe or atleast that is what I was thinking. That is when my biology master told me the truth. Within a few moments it struck me that, YES GOD IS NOT THERE!!!
Anywhere in this universe there is no such thing called GOD.
Everything fell into place automatically. All propositions supporting this fact started to fall in place in my brain.
That was the first turning point in my life. I started to diverge from the normal life which I might have led if I had not come to know about the fact that "THE SO
CALLED OMNIPOTENT GOD IS NOT THERE AT ALL IN THIS UNIVERSE (OR MULTIVERSE IF THERE IS ONE)."
