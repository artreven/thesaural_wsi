What situations might cause a sufferer to experience Anxiety?
Anxiety symptoms
can be constant or minimal most of the time, with peaks at times of stress or
high anxiety . Generalized Anxiety Disorder causes most sufferers to experience constant
anxiety
symptoms.
Anxiety sufferers
with panic disorder experience huge peaks in
anxiety
which causes a
panic attack
to ensue.
Most sufferers develop an
anxiety condition
which sits somewhere in the middle of the 'anxiety spectrum.' They experience regular
panic attacks ,
obsessive thoughts
and constant feelings of high
anxiety . Insomnia, strange thoughts and obsessions are all features of high
anxiety .
There seems to be no set pattern to the experiences of the 'average' sufferer - everyone reacts differently. Some sufferers do however find that their
anxiety
is worst when geographically removed from a location or person who would normally offer safety or comfort. Agoraphobia then develops as a result of finding a 'comfort zone.'
For some people, the company of a trusted person is required, sometimes constantly. Others find it impossible to leave the house or even a room in which they feel safe. Some
Anxiety sufferers
with acute agoraphobia won't leave these places for years, sometimes even decades.
Why do sufferers feel anxious all the time?
High anxiety
is created by a small organ in the subconscious part of the brain. This organ, called the
Amygdala , acts like an anxiety 'thermostat', regulating the bodies
anxiety
levels.
Under normal circumstances, the
Amygdala
effectively
controls the
anxiety
levels in order to protect us from danger, however, because the brain is an 'information sponge', constantly learning and updating our mental 'software', the
Amygdala
becomes susceptible to being re-programmed to function abnormally.
Anxiety
reactions are complex; they set off a string of chemical events in the body which produce all of the
symptoms of anxiety
which we associate with our
anxiety disorders .
As we modify our behaviour as a result of experiencing the unpleasant and apparently detrimental effects of an
anxiety
reaction, the
Amygdala
'learns' that our
anxiety
response has become adjusted and each and every time we experience
high anxiety . This new
anxiety
level becomes
instinctual
- the subconscious mind adopts it as the
new
'normal operating level.'
The new
anxiety
level has been
learned
by you. This process is called
Operant Conditioning
and is responsible for everything we learn to do.
Because we
consciously
fear the
anxiety
we experience, our
anxiety
levels rise, as they rise we produce more
anxiety symptoms . As we produce more symptoms, we become more
fearful , the cycle persists and it becomes very hard to break -
unless , you know how to break the
anxiety
cycle,
eliminate the anxiety
and return the
Amygdala
to normal function.
It
can
be done!
