Amygdala, the feeling part of the brain
Amygdala is the part of the brain where emotions arise. Emotions arise by way of secreting chemicals. For simplicity sake we will assume that only the following emotional states are present. Pain
- We always try to go away from this state. Peace- Might be boring after sometime. So we generally try to find something better than peace/boring state. Pleasure- We generally try to be in this state most of our life. All these states would have different chemicals secreted in
Amygdala
which is a part of the
lymbic system . This is true for all mammals. And this is what is happening for any kid/adult in this whole world(earth). There is nothing like SOUL in the brain to recognize these chemicals. Pain: ------ Caused by some problem in Real World- Following are some 1) Hunger 2) Injury 3) High/low temperature 4) Many other physical problems/sufferings 5) Seeing that our friends/relatives are suffering. Self
Induced Example: 1) Not achieving the set goal. - If achieved, it will lead to pleasure. If not we feel sad. Sadness also causes the pain chemical to be secreted. Pleasure:
( Dopamine??, Endorphins?? ) ----------- So what causes the secretion of chemical for pleasure? following are some. For kids: ----------- playing with toys/friends, listening to stories, new stimulations from outer world and many more. For Adults: -------------- Becoming famous Increasing wealth/money Achievement Solving problems Male,Female loving each other Traveling around the world Understanding how this world works(Really?) And many more All these pleasures would make Amygdala secrete the same chemical. But we dont recognize that it is the same chemical which is secreted for all pleasures. What this implies is that pain and pleasure cause the same action in Amygdala, the feeling part of the brain, but the variables are "THE OUTSIDE WORLD" and "THE THINKING PART OF THE BRAIN". What is "Thinking part of the brain" doing?
Would see that in the subsequent posts...
