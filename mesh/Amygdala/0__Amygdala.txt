Website relaunch
Capt. Axon
I heart brains the site is becoming a reality.
The site is usable at
homebase.iheartbrains.org
one day I will work out how to have it run at a clearer address. If you wish for a iheartbrains.org email address contact me at tony.harley(at)iheartbrains.org and I will make it so. It will also appear less rough in the coming days as I get to grips with the template. Any feedback is super welcome.
So come and enjoy the adventures of Captain Axon and Princess Dendrite as they sail the good ship
Amygdala
across the oceans of Cortexia and I can set you up as a user.
In other news. My good friend Ben White has published the first of his Clover Island novels.
Miya Black: Pirate Princess
is the tale of a frustrated daughter of the kings and queen of Clover Island (former pirate and princess respectively) who dreams of adventure on the high seas. Needless to say adventure and excitement find her.... Have a read for gratis and if you like it contact myself or Ben and we can make arrangements for distribution of the high quality paper-back edition. Here are the opening paragraphs.......
"Miya Black was thirteen years old and annoyed.
She was thirteen
years old because her fourteenth birthday wasn’t for another couple of
days.
She was annoyed because her upcoming birthday celebration was
going to include a formal dance.
“Mum, I hate that kind of thing.
You know I hate that kind of thing.
Don’t you pay any attention to my loves and hates at all?”
Miya’s mother was Lilith ‘Lily’ Black, queen of Clover Island and
ex-princess.
She had long black hair and dark eyes, and was often
remembered by people as being tall, although in fact she was of slightly
below-average height.
“Come on, Miya,” she said.
“You like dancing.
Everyone likes
dancing!
Who doesn’t like dancing?
Name me one person that doesn’t
like dancing.”
“Peggles, down at the docks,” Miya’s father put in.
Her father was
Tomas ‘Boots’ Black, king of Clover Island and ex-pirate.
He had short,
wavy brown hair and deep hazel eyes, and a kind of relaxed air about
him that extended from the way he sat to the way he smiled.
“He’s got
two wooden legs, I’m sure he wouldn’t enjoy dancing.”"

Jo and Prof. Fraser see Christchurch's new PET/CT scanner
I asked the professor in charge of nuclear medicine if this was going to be availiable with ligands over than deoxyglucose. The answer was a firm No. Hopefully neuroresearch will get a bit of this beast sooner rather than later.

Smarter hamsters
John Rosenburg from
Goats.com
fame has established his new web comic, Scenes From A Multiverse. So, so, good.
The science-master featured in the cartoon is striving to boost Hamster intellegence. It has been a while since I looked into the current literature on Sooped up super smart rodents. So I had a wee look see.
In 2000 one of the earlier strains of transgenic knock-in mice was announced. These animals expressed extra neurotransmitter receptors in the the hippocampal brain region. This receptor, the NMDA subunit is special in that it is only activated glutamate in situations where the cell is already stimulated and when I does open a soup of high Calcium fluid enters. Calcium influx from this is the "go-switch" for making permanent new connections. Turns out these mice were twice as good at learning tasks than their litter mates. They were media darlings and were called
"Doogie mice" .  This advantage is maintained over the entire lifespan (about 400 days).
At the end of last year a new contender stepped up Hobbie-J. This is one of the latest and greatest strains of transgenic rats (much harder to engineer rats than mice). Hobbie-J rats also overexpress NMDA receptors and are also super smart.
While these rodents are engineered nerds their is also a strain of engineered jocks.

This video is fantastic, they are strong, fitter, faster and live longer. They are also more aggressive.
These models have resulted in developments toward the treatment of dementia and sarcopenia (the progressive loss of muscle bulk which occurs in older people) and are not a mere curiosity.
Go Rodents!

High-Powered Air Guns. No good reason.
Just look at this weapon. All the factors to make a gun nut cream himself. A pistol gripped, bi-poded, noise suppressed,  scoped, single action sniper rifle. Described by the merchant as
" The
Gunpower
Storm. A high-performance take-down hunting rifle which also serves as an accurate target shooting gun" .  Its all yours from
www. guncity .co. nz
for $1,999.00 including GST plus postage and packaging. No licence needed. Just flash your id and this killer is yours. This is an example of the high-powered air rifles that have received coverage due to the two recent homocides of the
Don Wilkinson and Keith Kahi .
As you can see these are definitely not your average bb gun for shooting cans. I have commented on
Gun-City before . This store, based in suburban Christchurch prides itself on being "New Zealand's Largest Gun Dealer". They import and sell by mail-order restricted military style semi-automatics to holders of endorsed licences, this I have only a little beef with, if a gun nut is willing to undergo the police vetting and individual registration required for the endorsement they are likely to be collectors who will use and store them safely. My BIG beef with them is their sale of military style weapons that have been modified just enough to be sold to persons with a standard licence (over 16, no police record) and are not required to be registered with the police. The weapons,
like this modern AK-47 below , are from the factories as their military cousins, they have a shorter magazine and the pistol-grip (not removed as you can see) is incorporated into the stock those are the only modifications. Do you really want kids marching through high-schools with one of these? There is no good reason for owning these, if you want to hunt deer, buy a hunting rifle.
Criminal's will use what they can get. Hence the use of the
traditional kiwi
sawn -off .22
for pub, dairy and bank robberies.  These high-powered pre-charged air-rifles are just the next step up and look a hell of a lot more dangerous than, and are, a 50 year old rabbit gun stolen from a farm-house. The next level of escalation will be to these unregistered assault weapons.
The last time our gun laws were revised was post-Aramoana. I hope this week's two tragic episodes, the death of
Keith
Kahi
in Auckland, the Christchurch slaying of
Gage the police dog , will bring to gun-control to the forefront of political debate and the need to make changes to the availability of all firearms to the public. My big wish is for the sale of assault style weapons to be banned before too many are out and about in our communities. And prevent another Aramoana or heaven forbid
a Columbine .  I wonder if the folk at Gun-City ever listen to the Mutton Birds song ,
a thing well made ,
t his tells the story of a Christchurch gun dealer going about his work in the early 1990's. The collector down the line was
D.M. Gray and this is his AK-47 .
it's Wednesday so I do the mail orders there's nothing much some oilskins and a 303 for a hunter over in Westland and oh yeah one of those AK-47s for some collector down the line
- A thing well made:
Don McGlashen
Peace,
Tony.
