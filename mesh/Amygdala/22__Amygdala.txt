Go to a klinik kesihatan / polyclinic (government), tell the medical officer your problem, that u've had ur bloods checked and its normal. Ask for a referral letter specifically to the psychiatry clinic. Go back to a local hospital (one with a psychiatry unit and psychiatrist), give the letter to the psychiatry clinic staff and u'll get ur appointment. Good luck

I suppose what u did at kota tinggi was u walk-in to the emergency department. If the doc is junior and dunno whats' going on with u (or dunno where to refer u to), they will probably do some basic blood test and discharge u with 'reassurance'. So if u think the 'treatment' is sub-par and ur prob is genuine, do like i said previously. Go to the psychiatry clinic via the method i mentioned. U may think seeing a psychiatrist is an 'overkill' or a taboo but anxiety does fall under psychiatry disorders and they have specific drugs to help. Good luck
p/s: Other alternatives will be the private hospitals.

Doctors are humans too, they make mistakes too.

Anxiety is due to being worried. Its something that has to do with your mind. I've gone through this. All you have to know is.. nothing is happening to you. You need people to talk to

Yeap. Like all the times, started from you woke up in the morning, till you fell asleep,
Heart pumping fast, pain all over the body, shortness of breath, anxious, scared, you name it. Its a mental illness that are very physical. Its hard really to work, some of us even scared to go out side. Added on March 13, 2011, 5:13 am QUOTE(samowong @ Mar 12 2011, 07:17 AM) So, what treatment did u receive? no treatment, they just gave me painkillers for the pain, nothing for the anxiety.

I know how it feels, it is really a pain in the ass, especially when people close to you.. umm how to say it.. act like they dont care? like they say "ala its only your mind playing tricks on you" "ala kau buat rilek sudah" Whenever i found a place to go, i will tell you. But i suggest you to go to HUKM, just yesterday i found out i have a friend that is an anxiety disorder sufferer like us. She did get a treatment there, but she say we need to have a letter from a local hospital/clinic, so we can have treatment there. Now they put her on clonazepam (Klonopin), and shes started to feel less anxious, she said.
Better days ahead

' I suspect that I have anxiety disorder too. Who are you seeing currently? Anyone else with anxiety disorder? Anyone who has successfully recovered?
Below are some recommendations I found at Cari forum, he/she was seeing both: Psychiatrist - Dr Aw Tui Iar
Psychologist - Ms Leong Huey Mei, Hospital Pantai Indah Please share your views and comments on them if you have previously consulted them.
Please also share any other good recommendations especially if you or someone you know have had good results with the doctor.
I would be happy to visit both government and private clinics, as long as the doctor is good or 1 of the best, as I am quite worried with my condition and I do not know any contacts, and I am also concern with what I read on some websites that psychiatry is not very advanced in Malaysia.

I'm on anxiety meds now! Im on Alpazolam. Went to hospital Ampang, met Doctor Lim, he's a great doctor. Im recovering, but i still clinging on too much of the pills,
One day i left the pills at home when working, at first it was okay, then i suddenly realized i let those pills at home, fuahh! PANIC ATTACKS!

Thanx for ur recommendation, I m thinking of seeing a GP soon.
Can you share with us your journey to recovery? Coz I have not heard of anyone I know who had it before. How do they diagnose you with anxiety disorder? Do u see a GP 1st, then do blood test or ECG test before seeing a psychiatrist?
How is it treated? The psychiatrist juz prescribe u with meds? U mentioned earlier that u went to General Hospital, KL n she only gave u pain killers, so u switch to Doctor Lim at Ampang hospital after that? Is he giving u therapy apart from Alpazolam? Is ur condition caused by stress? Coz I m afraid that the doc will only give me meds to cure the symptoms but not the underlying cause. This post has been edited by

Well here's the thing. Theres a fine line between "normal" anxiety and "disordered" anxiety. Normal anxiety is when you feels anxious,scared,worried when theres a situation (life or death situation, interviews, surprised, you know that kinda situations) Anxiety disorder is when you feels anxious without facing those situations. (like for me i felt anxious like for 24/7) But panic attacks has it triggers. For example you get panic attack when at crowded places, you started to feel SUPER ANXIOUS, cant breath well,you have chest pain and discomfort, you feel faintish.

perhaps?

You can visit the link below to read more about anxiety disorder: http://www.psychiatry-malaysia.org/listcat.php?cid=6&all=N They have a "Quick Mood Checklist for Anxiety Disorder": http://www.psychiatry-malaysia.org/article.php?aid=1470 If you think there is something wrong, I think the best thing to do is to visit ur GP for diagnosis, although it may be difficult to take the first step. I wasn't aware about this disorder until I read about it in The Star years ago.

Are you anxious in social situations? Such as when walking in crowds or when talking to a stranger? I often blush abnormally and heart race in social situations and recently I started to participate in a program at my campus conducted by clinical psychology students. It like a.. counseling/therapy done in private. So far..not yet working haha.

Go see a psychologist for treatment of panic disorder and/or anxiety disorder. They are cheap I think.
If you see a medical practitioner specialised in psychiatry then it would be much more costly.

Its easy for you to say "live a more dont-give-a-lifestyle" when you have nothing bothering you. Anxiety disorder really is a painful and scary illness. You know what, people like you is the one who bringing ppl with anxiety disorder down. If you say this to a Anxiety Disorder like me, this will totally breaks the patient's mental and spirits down.
But i've met a lot of ppl like you,and surprisingly
even my bestfriends have this kinda mind set. Easier said than done.
But it's okay im strong now
HAHAHA Added on June 4, 2011, 11:15 pm QUOTE(Angela Lee @ May 17 2011, 04:27 PM) Definitely go seeing a psychologist first before seeing a psychiatrist I agreed. You should check all the physical symptoms first. Let them exam you. If they say you have anxiety disorder, then you go see a psychiatrist. From my experience, i've gone through so much. I went to see them doctors more then a dozen time. First they'll say its nothing, it is just gastric or fatigue. Then i came again said it getting worst, so they tested my blood. I had 3 different blood test if im not mistaken, the normal blood test, the sugar and cholesterol blood test, and the thyroid blood test. I've done so much ECG's, X-rays, all normal. THEN they suspected me of having Anxiety Disorder. After that i was referred to a psychiatrist. The first appointment was a long one, its like a job interview sorta. LOL. So the result are, i have BOTH anxiety and panic disorder.
My advice is,
1. BE STRONG! dont let words brings you down. 2. SEEK SOMEONE TO TALK. This really helps, in times when anxiety strikes. *i have to thank my friend Debra for this*
3. DO NOT GOOGLE ANYTHING CONCERNING YOUR HEALTH. IT IS A BADDDD MOVE
. I LEARNT IT THE HARD WAY. TRUST ME, DONT EVER GOOGLE. IT'LL WORSEN YOUR NEGATIVE THOUGHTS.
4. SEEK MEDICAL HELP QUICK. BOTH PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY. This post has been edited by

You should all consider drug free methods such as Linden Method, IMO their methods dwell deeply into the
mechanism of Anxiety Disorder and offer one of the best solution so far I can find to overcome it.

On the contrary, you should avoid that, support group will actually backfired, you should avoid talking about your anxiety experience at all cost, maybe a few times to your close friends or family members but not after that, because anxiety thoughts are learned bad habits, it's harmless, worst case you will have panick attack but that is also harmless because it's a normal physical reaction of fear & adrenaline rush for fight-or-flight response
to nonexistent danger , if you keep talking about it & be reminded about it constantly, your anxiety thoughts will become persistent & hard to shake off over time. What you should do however is try to fill up your free times with positive activities such as sports, singing, listen to music, chitchat with friends (anything but anxiety stuff), hobbies etc, this will avoid your idling mind to wander into negative thoughts, when you practice these new habits constantly, you will unlearned your bad habits in no time.
Be happy & No worry.

Hmm well for me, talking about my problems helps as it keeps me aware and motivate me to deal with the problem. But I guess different people have different ways of dealing with problems

In the beginning it's perfectly ok to research your condition, seeking answers/infos/reasons to your condition & sharing your condition with your friends and family. Once you have understood your condition, you will know that you're not alone in this condition, you're just having unpleasant thoughts & feelings which are harmless, with these knowledge you will have less fear & more prepared to deal with it.
To deal with it you may endure it if it's minor, but if your condition started to hamper your day-to-day life, you must then eliminate it by all means, anxiety elimination is a difficult & long journey, drug therapy is often the shortcut but it comes with side effects & short term relief, furthermore dosage will be increased for recurrences that often lead to addiction.
When you're ready to
eliminate
your anxiety (drug free), your next step is to stop all your previous action of "research your condition, seeking answers/infos/reasons to your condition & sharing your condition with your friends and family" because by now you should have your answers already, the rest will be same as my previous post: QUOTE ...because anxiety thoughts are learned bad habits, it's harmless, worst case you will have panick attack but that is also harmless because it's a normal physical reaction of fear & adrenaline rush for fight-or-flight response to nonexistent danger, if you keep talking about it & be reminded about it constantly, your anxiety thoughts will become persistent & hard to shake off over time.

anyways, i have felt terrible discomfort in my heart when i experience anxiety. But I don't experience it a lot. If you want, you can try to see a psychiatrist to see if its really anxiety disorder in a govt hospital or something as it's cheaper.
sounds like you may have paranoia.......but dont' worry, it is treatable my friend. you just need professional advice and some support.

Âť anxiety about being with others Depression and Anxiety Historically, anxiety and depression have been strongly linked. But are they related? That depends on the answer to one question! The question is: What came first, the anxiety or the depression symptoms? If your answer is that depression came before the anxiety, then chances are that you are suffering from true clinical depression. If you answer that your anxiety came before the depression, chances are you have anxiety-related depression and that's a completely different and very treatable condition. Anxiety causes mood changes which mimic true depression! There is a big difference between anxiety caused by depression and depression caused by anxiety. Clinical depression is a chemical mood disorder caused by changes in the chemicals in your body and brain that regulate 'mood'. This chemical imbalance causes a wide range of disturbing thoughts and anxiety symptoms and is generally treated using drugs, psychology, psychiatry and some more invasive procedures. Anxiety is a behavioral condition caused by the habit of 'Fear Cycle' or repetitive anxious thoughts. We feel frightened, we experience symptoms, these frighten us, our anxiety goes up... and the cycle continues. Stress, phobias and anxiety can cause 'depression like' symptoms but rarely true clinical depression. Anxiety is also generally treated using drugs, psychology and psychiatry which are good for treating and managing it, but not for curing it. Anxiety Disorder - Is it a physical or mental illness? In short, no, anxiety disorder is neither a physical nor mental illness! The word disorder suggests illness, please be assured that you are not ill. Anxiety is a behavioral condition regardless of how it makes you feel. Anxiety is a natural response to fear and, like other bodily systems that can falter, causing things like indigestion, palpitations or sensitive eyes for example, the anxiety response can become disrupted too. But, this isn't mental or physical illness... it's a temporary disruption which can be 'reset' very quickly indeed. Anxiety disorder is the condition caused when stress or constant anxiety provoking situations cause the mind to become reset at a higher than normal benchmark anxiety level. Anxiety disorder is most noticeable by the vast range of unpleasant sensations and thoughts it creates... unpleasant but harmless! Creation of an anxiety disorder can happen quickly and is usually the result of an event such as work stress, bereavement, divorce or other anxiety-provoking situations. When anxiety levels become raised due to such stressors, the mind can make a decision to re-set at this new level of anxiety; when this happens an anxiety disorder is formed. Anxiety causes a wide range of both physical and psychological symptoms, all directly caused by the anxiety reaction, all harmless, BUT all also feeling much worse than they actually are! They are the sensation of FEAR... BUT, they are NOT true fear! Anxiety Conditions (Disorder) - what are they? There are five main 'anxiety disorders', these are: 1.
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) » Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... « QUOTE GAD A sophisticated combination of negative, anxious emotions, which includes fear, worrying and fear of consequences. Anxiety is often accompanied by physical symptoms or sensations like a racing heart, breathlessness, nausea, chest pains and sweating for example. GAD is much more intense than normal anxiety levels which make be experienced day to day. GAD is overwhelming and can dominate one's day with inappropriate and exaggerated worries and tension, even even when there is nothing present to worry about. Having GAD means that the sufferer is always anticipating a negative outcome to everything they confront, sufferers often worry inappropriately about health, finances, relationships or their career. The normal reaction to anxiety is to retreat or withdraw from 'normal' activities, this reinforces to the anxious mind that it is OK for our anxiety to dictate to us and for us to modify our enjoyment of life to accommodate it... this is not acceptable. GAD is an anxiety disorder because, as already stated, without an underlying anxiety disorder, GAD cannot be present. GAD sufferers have inappropriate and sometimes scary disturbing thoughts, sometimes violent or sexual in nature - these may sometimes involve people with whom they would never partake in such acts, even members of their own family. On occasion, simply the thought of getting through the day provokes anxiety as soon as the sufferer wakes. Because adrenaline levels are artificially raised through stressors, which ultimately leads to a resetting of our baseline anxiety level, we can experience general or generalized anxiety. This means that the body is functioning at a much higher level of anxiety, causing a whole list of anxious feelings, emotions and sensations. What are the symptoms of GAD? GAD sufferers seem unable to eliminate or ignore their concerns, even though they usually realize that their anxiety is more intense than the situation warrants. The anxiety they experience is usually accompanied by physical anxiety symptoms such as headaches, tension, tiredness, aching muscles, difficulty swallowing, shaking, twitches, mood swings, sweats, and hot and cold flushes. GAD sufferers may often feel light-headed or out of breath. They may also feel nauseated or have to go to the bathroom frequently. Generalized anxiety is constant and can cause anxiety / panic attacks during the day and night. Night time anxiety and panic attacks are especially disturbing and can often wake the sufferer from deep sleep feeling particularly frightened. Night time anxiety can be minimized with some practical steps which minimize the impact of such things as blood sugar level fluctuations during sleep. Individuals with GAD seem unable to relax, and they may startle more easily than other people. They tend to have difficulty concentrating and often, they have trouble falling or staying asleep. The sort of symptoms you can experience in generalized anxiety are generally milder than those experienced during an anxiety / panic attack. Although distressing, they are usually much less extreme. Your stomach may churn, your heart races or beats slower or you may get palpitations you may also feel sweaty or clammy, dizzy or shaky and general unrest. You may just feel as if you have the Flu with shaky or weak legs and clamminess. You might get disturbing thoughts or feel depressed, this is perfectly normal and will pass, it is purely a response to anxiety and must not be mistaken for depression. Remember, these thoughts and feelings are harmless but unpleasant none the less. This doesn't mean you should rush to your doctor to get anxiety medication - in fact, quite the contrary! Anxiety is often misdiagnosed as depression by physicians, who's 'knee jerk' reaction is to reach for the prescription pad, not only is this premature but wholly inappropriate treatment for an anxiety condition. Anxiety isn't caused by a mental or physical illness and certainly not by a chemical imbalance which requires medicinal 'correction'... anxiety disorder is a behavioral condition and can not be eliminated by adding chemicals to the blood stream. GAD affects about 4 million adult Americans and about twice as many women as men. Anxiety disorder comes on gradually and can begin across the life-cycle, though the risk is highest between childhood and middle age. It is typically diagnosed when someone spends at least 6 months worrying excessively about a number of everyday problems. 2.
Panic disorder » Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... « Panic disorder is one of the so-called anxiety disorders and is the result of an increased level of anxiety which is caused by a change in the way a small organ called the Amygdala, in the brain, responds to anxiety-provoking thoughts or situations. When this process becomes disrupted, the sufferer develops feelings of anxiety which may escalate into panic attacks or Panic disorder. Panic Disorder has such diverse and sometimes extreme symptoms. BUT, this is caused by the same internal mechanism in every single sufferer. The brain thinks it is behaving normally as it has become re-set at a higher than normal level of anxiety due to a catalyst of some sort; the catalyst is unimportant actually, what is important, however, is that an internal switch, which activates the anxiety response in the brain has been 'adjusted' to a higher level of anxiety and it is this that causes and perpetuates the Panic Disorder. The term disorder is a misnomer, it suggests illness and anxiety isn't an illness, it's a natural device that can become disturbed. Panic Disorder affects about 5 million adults in the US and the UK and is twice as common in women as in men. It most often begins during late adolescence or early adulthood. Not everyone who experiences panic attacks will develop panic disorder - for example, many people have one attack but never have another. For those who do have Panic Disorder, though, it's important to seek treatment. Untreated, the disorder can become very disabling indeed. Many people with Panic Disorder visit the hospital emergency room repeatedly or see a number of doctors before they obtain a correct diagnosis and may go for years without learning that they have a real, treatable condition. Regardless of how the anxiety affects you mentally or physically, the very same internal mechanism is responsible, so the curative process is the same in every case regardless of age, race or gender. To eliminate Panic Disorder permanently, this mechanism must be addressed and corrected. Panic Disorder Symptoms People with panic disorder have feelings of terror that strike suddenly and repeatedly with no warning. They can't predict when an attack will occur, and many develop intense anxiety between episodes, worrying when and where the next one will strike. If you are having a panic attack, you may have Panic Disorder. Most likely your heart will pound and you may feel sweaty, weak, faint, or dizzy. Your hands may tingle or feel numb, and you might feel flushed or chilled. You may have nausea, chest pain or smothering sensations, a sense of unreality, or fear of impending doom or loss of control. You may genuinely believe you're having a heart attack or losing your mind, or even on the verge of death. Panic attacks can occur at any time, even during sleep. An attack generally peaks within 10 minutes, but some symptoms may last much longer. Panic Disorder and Phobias Panic Disorder may lead to a pattern of avoidance of places or situations where panic attacks have occurred. For example, if a panic attack strikes while you're riding in an elevator, you may develop a phobia (fear) of elevators. If you start avoiding them, that could affect your choice of a job or apartment and greatly restrict other areas of your life. Some people's lives become so restricted that they avoid normal, everyday activities such as grocery shopping or driving. In some cases they become completely housebound. Or, they may be able to confront a feared situation only if accompanied by a spouse or other trusted person. Sufferers avoid any situation in which they would feel helpless if a panic attack were to occur. When people's lives become so restricted, as happens in about one-third of people with panic disorder, the condition is called Agoraphobia. Early treatment can often prevent agoraphobia. Panic Disorder Treatment Panic Disorder is one of the most treatable of all the anxiety disorders, responding in most cases to carefully targeted anxiety management programs. Panic Disorder Medication Does a panic disorder medication exist? In a nutshell, NO! There is no such thing as a therapeutic panic disorder medication which can offer a cure. Panic disorder is a behavioral condition and there exists no medication which can erase memory and behavior in a targeted way in order to eliminate panic disorder directly. Many medications are prescribed for use with panic disorder, but these are sedatives and antidepressants and have not been developed for the targeted treatment of panic disorder. 3.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) » Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... « Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder symptom, NOT a stand-alone condition. Why? Because OCD never exists without an underlying anxiety disorder; take away your inappropriate anxiety and your obsessions will simply fade away. OCD is fueled by anxiety-driven 'what if' or 'catastrophic' thought processes which are stored like habit in the brain. If you have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), you may be plagued by persistent, unwelcome thoughts or images, or by the urgent need to engage in certain rituals in order to stave off anxiety. These Obsessive Compulsive Disorder rituals can be very fast to carry out, such as checking light switches or making sure you have turned off the stove, but many require large quantities of time and concentration. As a sufferer of OCD: Âť You may be obsessed with germs or dirt, washing your hands, clothes, home or furniture repeatedly
Âť You may be filled with doubt and feel the need to check things many times over
Âť You may have frequent thoughts of violence, and fear that you will harm people close to you
Âť You may spend long periods touching things or counting
Âť You may be pre-occupied by order or symmetry
Âť you may have persistent thoughts of performing sexual acts that are repugnant to you
Âť You may be troubled by thoughts that oppose your religious beliefs
The disturbing thoughts or images are called
obsessions , and the rituals that are performed to try to prevent or get rid of them are called
compulsions . If the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder sufferer does not carry out the ritual that their subconscious mind wishes them to, the anxiety level can become overwhelming. Panic attacks and all of the associated anxiety symptoms, thoughts and sensations can ensue - and it is this which forces the sufferer to become a slave to their compulsions and rituals in order to prevent an anxiety reaction. Even non-anxious people recognize some of the symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. 'Checking' behavior is common in non-sufferers, but when this behavior becomes obsessive, the OCD sufferer can spend much of their day checking the gas, the light switches or the locks. Some OCD sufferers spend much of their day carrying out the rituals they have developed which can be very intrusive and destructive for both themselves and family members. Most OCD sufferers realize that what they do makes no real sense, but the fear of the consequences of NOT doing it forces them to continue. There are many OCD sufferers who are so entrenched in their behaviors and routines that they seem oblivious to the fact that what they do is not what one would call 'normal' behavior. Who suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)? Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) affects over 4 million Americans and this figure is echoed across the world. OCD affects men and women equally and normally develops in younger people and children first. Approximately 1/3 of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder sufferers first experienced their symptoms as a child. People with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder tend to avoid situations where there may be a chance of confronting their fears or obsessions. Avoidance techniques support the anxious behavior and often phobias accompany the OCD behavior, such as agoraphobia or social phobia. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) sufferers find it very difficult to maintain healthy relationships or to hold down a job because of the intrusive and very visual nature of their conditions - often employers will find the visible symptoms difficult to work with and careers can be severely affected. What is 'Pure O'? Pure O is the obsessive thoughts experienced in obsessive compulsive disorder but without any resultant compulsion to carry out any specific actions such as hand washing, ordering or word repetition. Pure O can often center around obsessive thoughts of a sexual or aggressive nature. Can Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) be cured? In a word... yes! Most definitely and most permanently. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an Anxiety Disorder symptom, and can, therefore, be eliminated by addressing the subconscious reaction which causes and perpetuates the anxiety which fuels it. This sounds difficult, but it isn't. There is an internal 'anxiety switch' which is activated by anxious stimuli and it is by controlling and altering this reaction that OCD and the anxiety that fuels it can be permanently eliminated, very quickly and very permanently. In other words if you remove the anxiety which fuels OCD, the obsessions and compulsions fade away quickly. 4.
Phobias » Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... « Phobias can be described as a constant, overwhelming and disabling fear of exposure to specific objects, activities or situations, which represent little or no actual danger to the sufferer. Avoidance of exposure to these things then causes the sufferer to limit their daily activities unnecessarily. There are number of different types of phobias. In anxiety disorders specific phobias are experienced, however, more prevalently, agoraphobia, social phobia, medical and dental phobias and obsessive thoughts concerning health play a much more important role. These phobic reactions are important because the are key to eliminating your anxiety disorder completely. Phobias - what are they? Phobias can be divided into two distinct types: Specific Phobia Specific phobias are usually to things such as dentists and doctors, heights, flying, dogs or snakes for example. Whilst specific phobias can cause anxiety and even panic to happen on exposure to them, they are not caused by generalized anxiety or an underlying anxiety disorder. Social Phobia Social Phobia is anxiety caused by exposure to social situations and interaction with other people. Includes fear of public speaking or performance, eating in public, writing in front of someone and other social interaction. Social phobia sufferers experience an overwhelming and frightening fear of being scrutinized or of being embarrassed or humiliated. This can lead to avoiding situations where this could happen, which means missing out on many pleasurable aspects of life. Agoraphobia - what is it and how can YOU overcome it? Agoraphobia is officially defined as the fear of the marketplace and although not strictly a phobia, rather a symptom of anxiety, it can be categorized as such because of the specific reaction it causes. Agoraphobia often affects sufferers in far more diverse places than just crowded or open places. Agoraphobia is taken to mean a reaction to a geographic location - this could be far from home, where escape or retreat is restricted (e.g. theatre, cinema, train) or anywhere when you are alone and feel vulnerable. Agoraphobia develops as a coping device in high anxiety. Sufferers develop symptoms and thoughts of which they become scared, they start to depend on a person or place of safety and this place becomes their sanctuary, where they feel calm or experience a reduction of their anxiety symptoms. Agoraphobia, like all other phobias can be eliminated using a structured program. Agoraphobia, is, in fact, the easiest phobia to cure as its existence is directly linked to your anxiety disorder - without the underlying anxiety, agoraphobia simply can't exist. Social Phobia (social anxiety) - what is it? Social phobia (social anxiety) is an anxiety reaction to any situation which means that you must interact with other people. Social phobia (social anxiety) can cause mild anxiety to extreme panic attacks and the situation which creates anxiety could be interaction with just one or perhaps a crowd of people. Every social phobia (social anxiety) sufferer is different. Some social phobia (social anxiety) can happen when you go on dates, talk to a person in authority or just interact with anyone with whom you are not fully comfortable as well as causing problems in larger groups or when confronted with having to perform or speak in public. Many social phobics experience problems when they have to eat or write in front of another person also. Social phobia (social anxiety) is a symptom of an anxiety disorder. Because the sufferer's general anxiety levels are artificially raised all of the time, just a slight increase can cause an anxiety reaction and even panic. The good news is that social phobia (social anxiety), can be eliminated by addressing the underlying anxiety that causes it. Phobia Elimination - is it possible? Phobias are symptoms of an anxiety disorder and NOT stand-alone disorders. Anxiety disorders occur when the 'anxiety switch', the Amygdala, in the brain, becomes stuck in the ON position as a result of repeated anxiety provoking situations or, less commonly, a one-off trauma which has caused the sufferer to experience high anxiety. The Amygdala is the organ in the brain that regulates and stores the anxiety response and it is this which MUST be addressed in order to return the anxious response back down to normal in order to eliminate your agoraphobia... in fact any phobia, completely. There is an effective way of overcoming and conquering phobias permanently, by reducing and eliminating the anxiety which causes and drives phobias, you can become anxiety free, more confident and more effective in your lives. 5.
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) » Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... « Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is the name given to anxiety disorder when it develops as a result of the sufferer experience an initial 'traumatic' catalyst. Although popular psychological practice suggests that Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is a 'stand alone condition' it is not; PTSD is an anxiety disorder just like generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and agoraphobia. Psychologists attempt to separate the anxiety disorders, treating them differently to each other by addressing the initial catalysts and the resultant physical manifestations of the symptoms rather than the root cause of the condition. This is so very wrong. The only difference between PTSD and other anxiety conditions is that there is usually an identifiable anxiety provoking catalyst, but this doesn't require constant analysis. The resultant physical PTSD symptoms are irrelevant too, they can be distressing and frustrating but ultimately, they are the manifestation of inappropriate anxiety. CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) asks you to keep anxiety diaries, to 'grade' the severity of your anxiety and do other counter productive exercises which have little, if any, curative affect on your anxiety PTSD. PTSD sufferers often experience 'flash backs' and nightmares which remind the sufferer of the anxiety catalyst and cause ongoing distress but anxiety disorder sufferers all suffer inappropriate thoughts, some even, of a very aggressive or sexual nature. PTSD sufferers may have experienced extreme trauma during military conflicts or accidents for example and the memory of those events may weigh heavily on a day to day basis, but this situation can be corrected very quickly indeed given the correct structure, understanding and support. Like any other anxiety condition, PTSD can be eliminated using a structured anxiety elimination program. Just because conventional medicine has decided to apply these names to specific features of anxiety conditions, doesn't mean that there aren't some 'fuzzy edges' during diagnosis. If you suffer from any of the above conditions, you have underlying high anxiety, without which none of these anxiety conditions would exist. Often, anxiety will create a mixture of obsessions, high anxiety and panic, making it very difficult to categorize a sufferer's condition. But, it isn't important to categorize because all of these conditions are caused by elevated anxiety and require the exact same solution to remove them. Often, anxiety disorder sufferers can be diagnosed as having 'depression' which is a common mistake made by medical practitioners world over; anxiety is a completely separate and very different condition to depression and confusing the two is akin to telling an Athlete's Foot sufferer that they have Eczema... they are both skin conditions but completely unrelated! Anxiety Attacks - The pinnacle of high anxiety - Can they be stopped? Anxiety attacks or panic attacks are the most extreme experience of anxiety. Anxiety attacks happen when the hormone adrenalin, which prepares the body for fighting or fleeing from a threat, stays in the blood stream long after it is required. Of course, if the anxiety is inappropriate and has been caused by a disorder and not a true threat, it isn't used up at all; this is when an anxiety attack happens. Anxiety attacks cause the heart to speed up and for digestion to slow, breathing to speed up and many other changes, which all have the unfortunate affect of causing some unpleasant sensations and thoughts. Can anxiety attacks be stopped - of course they can. How? By reversing the process that caused them in the first place! Using a structured and simple technique, you can completely reset your anxiety levels back down to normal, something that neither drug therapy nor psychotherapy can do in isolation. Anxiety Symptoms Anxiety symptoms are caused by the anxiety response; they are either direct alterations of bodily systems in preparation for anxiety OR side effects of those changes. For example, during high anxiety, the digestive system is slowed down to divert resources to other parts of the body, the muscles for example. The side effect of this can be stomach cramps or discomfort. The cramps are caused by the anxiety reaction but because the sufferer has high anxiety, they can be interpreted in other ways; fears grow and the anxiety worsens. This then causes more symptoms and so on. This cycle of high anxiety can produce many sensations and thoughts that are mostly misinterpreted by the sufferer as being sinister or threatening, but they are not. Anxiety causes changes in the body that can cause symptoms just about anywhere and some can be pretty extreme; this doesn't mean they are threatening in any way and all of them will disappear when you eliminate the underlying anxiety that causes them. FACT! Anxiety Help / Support Anxiety support can be unstructured and unsupportive through conventional networks and resource shortages are usually to blame. Cost can also be an issue, with specialists such as psychologists and psychiatrists charging high hourly rates and often over long periods. The biggest problem with anxiety help and support though is accessibility. Anxiety sufferers are needy and require support, advice and reassurance during their high anxiety and not just when the specialists are available. Seamless access to answers is vital with anxiety disorders. Finding such a resource is near impossible through conventional anxiety support provisions, such as a psychology practice, medical practice or hospital. So, what is the solution to anxiety? The solution to anxiety is very simple indeed, because the subconscious mind has become 'reset' at a higher than normal level, the cure for anxiety is to reset your high anxiety back down to normal level using a structured anxiety elimination program. Be Happy & No worry.

I have been diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder. GAD and Social Anxiety Disorder. I find it really hard to do things that i usually enjoyed. I avoided crowded places.
For me, my psychical pain when anxiety attack, attacks. I have chest pain, racing heartbeats, neck pain, arm pain, shoulder pain and back pain. And its kinda hard to breath at times. And my visions are sometimes focused. idk. This has been going on for a year now. I went for like countless check up if my heart is okay, and all the the test shows my heart is indeed okay.
Emotionally. I feel very scared, i felt something is about to happen, something bad. Uncomfortable, uneasy. restless. i also kena insomnia. My doctors gives me to types of pills. Alprazolam 0.5mg and Fluvox 1mg. Alprazolam is for the anxiety and fluvox for depression. Personally i think a support group would be a great help. I have very close friends, i talk about this to them.. they want to help.. but they dont understand how does it feels. If in a support group.. each member actually knows how'd it feel ad understands.

same problem as u ts. my first doctor gave me prothiaden
ate that and it make me sleepy too much i rarely went for checkup since general hospital have only do checkup 1 per month and it's crowded so it makes it harder for me to go. next time i went they already change a new doctor and he gave me Luvox. luvox doesn't work well for me as i have very bad side effects of it but when i go see this 2nd doc, he refuses to hear and wants me to keep eating those pills... so i dont go there anymore.
i went back to prothiaden and got my pills from local pharmacy. downside is i need to buy them in bulk which cost me more than RM300. does it work? no.. i should probably go back seeing a doc . if only things were that easy

To Insidexjokes: Its great news that the meds have finally helped u in ur battle with AD. The doses your r taking are relatively low and if it enables u to resume a decent better quality of life, do continue. But from time to time, our lives will never b totally smooth sailing and you will have stressful triggers again. Those time may cause u to push urself for more Alprazolam and that might cause a vicious cycle. My humble advice to you would be to now take some time to identify what was the cause of the triggers n stressors that may have caused ur condition in the first place. There might be a few factors involved at one given time or none at all but u should try to identify them. The road in dealing with Anxiety or Depression is a long and very hard path to walk. So never walk alone and never look back. Keep pushing on and you will find urself in ur utmost optimal quality in time. To Liquidsny: Personally, i wouldnt advice on self medicating especially if the meds are really working for u. Do go back to ur doctor and be adamant that u require something better. Voice ur opinions. Sometimes, its not because they dont want to hear ur pleas or request but from experience, depressed or anxious patients can sometimes be overly dependant on meds to a point where they will start hopping from meds to meds just to make themselves "feel" that they r getting a better meds. Doctors sometimes pick up on this and try to prevent them from doing so. But if ur meds really arent working for u, do discuss with ur doctor. They will help.

yes i get it that he doesn't want me to depend on prothiaden. but i think he forgots that i have anxiety and that would make me difficult to xplain my problems with him.. the thing about GH is that there is no privacy, when u went in to see doc, the nurses can walk in and out as they please and listen in..
as to why i didn't carry on with luvox or luvoc is because it really does gave me bad side effects such as body aches in pain till i couldn't walk and severe headache .. i tried those meds 2 weeks and i ended up in emergency room with bad headache.. they concluded that i had the "wrong pills" .. @insidexjokes sry to hijack ur thread n hope ur treatment goes well for u.. do tell us if those prescription makes u feel better This post has been edited by

Well, do go back to ur doctor n request a private meeting. Nurses will always b there but worry not, believe me, they dont pay much attention to the cases at all. =) Reason y i said to go back to ur doctor is because there are actually many different sort of anti depressants in the market right now. Luvox is just one of the many that you can be started on. Having side effects to it could simply mean u should b started on other classes of antidepressants. Whats more importantly is how r u coping with ur current situation? If u feel u need help, then pls dont worry about meeting ur doctor, just make an appointment and work it out with them. Good luck! Dont lose faith in the Psychiatrist in Malaysia. We are a "young" group of medical team who's striving to make a difference in the Mental Health Care of Malaysia which has been significantly neglected.

Hey there insidexjokes, I'm glad you are getting stronger and better now. You know what, everything in life is actually giving you only TWO options to choose. For either good or bad, day and night, happy or sad, positive or negative etc.
Given the choice, why not ignore the bad and cherish the good, watch the sunrise and start your day full of activity and choose to be happy for life is short. Remember, always look at the bright side of everything.
Everyday, think and imagine you are recovering and anxiety disorder is the past. Being past is past and it will not come back just like when a child has grown up, you cant go back to become a child once again dont you. When you start to worry, talk to yourself and say hey, anxiety is my history and there is no way I can go back unless I have time machine which is not possible.
You are now starting a new chapter in your life and are living a normal and happy life like others. In front of you, there are so much good things waiting for you to explore and enjoy. Let's celebrate life.
Cheers, A lil advise from Zentaro

I had this panic disorder once this year. It occur after i drank a cup of thick coffee. Its been long time I never drink coffee. That day i put in two table spoon of milo and three teaspoon of nescafe in my cup. I think too thick for me. then i ate two packs of groundnuts and one chocolate bar. Suddenly after three to four hours i feel my heart beat so fast at the same time felt like hard to breath.
My hands and feet become very cold. I thought i might have sign of heart attack. So i quickly call my father to fetch me to hospital I am working that day. I dont dare to drive home. While waiting, all sort of thoughts in my mind. I even compose a will and make it as background picture for my iphone. Before my father reach around 10 minutes before i felt my both arms numb, both my legs numb hardly can clench my fist and stand up. I just squat infront my office. and then my stomach cramp... feel like something pushing in and out..feel like the stomach twitch so badly that i want to vomit. and when my father reach office. I started to talk gilberish. i dunno if he understand. I remember i told him.. " if i died please use this as the proof of my will." i have written down all saving epf and socso will be for my parent. Then my father quickly drive me to hospital. Along the way my father ask me to breath harder and try to clench fist and release so that the heartbeat will pump... i dunno that is right or wrong i just follow. Along the way to hospital. i took four panadols, three highblood pressure pill, two pain killers. i have high blood pressure diagnose this year too but then i never took it since i already try to change my lifestyle. daily i did my blood pressure checkup. from 140 now around 110~ 115 already. By the time i reach hospital in emergency. They test my blood pressure is around 160. heart beat is very fast around 120. I ask doc is it i am getting heart attack. Doc says no. If i can breath hard and deep and fast it is not heart attack. I ask is it a sign of stroke doc says no cause if stroke only one part of leg or arm will be numb not both side. Then the doc ask me about the symptoms i told the doc. Doc ask me to calm down and given me a anxiety pill. I took one. Only one. after around 15 to 20 minutes i feel better. heartbeat lower down to normal 75bps. blood pressure done down 120. Doc advice me not to think too much. It is the sudden intense of fear that cause this panick disorder/ anxiety. It will overcome your physcology. If this is not control it will happen more and more frequent. So the cure is not too think too much bad things, dont drink too much caffeine and listen to music, think of happy things. Then i ask doc to perform ECG to see my heart beat normal or not after the test it is normal. The Doc says cannot simply pop in medicine if not prescribe by doc. Too much pill at that day i feel so weak my body. until now " touch wood " i only had it once. i don't want another time. The doc did give me a strips of anxiety pills. Doc says only use it when really need. Cause if took too many time you will get use to it then you will depend on this drug. this is a control drug and you cannot get it in any normal pharmacy.

I have very close friends, i talk about this to them.. they want to help.. but they dont understand how does it feels. If in a support group.. each member actually knows how'd it feel ad understands. Rest assured that you're not alone in this AD mind trap, all AD sufferers have similar symptoms such as those listed in my last post. First, you need to understand that you're not "sick" physically, all the physical pain you're experiencing during AD episodes are the results of a normal physical reaction to fear & adrenaline rush for fight-or-flight response to nonexistent danger that keep on playing in your mind's eye, it's totally harmless to your physical body. So physically you're 100% fit as confirmed by your doctor(s), you can now stop worrying about it, stop visiting doctor(s) again & again for reassurance as it's just another anxious habit, start working on kicking this bad habit of "fear/negative thought cycles", to kick this habit it's like asking you to unlearn driving a car, it's easy if you're a beginner but hard not impossible if you're a 10+ years experienced driver. Second, you need to understand also that you're not "sick" mentally, all you have is just a hyper active mind with a lot of unallocated resources running screen saver with horror flicks, the different with people without AD is their screen savers is mostly non-fear positive genre, because fear is the key to open the door to AD, no fear no AD simple as that. If not sick then why need to see doctor & take meds? For AD beginners, panic/anxiety attacks is a very scary experience, it's perfectly normal to seek doctor(s) for professional help to first rule out any serious ailments of both physical & mental, if it's confirmed AD then you can opt for short term meds for serious AD or no meds for minor AD, doctor should advice you but the choice is always yours. If you're on meds you should consider cut down or stop meds & work on the elimination of anxious thoughts. Why meds are bad for AD sufferers? Meds will only provide temporary relief to AD symptoms, it will only mask or suppress your anxious thoughts as long as it's still in your bloodstream, it doesn't eliminate the root cause of anxious thoughts, often times the effects of meds will wear off after sometime which lead to increase dosage/addiction or change meds, not to mention that you have to endure some nasty side effects. If you're on high dosage of meds for a long time & you stop taking it, you will experience withdrawal syndrome with avalanche of rebound anxiety symptoms, in this case you have to talk to your doctor(s) about a gradual withdrawal program. Why nowadays we have lots of AD sufferers? Today people are more & more biased towards negative thoughts given the current world/social/home affairs fill with negative issues, bombarded by media 24/7 with lots of negative news, so no one is spare from it. So why not everyone suffers from AD? Those without AD are people who are aware & know how to filter out noise (negative) from signals (positive), their mind choose to dwell on positive thoughts rather than negative thoughts & ignore any temptation of fears. How AD works basically? Too much negative thoughts lead to fears, too much fears lead to panic/anxiety attacks, too much panic/anxiety attacks lead to more negative thoughts and the vicious cycle goes on & on, it's a positive feedback of fears in
Amygdala
that trigger the release of
adrenaline
into bloodstream which causes all sorts of adrenaline rush symptoms, these are just harmless sensations & feelings, scary but nothing more, BUT it's very handy when you're being chased by a real tiger, adrenaline will boost up your escape velocity.
How to stop/eliminate anxious/negative thoughts & panic/anxiety attacks? The key is to unlearn old habit of anxious thoughts, by learning/practice new habit of non-anxious thoughts to overwrite the old ones, fill up your spare time with lots of positive things/works/hobbies, don't give chance for your mind to idle & wander about aimlessly, identify what make you happy & do it, stop dwelling/researching/talking about your AD conditions & ignore those sad/unhappy stuffs, go to bed early before 11.00pm & have at least 6~8 hours of sleep. If anxious/negative thoughts try to resurface again, "STOP!" & "DIVERT" your mind/attention to do something else such as phone your friend up for chit-chat (not about AD), play loud music, sing along with it, watch funny videos & LOL, slap your cheeks, dance around, go fly kite, play sports/exercise/Tai-Chi/Chi-Kung, play video games, splash face with cold water, count down from 100 fast, do maths problems & etc, do it until the symptoms subside, make "DIVERSION" your new habit always!

Its good to came across this AD discussion here...pls allow me to share my experience I was once a AD sufferer 2 years ago and seriously, it was not an easy experience as we need to deal with it by our own mental strength. The symptoms I get is similar to what being mentioned from previous post. I had tried consume xanax, klonopil, alpazolam, etc...but the effect only last temporarily and will haunt you back if you stop taking the meds.
What I can remember clearly that my anxiety is much related to my stomach. It started when I got this serious gastritis which leads me to bloating, cramp, difficulties in swallowing, constipation and difficulty to fart. I lost about 7 kg at that time and my condition is worst at that time...quit my job for half a year (coz too weak to focus in work). Had done a blood test, ECG, ultrasound, endoscope and the results are normal. The docs prescribe me some Nexium, famotidine, charcoal, an other GERD meds but it doesn't help at all. My stomach continues keep bloating with excessive gasses bcoz I can't pass down my gas to the bottom. Then the doc conclude it's due to stress. Then I go try TCM approach and the sinseh prescribe me some herbs to boil and drink for few weeks. Upon taking the herbs for few weeks, I got diarrhea every morning but the sinseh told me its fine coz it's removing the toxin from my intestines, so I continue with the medication. Later on, I felt much better ...my bowel movement is going from top to bottom (means i got no constipation and can release gasses easily, got more appetite and gain some weight). According to the sinseh, OUR EMOTION CAN AFFECT OUR STOMACH. Therefore, all my physical symptoms is started by my mental problem. After considering the sinseh words, I r'ber that before I have this AD, I was a person with no patience, easily get irritated, annoyed and angry. I guess this is the root problem. From that day onwards, I decided to change my lifestyle totally... - dont be a workaholic...take short breaks regularly at work...dont sit in front of the PC for a long time - sleep early and wake up before sun rises...go for a morning walk or brief jogging - do charity on weekends by visiting orphanage or old folks home...u'll noticed that by helping the needy, u'll feel that u're more fortunate and u'll appreciate ur life more and this will lead to more positive thoughts. - if u're single, go find ur soulmate...have some fun and intimacy together. - i changed my diet by taking more vege and less meat. Seldom take coffee and alcohol. - but the most important thing is worry less and be happy. I still get some mild AD on-and-off when I really stress at work now but it's still managable coz I know how to deal with it from my experience. Luckily my condition has improved now and I won't blushed away when talking to strangers and won't get panic in crowded areas. My simple advice is u need to change ur lifestyle and get rid of ur old habit/thoughts. After going through this period, I somehow feel grateful that I get this AD. This had made me to understand my body and surroundings more
*p/s: if you need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me...TQ

This had made me to understand my body and surroundings more

QUOTE(insidexjokes @ Dec 13 2011, 08:41 AM) ...i used to be in a band, a hardcore band. Playing gigs week in week out. For some reason i kept telling myself i still can do that, but my body still refused to cooperate. That is something im working on. Hehehe. But thanks anyways. Actually your conscious/logical mind says you can still do that, but your body "involuntary" refused to cooperate due to your subconscious/illogical mind ordered it to do so because of some fear conditioning programmed in Amygdala! Some or most of our behaviors/habits/actions are involuntary control by our subconscious mind, when you learn new skills, 1st you use your conscious mind to execute the process of a new skill in an orderly manners, as you practise the same process overtime, your act will be programmed into your subconscious mind, next time when you need to perform the same skill set, your subconscious mind will kick in & run the saved skill set program automatically without you making a conscious effort to do so. The above mechanism also applied to AD sufferers, where constant anxious/negative thoughts originated from your conscious mind when you're running some simulation of fear/worry/danger+fearful-reactions scenarios will trigger your subconscious mind into believing it & record it in Amygdala, when you face the same scenarios again next time, your subconscious mind will playback the same fear/worry/danger+fearful-reactions without you making a conscious effort to do so. You can still go back & do what you loved before with some lifestyle changes, here are my advice to you: 1. Change your style by playing gigs in less crowded places or do recorded video gigs. 2. Divert your attention away from anything to do with crowded places & do anything that you enjoy/love & happy for until your symptoms reduced.

Something I would like to share (copied from my company's email) for this new year... 5 Keys to Living Longer and Better Key #1: Eat fewer calories, but more food. Thatâs no misprint. When nutrition researchers invited themselves over for dinner in kitchens across the globe -- from Greece to Japan to the state of Pennsylvania -- they discovered a tummy-satisfying secret to good health: Pile your plate high with vegetables and fruits, add respectable portions of beans and whole grains, and downplay high-calorie fare like cheeseburgers, cream sauces, and fatty meats. The result: Fewer calories, more health-boosting antioxidants, and longer, happier, more active and independent lives.
Why? "People on Okinawa eat more food by weight than people who eat a Western-style diet,â says Bradley Willcox, MD, of the Pacific Health Research Institute in Honolulu and lead researcher of the Okinawa Longevity Study. âThey eat a lot of produce and grains and smaller portions of higher-calorie, higher-fat foods. Itâs the combination of high nutrition and lower calories that gives them a tremendous health advantage: Their risk for dementia, heart attacks, strokes, and cancer are among the lowest in the world.â Key #2: Use exercise as an anti-aging vaccine. Itâs no secret that physical activity tones up muscles, burns calories, and puts a happy bounce in your step. But recently, researchers uncovered a new, bonus benefit: Exercise acts as a powerful vaccine against the aging process itself. When University of Florida exercise physiologists put healthy people ages 60 to 85 on weight-training programs for six months then tested them for signs of free-radical damage, they were surprised by the results. By the end of the study, low-intensity exercisers had a drop in free-radical damage, while high-intensity exercisers had a slight increase. And a control group of nonexercisers had a whopping 13 percent rise in free-radical damage.
The message: low-intensity exercise might be the best kind to protect your heart and arteries. Need more convincing? Not exercising nearly doubles your risk of a heart attack, says Robert Nied, MD, a sports medicine specialist in California. And itâs not too late to start: âPeople who go from no exercise to some exercise receive the biggest benefits,â Dr. Nied notes. Key #3: Find something interesting to do.
Life is perpetually busy no matter what your age. But the truth is, as careers reach their later stages, as children mature, and as home-improvement ambitions are fulfilled, time usually does become more available for adults after 60. With this time comes choices. The easy one is to merely to relax: watch more TV, eat out more often, talk on the phone as much as you want.
The better choice? Discover something more meaningful to devote yourself to and pursue it wholeheartedly. Why? A growing body of scientific research shows that doing something that interests you offers big health benefits in your 50s, 60s, 70s, and beyond. An example: When psychiatrists at the University of California, San Diego, checked up on 500 adults ages 60 to 98 who were living independently, they got a pleasant surprise. By standard definitions of successful aging, which focus mostly on physical well-being, this group had plenty of challenges. Most were coping with a tough health condition such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and mental health problems. Just one in 10 met the usual criteria for healthy, successful aging, the researchers noted. The study volunteers, however, werenât buying into conventional wisdom.
When they rated their own degree of successful aging on scale of 1 to 10, the average score was a very happy 8.4. "People who think they are aging well are not necessarily the healthiest individuals," notes lead researcher Dilip Jeste, MD, chief of the universityâs geriatric psychiatry division. "In fact, optimism and effective coping styles were found to be more important to successful aging than traditional measures of health and wellness."
Key #4: Connect with friends and family.
Close connections are a source of joy and offer a sturdy shield against the stress that can lead to health problems down the road. Scientific journals prove time and again that having friends around changes the biochemistry of your brain, pumping up feelings of joy and well-being that bolster immunity.
The message: When youâre alone for too long (and the definition of âtoo longâ is different for each of us), levels of the stress hormone cortisol rise, ratcheting up your odds for heart disease, high blood pressure, depression, muddled thinking, and sleep problems. Key #5: Flex your mind in positive ways.
By stressing your mind in productive ways, you can lower your risk of mental decline. And you donât need fancy computer programs or complicated âbrain gamesâ to do it -- simple âbrain calisthenicsâ (one neuroscientist calls then neurobics -- aerobics for your brain cells) that involve new ways of doing everyday things are all it takes. The idea behind neurobics comes from a remarkable discovery: During autopsies of 137 people with Alzheimerâs disease, researchers realized that even though these women and men had all the brain plaques and tangles of full-blown Alzheimerâs, their symptoms were much milder than they should have been. When the scientists looked further, they found a possible explanation: The patientsâ brains weighed more and had more neurons than usual, suggesting that they had âcognitive reserveâ -- a savings account of extra pathways that allowed them to function more normally for far longer. What's more exciting? People who use their brains more often -- on the job and at play -- seem to possess these brain-saving reserves. And they believe that stressing the brain in ways similar to the way we stress muscles during exercise can produce similar benefits: a stronger, fitter, more flexible brain.

QUOTE(insidexjokes @ Apr 4 2011, 05:21 AM) Well here's the thing. Theres a fine line between "normal" anxiety and "disordered" anxiety. Normal anxiety is when you feels anxious,scared,worried when theres a situation (life or death situation, interviews, surprised, you know that kinda situations) Anxiety disorder is when you feels anxious without facing those situations. (like for me i felt anxious like for 24/7) But panic attacks has it triggers. For example you get panic attack when at crowded places, you started to feel SUPER ANXIOUS, cant breath well,you have chest pain and discomfort, you feel faintish. this. i THINK i having this issue even until now since 2 years ago(ya i know is very long). visited doctors(even traditional) for few times and they said nothing wrong with me and blood pressure and heart beat is normal. most of the doctors said could be muscle pain and traditional doctor said could be my lifestyle..tried all the medicine(painkiller) but remain the same i asked them is it because of anxiety and they said is possible but never give much advice of this. it feels so shit and ruin my mood. im trying to relax and not to think anything else but the pain will come for no reason. i even follow a healthy lifestyle like eat in order and in time, exercise( gym), sleep early(11pm) and wake up early, always hang out, keep myself busy during work(my work involved talking in every minutes),etc but the pain still coming. i planning to go for another full body checkup after CNY and hope there is nothing wrong

And ask them for a letter, god willing they'll forward you to a psychiatric division, but dont be a afraid, you're not gonna be submited to a mental ward, because YOURE NOT CRAZY. Then you'll get an appointment and i also suggest you ask them to forward you to Hospital Ampang, which where i get my treatments.
At Hospital Ampang, the doctors are very nice and very concern, because i guess theres not much patient there. Best of luck, p/s If you have anything concerning about Anxiety/Depression/Panic disorder, i'll be glad to help

Âť anxiety about being with others Depression and Anxiety Historically, anxiety and depression have been strongly linked. But are they related? That depends on the answer to one question! The question is: What came first, the anxiety or the depression symptoms? If your answer is that depression came before the anxiety, then chances are that you are suffering from true clinical depression. If you answer that your anxiety came before the depression, chances are you have anxiety-related depression and that's a completely different and very treatable condition. Anxiety causes mood changes which mimic true depression! There is a big difference between anxiety caused by depression and depression caused by anxiety. Clinical depression is a chemical mood disorder caused by changes in the chemicals in your body and brain that regulate 'mood'. This chemical imbalance causes a wide range of disturbing thoughts and anxiety symptoms and is generally treated using drugs, psychology, psychiatry and some more invasive procedures. Anxiety is a behavioral condition caused by the habit of 'Fear Cycle' or repetitive anxious thoughts. We feel frightened, we experience symptoms, these frighten us, our anxiety goes up... and the cycle continues. Stress, phobias and anxiety can cause 'depression like' symptoms but rarely true clinical depression. Anxiety is also generally treated using drugs, psychology and psychiatry which are good for treating and managing it, but not for curing it. Anxiety Disorder - Is it a physical or mental illness? In short, no, anxiety disorder is neither a physical nor mental illness! The word disorder suggests illness, please be assured that you are not ill. Anxiety is a behavioral condition regardless of how it makes you feel. Anxiety is a natural response to fear and, like other bodily systems that can falter, causing things like indigestion, palpitations or sensitive eyes for example, the anxiety response can become disrupted too. But, this isn't mental or physical illness... it's a temporary disruption which can be 'reset' very quickly indeed. Anxiety disorder is the condition caused when stress or constant anxiety provoking situations cause the mind to become reset at a higher than normal benchmark anxiety level. Anxiety disorder is most noticeable by the vast range of unpleasant sensations and thoughts it creates... unpleasant but harmless! Creation of an anxiety disorder can happen quickly and is usually the result of an event such as work stress, bereavement, divorce or other anxiety-provoking situations. When anxiety levels become raised due to such stressors, the mind can make a decision to re-set at this new level of anxiety; when this happens an anxiety disorder is formed. Anxiety causes a wide range of both physical and psychological symptoms, all directly caused by the anxiety reaction, all harmless, BUT all also feeling much worse than they actually are! They are the sensation of FEAR... BUT, they are NOT true fear! Anxiety Conditions (Disorder) - what are they? There are five main 'anxiety disorders', these are: 1.
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) » Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... « GAD is much more intense than normal anxiety levels which make be experienced day to day. GAD is overwhelming and can dominate one's day with inappropriate and exaggerated worries and tension, even even when there is nothing present to worry about. Having GAD means that the sufferer is always anticipating a negative outcome to everything they confront, sufferers often worry inappropriately about health, finances, relationships or their career. The normal reaction to anxiety is to retreat or withdraw from 'normal' activities, this reinforces to the anxious mind that it is OK for our anxiety to dictate to us and for us to modify our enjoyment of life to accommodate it... this is not acceptable. GAD is an anxiety disorder because, as already stated, without an underlying anxiety disorder, GAD cannot be present. GAD sufferers have inappropriate and sometimes scary disturbing thoughts, sometimes violent or sexual in nature - these may sometimes involve people with whom they would never partake in such acts, even members of their own family. On occasion, simply the thought of getting through the day provokes anxiety as soon as the sufferer wakes. Because adrenaline levels are artificially raised through stressors, which ultimately leads to a resetting of our baseline anxiety level, we can experience general or generalized anxiety. This means that the body is functioning at a much higher level of anxiety, causing a whole list of anxious feelings, emotions and sensations. What are the symptoms of GAD? GAD sufferers seem unable to eliminate or ignore their concerns, even though they usually realize that their anxiety is more intense than the situation warrants. The anxiety they experience is usually accompanied by physical anxiety symptoms such as headaches, tension, tiredness, aching muscles, difficulty swallowing, shaking, twitches, mood swings, sweats, and hot and cold flushes. GAD sufferers may often feel light-headed or out of breath. They may also feel nauseated or have to go to the bathroom frequently. Generalized anxiety is constant and can cause anxiety / panic attacks during the day and night. Night time anxiety and panic attacks are especially disturbing and can often wake the sufferer from deep sleep feeling particularly frightened. Night time anxiety can be minimized with some practical steps which minimize the impact of such things as blood sugar level fluctuations during sleep. Individuals with GAD seem unable to relax, and they may startle more easily than other people. They tend to have difficulty concentrating and often, they have trouble falling or staying asleep. The sort of symptoms you can experience in generalized anxiety are generally milder than those experienced during an anxiety / panic attack. Although distressing, they are usually much less extreme. Your stomach may churn, your heart races or beats slower or you may get palpitations you may also feel sweaty or clammy, dizzy or shaky and general unrest. You may just feel as if you have the Flu with shaky or weak legs and clamminess. You might get disturbing thoughts or feel depressed, this is perfectly normal and will pass, it is purely a response to anxiety and must not be mistaken for depression. Remember, these thoughts and feelings are harmless but unpleasant none the less. This doesn't mean you should rush to your doctor to get anxiety medication - in fact, quite the contrary! Anxiety is often misdiagnosed as depression by physicians, who's 'knee jerk' reaction is to reach for the prescription pad, not only is this premature but wholly inappropriate treatment for an anxiety condition. Anxiety isn't caused by a mental or physical illness and certainly not by a chemical imbalance which requires medicinal 'correction'... anxiety disorder is a behavioral condition and can not be eliminated by adding chemicals to the blood stream. GAD affects about 4 million adult Americans and about twice as many women as men. Anxiety disorder comes on gradually and can begin across the life-cycle, though the risk is highest between childhood and middle age. It is typically diagnosed when someone spends at least 6 months worrying excessively about a number of everyday problems. 2.
Panic disorder » Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... « Panic disorder is one of the so-called anxiety disorders and is the result of an increased level of anxiety which is caused by a change in the way a small organ called the Amygdala, in the brain, responds to anxiety-provoking thoughts or situations. When this process becomes disrupted, the sufferer develops feelings of anxiety which may escalate into panic attacks or Panic disorder. Panic Disorder has such diverse and sometimes extreme symptoms. BUT, this is caused by the same internal mechanism in every single sufferer. The brain thinks it is behaving normally as it has become re-set at a higher than normal level of anxiety due to a catalyst of some sort; the catalyst is unimportant actually, what is important, however, is that an internal switch, which activates the anxiety response in the brain has been 'adjusted' to a higher level of anxiety and it is this that causes and perpetuates the Panic Disorder. The term disorder is a misnomer, it suggests illness and anxiety isn't an illness, it's a natural device that can become disturbed. Panic Disorder affects about 5 million adults in the US and the UK and is twice as common in women as in men. It most often begins during late adolescence or early adulthood. Not everyone who experiences panic attacks will develop panic disorder - for example, many people have one attack but never have another. For those who do have Panic Disorder, though, it's important to seek treatment. Untreated, the disorder can become very disabling indeed. Many people with Panic Disorder visit the hospital emergency room repeatedly or see a number of doctors before they obtain a correct diagnosis and may go for years without learning that they have a real, treatable condition. Regardless of how the anxiety affects you mentally or physically, the very same internal mechanism is responsible, so the curative process is the same in every case regardless of age, race or gender. To eliminate Panic Disorder permanently, this mechanism must be addressed and corrected. Panic Disorder Symptoms People with panic disorder have feelings of terror that strike suddenly and repeatedly with no warning. They can't predict when an attack will occur, and many develop intense anxiety between episodes, worrying when and where the next one will strike. If you are having a panic attack, you may have Panic Disorder. Most likely your heart will pound and you may feel sweaty, weak, faint, or dizzy. Your hands may tingle or feel numb, and you might feel flushed or chilled. You may have nausea, chest pain or smothering sensations, a sense of unreality, or fear of impending doom or loss of control. You may genuinely believe you're having a heart attack or losing your mind, or even on the verge of death. Panic attacks can occur at any time, even during sleep. An attack generally peaks within 10 minutes, but some symptoms may last much longer. Panic Disorder and Phobias Panic Disorder may lead to a pattern of avoidance of places or situations where panic attacks have occurred. For example, if a panic attack strikes while you're riding in an elevator, you may develop a phobia (fear) of elevators. If you start avoiding them, that could affect your choice of a job or apartment and greatly restrict other areas of your life. Some people's lives become so restricted that they avoid normal, everyday activities such as grocery shopping or driving. In some cases they become completely housebound. Or, they may be able to confront a feared situation only if accompanied by a spouse or other trusted person. Sufferers avoid any situation in which they would feel helpless if a panic attack were to occur. When people's lives become so restricted, as happens in about one-third of people with panic disorder, the condition is called Agoraphobia. Early treatment can often prevent agoraphobia. Panic Disorder Treatment Panic Disorder is one of the most treatable of all the anxiety disorders, responding in most cases to carefully targeted anxiety management programs. Panic Disorder Medication Does a panic disorder medication exist? In a nutshell, NO! There is no such thing as a therapeutic panic disorder medication which can offer a cure. Panic disorder is a behavioral condition and there exists no medication which can erase memory and behavior in a targeted way in order to eliminate panic disorder directly. Many medications are prescribed for use with panic disorder, but these are sedatives and antidepressants and have not been developed for the targeted treatment of panic disorder. 3.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) » Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... « Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder symptom, NOT a stand-alone condition. Why? Because OCD never exists without an underlying anxiety disorder; take away your inappropriate anxiety and your obsessions will simply fade away. OCD is fueled by anxiety-driven 'what if' or 'catastrophic' thought processes which are stored like habit in the brain. If you have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), you may be plagued by persistent, unwelcome thoughts or images, or by the urgent need to engage in certain rituals in order to stave off anxiety. These Obsessive Compulsive Disorder rituals can be very fast to carry out, such as checking light switches or making sure you have turned off the stove, but many require large quantities of time and concentration. As a sufferer of OCD: Âť You may be obsessed with germs or dirt, washing your hands, clothes, home or furniture repeatedly
Âť You may be filled with doubt and feel the need to check things many times over
Âť You may have frequent thoughts of violence, and fear that you will harm people close to you
Âť You may spend long periods touching things or counting
Âť You may be pre-occupied by order or symmetry
Âť you may have persistent thoughts of performing sexual acts that are repugnant to you
Âť You may be troubled by thoughts that oppose your religious beliefs
The disturbing thoughts or images are called
obsessions , and the rituals that are performed to try to prevent or get rid of them are called
compulsions . If the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder sufferer does not carry out the ritual that their subconscious mind wishes them to, the anxiety level can become overwhelming. Panic attacks and all of the associated anxiety symptoms, thoughts and sensations can ensue - and it is this which forces the sufferer to become a slave to their compulsions and rituals in order to prevent an anxiety reaction. Even non-anxious people recognize some of the symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. 'Checking' behavior is common in non-sufferers, but when this behavior becomes obsessive, the OCD sufferer can spend much of their day checking the gas, the light switches or the locks. Some OCD sufferers spend much of their day carrying out the rituals they have developed which can be very intrusive and destructive for both themselves and family members. Most OCD sufferers realize that what they do makes no real sense, but the fear of the consequences of NOT doing it forces them to continue. There are many OCD sufferers who are so entrenched in their behaviors and routines that they seem oblivious to the fact that what they do is not what one would call 'normal' behavior. Who suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)? Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) affects over 4 million Americans and this figure is echoed across the world. OCD affects men and women equally and normally develops in younger people and children first. Approximately 1/3 of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder sufferers first experienced their symptoms as a child. People with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder tend to avoid situations where there may be a chance of confronting their fears or obsessions. Avoidance techniques support the anxious behavior and often phobias accompany the OCD behavior, such as agoraphobia or social phobia. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) sufferers find it very difficult to maintain healthy relationships or to hold down a job because of the intrusive and very visual nature of their conditions - often employers will find the visible symptoms difficult to work with and careers can be severely affected. What is 'Pure O'? Pure O is the obsessive thoughts experienced in obsessive compulsive disorder but without any resultant compulsion to carry out any specific actions such as hand washing, ordering or word repetition. Pure O can often center around obsessive thoughts of a sexual or aggressive nature. Can Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) be cured? In a word... yes! Most definitely and most permanently. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an Anxiety Disorder symptom, and can, therefore, be eliminated by addressing the subconscious reaction which causes and perpetuates the anxiety which fuels it. This sounds difficult, but it isn't. There is an internal 'anxiety switch' which is activated by anxious stimuli and it is by controlling and altering this reaction that OCD and the anxiety that fuels it can be permanently eliminated, very quickly and very permanently. In other words if you remove the anxiety which fuels OCD, the obsessions and compulsions fade away quickly. 4.
Phobias » Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... « Phobias can be described as a constant, overwhelming and disabling fear of exposure to specific objects, activities or situations, which represent little or no actual danger to the sufferer. Avoidance of exposure to these things then causes the sufferer to limit their daily activities unnecessarily. There are number of different types of phobias. In anxiety disorders specific phobias are experienced, however, more prevalently, agoraphobia, social phobia, medical and dental phobias and obsessive thoughts concerning health play a much more important role. These phobic reactions are important because the are key to eliminating your anxiety disorder completely. Phobias - what are they? Phobias can be divided into two distinct types: Specific Phobia Specific phobias are usually to things such as dentists and doctors, heights, flying, dogs or snakes for example. Whilst specific phobias can cause anxiety and even panic to happen on exposure to them, they are not caused by generalized anxiety or an underlying anxiety disorder. Social Phobia Social Phobia is anxiety caused by exposure to social situations and interaction with other people. Includes fear of public speaking or performance, eating in public, writing in front of someone and other social interaction. Social phobia sufferers experience an overwhelming and frightening fear of being scrutinized or of being embarrassed or humiliated. This can lead to avoiding situations where this could happen, which means missing out on many pleasurable aspects of life. Agoraphobia - what is it and how can YOU overcome it? Agoraphobia is officially defined as the fear of the marketplace and although not strictly a phobia, rather a symptom of anxiety, it can be categorized as such because of the specific reaction it causes. Agoraphobia often affects sufferers in far more diverse places than just crowded or open places. Agoraphobia is taken to mean a reaction to a geographic location - this could be far from home, where escape or retreat is restricted (e.g. theatre, cinema, train) or anywhere when you are alone and feel vulnerable. Agoraphobia develops as a coping device in high anxiety. Sufferers develop symptoms and thoughts of which they become scared, they start to depend on a person or place of safety and this place becomes their sanctuary, where they feel calm or experience a reduction of their anxiety symptoms. Agoraphobia, like all other phobias can be eliminated using a structured program. Agoraphobia, is, in fact, the easiest phobia to cure as its existence is directly linked to your anxiety disorder - without the underlying anxiety, agoraphobia simply can't exist. Social Phobia (social anxiety) - what is it? Social phobia (social anxiety) is an anxiety reaction to any situation which means that you must interact with other people. Social phobia (social anxiety) can cause mild anxiety to extreme panic attacks and the situation which creates anxiety could be interaction with just one or perhaps a crowd of people. Every social phobia (social anxiety) sufferer is different. Some social phobia (social anxiety) can happen when you go on dates, talk to a person in authority or just interact with anyone with whom you are not fully comfortable as well as causing problems in larger groups or when confronted with having to perform or speak in public. Many social phobics experience problems when they have to eat or write in front of another person also. Social phobia (social anxiety) is a symptom of an anxiety disorder. Because the sufferer's general anxiety levels are artificially raised all of the time, just a slight increase can cause an anxiety reaction and even panic. The good news is that social phobia (social anxiety), can be eliminated by addressing the underlying anxiety that causes it. Phobia Elimination - is it possible? Phobias are symptoms of an anxiety disorder and NOT stand-alone disorders. Anxiety disorders occur when the 'anxiety switch', the Amygdala, in the brain, becomes stuck in the ON position as a result of repeated anxiety provoking situations or, less commonly, a one-off trauma which has caused the sufferer to experience high anxiety. The Amygdala is the organ in the brain that regulates and stores the anxiety response and it is this which MUST be addressed in order to return the anxious response back down to normal in order to eliminate your agoraphobia... in fact any phobia, completely. There is an effective way of overcoming and conquering phobias permanently, by reducing and eliminating the anxiety which causes and drives phobias, you can become anxiety free, more confident and more effective in your lives. 5.
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) » Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... « Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is the name given to anxiety disorder when it develops as a result of the sufferer experience an initial 'traumatic' catalyst. Although popular psychological practice suggests that Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is a 'stand alone condition' it is not; PTSD is an anxiety disorder just like generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and agoraphobia. Psychologists attempt to separate the anxiety disorders, treating them differently to each other by addressing the initial catalysts and the resultant physical manifestations of the symptoms rather than the root cause of the condition. This is so very wrong. The only difference between PTSD and other anxiety conditions is that there is usually an identifiable anxiety provoking catalyst, but this doesn't require constant analysis. The resultant physical PTSD symptoms are irrelevant too, they can be distressing and frustrating but ultimately, they are the manifestation of inappropriate anxiety. CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) asks you to keep anxiety diaries, to 'grade' the severity of your anxiety and do other counter productive exercises which have little, if any, curative affect on your anxiety PTSD. PTSD sufferers often experience 'flash backs' and nightmares which remind the sufferer of the anxiety catalyst and cause ongoing distress but anxiety disorder sufferers all suffer inappropriate thoughts, some even, of a very aggressive or sexual nature. PTSD sufferers may have experienced extreme trauma during military conflicts or accidents for example and the memory of those events may weigh heavily on a day to day basis, but this situation can be corrected very quickly indeed given the correct structure, understanding and support. Like any other anxiety condition, PTSD can be eliminated using a structured anxiety elimination program. Just because conventional medicine has decided to apply these names to specific features of anxiety conditions, doesn't mean that there aren't some 'fuzzy edges' during diagnosis. If you suffer from any of the above conditions, you have underlying high anxiety, without which none of these anxiety conditions would exist. Often, anxiety will create a mixture of obsessions, high anxiety and panic, making it very difficult to categorize a sufferer's condition. But, it isn't important to categorize because all of these conditions are caused by elevated anxiety and require the exact same solution to remove them. Often, anxiety disorder sufferers can be diagnosed as having 'depression' which is a common mistake made by medical practitioners world over; anxiety is a completely separate and very different condition to depression and confusing the two is akin to telling an Athlete's Foot sufferer that they have Eczema... they are both skin conditions but completely unrelated! Anxiety Attacks - The pinnacle of high anxiety - Can they be stopped? Anxiety attacks or panic attacks are the most extreme experience of anxiety. Anxiety attacks happen when the hormone adrenalin, which prepares the body for fighting or fleeing from a threat, stays in the blood stream long after it is required. Of course, if the anxiety is inappropriate and has been caused by a disorder and not a true threat, it isn't used up at all; this is when an anxiety attack happens. Anxiety attacks cause the heart to speed up and for digestion to slow, breathing to speed up and many other changes, which all have the unfortunate affect of causing some unpleasant sensations and thoughts. Can anxiety attacks be stopped - of course they can. How? By reversing the process that caused them in the first place! Using a structured and simple technique, you can completely reset your anxiety levels back down to normal, something that neither drug therapy nor psychotherapy can do in isolation. Anxiety Symptoms Anxiety symptoms are caused by the anxiety response; they are either direct alterations of bodily systems in preparation for anxiety OR side effects of those changes. For example, during high anxiety, the digestive system is slowed down to divert resources to other parts of the body, the muscles for example. The side effect of this can be stomach cramps or discomfort. The cramps are caused by the anxiety reaction but because the sufferer has high anxiety, they can be interpreted in other ways; fears grow and the anxiety worsens. This then causes more symptoms and so on. This cycle of high anxiety can produce many sensations and thoughts that are mostly misinterpreted by the sufferer as being sinister or threatening, but they are not. Anxiety causes changes in the body that can cause symptoms just about anywhere and some can be pretty extreme; this doesn't mean they are threatening in any way and all of them will disappear when you eliminate the underlying anxiety that causes them. FACT! Anxiety Help / Support Anxiety support can be unstructured and unsupportive through conventional networks and resource shortages are usually to blame. Cost can also be an issue, with specialists such as psychologists and psychiatrists charging high hourly rates and often over long periods. The biggest problem with anxiety help and support though is accessibility. Anxiety sufferers are needy and require support, advice and reassurance during their high anxiety and not just when the specialists are available. Seamless access to answers is vital with anxiety disorders. Finding such a resource is near impossible through conventional anxiety support provisions, such as a psychology practice, medical practice or hospital. So, what is the solution to anxiety? The solution to anxiety is very simple indeed, because the subconscious mind has become 'reset' at a higher than normal level, the cure for anxiety is to reset your high anxiety back down to normal level using a structured anxiety elimination program. Be Happy & No worry.

This is my story, my anxiety triggered when I first started work and in the last 2 years I have had about 5 attacks. At first I did not know what was it, I went to a few docs and they told me off that im having food allergy. After sometime, it disappeared and I did not have it for a few months and eventually I never thought of it.
I only found out that what Iâm having is actually called anxiety last year. The worst experience of mine and it is still affecting me till today is when I had a full blown anxiety attack while driving, I thought I was going to die that day. I pushed myself but I was not able to continue, therefore decided to stop and call my friend for help. After the incident I took a month break from driving whereby I totally did not drive at all. Ever since then, Iâm having a tough time with driving. Iâm not sure what is wrong with my brain as I used to enjoy driving and even drive outstation alone last time but now Iâm so afraid to drive on the highway. Each time I drive more than 5km I can feel the abnormality in my breathing and I tend to turn back.
These actually happen 4 months ago and up to today Iâm still facing this problem. I can see that slowly im going into depression due to this issue and im having sleepless nights thinking about it.
Due to the sleepless nights, every morning when I go to work I have terrible head pain, dozing off and lack of focus. Iâm actually thinking now whether should I give up my job and concentrate on recovering myself. Iâm not sure whether this is the right decision. I seriously donât know how I am going to recover my driving. Appreciate the advice from the members here.

You'll have to learn to cope with it, it is very hard i tell you, but not impossible. It took me 6 month to let myself be brave to go out, hangout with friends at mamaks. (by this time i have medical help i.e Alprazolam) But in times, i learn to take less pills, and face the attacks, face to face without the pills, sometime i succeed, sometimes i dont. Now it has been a year. And i have learnt how breath, when its hard to breath, i learnt how to calm, when its hard to calm. But still i always have Alprazolam pills with me, in case of super duper anxiety/panic attacks. by super duper i mean, combo ah, hard to breath, tremor, disoriented, blur vision, and pain all over the body. It takes time to adjust. But im sure you will succeed too. FYI, i have daily attacks, my doctor says, not many ppl had daily attacks.

Stay strong!
I also tried hanging out with people nowadays, but I dunno I think Im very picky and can't stand some people. It's like I will have a social overload or something. For example after going out with a group of friend I'll be like "whoaaa okay I need some timeout." And I will spend some time eating and going for a jog alone for a few days (even weeks). Is that normal? But when it comes to a presentation or education related task, I try to breath calmly and try to talk really slowly to reduce my anxiety and I think I speak better in front of a class rather than speaking to a stranger. When it gets more personal, I get more anxious. This post has been edited by

I guess, what you're facing is called Social Anxiety, umm do you get the same feeling if you were out like jalan2 in the mall or crowded places? *im no doctor, i might be wrong* I also, sometimes facing problems like you. Like at home feel godamm hungry and then go out with frens, then suddenly anxiety strikes, no appetite and want to go home ASAP.
Sometimes i even force myself to eat, and then regret coz cant breath properly, feeling uneasy, sweating and such. I dont know how to help, but i always force myself to do, what scares me the most. For example, going out with frens at mamaks, or go to the movies, now i can do that, but when anxiety strikes i strengthen myself with determination, it is so hard, but i have to force my body and my mind to act normal when anxiety strikes, its like teaching my mind and body to be normal again. Up until now, which is 1 year, im living with AD, Panic Disorder, and Social Anxiety, i've down to lowest point of my life, living with depression but one day i decided, fcuk anxiety. I want my life back, so i slowly challenge myself. And things are getting better, but i also got help from the pills that my doctors gave me. I still having problems getting into crowded places, i still scared of racing heart and chest pain. I get tired easily. BUT SLOWLY IM TEACHING MY BODY TO RESET AND RETURN to it's old self. Be strong, challenge yourself, physically and mentally. That way you can overcome, but as always, i recommended you to go to a hospital first. Let the doctors sort you out.
Best regards, and stay strong!

i've rejected friends outing, i lost my chance to tackle with the girl that i like because i fear to go dating if i cannot eat.. end up she is with another guy. and i dun wan this to happen again (losing someone because of my anxiety)
i want to over this before i start to work else im doom. even my parents don't know about this. u know how i wish a lot of time like i can have memory lose of something. so that i can forget about this.

You may have anorexia nervosa intertwined with social anxiety disorder. Why don't you see a psychiatrist ? They will use counselling, hypnosis and cognitive behavioral therapy. Note that not every psychiatrist is trained in hypnosis. One is Dr Cheah Wing Yin in Sunway Medical Center. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17766567 The SNRI drug, duloxetine (Cymbalta) seems to work well in
generalized anxiety disorders. You could ask your GP to prescribe a short course at low dose for you, if you do not wish to see a psychiatrist. Note that you should not discontinue SSRIs and SNRIs suddenly. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duloxetine http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17474806/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18221755/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/19480470 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17559726 The other drug is venlafaxine (Effexor) but that would have more side effects than duloxetine. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venlafaxine Added on April 2, 2012, 5:01 am QUOTE(Brielle123 @ Apr 1 2012, 11:55 AM) I'm 17, and I'm suspecting myself from having anxiety disorder.
Should I go to see a psychologist? There is no harm is consulting one if you feel you have that. Go and see Dr Cheah Wing Yin at Sunway Medical Center. He's a psychiatrist. I think there is a psychologist there too, or in other medical centers like Pantai. This post has been edited by

QUOTE(activexxx @ Dec 25 2011, 03:49 PM) Its good to came across this AD discussion here...pls allow me to share my experience I was once a AD sufferer 2 years ago and seriously, it was not an easy experience as we need to deal with it by our own mental strength. The symptoms I get is similar to what being mentioned from previous post. I had tried consume xanax, klonopil, alpazolam, etc...but the effect only last temporarily and will haunt you back if you stop taking the meds.
What I can remember clearly that my anxiety is much related to my stomach. It started when I got this serious gastritis which leads me to bloating, cramp, difficulties in swallowing, constipation and difficulty to fart. I lost about 7 kg at that time and my condition is worst at that time...quit my job for half a year (coz too weak to focus in work). Had done a blood test, ECG, ultrasound, endoscope and the results are normal. The docs prescribe me some Nexium, famotidine, charcoal, an other GERD meds but it doesn't help at all. My stomach continues keep bloating with excessive gasses bcoz I can't pass down my gas to the bottom. Then the doc conclude it's due to stress. Then I go try TCM approach and the sinseh prescribe me some herbs to boil and drink for few weeks. Upon taking the herbs for few weeks, I got diarrhea every morning but the sinseh told me its fine coz it's removing the toxin from my intestines, so I continue with the medication. Later on, I felt much better ...my bowel movement is going from top to bottom (means i got no constipation and can release gasses easily, got more appetite and gain some weight). According to the sinseh, OUR EMOTION CAN AFFECT OUR STOMACH. Therefore, all my physical symptoms is started by my mental problem. After considering the sinseh words, I r'ber that before I have this AD, I was a person with no patience, easily get irritated, annoyed and angry. I guess this is the root problem. From that day onwards, I decided to change my lifestyle totally... - dont be a workaholic...take short breaks regularly at work...dont sit in front of the PC for a long time - sleep early and wake up before sun rises...go for a morning walk or brief jogging - do charity on weekends by visiting orphanage or old folks home...u'll noticed that by helping the needy, u'll feel that u're more fortunate and u'll appreciate ur life more and this will lead to more positive thoughts. - if u're single, go find ur soulmate...have some fun and intimacy together. - i changed my diet by taking more vege and less meat. Seldom take coffee and alcohol. - but the most important thing is worry less and be happy. I still get some mild AD on-and-off when I really stress at work now but it's still managable coz I know how to deal with it from my experience. Luckily my condition has improved now and I won't blushed away when talking to strangers and won't get panic in crowded areas. My simple advice is u need to change ur lifestyle and get rid of ur old habit/thoughts. After going through this period, I somehow feel grateful that I get this AD. This had made me to understand my body and surroundings more
*p/s: if you need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me...TQ Hi, I face the same problem like you too. Only recently my problem become worse where I felt numbness on my hand and legs, shortness of breath and dizzy. After all the test I have done with normal results then doctor prescribed me Xanax. I took few tablets then decided to stop it as I does not want to rely on drugs. I have a digestion problem which cause I have burping most of the times and gas was difficult to pass down. May I know what type of herbs that you had drink before?

if i try to eat i'll puke cause its like im forcing myself to eat. thing is everytime when go out eat my mind will automatically thoughts of this, which then cause my anxiety to come. i've been like this for like 5 years or so. im 22 this year, and its so bad that everytime i have to starve myself when its lunch time and my friends all makan i just drink. they of course did find it weird at first why i never eat, i always use the same reason, i eat at home already. i must be a freak to them by now. >< however sometimes i do manage to eat, but just a very small portion which is not me. i actually can eat quite a lot if it wasn't because of this.
i've rejected friends outing, i lost my chance to tackle with the girl that i like because i fear to go dating if i cannot eat.. end up she is with another guy. and i dun wan this to happen again (losing someone because of my anxiety)
i want to over this before i start to work else im doom. even my parents don't know about this. u know how i wish a lot of time like i can have memory lose of something. so that i can forget about this.
I suggest you should share this with your parents. Please bear in mind that AD is not a sickness/disease, it happens because you had been strong for too long...now you need someone to support you. Do let your parents know and ask them to bring you outside for some meals. This will help you alot...trust me

Hi, just a suggestion.
personally I have been through depression and met a few people who have helped me spiritually.
There's this technique by Isa Lindwall called Releasing. A facilitator will help you find out the cause of your disorder (well, actually anything such as depression, anxiety, physical illness) .. sometimes it stems from subconscious
such as trauma during childhood or teens, even simple things that happened could be imprinted in our subconscious in a -ve way way and be triggered when we reach adulthood. Once the cause has been identified, it will be "Released" simply by saying a few Releasing statement to free you and then Positive Affirmations to replace the old subconscious thoughts. It sounds too simple, but I've been reading up on the power of thought and words, and it does make sense. Plus after personal experience going through this method, I feel that I'm starting to be able to move forward in life, helping myself heal through self improvement and self awareness. I do meditation too. The facilitators will charge around RM250 per session. On my part, as I have taken an interest in spiritual healing, I feel their method also teaches me to help myself instead of depending on facilitators or healers. This depends on the proactiveness of the individual though, to learn how to be aware of their emotions and do self help for themselves. If anyone's interested I'll give the link of the lady who does Isa Lindwall's releasing technique in Malaysia. Other recommendations is to watch this movie "You can heal your life" by Louise Hay.

Anyone here who got anxiety disorder have tried an alternative approach such as fasting? Fasting works wonder!! I used to be much anxiety... but after 2++ years of fasting (on and off.. not all the times), I've gotten a lot better. Yup.. and exercising helps too. The physiological impact on the body and mind between
fasting and exercising are exceedingly similar.

Guys, I think I have anxiety too... I worried and my heart pounding suddenly without any good reasons.
Once get panic attack at home just like tiba2... I am feeling little bit cold sweat in my palm and hard to breath and like no control on your body. Luckily, its just happened once. If I feel like feeling the anxiety, I take a deep breath and distract my mind to other thing. Normally I have anxiety when I woke up in the morning and when going to bed. When I am going to sleep and feeling worried, I will play with my phone.. Maybe this happen because I feel insecure in my life especially about future and financial. Usually anxiety when I think too much about dying.. some kind of fear of
dying. Did you guys have a same thought too..? Never speak to anybody about this...

The physiological impact on the body and mind between  fasting and exercising are exceedingly similar. Hi, I was suffering from anxiety, depression and ADD (attention deficit disorder), Ive gone through craziest sh*t ever in my life. A terrible childhood and later on my parent disowned me and throw me out of the house, I was asked to leave and never come back. later on nervous migraine attacks added up the sugar. Ive got these anxiety attacks that would give me a shock like electrocuted whenever I closed my eyes at night. terrible nights that nobody deserve it. I spent money on RM 200 per hour for therapy sessions and strong anti depressant and ADD management pills like Ritalin LA, 30 Caps for Rm 200 that literally broke me with just mild effects. I searched for Alternative Lifestyle and Alternative lifestyle products in Malaysia and I found a Herbal Coffee (Dr.kalan Herbal Coffee) around 3 months ago. They claimed I could loose much of my depression, anxiety and Migraine.
The first few days of drinking it I had good hours (Those hours in day that you feel like normal humans), I first thought it was just my moods, but later on I was surprised
that it actually worked. Its been two months that I almost feel human, I have empathy for others, I Can Feel. I still have bad days, but just few minutes. The point of my words is that always look for alternatives, natural, clean alternatives that nowadays are surprising us. Most of the helps out there are available only in kuala Lumpur and are very limited, we need to learn from developed countries that embrace natural remedies that are much better than traditional and are as good as chemicals and are cheap
. From One suffered fellow to other: Mental conditions are manageable when you are ready to fight back. its an attitude. Cheers

I work in a psych hospital. If u really think u have anxiety, go to klinik kesihatan and get a ref letter to nearest psych hospital and u will get more proper treatment. Do not go to normal GP
as most of them might start u on alprazolam (xanax) which works like magic. BUT xanax is not for long term use as u might become dependant on it and it is doing more harm than good. Proper treatment for anxiety disorder is antidepressant and there are actually many types of them which can only be found in psych hospital. In this case, it is advisable to see a professional in order to treat u properly. There are some other ways beside medication such as relaxation technique and counselling. Can also seek treatment from private psych but the med will be very expensive. So the best is to see doctor in psych hospital. I am telling u this because we got lots of referral from private just because pt cannot afford to pay their med anymore...

I stop taking antidepressant because a doctor says to me that it'll fcked up my nerve systems. And that freaks me out. But after you saying that antidepressant helps to fight anxiety in the long run i might try to get back on them. Sometimes im confused. This doctor says this and the other says that.
But thanks anyway.

QUOTE(Chica @ May 28 2012, 11:17 PM) Hi, just a suggestion.  personally I have been through depression and met a few people who have helped me spiritually.
There's this technique by Isa Lindwall called Releasing. A facilitator will help you find out the cause of your disorder (well, actually anything such as depression, anxiety, physical illness) .. sometimes it stems from subconscious  such as trauma during childhood or teens, even simple things that happened could be imprinted in our subconscious in a -ve way way and be triggered when we reach adulthood. Once the cause has been identified, it will be "Released" simply by saying a few Releasing statement to free you and then Positive Affirmations to replace the old subconscious thoughts. It sounds too simple, but I've been reading up on the power of thought and words, and it does make sense. Plus after personal experience going through this method, I feel that I'm starting to be able to move forward in life, helping myself heal through self improvement and self awareness. I do meditation too. The facilitators will charge around RM250 per session. On my part, as I have taken an interest in spiritual healing, I feel their method also teaches me to help myself instead of depending on facilitators or healers. This depends on the proactiveness of the individual though, to learn how to be aware of their emotions and do self help for themselves. If anyone's interested I'll give the link of the lady who does Isa Lindwall's releasing technique in Malaysia. Other recommendations is to watch this movie "You can heal your life" by Louise Hay. Hai can you pm me too. Thanks

Hey TS, I have gone through depression/anxiety attack too. I totally understand how it feels.
I was having symptom like fast heart beat, panic, extremely afraid (feeling so uneasy), cold sweat, cold hand, hot flush, dizziness, nausea, difficulty to breath, in the end I couldn't eat and sleep at all. The feeling is terrible. One day, I felt so cold and start to trembling, again those extremely scare feeling strikes me again, I have to go to a clinic to see a doctor. Then I told him my problem and he said it's depression, he gave me some pills, something to calm me down but I couldn't remember and in the ends he only said that the only person to cure this is yourself and you'll be fine. I was so frustrated because it always easy for you all just to say it instead of doing it by yourself. But as I go through the process, it's very true on what the doctor told me. For my own opinion, don't rely on the medication, try to let go of it. I have this anxiety attack every time I went out so I feel secure when I had the medication with me because I feel like it can "relieve" my anxiety attack. As times go by, I try to replace the med with candy and cut down on taking the pill. I have candy that can sooth me, mint flavor (I felt comfortable with it). So, whenever I go out I have the candy with me so I feel secure.
Regarding on eating and sleeping, I found that banana and hot drinks before sleep help me a lot, not sure whether it's about psychologically thinking but warm drink is the best for me.
Then, I try to seek new hobby for myself, as I began to lose all my interest even doing my favorite thing before that. I found reading is very good for me and playing game. In the end, it's communication, I talk to my friends and family. It's very helpful to have someone to talk to. And when you go through this don't think that you're sick severely or being very terrible, I mean take it as an emotional flu that will happen to anyone, lessen your worry, it's very common to have this anxiety attack because before that I'm actually thinking I'm going to die because of this.
I just wanna share my experience on this and I hope it can help anyone with anxiety attack or depression.

QUOTE(annoymous1234 @ Apr 2 2012, 12:29 AM) i dont feel embarrase or anything.
if i try to eat i'll puke cause its like im forcing myself to eat. thing is everytime when go out eat my mind will automatically thoughts of this, which then cause my anxiety to come. i've been like this for like 5 years or so. im 22 this year, and its so bad that everytime i have to starve myself when its lunch time and my friends all makan i just drink. they of course did find it weird at first why i never eat, i always use the same reason, i eat at home already. i must be a freak to them by now. >< however sometimes i do manage to eat, but just a very small portion which is not me. i actually can eat quite a lot if it wasn't because of this.
i've rejected friends outing, i lost my chance to tackle with the girl that i like because i fear to go dating if i cannot eat.. end up she is with another guy. and i dun wan this to happen again (losing someone because of my anxiety)
i want to over this before i start to work else im doom. even my parents don't know about this. u know how i wish a lot of time like i can have memory lose of something. so that i can forget about this.
Hmm, I have the same problem with you. Try to eat in very small portion maybe.
This even happened to me when I'm eating with my parents. The first time my mom even scold me for that, she thought I wasn't eating anything the whole day and cause the lost of appetite. Then she knew. Best way for me is don't force yourself but maybe try small portion. Maybe ask your friend out for dessert or something, sharing same meal so that eat little bit by little bit.

I am a Clinical Hypnotherapist who works in a proactive healthcare centre. I am using biofeedback and clinical hypnotherapy to help my clients and it works. Anxiety reducing interventions using biofeedback has proven to be effective. People can monitor their physiological responses and thus learn how to gain control over them.

You have to use the linden method. It's available in apple store for iPad and iPhone. Trust me you will recover as long as you never skip the process mentioned there. Don't worry thousands of ppl like me recovered with the linden method .

I went to local hospital, they all malas to layan anxiety patient like me.
But thanks to them i have my heart and my thyroid checked. which is im okay. Wow I've been surfing this forum since 2009, but I didn't knew there is such thread. Yes I went to local hospital before which is Hospital Malaya. I've went there like 10 years ago. Yeah 10 years ago. I've always reach there early and earlier than most of the patient, but I'm always wasting my hours of time waiting while those who reach late can enter first. After I entered, they did not ask your actual problem, instead they just ask like your biodata and condition and that's it. Lol Anyway I've seen Miss Leong Huey Mei for 4 session that time as well which she is at hospital pantai that time. It is a really expensive session for my family that time and it's even expensive for now. I've tried to google her and found out that she went to gleneagles hospital. If possible can anyone reconfirm with me regarding this details? I really like to meet her again in between the 10 years, but due to my family financial problem and myself as well. My parents also discourage me not to meet her due to unknown reason. Now I have started working I want to meet her again as my problem still have not solve yet. Although I think is not that serious as before. This post has been edited by

hey guys im gonna be honest, i broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years a month ago and i've been experiencing loss of appetite(my appetite has literally cut in half),sudden mood swings, lost 5 kg already, have weird sleeping patterns, i get panic attacks almost every day been using breathing techniques lately which is helping a bit, stomach doesn't feel well. Wake up to nightmares most of the nights. I thought it would go away but it's been a month. There is still some things going on between me and her which could explain much about why it has lasted till now. Chest gets tight and difficulty when breathing quite frequent. So really need some advice. I'm just a college student and this has been really affecting my studies, luckily some of my lecturers are nice and helpful, but i cant really keep focus in class. Not sure if can just go clinic for this? This post has been edited by

I did it when i first had the symptoms way back, when everytime i went to the ER for a heart check up fearing that i might have a heart attack, but turns out im okay. That is when i turn to google for answer. WHICH IS A BAD MOVE. Everyone please DONT do that. I am diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder with depression, cardiophobia and agoraphobia. Recovering and my meds are reduced. I am so glad that i now can control myself. Been living in fear for so long. Now i am proud to say that i can fight my anxiety.

i think i have anxiety disorder. i got a baby in June 2013. we both working couple. after my wife 3 months confinement, we send our baby to nursery, i have to drive them from puchong to hartamas, which is about 100km daily drive. Routine and stressful. My work also stressful. At the same time, my brother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and my father attempted suicide. Initially, i thought i got heart attack. But full blood test and stress test, cardiologist said no problem. My GP recommended me to Putrajaya hospital to see psychologist. I have low sugar level, stomach digestion problem, insomnia. Symptoms are like, dizzy, panic attack, cold sweat, palm sweating, suddenly wanna go home when eating out, negative thought feeling like wanna commit suicide, tight head, sometimes dont wanna have long/short conversation. I have tried hybnotherapy and deep breathing... not so effective. I exercise everyday, it helps a bit. I dont have insomnia now after taking flower tea. Psychiatrist in Gleneagle gave me lexapro. But i stop taking it after 2 pill. Felt sleepy and easy forget thing. Agree, NEVER GOOGLE YOUR SYMPTOMS. Right now, i can control the anxiety and manage to finish the task, but the feeling is shit. Any suggestion is welcome to help me.
PLS HELP.

One is never too smart to learn. It is just that you have to be a bit discrete and not expect one's many medical problems to be solved with a few clicks of the mouse. Right now, i can control the anxiety and manage to finish the task, but the feeling is shit. Any suggestion is welcome to help me.  PLS HELP. When you said you tried hypnotherapy, was it in consultation with a psychiatrist or psychologist trained in this field ? Not many in the country have training in this specialized field. I checked Gleneagles' directory and none of them seem to have a postgraduate diploma or certificate in hypnosis.

Tham, I went to Putrajaya Hospital. I am not sure whether she is trained in hypnotherapy, but she is a psychologist. You can google online on hypnotherapy. It is just telling your subconscious mind on good thing.

Yes, I know about hypnosis. Quite a number of studies showing it is useful for depression and anxiety, even physical diseases like heart failure. https://forum.lowyat.net/index.php?showtopi...entry68262633 https://forum.lowyat.net/index.php?showtopi...entry66162138 https://forum.lowyat.net/index.php?act=ST&f...post&p=60688815 So she tried hypnosis on you ?

hypotherapist, rather than try self-hypnosis.
They practice EFT as well, which can also help your situation. Their links have been given above.
This practice seems worth checking out. http://www.joycehue.com.my And why not
try one or two of the many supplements and herbs given in the links above, like 5-HTP, magnesium threonate and St John's Wort ? This post has been edited by

I also experience this problem at one point of time. That time I easily short of breath and suddenly woke up in the middle of the sleep. I even ask doctor if I got take anti-depression medication but the doctor said mine is mild type and so no need first. Later somehow, those symptoms slowly gone. After reading a book about this, I realize that several way which can help is to find the right community (ie church small group) whom you can trust to share it out.
Medication/drugs is to be last resort. We need medication sometimes because it has to do with our biological chemical and when we can't really sleep. But medication gotta be prescribed by certified doctor due to its side-effect and dependency (meaning, we need to take it then only can sleep.). I also learn that mental disorder can be quite difficult to diagnose. I mean for physical illness, we can go for check up, there is many of types of check, test (CT scan, MRI scan, X-ray). But no machine can check for our mental illness. Only can diagnose by looking at the symptoms as a whole. Example for bipolar / manic depression there are the common signs and symptoms: - Feeling unusually âhighâ and optimistic OR extremely irritable - Unrealistic, grandiose beliefs about oneâs abilities or powers - Sleeping very little, but feeling extremely energetic - Talking so rapidly that others canât keep up - Racing thoughts; jumping quickly from one idea to the next - Highly distractible, unable to concentrate - Impaired judgment and impulsiveness - Acting recklessly without thinking about the consequences - Delusions and hallucinations (in severe cases)
And best to be treated as early as possible although it is easier to be said than done.. This post has been edited by

Hate to say this, but the natural cure to fix this problem is to go out, meet people or small marijuana intake.

? No, I am not. If you had bothered to read the links to my earlier posts (which I don't believe you had) when I had given above, you would have noted that I had given info on three centers in
town staffed by psychologists who also practice hypnotherapy and EFT. Remember that they are not psychiatrists. Those centers were not easy to find and took some time to search on the net, and I posted them here for the forum users' info, not for canvassing clients. I don't know the background of any of them. I took the trouble to reply and pick that one for you because they also have a practice
in Mont Kiara, near my office in Sri Hartamas, and they also appeared professional,
not because I am affilated with them.
Hynotherapy is still a relatively new field in this country, and you would be hard pressed to locate a psychiatrist who also knows hypnosis. Dr Cheah Wing Yin in Sunway is currently the only psychiatrist in town whom
I know of with such training. He used hypnosis on me when he was with UKM in GH in 1988 in an attempt to treat my tinnitus. Given your difficult condition, I am surprised that you view my post as an
attempt to solicit business from you. I suggest then that you go back to your previous psychiatrist and ask if he
knows hypnosis.

A terrible childhood and later on my parent disowned me and throw me out of the house, I was asked to leave and never come back. later on nervous migraine attacks added up the sugar. Ive got these anxiety attacks that would give me a shock like electrocuted whenever I closed my eyes at night. terrible nights that nobody deserve it. I spent money on RM 200 per hour for therapy sessions and strong anti depressant and ADD management pills like Ritalin LA, 30 Caps for Rm 200 that literally broke me with just mild effects. I searched for Alternative Lifestyle and Alternative lifestyle products in Malaysia and I found a Herbal Coffee (Dr.kalan Herbal Coffee) around 3 months ago. They claimed I could loose much of my depression, anxiety and Migraine.  The first few days of drinking it I had good hours (Those hours in day that you feel like normal humans), I first thought it was just my moods, but later on I was surprised  that it actually worked. Its been two months that I almost feel human, I have empathy for others, I Can Feel. I still have bad days, but just few minutes. The point of my words is that always look for alternatives, natural, clean alternatives that nowadays are surprising us. Most of the helps out there are available only in kuala Lumpur and are very limited, we need to learn from developed countries that embrace natural remedies that are much better than traditional and are as good as chemicals and are cheap
. From One suffered fellow to other: Mental conditions are manageable when you are ready to fight back. its an attitude. Cheers hi there. i was prescribed seroquel xr since 2008 for cognitive difficulties. i have now learnt that those issues might be caused by my deviated septum and sinusitis. however, in 2008, i was given the diagnosis of bipolar depression, despite stating i do not have the extreme high and lows of emotional swings.
my question is, how did you managed to get ritalin together with anti depressant? i am currently getting my seroquel xr from government hospital.
Dr Kalan Herbal Coffee seems like a good alternative, did it help you with focusing and concentration (cognitive) as well? Furtheremore, how quick you get it after you purchase it online?

would like to ask what causes panic attack actually? depression? misuse of medicine? my mom was diagnosed having schizophrenia last 2 months. then doctor prescribed her with lorazepam 1mg on daily basis. soon after she has been discharged from hospital, she is so dependent on lorazepam to the extent that she will have panic attack every 2 days if she doesnt take FULL lorazepam 1mg for a day.
very headache to see my mom having panic attack symptoms, and these symptoms can last more than 8 hours sometimes
i actually brought her to see doctor, doctor just changed the medicine to T.Xanax 0.5mg. however, we couldn't get the medicine because of no stock in hospital.
so now my mom is still taking lorazepam 1mg.

im also looking for a good psychiatrist. my friends around me told me that i need to go to private specialist if i want to get the experienced one (going govt hospital may take time to queue)

good to hear tat she cut the lorezapam intake into 2.. hv been there b4, the withdrawal is debilitating yo.. maybe u can try dr yen
teck hoe
n dr lee aik hoe.. both was used to be the president of MPA.. n they r very famous .. dr lee aik hoe medication fee is expensive though..
my humble suggestion is to treat her until she is in remission 1st then only c GH dr to minimize the budget..... again, good luck

dunno what to do now. You might wanna consider EFT therapy. My friend Jack is a licensed practitioner of the Emotional Freedom Technique(EFT). I tried some session from him before and it is good. If you keen, you can contact him and tell him that my name is Steve Ngai. More info and testimony -
http://www.akusihat.com/eft-tapping-therapy/ Btw, his charges is very reasonable, in fact below market rate. This post has been edited by

How does your heartbeat feels like, does it cause your head and chest to vibrate when lying down on bed. Tell me your experience. If you been suffering from panic attacks it should only last for a brief period like for only 10 to 15 mins, after that you should expect relieve and the feeling is awfull, as if you are having a heart attack or something. Did you checked your thyroid gland by the way. Thyroid problems are known to cause anxiety attacks and is associated with hyperthyroidism E.g. Graves Disease. Hashimoto Thyroiditis is another thyroid disease it causes hypothyroidism. However both of them are autoimmune disease where your white blood cell attack the thyroid tissue. Another problems associated with thyroid is nodules, some are overactive and produce alot of Thyroxine in the body. which cause your heart to race and metabolism to speed up. Most thyroid problems can be eliminated by eating proper amount of iodine rich food. E.g Fish, eggs, seaweed and iodized table salt. Consult your Doctor to determine if it is your thyroid that is causing the problem.
