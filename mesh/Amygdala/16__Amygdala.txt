What’s An Almond?
An almond tree is small, growing to between 4 and 10 meters in height, with a trunk of up to 30 centimetres in diameter.
The almond is a native to an area stretching from
Pakistan , westwards to
Syria ,
Israel , and
Turkey .
It can now be found in the United States, most commonly in California.
The word "almond" comes from Old French almande or alemande, late Latin amandola, derived through a form amingdola from the Greek αμυγδαλη (cf
Amygdala ), an almond.
Global production of almonds is around 1.7 million tons, with a low of 1 million tonnes in 1995 and a peak of 1.85 million tonnes in 2002 according to
Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) figures. [8]
According to the FAO, world production of almonds was 1.76 million tons in 2006.   In the United States, production is concentrated in
California , with almonds being California's third leading agricultural product and its top agricultural export in 2008. California produces 80% of the world’s almonds and 100% of the U.S. commercial supply. California exported almonds valued at 1.08 billion dollars in 2003, about 70% of total California almond crop.
Americans love Almonds primarily as a healthy snack food, alone or mixed with fruit or other foods.
