But at least it was not me that teared in the end hahahaha but more on that later! Being a really great fan of food, and I admit I ain't really some type of expert when it comes to food when all I ever do is enjoy them, I sometimes would love to try new things if ever my stomach permits it as most of my friends know, my stomach is a killer machine which will kill me at the slightest touch of chilli even though I love them damn! Well, earlier this week, myself and the usual's was invited over to Frontera Bar & Grill to sample some of their most famous dishes by which the restaurant serves authentic Texan and
Mexican food . That's right, when I said authentic, I really meant it because the ingredients, or spices and chilli's that are used in their dishes are specially imported from the states just to preserve the authentic taste of Texan and Mexican food that you really can't find anywhere in the county. Located at a pretty new but well known place to most people in PJ, Jaya One, this little eatery is housed at just the perfect spot to chill, have a great time and enjoy great food all at a lil corner and oh, it also houses a bar which makes the perfect margarita, the best that I have ever tasted so far, which is the Agave
Margarita . Agave Margarita Made from
agave nectar , this mean cocktail is served with a 45ml shot instead of the usual 25ml shot which was taught to us that original shots are supposed to be in 45ml shot cups, instead of the 25ml that we are so used to seeing in most bars and clubs. The Agave Margarita also boasts of its first of its kind trait, which is that there will definitely be no hangovers the next day, no matter how much you take. How's that for awesome alcohol haha! Larry, the owner of the restaurant was a pretty interesting dude to chat with as we divulged into many different types of topics, from food to ingredients, to the country and also the states, and even other foods and oh, even the blogging world! Thanks Larry for the invitation, and also to Anju as well. Chips with Salsa Dip Chips were served after being introduced to the Agave Margarita and boy do they have many different dips for their chips. First of all, would be the
salsa dip
which was pretty much the same as many other salsa sauce but the one that you should all try would be the Chilli Con Queso dip whereby, being different from the many different dips available out there, this cream based chip dip is a heavenly cheese galore and a definite must try for all cheese lovers out there! Chips with Chilli Con Queso Dip Served warm and made from Monterrey Cheese, this dip is superb and it got a two thumbs up from the all-cheese-lover, Jen whom is always desperate trying to try all things cheese and still searching for the cheese paradise here in Malaysia! Chips with Chili Con Carne Dip The third dip is the Chili Con Carne dip which is a meat based salsa and is served with onion toppings which kinds of reminds me of a burger all minced up and mixed with salsa sauce. Wasn't really my favourite of the 3 due to the awesome cheese dip but for meat lovers, this could definitely be your thing! Frontera Nachos And as if our tables was not already filled with chips, we were then served with Frontera Nachos which did not look like
nachos
to me at first and here I was stoning at the table wondering what it was while trying to take pictures of it! Geek nature calls first before brains haha! Topped with cheese first, a slice of chilli and for it's garnishing, some tomatoes and lettuce it is certainly something different from the usual nachos that I am served with at other restaurants oh, and a pretty good finger food too. It is a pretty satisfying appertizer and I loved it, anything on cheese goes well with me haha! Taquitos de Pollo The Taquitos de Pollo came shortly after the nachos which looked really similiar to kuih kapet if you have seen it before haha but it's a totally different thing. Truth is, this wasn't really my favorite appetizer of the lot although it contains the Frontera chicken and was wrapped with corn tortillas, it didn't exactly do much for me as I could barely taste the chicken. Habanero Chicken Wings Now the Habanero Chicken Wings, that is something to talk about. Once it was down on the table, everybody was trying to have a go at it but not before I took some pictures haha! Served with some habanero BBQ sauce and cilantro
ranch dressing , the wings literally melted in my mouth and damn myself for being a photographer as I could not dirty my hands with more wings or rather, I'm just really nice that way and I let everybody have a go at it haha! Chimichanga
(Choice of Beef/Chicken) The Chimichanga arrived next together with the Tex Mex Burrito and boy did both look the same to me and the only difference between the twi is the the Burrito is not fried and the Chimichanga
is. Both made out of homemade flour tortilla topped with
Chili Con Queso
and diced tomatoes and served on the side is
refried beans
and some Mexican rice while both servings comes in a choice of either beef or chicken. Tex Mex Burrito (Choice of Beef/Chicken) Those 2 dishes were not my type of dish and surprisingly, it was the only Mexican food as well and it also goes the same for the Tacos that contains the same sidelines as the above dishes. The taco is filled with either a choice of seasoned beef or shredded chicken and I guess you can't really take my word for it because since it is of course my taste and who knows, you might like it when I don't. Tacos (Choice of Beef/Chicken) With even more dishes filling up the table, we really thought that this could be our last supper because we were presented with a feast next with many different types of main dish and boy was the table seriously full to the brim! Frontera Beef Ribs The Frontera Beef Ribs is said to be the best beef ribs so far by the usuals but to tell you the truth, I can never tell when it comes to ribs. I'm just never in-tuned haha for ribs and although it was tender and juicy and being especially light and really well prepared, the mash potatoe caught my eye because I am a huge fan of mash potatoes haha, sorry Larry lol. Cajun Fish and Chips Cajun Fish and Chips was also pretty ordinary due to the fact that it's pretty much the same everywhere and also, it could be your safest bet to dining if you're not feeling adventurous because with fish and chips, what can really go wrong? Chili Cheese Burger (Beef) But what comes next was my second favorite dish of the night, the Chili Cheese Burger which comes with either a choice of beef or chicken and comes with it is real meaty tastes! I am a huge fan of burgers and when I tell you that Frontera has the best burgers around, you better believe it! The Chicken Ranch Sandwhich was the ultimate favorite among the burgers by which with it's tender meat being so juicy and tasting so good, you will in fact want more and this is real because I am really, a beef fan more than chicken and to my surprise, the Chicken Ranch Sandwhich tops the beef burger by a whopping 10 times more on my scale of awesomeness! Chicken Ranch Sandwhich Life is great and I can die happy already.... Dining here can really be a fun time and when it comes to the late night drinking sessions, be entertained by the legendary Margarita-making Machine as you witness him whoop you some drinks and if you do head down over there, take my advice! Must try - Patron XO Cafe You have got to try the Patron XO Cafe because I had never tasted a coffee based alchohol so good in my life and if I'm not mistaken, you can't get this anywhere else unless you import it yourself! And if you're into something a whole lot different and wanting some tingly action, check out the Jalapeno Margarita as it is guaranteed to tickle your tongue, litteraly! Oh and do try the chilli test, ask Larry and he'll be glad to entertain you with some of the hottest and some fun tingling sensation chillies available! Check it out at : Frontera Bar & Grill No. 18-8-2 Block L, Palm Square, Jaya One Jalan University, Petaling Jaya. T +603 7958 8515 F +603 7958 8125 PS: Pictures by myself and Nigel

As far as I remember, I don't think that I have once celebrated my birthday on a very big scale before, and the biggest was during my 21st birthday party back at my old house organized by my parents which housed roughly about 30+ people consisting of friends and family. Heck, I had never even celebrated my birthday in a club before lol! But all that is about to change... Being 5 years old, is although new but a very ripe age to be because at 5, you have already learned many of the basic things in life and already some at 5, are improvising on making their 5th year since conceived, the best that they have experienced! And that people, is how
Zouk
KL does it!! Celebrating it's 5th anniversary at it's one and only venue in

where people in costumes dancing together, mingling till the wee hours of the morning all celebrating their one and only time of birthday together. And really thousands of people celebrating it the same day, awesome or not leh? How about I put it this way, imagine the pink hippos in
Disney's

Not to miss is the 4Play dancers whom will turn you up and make things hot as the night progresses! Velvet Deep Blue Room

Especially when there are so many talented ones in the country! I have always been a noob when it came to
fashion , even when dressing myself. I'm sure that many whom have known me for quite some time will always see me in either long sleeve or short sleeve shirts coupled with
jeans
or slacks. For guys, it is kind of easy to dress up and impress others but when it comes to ladies, heck it is confusing as hell can get.. And I still am even though people keep educating me haha! Well recently, I attended an event called FASHFAB which is founded by
TwentyOne Kitchen + Bar
and yes it has become the place to be to get a great dining experience mixed with a bit of social or business rendezvous. Now, through the introduction of FASHFAB, Twenty-One Kitchen + Bar is presenting us with a platform for up and coming
fashion designers
to showcase some of their creative yet elegant designs to the public. This March 5th was the showcase of Safira's Wardrobe from Mênê by Anusha where this collection centralises on a collection to be made in relation to every women and thus is categorized in 3 different categories, semi casual wear,
cocktail
wear and evening wear. And man it was pretty interesting and oh here are the models and the clothes they wore: The designer, Anusha FASHFAB has opened a new door to me in fashion
photography
as well as in learning more and more about fashion. Therefore, FashFab upcoming events will always feature new and exciting series of other upcoming talented designers. If you're interested, do drop by and remember, the next FASHFAB is on April 2nd 2009 and it happens every first Thursday of the month only at TwentyOne Kitchen + Bar. For more information on the venue and the whereabouts of it, do check out it's main site
