Margarita Sorbet
Here’s the second of the flavours we’re doing for our
Mexican Fiesta  at the rapidly approaching
Dingle Food and Wine Festival . Margarita sorbet should be a real crowd pleaser, and we’re certainly quite enamoured of it.
There are as many stories about the origins of the
Margarita
as there are ways of making it. A classic Margarita would generally have tequila,
triple sec
(such as Cointreau) and lime juice. The ratio varies, but a typical one would be (in order of the above) 2:1:1. It’s a drink I love in all its variations, as long as I can lay my hands on good tequila (which is not always easy in these parts). Way back when I lived in Texas, my favourite Mexican restaurant,
Fonda San Miguel  served the most amazing frozen varieties.
For the ice cream, we’ve done it with and without the triple sec, and I think I prefer the latter. I’m not sure why that is, for I certainly like the hint of orange in the drink. We also like it with a little lemon, but you can substitute lime. I’ll leave it up to you!

Margarita Sorbet
Ingredients:
340 gr sugar
500 ml spring water
100 ml good tequila (or a combination of tequila and triple sec)
300 ml freshly squeezed lime juice
60 ml lemon juice (or more lime juice)
Pinch of salt
What to do:
Boil the water, then remove from the heat.
Stir in the sugar, until it is completely dissolved.
Cover immediately and cool completely.
Stir in the tequila, lime, and lemon juice.
Taste it to make sure you like it!
Freeze using a domestic ice cream machine, or cover and place in the freezer, stirring at 1 hr intervals to break up the ice.
Note:
It’s hard to make sorbet without an ice cream machine. You will need to interrupt the freezing process and stir, or you will be left with a block of ice! The more times you do this, the better the consistency will be.

Step 5 sounds like the best part! I wonder how high you can push the alcohol without it becoming a frappe?

Push away!!! I didn’t say in the post above, but if you cut the sugar (maybe to half) and added more booze (triple it, I’d say), and followed all the other steps, you’d have a decent (semi) frozen margarita! I’ve done it, but it’s been a while and I’ve forgotten exactly. Worth a bit of research, I’d say…

Hi Kieran! As usual you’re a mine of information. I’ve always wondered what Tipple Sec was, but have never bothered to investigate! Ironic considering that I’ve always loved orange liqueurs. Der.
As for the Margarita Sorbet; I just wish I was a fan of Tequila. Now that I’ve got this recipe and can substitute some of the T for Cointreau; I might just try it! Anyway, if it doesn’t work out DG loves Margarita’s, so it wont go to waste!!! The slushy variety sounds even better…

These recipes sound fantastic. I’m not going to be able to make it to Dingle unfortunately but would really like to try some of these flavours. Do you have any recommendations for a basic home icecream maker?

I’d just get a cheap machine and then if you make lots, you can consider spending more. From my experience, there’s not a whole lot of difference between brands with the inexpensive machines…
