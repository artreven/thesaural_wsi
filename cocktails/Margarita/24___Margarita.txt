Re: Mixed Drinks
I am not a fan of mixed drinks and cocktails and i certainly don't suggest drinking more than one kind of alcohol beverage in the same run, i have pretty bad experiences about that.
Just picking a good choice of beverage suited for the way you are going to drink and sticking with it is the most efficient way, in my opinion.

I like my drinks plain. Except few, some are just impossible to drink plain.

Re: Mixed Drinks
Alcoholic root beer sounds immensely rewarding. I have to try that tomorrow!
Personally, my demands aren't very high when it comes to drinking, so I'll just do something easy, such as pouring liquor into soda, lemonade, juice, or whatever. When I don't have liquor, cheap (but relatively high ABV) beers such as King Cobra do the job.

Re: Mixed Drinks
I'll try to give you a serious response. If you find my response a failure, check the damn menu!
(MUST): You need to try these if you have never done so.
What I drink:
Favourite (Expensive):
Strawberry Daiquiri
(MUST)
Favourite (Cheap):
Highball
(MUST)
Other:
Screwdriver
(MUST)
Other:
Manhattan
(MUST)
What I don't drink but you can take my advice and drink away:
Almost all
Margarita 's. I find the simple Margarita's taste better. Try to get as
classic
as possible.
The very famous Cape Cod(der) (Vodka + Cranberry Juice). (MUST)
The very famous
Tequila Sunrise . (MUST)
Try some Sake if available!
Finally, this is pretty famous in my country, but I've never tried much local drinks, but, if available, I'm sure my countrymen would recommend
Trinidad Rum Punch .
A last word of advice: If ever in doubt, a Highball or a Screwdriver will always do the trick.
Interesting link:

Say your prayers,
And you'll need them,
GravedamN.

Re: Mixed Drinks
here is a good one to do by yourself if you are motivated.
Make some lemon juice
Make some green lime juice
Melt some sugar with water and a lime leaf until it turns into syrup
Mix the syrup with the two juices and add some vodka (vodka = half the juice volume, and adjust the next time if you prefer it stronger)
Put that thing in the freezer, when it's frozen put it in the blender and mix, it's ready to drink, I add some vodka on it and a fresh cut of lemon but that's optional
Luxury item : Girls

If you wanna see it this way, yes, except lemonade is easier to make, there is no syrup phase etc and it has less taste.

Re: Mixed Drinks
I like tonic, and I love gin. Gin&tonic is fine - yeah I'm boring.
But out of the three things I drink (the other two being whisky and cognac) this is the only one that I fancy drink mixed with something else (strictly with tonic, tho).

Actually, it's very different from lemonade and vodka ( Amazon Street Lemonade )
This is a bit more complex, and is traditionally served as a Martini.

That's not a basic lemonade, but it seems to work better.

Never tried either Black or White Russian, or any coffee liqueur at all.

Whiskey and Cognac are genuinely good straight.
Now that i think about it, only drinks i drink with a mix is vodka because it tastes like cologne and turkish raki which also tastes like cologne but flavored.
I tried a lot of drinks too.
