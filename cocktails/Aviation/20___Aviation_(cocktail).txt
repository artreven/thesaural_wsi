I take it all back about the Aviation
A perfect ashy-purple drink.
It's not technically an
Aviation , but the Violetta at the Ashland Springs Hotel in Ashland, Oregon is very close. When I saw it on the menu I could barely contain my excitement given that, per the comments on my recent post, I clearly hadn't experienced a proper Aviation.
Right you all were. The Violetta contains Aviation gin ( made in Portland ),  Deviation dessert wine
(in place of maraschino liqueur), creme de violette, and lemon juice. The bartender drops in a tiny viola and though the color is less lavender than sooty, it's exquisitely beautiful. It is also delicious -- delicate and aromatic. The Violetta/Aviation makes a Negroni, my favorite cocktail of recent months, taste coarse and brassy. I think it's a good sign that I no longer like Manhattans (at all!) and that I may now be transitioning from Negronis to something daintier. Soon, I'll be a white wine spritzer drinker, and, after that, maybe just spritzer. A girl can dream.
All hotel lobbies should look like this.
Today we see
plays . Isabel loves plays and while I do not love plays, I do love Isabel.

this is rae 6/29/11, 6:23 AM Jennifer, you totally inspired me! Not long ago I shot down to DC for a one-day business trip, and at dinner I ended up at this gorgeous restaurant that specialized in speakeasy-era cocktails. First on the menu? Aviation. Your blog post popped up in my head and I ordered it. It was totally divine. I'm glad you tried it again and were won over, because I was too. Cheers. Reply Delete Ginny Lee 7/1/11, 3:14 AM I am not a big play person but I think I could be happy at a Shakespeare festival especially an outdoor one if only for the picnic opportunities....must buy creme de violette :) Reply Delete Melanie 7/1/11, 7:18 AM I have great memories of seeing plays in Ashland. Enjoy yourself! Reply Delete RuthWells 7/1/11, 5:08 PM If this trajectory toward white wine spritzers continues, you'll have to rename the blog "The Can't-Quite-Get-a-Buzz-On Baker"... Reply Delete Ginny Lee 7/1/11, 5:54 PM got it! posted :) Reply Delete Alissa 12/27/11, 1:01 AM I know a great
aviation accident attorney , but I can see we're talking about a different aviation here! Hope you had a great time. Reply Delete Anonymous 11/23/12, 9:46 AM uqctfqfc

CURRENTLY COOKING THROUGH
The Hakka Cookbook
by Linda Lau Anusasananan
Cookbooks We've Survived
River Cottage Veg Everyday by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. Shelf essential? A stalwart and worthy tome, but no.
Fika by Anna Brones and Johanna Kindvall. Shelf essential? Charming. Yes.
Burma , by Naomi Duguid. Shelf essential? Yes.
The Suriani Kitchen
by Lathika George .
Shelf essential? If you consider a Suriani cookbook a cornerstone of any respectable collection, yes.
Bread and Chocolate , by Fran Gage. Shelf essential? A lovely little book, but no.
The Cuisines of Spain , by Teresa Barrenechea. Shelf essential? No.
Mozza , by Nancy Silverton. Shelf essential? For the pizza dough and the meatballs, yes.
Tender , by Nigel Slater .
Shelf essential? In my view, no.
The Best of the Best from California
Shelf essential? Oh no. No, no, no.
Soul of a New Cuisine , by Marcus Samuelsson. Shelf essential? No. Some good African-inspired recipes here, but not enough.
Super Natural Every Day , By Heidi Swanson. Shelf essential? A beautiful and thoughtful book. Yes.
Guy Fieri Food , by Guy Fieri. Shelf essential? No. Full of over-the-top, outlandish dishes (Irish nachos?) that most people won't want to cook often, if ever.
Around My French Table
by Dorie Greenspan. Shelf Essential? Yes. One of the most reliable and charming cookbooks I've ever worked from. A should-be classic.
Ethan Stowell's New Italian Kitchen , by Ethan Stowell. Shelf essential? On the cusp, but no. Lovely, though.
Mixt Salads , by Andrew Swallow. Shelf essential? No.
Stir , By Barbara Lynch. Shelf essential? Yes. An approachable and reliable book by a renowned Boston chef.
Ad Hoc at Home , By Thomas Keller. Shelf essential? An enormous, beautiful book with some great recipes, but no.
The Pioneer Woman Cooks
by Ree Drummond. Shelf essential? On my shelf, yes. I wouldn't dare to speak for anyone else.
Top Secret Recipes Unlocked
by Todd Wilbur
Moro
by Sam & Sam Clark. Shelf essential? Yes. An all-time favorite. A brilliant and fascinating book about the cuisines of North Africa and the Mediterranean.
Gourmet Today
edited by Ruth Reichl. Shelf Essential? No. Not a bad book, but it can't decide if it's aspiring to be an all-purpose classic or something else entirely. It's neither. Recipes are mostly solid, few outstanding.
Mexico, One Plate at a Time by
Rick Bayless . Shelf essential? No, but a very useful and reliable Mexican cookbook.
Into the Vietnamese Kitchen
by Andrea Nguyen. Shelf essential? Yes. An excellent primer on an extremely exotic and enticing cuisine.
The Sweet Life in Paris
by David Lebovitz. Shelf essential? Yes. The Breton buckwheat cake is worth the price of the book. Ditto the chocolate-coconut marshmallows.
A Homemade Life
by Molly Wizenberg. Shelf Essential? Yes. This is a lovely memoir with some very lovely recipes.
Milk
by Anne Mendelson. Shelf essential? If you want a deeper understanding of fresh dairy products, yes.
Fat
by Jennifer McLagan. Yes, unless you're a vegan.
How to Cook Everything Vegetarian
by Mark Bittman. Shelf essential? Yes. Even for meat eaters.
Platter of Figs
by David Tanis. The jury is still out -- we have to test a few more menus -- but we're guessing no.
The Splendid Table
by Lynne Rossetto Kasper. Shelf essential? Absolutely. This is a truly splendid cookbook.
Eat Me
by Kenny Shopsin. Shelf Essential? Oh yes, though less for the whack recipes than for the cantankerous Shopsin persona.
Charleston Cuisine
by Louis Osteen. Shelf essential? No. Extravagant restaurant food and slapdash recipe-writing.
Arabesque
by Claudia Roden. Shelf essential? Excellent cookbook, but no. Not if you already own her classic Book of Middle Eastern Food.
The Whimsical Bakehouse
by Liv and Kaye Hansen. Shelf essential? No, but cute.
The Art of Simple Food by
Alice Waters . Shelf essential? Yes. Definitely a primer, but a fabulous one. Can I just point out that while the recipes are terrific the book has the charisma of a turnip?
The Best of the Best from Alaska . Shelf essential? No. For kitsch lovers only. Abounds in canned soup casseroles and moose teriyakis. Undoubtedly, Sarah Palin has a copy.
The Cuisine of California
by Diane Rossen Worthington. Shelf essential? No. Dated.
Revolutionary Chinese Cookbook
by Fuchsia Dunlop. Shelf essential? Yes, especially if you're a Chinese food fanatic and want to delve into its regional cuisines. Though some of the recipes are too weird even for me, the beef with cumin was one of the best things I've ever cooked.
The Seventh Daughter
by Cecilia Chiang. Shelf essential? Sure, though if there's only room in your collection for one "basic" Chinese cookbook go for Barbara Tropp's Modern Art of Chinese Cooking.
My Bombay Kitchen
by Niloufer Ichaporia King. Shelf essential? Yes! Why? Cardamom cake. And everyone needs one Parsi cookbook.
