Church & State: This Time It’s Personal
I hate to tell you wonderful readers about things not available to the general public, but sometimes it’s just too good.  You’ve read about
Wisdom ,
Church & State , and
Fruit Bat
on this blog before.  But until, now, it wasn’t
personal .
Last night saw an event of epic mixology proportions hosted at
Church & State
on H Street.   Erik Holzherr , the owner and genius behind these three bars, was on hand to tutor contestants in a make-your-own-drink competition at the
Smorgie
and
Catoctin Creek -sponsored event.
Besides learning how hard it is to just create something fantastic out of thin air, I learned some
fascinating tidbits
about the world of cocktails.  I can’t believe I got along without them.
Bitters .  Bitters have always seemed mysterious to me, but they needn’t.  Bitters are essentially a way to add depth to a drink, keeping it from being flat and boring.  Think tannins in red wine.
Vermouth .  Many people are afraid of vermouth, but play it off as being discerning.
Oh, yes, I’ll take mine bone dry .  No, really, vermouth adds a definite something.  At Church & State, you can ask for a
martini
(gin or vodka) in the following way:
Bone dry=No vermouth
Dry=11/1
Regular=5/1
Wet=3/1
Dirty=Add olive brine
ODB=Lots of brine
There is still some debate about the merits of shaking versus stirring.  We know
what James Bond would say , but at least at Church & State, you can specify to have it stirred.  Otherwise, they’ll
shake the hell out of it.
Needless to say, the drinks on the menu, or
Bill of Rights , at
Church & State
are amazingly good.  The
Sophomore Sazerac #2
is also served at Wisdom.  The bartender swirls the glass with absinthe before pouring the cold magic into a chilled glass, then topping it off with a burned piece of lemon peel.
The
Chuck Yeager
(gin, lemon juice, cherry liqueur and lavender bitters) is named after the first American to break the sound barrier, and is a spin on the classic
Aviation .  Its tart syrupy-ness was a nice departure from hard-nosed cocktails on the menu like the
Old Fashioned
and
Manhattan .
If you’re there to find a certain liquor, peruse the sheet of
Hymns
for the all-American selection.  That’s right, all American.  Don’t look for any Scotch here, folks.
So thank you, Erik.  I knew I liked your drinks before, but now I’ll watch how they’re made even more carefully.  Note that the bartender slaps the mint leaves between his palms making a
Mint Julep .  This is a great place.
