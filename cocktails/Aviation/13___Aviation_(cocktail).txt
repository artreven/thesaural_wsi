Can you think of a better way to help people in a desperate situation thousands of miles away than by getting sauced next Saturday? You probably can, which is good, so go ahead and do that — and then afterwards come to Vertical for the Haitian Libations Charity Event. After 10 p.m., 50% of the take from the bar and lounge will go to
Artists for Peace and Justice , which has been working with the only free pediatric clinic in Haiti — St. Damien’s Hospital in Port-au-Prince — since before the earthquake. St. Damien’s took a big hit but is one of the few semi-functional medical facilities in the city, and so is in a position to make excellent use of the help.
Maria Bello
and
Paul
“ Sheep Stomach ”
Haggis , APJ board members, will be taking funds and supplies over themselves some time in the next three weeks.
Also in on the event are L.A. food bloggers
Matthew Kang ,
Matt Robold
and
Fiona Chandra , who have prepared an exclusive cocktail menu for the occasion: the
Aviation , the
Vieux Carre
and the Port-Au-Prince (which is like
The Last Word , but with
Rhum Barbancourt 8 ). This trio of blogging do-gooders will be personally preparing these drinks behind the bar. The regular cocktail and food menus will also be available.
