Quotes [ edit ]
Pilots take no special joy in walking: pilots like flying.
Pilots generally take pride in a good landing, not in getting out of the vehicle.
Neil Armstrong , On his famous moonwalk, as quoted in
In the Shadow of the Moon  : A Challenging Journey to Tranquility, 1965-1969
(2007) by
Francis French
and
Colin Burgess
Ours is the commencement of a flying age, and I am happy to have popped into existence at a period so interesting.
Amelia Earhart ,
20 Hrs 40 Mins
(1928)
Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
of sun-split clouds,—and done a hundred things
You have not dreamed of—wheeled and soared and swung
High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there,
I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung
My eager craft through footless halls of air….
Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark nor ever eagle flew—
And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.
John Gillespie Magee, Jr. , "High Flight" (September 3, 1941); reported in
Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations
(1989).
Ronald Reagan
quoted from the first and last lines in a televised address to the nation after the space shuttle Challenger exploded, January 28, 1986.

The saying ‘Getting there is half the fun’ became obsolete with the advent of commercial airlines.
Henry J. Tillman , as quoted in
Strange but True
(February 9, 2011) by Samantha Weaver,
The Mountain Eagle (newspaper)
“No airship will ever fly from New York to Paris. That seems to me to be impossible. What limits the flight is the motor. No known motor can run at the requisite speed for four days without stopping, and you can’t be sure of finding the proper winds for soaring. The airship will always be a special messenger, never a load-carrier. But the history of civilization has usually shown that every new invention has brought in its train new needs it can satisfy, and so what the airship will eventually be used for is probably what we can least predict at the present.”
Wilbur Wright
in the Cairo, Illinois, Bulletin, March 25, 1909,
according to the Smithsonian
(often misquoted, as detailed
here , and also misattributed to his brother,
Orville Wright )
