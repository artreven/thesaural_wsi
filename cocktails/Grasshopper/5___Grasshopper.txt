Grasshopper ( Idealius robeticum )
The
Grasshopper
is, expectably, a medium-sized insect that can often be seen hopping around the grassy fields of the Norn Terrarium.
A bug has been observed where the grasshopper gets stuck in mid-hop, simply sticking in one position and not moving - this can be fixed by picking up the grasshopper and then setting it back down.
The
Grasshopper
is a real terran insect. There is also a
C1 Grasshopper .
Did you know?
The in-game help for dead grasshoppers is a reference to
Monty Python 's
Dead Parrot sketch
and reads:
It's a dead grasshopper, it is no more. It has ceased to be. It is an ex-grasshopper. Its days of jumping in the field are over. It's kicked the bucket. It's pushing up the daisies. It has chirped its last chirp!
