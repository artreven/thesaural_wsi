Getting ready for Rhino!
Rhinoceros 3D  (Rhino) is a stand-alone, commercial  NURBS -based 3D modeling tool, developed by Robert McNeel & Associates. The software is commonly used for industrial design, architecture, marine design, jewelry design, automotive design, CAD/ CAM, rapid prototyping, reverse engineering as well as the multimedia and graphic design industries.
Rhino specializes in free-form non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) modeling. There are several rendering plug-ins developed by McNeel:  Flamingo  ( raytrace ), Penguin (non-photorealistic), Bongo and Brazil (advanced). Over 100 third-party plug-ins are also available.
Like many modeling applications, Rhino also features a  scripting language , based on the  Visual Basic  language. Rhinoceros 3D gained its popularity in architectural design in part because of the  Grasshopper
plug-in (parametric modeling tool) for computational design.
Rhino’s increasing popularity is based on its diversity, multi-disciplinary functions, low learning-curve, relatively low cost, and its ability to import and export over 30 file formats, which allows Rhino to act also as a ‘converter’ tool between programs in a design workflow.
