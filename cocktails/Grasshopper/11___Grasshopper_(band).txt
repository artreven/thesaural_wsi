Sugar Hiccup
is a pop-rock band popular in the 90s. he band formed in Manila, Philippines, with Melody del Mundo (vocals, lead guitars), Czandro Pollack (rhythm guitars), Russel Dacasin (bass), and Mervin Panganiban (drums) in 1994. The band name was taken from a song by dream pop pioneers the Cocteau Twins. Like the Cocteau Twins, Sugar Hiccup features angelic, high-pitched female vocals gliding over ethereal guitars.Sugar Hiccup released their first album,
Oracle , in 1995 on
BMG Records Pilipinas . Mainstream radio stations in the Philippines were initially hesitant to play the album’s first single, Five Years. With its unintelligible, funereal wailing, thunderous drums, and doleful guitars, the song was welcomed first by Manila’s alternative scene before it was embraced by the masses. Oracle eventually sold more than 20,000 copies. In 1996, Oracle garnered the Best Alternative Recording trophy at the Awit Awards (the Philippines’ version of the Grammys) and “Five Years” won for Best Alternative Song and Best Alternative Performance by the songwriters’ organization KATHA. In 1998, Sugar Hiccup released their second album Womb to widespread critical acclaim.

In Filipino, the word "kulay" means color, which best exemplifies the unique sound and style of this band from the Philippines.
Ever since they started, the pop sensation collectively known as KULAY (pronounced Coo-lai) has been making waves in the Philippines with their novel look and exciting public performances. In the world where "formula" pop music bands dominate tha market, KULAY has been able to distinguish themselves above the rest by creating their own sound out of a mixture of pop, dance, hip hop and funk styles. The result, is a sound that is so unique in the world of music that it can be called distinct, or truly "KULAY".
The band composed of Radha, Boom and Angel is Sony Music's latest signing to the fast growing Dance Pool Label, and is expected to make a very big impression on the music scene in the months to come. Their first record entitled VIBESTATION, is a compilation of some of the most compelling and interesting music to come around in a long time, and the entire project is being backed up by some of the best marketing tools ever seen in the business.
VIBESTATION in itself is a unique concept album that features musical and vocal seques between each track. "We really wnated this album to be different, so we planned whole VIBESTATION album around the radio program." says Boom. "The idea was, when you listen to the album, it is supposed to sound you like you're listening to a radio station called the VIBESTATION."
Sony executives have latched on to the VIBESTATION concept and everything being created around the band all go back to the same concept. When you look at our video, that opens with a chamber with several doors, and at the start of each video, you fly into one of doors which is the start of each video." says Radha. "So far, both of the videos that we've done have kept this single concept, and we hope to do a few videos around this to try to keep everything on the same vibe."
A lot of mention about their videos and artwork is almost a necessity in any discussion about KULAY for the simple reason that all these actually come from the band themselves. "Boom and Radha both dabble a lot in computers and actaully shot, edited and directed all our videos," says Angel. "It's really kinda cool that they do this, because what you see of us is basically what we are, nothing has been created.... Everything's all us."
KULAY's first single is the sassy dance tune " Delicious" which will have two videos accompanying the release of the album. The album version of the video is for television broadcast, while a special "remix" video which features the "Break Neck Mix" of the song will be exclusively offered to clubs. Sony Music is also preparing a wide array of merchandise around the band and the release of their album.
But more than just boob tube darlings of the new generation, what is it that makes Kulay tick? Mainly the vibe, that intangible something that gives their music the added kick. And it is this music that has gotten Kulay the attention they so rightfully deserve, locally and internationally.
Kulay spent the large part of August touring the UK. With "Delicious" single released there as an EP, Kulay was whisked into a tiresome tour that brought them to places they themselves have only dreamed of going. To update what we all known about Kulay, here's a list of what they've been up to lately, and it's definitely something that will make us Filipinos proud.
To date. Kulay has:
o Been on the cover of Echoes, a popular streetmag
o Been featured in a spread in Billboard
o Gone coast to coast all over England as part of Radio One Roadshow, Radio One id the biggest radiostation in England. They've shared the stage with the likes of Peter Andre, All Saints and others.
o Been guests in Galaxy Radio 102 Balloon Fiesta, dubbed the biggest party of the millenium.
o Attended the Wave FM party, which was also attended by some 60,000 people.
o Made an appearance on the Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Blast on Trouble TV, and Big Breakfast (the #1 breakfast show in England).
o Recorded some scenes for the Columbia TriStar movie "Virtual Sexuality" which premieres in UK on November. Word has it that two of their songs are also included in the soundtrack. Whether their scene makes it to the final cut of the movie has yet to be seen.
o Been on club tours all over UK and graced the opening of one of London's hottest clubs, Heaven.
o Participated in Popkomm in Germany where recording companies show off their top international acts. With other guests 2 Unlimited, Solid Harmonie, B*Witched and CecePenniston.
o Been on the other TV programs such as Buzzin'Birmingham Live and other live shows in Manchester and Newscastle.
With their management in UK (Clare Shave, who has also managed acts like D'Influence, M People and Zhane), Kulay is being handled by Brilliant, the same team that handled the Spice Girls, 911 and even David Bowie. More shows are being booked by their agent Mission Control. Dr. Martens and Adidas are sponsoring the UK stint.
On the other developments, Kulay's single "Burn" will be remixed by Norman Cooke of the UK-based group Fat Boy Slim. Here at home, Boom and his gang's pet project will soon be underway. Aside from his own music label Vibestation Records (which includes R&B hip hop act Seven Shots of Wisdom and underground rapper Syke -- toutes the Tupac Shakur of the Phils.), they are also putting up a show on ABC 5 called "Vibestation TV Show." which premiers this month. Fondly referred to as "X Generation Sesame Street," its aim is to "edutain" (you know what that means) even viewers who are predisposed to channel-surf. The weekly journey to the Vibestation, with colorful hosts and celebrities also visiting in will have a very short segments that are very innovative and as shocking as they are entertaining. The dynamic out of this world visuals provided by David "DFX"Yu&Boom, the duo that directed the Award winning MTV's of "Delicious" and "Shout," will, according to Boom, "take the show to another level of visual imagery that the local viewers haven't seen before." One last thing, this ain't MTV.
So, DO YOU GOT THE VIBE?
