Hot Pop Factory
I was so excited when my talented friends
Biying
and
Matt
asked me to photograph their new jewelry line.What's so unique about them you ask? Biying and Matt designed their peices in
Rhino
and
Grasshopper
to be printed specifically on their
3D printer
at home. They went through many iterations to find the perfect geometry and grain pattern for them. The duo lunched
Hot Pop Factory
a few weeks ago. They're hoping to develop web-based customization in the future, so
follow them
to stay tuned!
