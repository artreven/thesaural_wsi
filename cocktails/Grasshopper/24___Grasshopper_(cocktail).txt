All right, I didn’t planned to blog this initially. But after seeing the first episode and with my bias for the main character’s voice actor, I decided to blog this series. BTW, I didn’t watch or read the original series, so yeah, I might get lost with the terms used in this anime. But the mangaka
suggested
that you can still watch it without looking into the original series.

Finally, we got an anime that doesn’t have those pandering moe fanservice. That’s good and it’s a two cour which means Urobuchi can do whatever he want before he kills someone. LOL. Anyway, this anime has a feel of Ghost in the Shell, Minority Report and Equilibrium. And I really love the music (not Yoko Kanno but someone with the same family name did it) and the background scenes look amazing. Oh, big applause to the Chief Director who doesn’t want this anime to be moe-pandering.

We’re back again with more Code Geass. Though Lelouch and the gang are not present, we finally get to know more on European side where they are about to be overrun by Britannia. This is actually one of my qualms back then when R2 was airing. We only know that Britannia conquered most of the European Union territories which later resulted to them joining Lelouch’s United Federation of Nation in R2. Fortunately, this 4-part OVA (or movie) would tell us their side of the story.
It’s too early to like him.

Whoa, it’s really a big surprise that
Yahoo Movies JP
streamed the first 8 minutes of Blood-C: The Last Dark. But, yeah, the quality is so bad, it’s like we (who lived outside Japan) need to wait for the BD release. Still, this really makes me excited. BTW, I made a short summary if you can’t watch it in case they decided to region-lock it. But somehow I managed to watch it. Idk if that clip will still be available before the movie officially airs.

introduction
Winter 2012 still bores me but at least, Another and Inu x Boku SS are getting better…..for the meantime while Recorder to Randeseru is still funny as long as they don’t use that “Atsushi got mistaken as a child offender” again. And Black Rock Shooter annoys me with its exaggerating drama.
Anyway, I managed to finish 2 animes which are deem hyped by the mass and overall, weird and confusing.
Bakemonogatari
Directed by Akiyuki Shinbo and originally written by Nisio Isin, this anime is known for its confusing dialogue and wordplay which may bring a headache to some non-Japanese viewers. A friend of mine recommended me this anime because she said it’s psychological. Idk what she meant by psychological but I have to see. And indeed, there’s some psychology in it.
Anyway,  the story is all about Koyomi Araragi, who used to be a vampire but got back again as a human (though his vampiric traits are still present). He got himself involved in strange supernatural stuff which involves his female acquaintances and tries to help them whenever he can with the aid of Meme Oshino, the guy who cured of being a vampire.
Apparently, most the scenes involved much of the conversations between Araragi and the people involved around him. Usually, these conversation are trivial and may not be related to the story. Sometimes, the show keeps using black or red screens or shots of Araragi’s eye given the fact that this is Shinbo’s trademark along with some stylish artwork. And that psychological aspect that my friend keeps mentioning, I managed to see it. Similar to xxxHolic, the characters who suddenly got involved with the supernatural have issues which remained unresolved. And like Watanuki of xxxHolic, Araragi voluntarily helps them. Araragi also has problems of his own but it wasn’t focus much here because those will be shown in the sequel Nisemonogatari and the upcoming prequel movie, Kizumonogatari. So, would I recommend this to everyone? No. If you’re into action (like Naruto or Bleach) or have a short attention span, then you’ll not like this show. But if you really like heavy dialogue shows, then you might like this one.
Cencoroll
Story is about Yuki, a high school girl, who discovered a secret of her friend, Tetsu. His secret is that he has a pet monster named Cenco who can transform into anything. Unfortunately, this kind of monster attracts the attention of the Japanese military and another boy who also has a pet monster similar to Cenco. BTW, this is not those pokemon or digimon types because those monster can eat you alive but you’ll find yourself inside a soft belly. The boys, and later Yuki, have the ability to control these monsters using their hair. I’m not kidding. The hair acts like an antennae for the monsters.
Similar to Kyousogiga, you’ll have no idea what’s going on. You’ll never know much about the characters or the origins of these monsters because this show only last for 26 minutes. There’s also an upcoming sequel for this but there’s no announcement of it yet. BTW, this anime is very similar to those kaiju movies.

I noticed that there are lot of negative first impressions out there after Blood-C episode 1 was aired. Here are some things which we need to be cleared:
Blood+ and Blood-C are set in a different setting with different characters and with no connection to each other.
The theme of both shows are the same:
Saya fighting blood-sucking creatures.
Both shows are handled by Production I.G. with the same director but different staff in terms of writing with CLAMP in charge of it.
Srsly, saying that the show sucks based on the 1st episode means that you’re just jumping into conclusions and that you’re impatient (probably in RL too).

nijuu mensou no musume
Since the Spring 2011 anime started, I started to get bored during Tuesdays up to Thursdays. So, I’ve found 3 shows which pique my interests. And yet, these shows were underrated by the mainstream viewers.
Himitsu: Top Secret
Also called Himitsu- The Revelation. The story is set in five decades from now, though it looks like the setting on the present time. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police’s Section Nine begins using a new method to solve crimes through the
MRI system
in which they scan the brains of criminals and victims and retrieve their memories. The show is told in an episodic manner and yet, it’s very similar to all of the forensic and police shows that I’ve watched. But I think it’s very similar to
Cold Case
since they’re also looking into the person’s past. I know that there’s a manga version of this one but I only saw one chapter.
Nijuu Mensou no Musume
Show is set on the 1950’s after WWII. It tells about Chizuko Mikamo, or Chiko, who lives a miserable life with her relatives, who were trying to poison her just to get the inheritance left by her dead parents. One day, she is taken by the renowned thief, Twenty Faces (or Nijuu Mensou) and she decided to join him and his band of merry thieves. For 2 years, she was trained by them to become a skilled thief and indirectly, Twenty Faces’ successor. However, due to a tragedy, Chiko is separated from Twenty Faces and is forced to go back to relatives’ house. Later, she is being hunted down by those who were also after Twenty Faces’ “legacy” and it is at this point that she began to uncover her mentor’s tragic past. I know  Chiko is the main lead here but I have my eyes on Twenty Faces since he’s like Lupin. And yeah, Twenty Faces is like the Japanese version of Lupin but not really goofy like Lupin the Third.
Bartender
Obvious by the title itself, it’s all about a bartender named Ryuu Sasakura, who is good mixing drinks and sprites. He runs this bar called Eden Hall which is not very noticeable by passer-bys. People who come in his bar (whether rich or poor) have issues in life (like all people have in real life) and through Sasakura’s drinks and guidance, they reflect on it and decide on what to do. Blame Homer Simpson’s quote, “ To alcohol: the cause of,
and solution to , all of life’s problems! ” Yeah, I seldom drink alcohol though I did drink Tequila Sunrise and Red Wine Punch before. BTW, this show is very educational and it may convince you to drink. Also, at the credits, they show you recipes of different cocktails like the
Grasshopper
and
Nikolaschika . I know that it’s based from the manga and it recently has a
live-action version
starring Masaki Aiba of Arashi.
