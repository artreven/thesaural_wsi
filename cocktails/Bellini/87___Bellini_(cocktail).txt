Mariah Carey Luscious Pink: It’s Already Gone

Review of Perfume Luscious Pink By Mariah Carey
While I was randomly fishing in my bag of samples, I caught this Luscious Pink by Mariah Carey. It was created in 2008 by Carlos Benaim and Loc Dong, and it’s the second perfume to be branded after the American pop singer, after M.
The declared top note is
Bellini , a famous Italian peach-based cocktail. So boozy peach is what you would expect, and I sure got the booziness at the start, and the peach after a couple of minutes.
To be honest however, I could say it was peach only after reading the description, as the fruity side is indeed quite pale and shy. Fruits are quickly joined by the florals, but it’s still all quite vague, and wrapped in a light cloudy sweetness. In the dry down, the fragrance will be still slightly sweet, and will grow warmer with woods, but chances are, you won’t feel a thing, unless you re-apply it.
Mariah Carey Perfume Luscious Pink  may as well be the most insignificant perfume you could ever try, but  – depending on which side you want to see it – it also has a disarming delicacy. That’s why I would feel bad if I dismissed it completely.
