Good Wine: La Gioiosa Prosecco
Yes, a white wine review, not a Merlot for once!
I first tasted
Prosecco
when I was in
Venice
with my wife a couple of years ago.
We had it one evening at a very overpriced restaurant just next to the
Rialto bridge .
If you’re thinking of taking a break in Venice bear in mind that a lot of restaurants DON’T accept credit cards, cash only.
Thanks goodness we had €100 in cash with us, not enough for a tip though so we scarpered quickly before the imposing bald waiter could scowl any more at us!
Prosecco is, simply put, the Venetian Champagne.
Like
Cava
and all those other sparkling wines, it’s quality can match and exceed more expensive Champagne.
Some of you may have had the popular
Bellini
cocktail which is Prosecco mixed with Peach purée.
Most major supermarkets in the UK offer a Prosecco.
This one was from
Tesco
but I’ve also had excellent bottles from
Sainsbury’s ,
Waitrose
and
Marks & Spencer .
La Gioiosa Prosecco is a lovely dry but fruity wine with a decent fizz.
I find the fizz less gassy than some champagnes so La Gioiosa Prosecco seems to me to be easier to drink than some champagnes and other sparkling wines.
It’s dryness suits it to be used as a base for a
Kir Royale
(or, to be strictly correct, a
Kir Pétillant ) or, as previously mentioned a Bellini.
This is an excellent Champagne alternative for both taste and price.
Whilst I love a bottle of
Laurent Perrier , £40 per bottle is a little to expensive for it to be a day-to-day drink.
Tesco’s La Gioiosa Prosecco is a perfect choice for a decent fizz and perfect on your pocket if you’re having a few friends round and need a few bottles.
An excellent 4 stars!
