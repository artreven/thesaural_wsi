Aspen Music Festival Music Director Quits. Unexpectedly?
Apr 10, 10
I can certainly pin point my formative years and specific life changing moments. It's hard to forget them. Sometimes they serve as a rite of passage, others are traumatic events that can leave us forever tainted. Some remain engraved in our memories as the happiest days of our lives. My dad always told me to enjoy my life as a student. And that I did, to a fault.  I spent my college years obsessing over a cylindrical metal object with holes and keys: the flute. Pierre the slightly arrogant gold flute, Sparky the playful but twisted silver one and Hercules (aka Mariah) the piccolo. And five of those summers were a privilege at the
Aspen Music Festival and School . I still have all the programs, an endless myriad of pictures, lifelong friendships, and exponential personal, artistic and professional growth.  During my summers there I wore a fedora and I was nicknamed Indiana Jew. I hiked, I jumped off of a cliff (paraglide), I pseudo-climbed mountains experiencing epic views of the continental divide, I cooked to make money, ushered, had a few love affairs, drank too much, gorged in the local gourmet cuisine, house sat, became a dog walker, developed a love for 70s tunes (at the Tipler), I organized a rafting trip, I learned that I loved working with kids (thanks to a wonderful Debbie Barnekow whose dog Sadie threw up on me), lost weight, gained weight, was featured on one of those wedding shows, and developed a crush on my roommate and had my heart broken. Oh yes, and then there was the music.  I could name drop for days: conductors, musicians, administrators, lecturers, etc. But the first time I was introduced to
David Zinman
was a day I would not forget.
Bonita Boyd , my teacher at
Eastman
where I did my undergrad had played under his baton for many years at the Rochester Philharmonic. She introduced me to him and his wife as they were walking their enormous but quirky poodle. There were many influential musical and aesthetic moments. Whether it was playing Prokofiev's Classical Symphony at superhuman speed - I felt as smoke should come out of my keys and the woodwind section should spontaneously combust -  earning the first flute fellowship, and blasting the alto flute part on the Rite of Spring,
David Zinman
conducting. David Zinman
recently and abruptly quit, although it was brewing slowly like the orgasmic cadence in Tristan's Prelude. The festival was recently shortened for a week, the CEO fired and rehired, faculty cuts and disagreements as fundraising goals were missed and tensions arose out of financial concerns. This is not unique to the
Aspen Music Festival (pause) and School , but rather general economic difficulties that plague almost all arts non-profits. What would Michael Kaiser say to this? How would he handle it. I think we are all watching to see what Alan Fletcher, the president and CEO will do. Or is he perhaps the next in line to go elsewhere. Most non-profits are revolving doors, although I remember Aspen being quite stable during my time from 1997-2001. Whether it was Dean Hal's presence and his dog Copland, I am thrilled that I was given the opportunity to experience Aspen. So, who will follow
David Zinman ? Any guesses?  More info here:  http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/09/aspen-festival-music-director-quits/ Pictures:  1. Flute studio with Nadine Asin and Murry Sidlin after a performance of Steve Reich's Vermont Counterpoint for way too many flutes, piccolos and altos. 2. My first catered lunch at Martha Aarons masterclass.  3. A drive to independence pass with roommates, sushi chef from Takasushi and friends.  4. Martha Aarons and I after a ridiculous performance of Prokofiev's Classical Symphony 5. Flute section with Mark Sparks after honking the hell out of Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin.
Making Contemporary Music Relevant
Apr 04, 10
Have we lost our way? Have the arts become so esoteric in artists' efforts to find a new voice that we no longer have an access point? Has artistic and aesthetic language expanded so much that one needs a deciphering dictionary to have a chance at relating? The answer is no. A big resounding no. But a a hint, a lending hand, and a tour guide is definitely helpful.
Anthony Brandt , a composer with
Musiqa , explains that art is progressing, but its direction cannot be foreshadowed. Unlike technology where there may be some directed research, in the arts, if it can be imagined now, there is nothing stopping from realizing it now. It's an interesting comparison. Perhaps in certain circumstances the expectation of new technology can open more tools of expression. But it does seem that foretelling artistic direction seems futile. In the short time that I have been exposed to  Musiqa 's concerts, I have appreciated their ability to bridge a formal concert experience with an informal salon setting. With the addition of comfortable and personal introductions, contemporary music changes from the wrongfully given cold, intellectual and incomprehensible reputation to energetic, accessible, and dare I say cool and trendy? Music by dead composers is so yesterday. Add some delicacies by Monica Pope's Plum Catering and I am sold. "Imaginary Scenes" presented a well balanced program of Music by  Musiqa  composers Rob Smith,
Karim Al-Zand , as well as Stockhausen, Wynton Marsalis, Hamza el Din choreographed by Houston Ballet's own  Stanton Welch . Rob Smith 's
Hot Seat  (1997) balanced a sense of danger from wild and unpredictable syncopations, sexy interrupted burlesque jazz and flowing transparent liquid imagery.  Karim Al-Zand 's
Imaginary Scenes
(2005)   presented four thematically and compositionally cohesive pieces in somewhat symphonic form. Sonorities are pseudo drunk impressionist. If the love child of Debussy and Ravel married Francaix then developed a drinking problem and Freudian psychosis, it would explain the light smirky and, at times, somewhat twisted affect.  For those that do not think musical performance is an athletic feat, Stockhausen's
The Little Harlequin  (1975) left me breathless. The demands placed on clarinetist Carlos Cordeiro near implausibility with the inclusion of rhythmical foot stomps, jumps, twirls, yoga tree poses and constant movement while executing virtuosic passages that reach beyond most people's concept of the clarinet's higher range. Collaborating with
Houston Ballet II ,
Stanton Welch
choreographed the only notated movement of
Hamza El Din 's
Fingerprints  (1971). Originally for the oud (arabic lute),
El Din
transcribed it for the
Kronos Quartet
and tar,  a single-headed frame drum from North Africa and the Middle East. Satisfying my love for ethnic music and exotic sonorities, the effect was tantalizing and hypnotic. Coupled dancers appeared and disappeared seamlessly with flowing and somewhat stylized movement that echoed the music's strength. The zebra print fluid skirts magnified and intensified the physical movements, adding a natural and almost supernatural element. The costumes by London based designer
Kandis Cook
allowed dancers to unify creating pseudo mythological imagery. If you missed this, it's your loss. Picture: Stanton Welch answering a questions about the costumes (they were NOT skirts). From right to left: Karim Al-Zand, Rob Smith and Anthony Brandt.
Once Upon a time...Our Late Night
Apr 02, 10
Once upon a time, it was the dawn of time, it was a dark and stormy night, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times, and call me Ishmael are amidst the most well known opening lines. Although most of them are tired clichés that give most middle school teachers heart burn, we can't help be drawn to them. Perhaps
Our Late Night  can be in a similar category as the start of a series of pseudo implausible stories that we tell in order to sensationalize our evening and elevate our social butterfly insanity status in front of friends and colleagues. Why the need to do that? I am sure that is entrenched and pre-programmed not unlike wanting to kill father and sleep with mother. It is difficult to categorize and criticize
Catastrophic Theatre 's productions, but one surely can react to them. I am always up for a program that warns that it is "recommended for brave audiences with strong constitutions." Anything that keeps me thinking, laughing and saying what the fuck the next morning has certainly met the goal of challenging and expanding my aesthetic and cultural experiential vocabulary.  Wallace Shawn, as an actor, is perhaps better known for awkward dorky roles such as love challenged Mr. Hall in
Clueless.
But as a playwright, his work is dark, sexually and politically charged with a dash of controversy. From Shawn's perspective,
Our Late Night  explores the necessity of dreams and the differences between daytime (as influenced by aesthetic objects) and nighttime slumber. We all have had somewhat surreal evenings where perhaps due to our own idiosyncrasies sprinkled with chemicals have led to bizarre situations, or perhaps, bizarre recollection of the situations.
Our Late Night  hones in and out of cohesive and broken conversations between seven colorful characters. At times we connect, at times we laugh at the ridiculousness, at times we feel uncomfortable and creepy, like intruding in what should be private moments: Voyeurism. Seems like that is the theme du jour. Are we all really that dark but afraid to blurt out our inner most fetishes and fantasies? I could almost compare  Our Late Night   to the intersection of German expressionism, Magritte-esque sexual surrealism with a hint of freudian psychosis. At any rate,
Catastrophic Theater
lives up to their reputation, "we will destroy you." Highly recommended. You may never think of jelly, the tropics, and feathers in the same fashion again. Playing through April 3rd at
Diverseworks .
Once upon a time...there was a flute
Apr 02, 10
The flute, in any of its versions, holds a unique place in cultural, folkloric and mythological traditions and history. Yes, the flute is special. May I dare say much more so than any other instrument? Perhaps the drum comes close. The Indians have the bansuri (Krishna apparently was a virtuoso), the Chinese have the "di", Japanese have the shakuhachi, the Armenians have the sring, the Irish fife, the Incan quena, nose flutes, the ney, xiao, kaval, danso, anasazi, zampoña, ocarina, and the biggest of all, yes, the organ. Meeting a Native American flute maker at the Bayou City Arts Festival opened up my eyes to the cool history and aesthetic associations of the instrument, both in terms of the western concert flute and others.  I am reminded of the delicious, sensual and smokey opening of Debussy's
Prélude à l'après-midi d-un faune , where the flute exposes a sense of eroticism mirroring the Stephane Mallarme poem, its main inspiration. It describes a faun's encounters with water nymphs in a pseudo-dreamlike state after waking up from his afternoon slumber (pictured left is Manet's depiction of the faune). The exotic chromaticism of Ravel's
Daphnis et Chloé
ravishing flute solo awakens the memory of Pan (god of shepherd, flocks, mountain wilds, hunting and rustic music) who made a flute out of reeds to commemorate his love for Syrinx (a nymph known for her chastity) who was transformed into hollow water reeds that made a haunting sound to avoid him. The name of the pan flute is derived from this story.  The tale is deliciously hot. At any rate, is it time for a cigarette? And then there's
Syrinx , the solo flute piece by Debussy, based on Pan's sadness for losing his love. Death. Tragedy. Passion. Another cigarette. Add a martini.  Popular in the baroque period and largely ignored in romanticism other than a few Brahms solos in his first and fourth symphony and a Schubert tour the force (yes and some other horribly cheesy theme and variations), my talk with Gillermo Martinze made me think about the special attributes that would allow the flute to make a comeback and become a favorite among impressionist and post-impressionist composers. Guillermo Martinez reminded me about one more trait: spirituality and the supernatural.  I am not referring to Mozart's
Die Zauberflöte or  Gluck's
Orfeo ed Euridice
but rather legends of its origins. Native American culture links the flute to the spirit world and has, just as many cultures have their own creation story, many legends that give its birth a supernatural element. To read a few, click  here.  Whether the impressionists were aware of this at a conscious or unconscious level is of no concern to me, but rather justification for using it to carry this type of symbolism. Gillermo's flutes themselves bridge the craft of instrument making with spiritual and artful elements. Inspired by dreams and visions, Gillermo incorporates the horse in this gorgeous creation. The horse symbol is widespread through many cultures as the emblem of the life force and is assigned the attributes of the four elements: Earth, Fire, Air and Water. In Native American culture specifically, it combines the grounded power of the Earth with the whispers of wisdom found in the spirit winds. The horse is a honored helper and messenger. It harbors spirit knowledge and is considered an wild emblem of freedom. There is mutual respect, awareness, and responsibility when man enters into a silent contract with the animal. I love when instrument making goes beyond craft. To learn more about Gillermo and his flutes, visit  http://www.quetzalcoatlmusic.org/ .
Thinking about Bars, in Bars, and through Bars
Mar 17, 10
Whether you believe in green beer or a pint of Guinness, St. Patrick's day is celebrated by the Irish to remember their patron saint. The philosophy? Eat, drink, and be merry. It's festive, I dig it, although I am not much of a drinker these days. The only thing that could make it better, is art. The concept of art in bars is not by any means new. Art and wine pair beautifully together, and slight inebriation eases collectors wallets to enhance their private collection. This has expanded into a trend where some progressive bars showcase art work to show collaboration with the local scene, use it as PR strategy, as well as donate a portion of their tabs towards an artist or non-profit. Think about it. It's plain brilliant. Some people do not want to go to a gallery per se, but a brew is always a welcome companion. Let's think about our own experiences in bars. Typically, we arrive at the conclusion to visit one for a variety of reasons: we are meeting a friend for a simple chat, or a group for raucous sinful fun, we need to get drunk and forget, looking to people watch, therapy session with the bar tender, and other less honorable activities. But we never directly look for drama, although sometimes, drama finds us. Unexpectedly. Sometimes the appearance of alcohol lowers our inhibitions and inadvertently we are drama. Horse Head Theater
production of Stephen Belber's
Fault Lines
shows us that our perception of the strength of our relationships may be confused. What appears to be solid ground may indeed start shifting, at first unnoticeably, then forcefully until we are forced to make a choice. What begins as an innocent meeting between two friends to rekindle a friendship turns into a test of character, morality, trust, loyalty, and love. Although this are things we readily do not associate with bar scenes, digging deep into my past, I can see where all of these have been tested, at one level or another. As you celebrate tonight, try not to be the drama. But I would encourage you to check out
Horse Head Theater 's
Fault Lines . And get one of their cool mugs.
Animals and Things that Stick
Mar 14, 10
Sometimes unexpected things haunt your memory. Perhaps an experience, a look, a traumatic or joyful event, and sometimes something banal. As I go through the weekend overwhelmed at the boundless events in such a limited amount of time, I explore what sticks and what is fleeting. I can't help put a marketing hat on. From a for-profit basis, we are constantly researching the creation of products and marketing strategies to create a "purple cow." Seth Godin describes purple cow as a remarkable product with a remarkable marketing strategy. Something, that people want, that communicates, and sticks out. So when something sticks, I want to question: why? Interestingly, in researching the origin, I came across
"Purple Cow: Reflections on a Mythic Beast Who's Quite Remarkab le, at Least" , a well known poem by Gelett Burgess written in 1895. Although it is best to leave this more as a humorous little rhyme, according to the title, it is better to be anything than boring.
I never saw a purple cow; I never hope to see one; but I can tell you anyhow; I'd rather see than be one! In regards to art, I am reminded of Michael Kaiser's strategy: exception art + creative marketing strategies = successful fundraising. Quite similar in message, different in level of sophistication.
So why does my memory commits to Allison Hunter's
Zoosphere
on display at
Diverseworks ? Purple cow? Well not that literal, but certainly trumpeting elephants, birds in flight, herding zebras, barking sea lions, a giant toad, and an unidentifiable peeping tom-esque eye come to mind. A quick tour:
http://www.allisonhunter.com/Art/zoosphere.html .
Hunter shifts my paradigm. In an urban environment, we often recognize animals as exhibits and forget that indeed, they have an essential place in our natural world. Threatened with extinction, awareness of these species does not infiltrate our everyday. In this engaging active space, Hunter video installation challenges us to rethink our relationship with them by transferring to an aesthetic venue. Is there meaning in their movements? Is there sublime beauty in the frogs movement? Can animals truly be part of the aesthetic experience? How would the world change without their existence?
The eye of this unidentified animal, although I speculate is a turtle or some sort of a reptile, shifts the players. Are we watching them, or are we the exhibit? More importantly, are we being judged?
All rather big questions that lead us to think about eco subjects and revaluate our responsibility to them. As a species, we have taken control over a almost all natural elements, and our human footprint in the world is rather destructive. I am forced to think about the environmental forces that are omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent at some level. At some point, are we worried that these will take over? I believe we all agree that there are many examples of that already in progress. So that is what sticks. On display until April 17, 2010.
How much time can a single image represent?
Mar 13, 10
I have always known this, but it is nice to be able to verbalize it and put it out there. Similar to the mantra that admitting something is the first step to recovery, I have been made aware that accessible art (in my own aesthetic language and experience) is just boring and I most likely will not be interested in it. Accessibility is a personal continuum. In essence, if I can figure it out quickly, it is as interesting as a shiny object: it can only hold my attention for a short period of time. Perhaps thats one of the reasons why banal comedy holds my interest for all but two seconds. After the initial chuckle, I am done. So, what are the things that are able to hold my attention? That which allows for an experience (aesthetic), a thought (academic), and engages me in narrative.
Today was a fun day of art and aesthetic exploration. Looking at 18th Century works of Benjamin West, John Singleton Copley, and Jonathan Trumbull at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, I explored different genres from the highly regarded historical paintings, portraits, the "lower brow" landscapes, most of which explore narrative and character development. The portraits hold clues that tells a story about a person. Historical depictions capture a turning point in socio-political development, while dramatic landscapes evoke a sense of awe. The seascapes of William Turner (pictured above S heerness as seen from the Nore , 1808) , for example, explore the sublime which i n " aesthetics , the
sublime
(from the
Latin
sublimis ([looking up from] under the lintel, high, lofty, elevated, exalted) is the quality of greatness or vast magnitude, whether physical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, aesthetic, spiritual or artistic. The term especially refers to a greatness with which nothing else can be compared and which is beyond all possibility of calculation, measurement or imitation."
However, I do believe this greatness is fleeting. Once we are exposed to something aesthetic, it has the power to loose its power. I call this a sublime aesthetic orgasm. We look for more. Ever notice that the words sublime (elevated) and subliminal (unnoticed, below the surface) are related? One theory states it has to do with a threshold after which our response is unexpected and uncontrollable, whether aware or unaware. I diverge. Tangents are fun.
Most of these 18th century works employ and suggest narrative by what is included around the subject. Sometimes, they even imply different stages of the linear story line. I encountered an artist at Lawndale Art Center that attempts to do the exact opposite: juxtaposing time and narrative to create an interesting aesthetic image that attains what the artist affectionately calls gorgeousness. Chuck Ivy (pictured below
Untitled Film Composite #24 from Tapeheads, 2009)
questions "How much time can a single image represent?" The key to his questions lies in the semantics. He is not interested in the narrative aspect, but rather the passage of time's ability to create something sublime. We are wired to find narrative in things. The challenge here is too look at the images without attempting to attach narrative values, but rather appreciate the abstract colors, shapes, composition, and depth.
Chuck Ivy's collection at Lawndale in partnership with Dan Havel "Dirty Secrets from the Cataract Cinema" is breathtaking, challenging, not readily accessible and holds my attention for a long time. Worth taking the time to explore.

Big Questions and Inner Dialogue
Mar 09, 10
Yes. I talk to myself.
Sometimes
little harmless conversations that may have to do with strange behavioral idiosyncrasies, others with big unanswerable (and somewhat pointless) existential content. Or not. After a company event at L'Auberge du Lac where I miserably failed at gambling, I returned rushed to Midtown to catch Mildred's Umbrella Theater's production "Flu Season." Enjoying a breakfast of champions consisting of bloody mary's and crown and coke on our way there, I sobered up in the "buffat" and took a slight nap on the way back. A day like this makes internal dialogue so much more active as you go through different stages of psychosis. Excitement. Alcohol. Munchies. Cigarettes. Junk Food. Water. Nap. Sickness. Theater. Home. Dog. Maybe it was this heterogenous roller coaster that put me in such a contemplative state to make "Flu Season" so exceptionally effective, or perhaps it was just fucking awesome. At any rate, it dealt
with a similar range of dialogues: internal, external, connected and disjunct. Yes people do experience joy in winter and some do get cancer in a bright summer day. Life is not full of pathetic fallacy where winter is always the season of death while summer is cheerfully happy. If you'd live in Houston for one season cycle, you'd know this intimately. "Flu Season" is about a lot of things, including playwriting, interpretation of events, failing positivity, hope and the inevitability of falling into darkness. It tells a linear story of a man and a woman falling in and out of love in Crossroads, a psychiatric facility, with asides from non-participating characters. Do you remember a moment in your life that changed the course of your history? You will be challenged with rather large questions like this or rather funny ironies like questioning whether two people can be alone. I have always enjoyed the casual nature of Mildred's ambiance and the professionalism of their productions. Grab a beer and enjoy. You'll have just a few more days to catch this. More info
here : Picture above: set of Flu Season. Although I have to admit, I spent some time figuring out how these tetris-esque graphics fit together, it also made me think as to the disjunct and seemingly complicated and unpredictable pieces and somehow fit to make us psychologically whole.
PETA Conspires with Bengal Tiger to Eliminate Complete Indian Village
Mar 06, 10
Humor me. It's late and I am under the narcoleptic haze (a la Bayadere style) of french fries dipped in hummus. I am seriously thinking that Houston Ballet's
La Bayadere,
aka the Temple Dancer is a huge conspiracy similar to the terrorist methods of a suicide bomber as they try to annihilate a group of people. PETA, I believe, talked a Bengal tiger, let's call him Tony, into sacrificing himself in order to create a chaotic love polygon ending in the destruction of the the main temple in mythic India, killing everyone. Somehow, the snake got jealous and had to participate in the demise of mythic Indians (which by the way were wearing delicious costumes). How original sin-esque. PETA was counting on people's stupid naivete regarding such a ridiculous false feeling of falling in "love" like it is ever perfect. They weren't counting on the high rate of divorce, the hours of counseling needed to work out why don't you take out the garbage and you spent how much type of issues. If they knew what their therapist and botox treatments would cost (thanks to stress wrinkles), they would have happily accepted the Tony as a pet and moved on.
Somehow, ballet makes falling in love magical. Being swept off your feet takes on a more literal meaning. I love going to the ballet. But I have to admit, last night's experience was a deliciously strange combination of fast narrative, feature numbers within the story line, and some that really added nothing to story development except artistic and aesthetic eye/soul candy. And lots of piccolo. Lots and lots of stereotypical cutely annoying piccolo playing in what should have been the afterlife or Kingdom of Shades. Moral of the story, don't kill a Bengal tiger or all everyone will end up dead. And PETA didn't count on afterlife reunions. So at the end, the guy gets the girl, and the girl gets the guy. Photo:

Experimenting with Public Naughtiness
Jan 24, 10
Like the force, we have a light side and a dark side. I believe even the most righteous people often have unpure thoughts and if we have learned anything from Catholicism, we are all sinners and will spend our lives routinely in confession. For jews, it is once a year. We figure, let the sins accumulate and do one massive fasting forgiveness orgy (followed by honey cake and chinese buffet) and hope for forgiveness, because if not, you die. Well, you are not written in the book of life, which by process of elimination means you are done. So, I am confessing on my behalf and on yours. We are obsessed with other people. We can't help it as it is part of our anthropological disposition. History, in a nut shell, is about linking the past to the present through the actions of what sometimes feels like fictional characters. Our raison d'etre can be explained by looking back. However, what we are taught are the major accomplishments, the quotes, the speeches, the discoveries, the product that somehow guided history this way and that.
But behind all these seemingly great events, there are regular people that eat, sleep, and yes go to the bathroom, release gas, pick their nose, and have physical and emotional idiosyncrasies that usual escape our study, unless they happen to be interesting in their own right. For example, Beethoven loosing hearing towards his later years in life, or Napoleon having a complex, of perhaps Einstein failing mathematics. But can you imagine Marie Antoinette going number 2? It is true that for most of our lives, we interact with a myriad of people, most of which present just a facade at some degree. There are private moments that we never get to see, learn and experience, and we are relieved that most do not get to share our private, intimate, and perhaps somewhat embarrassing moments. Did you ever loose yourself playing air guitar or conducting a rambunctious movement of a Shostakovich Symphony? Or perhaps slobber, snore, and say horribly inappropriate things in your sleep? Maybe you like you pick your ear and smell the wax? Diverseworks
presented the US
premiere of
Voyeur , the latest performance installation by Australian-based
Company Clare Dyson
that explores notions of intimacy, desire, and the act of revealing.
T hought-provoking, it made me explore how many private moments exist in our lives, what it would feel to be watched, and how we respond when watching others. At times forbidden, erotic, naughty, tender, and sometimes hilarious, we walked into a world of the unknown, where we had a chance to explore this curiosity, with permission from the artists, but acknowledging our curiosity with the other 30 or so folks in the active audience.
The work presented took the following form: on stage, a closed performance spaced was created with drywall. Holes of different sizes, shapes, and heights were placed strategically around the space. You were given the option of where to watch, move around and change perspectives. There were also monoculars, as well headphones to "hear" the dancers thoughts, one for the male another female.

http://www.dysonindustries.com.au/performance/voyeur/film.html Here, we truly explore the banal of the everyday, while intruding into the space and choosing our point of view, exposing the vulnerability of the artist, and exploring our own taboo for engaging in voyeurism in plain view of others doing the same thing. As much as we watch the artists, we also notice other eyes prying out of other peepholes, creating a humbling and accepting experience. We connect, we are being seen, without identifying ourselves.
I leave with many questions after exploring a taboo that I had not experienced before. I have the sense that I want to smile, and take a shower at the same time. Yes, we all have a dark side. We just have to be brave and open enough to admit it.
The 64 Million Dollar Question
Jan 10, 10
It is much easier to understand the evolution (if one can call it that) of artistic movements in retrospect. Evolution is perhaps not the right noun as it implies that to evolve means to develop and to get better. To claim that one artistic movement is better than another is not only unfair, it is just plain nonsensical (although naturally, we can be drawn to one over another). I find it particularly successful to examine this as it relates to visual art. From experimentation of perspective, to the discovery of orthogonal lines, foreshortening, trompe l'oeil, realism, baroque, impressionism, cubism, fauvism, suprematism, abstraction, etc. I have left quite a few out in the interest of simplicity, but one can certainly deduce that in visual art, the general movement has been from figurative to abstract. The definition of what is art becomes more difficult today. In an age where everything goes, how does one distinguish between art, things that have artistic merit or artifacts, or things that appeal to our aesthetic judgement? It is easier to ask this question having a little background of where we have been, where we are, and indulging in the temptation to hypothesize where we are going.
I recently read in another blog the notion that opera Da Capo arias (basically, musical form where the first part is a complete musical form, the second contrasting, followed by a repeat of the first) are somewhat not received well due to their redundant nature as they do not further the plot. They just repeat and depend on the agility and artistic ingenuity of the performer to embellish the repeated first section. Audiences would have been able to identify the improvisational quality and be satisfied with the ingenuity and novelty. Today, the style may seem antiquated, as the novelty does not have the same impact. We are exposed to more and unless performed with the highest artistic merit, it does little for us. We are desensitized.
Look at the content of popular programming. It follows the same pattern. Novelty lessens the efficacy of older programs. The amount and degree of profanity, violence, indecency increases, allowing these to become less shocking and acceptable in our modern vernacular. In general, audiences have trouble with contemporary music questioning what makes it music, more so, what makes it art music. But I'd argue that although earlier music styles like classical, baroque, and romantic periods are easily identified as art music, most will have difficulty explaining why and appreciate and understand its context. In a Musiqa (Houston based non-profit committed to presenting contemporary art music) performance tonight, I appreciated the composers vulnerability to explain their works and allow for a Q and A post performance. I asked what composer Anthony Brandt labelled as the 64 Million dollar question: where are we in art today and is it fair to ask to forsee the future of classical music? I received one of the best answers. Unlike technology where progress is somewhat predictable (although the effect may not be), if one can think of it today, it can be done today. If I can predict what can be done tomorrow, there is no reason why it cannot or would not be done today. Meaning, predicting the direction of art movements is an impossibility.
Art movements have always carried some sort of tradition from the past while at the same time rejecting another. In a time of extreme artistic clutter, confusion, and overwhelming variety, would it be fair to predict a rejection to a neo-simplistic period of easily identifiable styles in easily recognizable formats? Has the pendulum swung so far one way and it is inevitable to swing back the other?
Recognizing Art
Dec 13, 09
We are the last and only surviving members of the genus
Homo.
Homo Sapiens
or "wise men" refers to humans, but only those that have a highly developed brain, capable of abstract reasoning, language, introspection and problem solving. I consider myself one, in more ways that one. We like to put labels on things: this is my handle, this is my spout. When get tired of directly labeling, we use comparisons. When we feel the need to go beyond the explicit and implicit comparisons into the poetic, we enter the subjective realm of metaphors. Art exists somewhere in between this continuum. In between the extreme and narrow direct representation labeling, to the highly abstract, non-figurative and symbolic, we have the ability to find an access point into the work. Some works cover more of the continuum which allows for diverse entry points and open different interpretation tangents, where others are much more narrow, offering limited paths of discourse. More so, I find the extremes of this continuum are much more difficult to access aesthetically, and our response becomes more logical, directed, and intellectual. Defining art is nearly impossible. The artistic fields are no longer clearly defined. The classical arts made it easier for us to distinguish theater, music, visual, and dance. Things that have artistic merit but did not fall into these categorizes are a kind of art: cultural artifacts. Cross-discipline artists, technology, globalization and exponential communication mediums have expanded the realm and continue to challenge the art compass. At the same time, the labels continue to be created as our drive to classify and arrange our world into neat compartments remains a part of our anthropological make-up. So unless these works are shown to us in context which can easily be recognized as artistic works (i.e. a gallery, museum, performance, etc.), sometimes it can really be difficult to recognize art. The last art essay discussion group at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, we dove right into the intersection of science in, about and through art. This is not a new concept. I am a believer that cultural contexts always show up in artists genres, so whatever happens to be in the forefront of anthropological development will make an appearance.
We can use science as a tool (as in computer music), as a vehicle (as in photography or film) or as a topic. One could argue that science has always been used as a tool in the creation of instruments (in seeking the most resonant sound and stable scales) and paint (creating colors hues, and textures). Da Vinci's
Vitruvian
man attempts to explain classical architectural proportions through the canon of proportions.
Although some may argue that this is an example of blend between art and science, one could question where this is an illustration for explanation purposes. Artistic merit, or artistic components does not equate to a work of art. For example, I think we could all agree that a toilet bowl cleaner designed by Michael Graves, as pretty as it can be, would not enter the realm of art, unless it was displayed in a box in a museum somewhere.
A retinal exam can produce such gorgeous images that could be confused for art without any further need for manipulation.
Images of the Hubble telescope are fantastic and appear to be beyond the realm of most people's realities, that can explicitly provoke an aesthetic response beyond its documentary and illustrative purposes. In the discussion group, a participant explained:
"if you do something so well that it pushes the envelop of that field, it becomes artistic and can be considered art."
I think this measure can be applied sometimes. I recall a discussion on the topic of culinary arts. Some chefs employ such virtuosic techniques in their craft, that combining the presentation with preparation techniques can present something so spectacular and unexpected that it transcends craft. Can cooking then become a performing art of some sort? An interaction between artist and audience where the consumer becomes a performer? So, does art then become about the original intent of the work? Seems like this would be a natural place to start: the origins. After all, since we always seem to be fascinated with stories, histories and where things came from, it would be logical to conclude that to recognize art you have to look at the intent at the starting point. But that is not always accessible, existent, and practical. Perhaps that is a reason why there is such diverse art discourse.
Lost in Translation
Nov 21, 09
Globalization is a word that has been around for longer than most people think. Although the origins of the word date back to the late 19th Century, the concept globalization in terms of socio-economic development entered our vernacular in the 1960s. One can think of the earlier globalization in antiquity as cultures and empires expanded and contracted. Hellenic travels introduced Asian countries to wine, the Silk Road connected East and West, and Christopher Columbus brought the Old World in to the new. Today, living in exponential times, we are faced with perplexing dilemmas. The problems of the future are unknown. Globalization has also entered the art world. Again, this concept is not new. Puccini's Turandot uses Chinese folklore and traditional sonorities (Orientalism), Dvorak New World is laden with sonorities of Native American melodies, longing for the past with excitement for the future. I attended the opening of
"Your Bright Future: 12 Contemporary Artists form Korea"
at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Pictured here is Bahc Yiso's, died in 2004, "Your Bright Future" which themed and named the exhibition. A collection of lamps shining bright light on a white wall, questions the complexity of the excitement of raising stars while juxtaposing a blank wall of nothingness. Is there a future? Is there a bright future? Will it have meaning? A lecture preceded the opening drinkfest where we learned about the overall concept of Korean state-sponsored art versus the "people." In it, a general commentary of art not necessarily communicating in a one-way direction, but more of an interactive and experiential dialogue. Cultural context was not necessarily needed to participate. Well, of course, this concept is not universal, but I'd argue, impossible to achieve. I do not believe anyone can just eradicate and negate the importance of cultural context. As human beings, we come with histories, contexts, psychological baggage, preset traditions, rebellious tendencies, all which exists within the confines of our own realities.
Billboard art is present in Houston. Whether through the recent works of Karyn Olivier's "Inbound" and now through this exhibit which also extended into this medium. Billboards are interesting. Although their primary function is to broadcast information, noticing "Inbound" is quite strange at first. They are somewhat playful, although some claim surreal, I'd argue the works themselves are not surreal, but the experience and medium are. They represent and mimic exactly what is behind them in an effort to make them disappear.
This exhibit also has some billboards associated with it. Below is one of them. Originally found in Seul Korea, it is now on display facing west overlooking 59 and Rosedale. Here is my dilemma. Upon seeing this, my first reaction: I am of course not the target demographic for this sign. In reality, I am. But unfortunately, it is lost in translation. It actually means
we are happy.
Given that this was meant for an English speaking country, would it have been appropriate to translate it or to provide a translation? Or is the fact that it is Korean provide us with more information. If so, one cannot take a piece like this outside of its cultural existence.
The concept of globalization is also clear in
Do Ho Suh "Fallen Star 1/5" . Two cultures collide. A violent crash of a traditional home in Korea with a traditional Rhode Island apartment is a biographical commentary on the artists travels and education. The video does not do justice to the sublime and realistic detail. It's a must see, especially for those of us whose inclination would be to dust off the old Barbie and Ken Doll and play house. I did not get a chance to spend more time and interact with the work. That will be my intention in the next coming weeks. I encourage you to do the same. More information on the
MFAH website .
Coming to Terms with Wagner
Nov 15, 09
On Friday, at the suggestion of many of my friends and colleagues, I made a commitment via ticket purchase to sit through what I thought would be a long winded, self-important, repetitive and overly psychologically dramatic Wagner opera: Lohengrin. Although I have played a couple, played incidental music, and watched a concert version of Tristan and Isolde, my cultural and musical life had not given me the opportunity to watch a full production. I was a Wagnerian virgin. Gesamtkunstwerk, we learned in school, is a term used by Wagner to describe the complete work of art: one which sythesizes all the art forms to create the ultimate form of deep expression. So playing incidental music or watching the concert version does not give one proper experiential material to assess Wagner.
I have to admit I had pre-programmed prejudices. Coming from a Jewish background, the topic if Wagner's music was treated as taboo. Hitler saw Wagner's music as an embodiment of the new German regime and nationalistic "pure" ideologies. Wagner's music was not performed in the modern state of Israel until 2001 conducted by Daniel Barenboim. Previous attempts to stage productions were halted by protesters.
In his "Jewishness in Music" essay published in 1850 under a pseudonym, Wagner accused composers Felix Mendelssohn and Giacomo Meyerbeer of being harmful and dangerous to German culture. He claimed Germans were repelled by Jew's appearance and were detached completely to the German spirit. As they were only capable of producing shallow and artificial music, its purpose was to be popular and financial rewarding, and devoid of any aesthetic merit.
As I write this, I realize that I use the third person pronoun "they" to describe Jew's above as a way to separate myself from the gross misguided representation by Wagner above. Freud would have a field that with this I am sure. We studied Wagner in school. Tristan and Isolde is epic as music theorists and musicologists revere the symbology of the Tristan chord due to its tonic ambiguity, it's perplexing sonority and instrumentation, and it's ability to morph. We learned Tristan and Isolde as a long yearning for resolution work as there isn't a resting point, cadence, or tonal resolution until the end, after which it quickly ends. Like sex our professor explained. Orgasm, you are done. My friends and I had our share of cigarettes following the lecture. So, I purchased a great seat and I did what I usually do not do. Although I usually like to research the work prior to seeing, I refused to and decided to really watch this purely with virgin ears. From the beginning of the overture to the end, I got it. I understood the fascination. I had the epiphany that my professor was attempting to instill in me back at school: a perfect combination of relatable narrative with enough musical and physical symbology to over talk this over gallons of coffee. Two days later, I am still perplexed by the performance and I haven't even addressed the HGO production. It's a must see if you can catch the last couple of performances before the run ends. Epic is the best way to describe it. Almost like watching a most sublime and relatable story of found and lost love with middle earth and Grail myths mixed in. The music presented additional information not found on stage. Themes were easily recognizable. I think I am a convert. I am quite willing to explore Wagner. I actually think I may be enroute to liking and accepting my ability to like Wagner. The guilt to do so will have to be worked on over time. In this video, Elsa (the wrongly accused damsel in distress) summons a rightful stranger she met a while back. In this scene, Lohengrin (the wonderful rightful stranger) and Elsa (the wrongfully accused damsel in distress) discuss the proclivities of their arrangement. He would defend her honor and marry her if she never asks his origin, name, and lineage. Deliciously romantic.
Cinema Arts: There is a Difference
Nov 12, 09
There is a myriad of arts organizations in Houston. Here is a few cool facts: Fourth largest Museum District in the nation One of the few cities with major companies in the four disciplines: ballet, opera, symphony, and theater 21,000 arts events annually The arts supports 14,115 full time jobs in Houston So when another one is added to our mix, I rejoice in our cities diverse offerings, and get excited at the prospect of learning and being exposed to another range of creative pursuits. Somehow, the addition of a well structured film festival adds yet another badge to our city's diverse offerings:
Houston Cinema Arts Society . The
Houston Cinema Arts Society
2009 Cinema Arts Festival Houston
offers a wide range of films curated by
Richard Herskowitz
and goes on until Sunday, November 15th. Click
here
for the
schedule . Film festivals are sexy. Somehow, I have the perception that people are more open to experimental films than they are about today's art music, visual or performance art. Film enjoys a unique place in that it is usually introduced as popular, then our taste usually develops into the more artistic genres. I took sometime yesterday to preview Houston Cinema Arts Society H BOX. A portable screening room by Portuguese/French architect Faustine Didier Fiuza Faustino, it is currently stationed until the end of the festival on November 15 in the Alabama Theater on Shepherd and Alabama.
The H BOX is beyond cool. A small room with mini bean bags, it plays a rotating diverse offering of shorts ranging from 2 to 14 minutes ranging from quirky, symbolic, to strong commentary on sociopolitical ideologies. A great place to get comfy and chat with those around you. Amidst my favorite ones was a short by Yael Bartana that deals with post WWII Poland economic and social demographic make-up.
Yesterday, I attended their grand opening reception at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston where we viewed "Me and Orson Welles" by Houston filmmaker Richard Linklater, starring
Zac Efron (from High School Musical) amidst an incredible cast of UK artists. Hearing Richard speak really reminds us that there is a very big difference between movies and cinema art. The best line I can remember (not 100% accurate I am sure): Wealth. Travel. Fame. I can take you to movies that have all that. Also, Linklater redefines "quadruple space." You know, to enable writers to publish their novels, romantic scenes end with. And they went to bed. Quadruple space. There are amazing film resources in Houston that allow Houstonians to explore film all year long.
Aurora Picture Show
has an amazing collection of film, video and media with screenings all year long.
SWAMP (South West Alternative Media Project)
promotes regional film and video since 1977.
Film is sexy. Art is sexy, and most importantly, supporting local arts organizations is beyond hot. Take part. Be Current.
Dialoguing with Retablos at Lawndale
Oct 30, 09
Epiphany 37 about why I love art - I always learn something about the work, about the artist, and about myself. In a world where anything goes, it is an impossible task to define what good art should do. Technology, globalization and the proliferation of performance art has pushed boundaries of the classical
beux arts
and continues to challenge our own definition. The line is thin and quite subjective. I still to this day prefer the aesthetic definition of art. I seek connection, meaning, an experience outside my everyday, and a challenge to the status quo. Its quite interesting to have a conversation with a work and heighten your understanding and interpretive abilities.
Retablos
beg for that conversation.
Retablos
are small devotional folk paintings most often on tin that traditionally use iconography derived from Catholicism. They traditionally have a narrative quality, often telling a story of hardship and survival with a message of thanks to the sacred entity or saint that help them overcome it: a direct communication between people and the divine. Lawndale Art Center
is currently presenting a huge collection of contemporary retablos by Texas artists and they vary greatly in medium, style, content and purpose. As I walked around the exhibition you are begged to stop and hear the story of them, almost like a room full of interesting people waiting to be heard and discovered. They are all very accessible, using a wide variety of materials and entry points. Some use humor, and some a combination of recognizable religious icons with a twist. This retablo by Georgia Redonet titled
Yes We Can , made me chuckle as it entertained me in so many levels. Although the obvious Obama parallel is unremarkable, the coupling with the symbolism of the laughing buddha, popular folklore maintains that rubbing his belly brings wealth, good luck, and prosperity. The green background to me suggests a grounding in natural elements, while enlightenment comes from a balance of earthly gifts and divine intervention. Prosperity and environmentalism do not have to be equally exclusive. I wonder what the character below the buddha represents? Perhaps an entry point for mindful wondering or a missed opportunity to connect. Jo Zider's
Too Many Lies; So Little Taste
brings together religious connotations, humor, and perhaps a touch of sexuality. Often people consider the tongue as the "strongest' muscle in the human body due to speech. It is used to communicate, nourishment and physical pleasure. Personally, I recalled horrific images of my grandmother's favorite dish at Friday night dinner's: Beef tongue. Zider's arrangement of an overcrowding number of tongues would suggest a commentary on the prevalence of dishonesty while dismissing the psychological and nutritional nourishment that properly used tongues can accomplish. Makes one think of white lies that often are told to escape awkwardness, often to complicate situations to an exponential degree. The composition is highly unique, although it did make me think about the Rolling Stones iconic tongue as well. This retablo is unmistakably a riot. Tequila is synonymous with the ultimate party drink and shot.
Teresa Rubino's
Vivir la buena vida despues de
(live the good life after...) leaves us with an open ended suggestion as to what we are to accomplish before we live a good life. Although my first thought was a strong message of a suggestion to seize life, it can also be inferred that careless narcissist-like partying can lead to death and a shortened life. The skeleton reaching for an empy glass and a closed full tequila bottle could also identify a missed opportunity for enjoyment as well. At any rate, the use of complimentary colors, blue and red-rust gives it a pleasing, bold and joyful appearance. This are three of hundreds of retablos worth stopping and searching for that inner dialogue. Part of their 22nd Dia de los Muertos series programs,
Lawndale Art Center
will have these up until November 7th. Check them out. Lawndale Art Center 4912 Main Street Houston, Texas 77002 713.528.5858
A Song Without Words
Oct 27, 09
Waking up. One eye open, another half closed. I am attempting to wake up after a late and emotionally charged evening. I need to be up and going in a few minutes as I have an important meeting to learn about new laws and guidelines regarding title company and closing statements. I attended last night the touring show of So You Think You Can Dance, and it made me think about that often conventional communication hinders our ability to share the core and essence of messages. It has severe limits. The concept is embodied beautifully in Felix Mendelssohn (1809-1847) "Song Withouth Words." In his words: " What the music I love expresses to me, is not thought too
indefinite
to put into words, but on the contrary, too
definite ." These short romantic pieces had the distinct responsibility of carrying a message so precise, it could only be shared through artistic mediums. Although initially they were not given much importance as the music itself is within the grasp of amateur pianists, the idea that music transcends words in accuracy makes one stop and think.
Sometimes we find sublime in the most unexpected of places. I do have to admit that I initially thought of So You Think You Can Dance with a discerning eye, aligning it closely with artistic prostitution. But taking a step back, often today's celebrities are talentless and are known strictly for dramatic and controversial events in their lives. How wonderful is it that ballet, contemporary, broadway (and a myriad styles of other dancers) get a chance to showcase their abilities, earn and retain celebrity status. There was one dance that made me understand a difficult issue that some people close to me face: addiction. Whether physical, emotional, psychological, or chemical, it is often something that those who are lucky enough not to have struggled with it can find it hard to relate, understand, and sympathize. Having witnessed this within 10 feet from the stage allowed me to understand that amazing dance looks effortless and completely natural. Having the ability to look directly at the dancer's eyes and facial expressions added to the connection. I did not have to seek for meaning. It was clear, precise, and went beyond words and conventional communication. It seems that lately, I have had many conversations about meaning. I have seen a couple of works that puzzled me and challenged me to connect and find meaning. Some made me think, others left me unfulfilled. I have come to the conclusion that if that happens, if a connection is not made, if meaning is clouded, then the aesthetic and art experience has failed.
Things that Disappear
Oct 26, 09
I have this problem. Often, my mind goes so quickly and is so busy talking to itself that I am often not paying attention to physical things I am doing like where I put my keys, or why I took my computer home but left the charger in my office, or why I put the dog leash inside the half eaten Dorito's bag in the pantry. It is very easy in the mundane and banal to loose focus and not pay attention to little things. I find this is also the case when I drive a familiar route. I arrive at work without any recollection of what happened between getting my car and looking for my office keys. Sometimes I notice something new. Perhaps a new building, a new restaurant, a new business, road construction, and sometimes a new sign. I10 is a relatively uneventful drive. However, let's talk about 45 N. A serious case of visual pollution by the overcrowding if billboards, my drive to the airport sometimes is so "screaming loud" and somewhat embarrassing. I often wonder what people's first impressions are of Houston. I have come to love this city, act as a protector of those who bash it.
Inbound: Houston , a project of Karyn Olivier, artist-in-residence at the
Cynthia Woods Mitchel Center for the Arts
will replace 13 advertising billboards along the city's downtown major highways with urban landscape in an effort to make them disappear. I have to admit, when I saw the photography of the installed billboards, it was almost like a game of
where is Waldo . Here is what I mean: I had the opportunity to hear artist Karyn Olivier at
Spacetaker 's
Artist SPEAKeasy
via skype from New York. Her energy was contagious as she told the curious story of how the project was spun to ensure it was not presented as a anti-billboard campaign, but rather as a creative use of an established frame that could be used for other objectives than traditional advertising. Ever been curious as to what is behind these billboards. To track the project, click
here for Karyn's blog . Although I am not certain I would call this type of work surrealism, the
Douglas Britt's article in the Houston Chronicle
explains more.
The project was supposed to be unveiled today, but due to inclement weather, it is now scheduled for tomorrow morning. Would you like to meet the artist? There is a
reception
an artist talk at
Diverseworks
from 6-8 pm tonight, Monday, October 26th. In addition, the Mitchell Center commissioned a soundtrack of original works inspired by the billboards from UH Moores School of Music composers Joel Love and Paul Wadle and recorded by Aura, the school's contemporary ensemble. The works will debut at 7:30 tonight and will be available as a podcast download at
KUHF .
As I look at these photographs, I am amazed at the complexity of urban landscape. I have to admit, some took me a while to figure out exactly where the billboard stood. Can you see them?
Finding Stuff to do in Houston
Oct 18, 09
I make my rounds. I try to see what time will allow me to see. I generally do not discriminate between the art disciplines, although I often tend to enjoy dance performances above all. For me, performing arts requires focus. Visual arts allows me to wonder as generally, the piece won't change while I am swimming in my own sea of unconscious and conscious thought waves and tides.
I have come to the conclusion that Houston has incredible creative talent, although sometimes not as visible, I love that social media trends has allowed some of the smaller non-profits and artists to be as visible as some with the largest marketing budgets. I have to put a plug for two organizations that keep me challenged and continue to introduce me to incredible folks. There are also additional websites I frequent that give me helpful information: Spacetaker
provides artists and small non-profits access to economic, educational and networking opportunities. I often consult the
Culture Guide
for happenings. I make a point of going to the
Artist SPEAKeasy
on a monthly basis. Artists have a chance to present informally and dialogue about their work, discourse, and creative processes. Aside from being a fun forum, you also get to meet fantastic personalities that seek similar experiences. To stay current, the
Culture Wire
will keep you current on what's new and exciting in Houston's arts scene. If you get a chance to meet the folks behind the scenes, you are in for a real treat.
Fresh Arts Coalition
is a collaboration of original and thought-provoking arts group and
markets the importance of the arts builds audience through increased visibility. The
calendar
is an impressive listing of their affiliated groups and will help you keep current on what's happening right now. When I show this website to friends, they are often surprised as to how much really happens in Houston. Come on y'all. Houston rocks.
I also like to consult
ArtsHound , an
online resource for cultural information for the Houston. I am also quite excited about
Culture Map , which is supposed to launch in November 2009. A new online "mapzine" I am always on board for new cool ways to distribute information. Recently, Shelby Hodges, society reporter and long time columnist for the Houston Chronicle joined the Culture Map Team. This is HUGE! Of course, I always directly with the organizations I love. Whether it's the
MFAH ,
CAMH ,
Opera ,
Ballet ,
Symphony ,
Stages Repertory Theater , and the list goes on and on (so forgive me if I left anyone or anything out). But I am so thankful there are organizations out there that challenge me and keep me current of Houston's wide array of happenings, people, and experiences.
The Moon, Cheese, and the first Sci-Fi Film
Oct 14, 09
Less is more although I have a good friend that consistently says more is more, and sometimes, I have to agree. Lately, my trend has been to see less, but to spend more actively looking. It's amazing what we can miss just by not noticing or paying attention to what's right in front of us. So, I have been going back to a small exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, but just doing a couple of rooms at a time in an effort to read, learn and retain.
" Houston: Tranquility Base Here. The Eagle Has Landed"
opened just a few weeks ago. It is a varied collection of paintings, treatises, photography and installations that trace 500 years of fascination with the moon.
Last time I browsed the exhibit halls, I noticed a flat screen television but had no inclination to sit down and watch the full sequence of what was being shown. This time around I did. I was delighted to learn that what was shown, was considered the first science-fiction film in 1902 by
Georges Melies .
"Trip to the Moon"
is in some ways ridiculously hilarious, in other ways signifies what man has the ability to create in order to explain the unknown. The symbology is thought provoking, but the general theme of man not being able to harmonize with unknown cultures is a them e that is quite applicable and arguably more important today.
Having recently read Dan Brown's lost symbol, I am in a quest to derive, decipher, and perhaps invent meaning in seemingly empty and inanimate objects. This certainly provided food for thought when the rocket lands right in the cheese-like moon's eye: man cannot explore without destroying something in either a large or small scale. On October 9th, Nasa bombed the moon to create a 5 mile crater to seek for water. It has caused some controversy as it violates
space law prohibiting environmental modification of celestial bodies. I have not been able to locate follow-up information to see what was found. The movie is only 10 minutes, has curious music accompaniement. If you are a classical music lover, you will recognize the tunes. I have posted it below
Anna Netrebko in the Target Bathroom Stall
Oct 08, 09
Although not the sexiest and most eccentric topic, I had a funny experience as I put into action my smart shopper hat and ventured in to Target (where the smart trendy shoppers go) and accompanied the female contingency of my family as they searched for baby clothes. The phrase "everything happens for a reason" is grossly overused by many that think of themselves as enlightened. I am tired of hearing it. It's cliche, banal, and just plain blah. I think it's time that the new generation comes up with a similar karmic praxis or stop pretending to believe in it all together.
As I decided to take a relief break in the pseudo clean Target facilities, I heard an angelic voice that usually does not make a formal appearance when I am discoursing with myself, as I am incapable of such sublime, transcendental and sinfully delicious imaginary vocalization. Plus it was a woman, and typically the voices in my head tend to me a little more gender ambiguous.
I came to the realization that the sound was coming from my pocket, and in my pocket lay at rest my beloved iPhone. Somehow, I had hit the music button and like the power of the force, it had coincidentally and "randomly" chosen the unmistakable and striking voice of
Anna Netrebko , (photo by Esther Haase) a soprano of outstanding purity,
"a virtuoso singer of endless versatility smoldering presence and inimitable sound, who happens to be fashion-model gorgeous." I had just been reading an essay by Nikos Papastergiadis, Professor of Cultural Studies and Media & Communication at the University of Melbourne, on the concept of the everyday. Although not a thesis article but a conversation of the purity of art theory, analysis and works through the eyes of the everyday, it presented a wide continuum of possibility from the idiocies and banalities of everyday life to the boring political correctness, transcendental and academicist aesthetic approaches. In essence, from the seemingly insignificant to the marvelous.
High concept articles always provide for good conversation. At the
Contemporary Arts Museum Houston , there is a lovely mix of personalities, experiences, and backgrounds that enrich the communal adventure. Contradictions ruled the essay and the discussion, in search for meaning or a normative approach to three aspects: art theory, analysis, and art creation. The purity of art was in question. If indeed we
"consider art from the perspective of the everyday is to stress that the measure of art is not found by borrowing the yardsticks of other discourses, bur rather from its articulation and practices from everyday life."
And since the access to "life" is always through language, culture, and psyche, the interpretation of art is as a result impure. So here I am in the bathroom, and you cannot get more banal, everday, or outside the realm of political correctness. Listening to Anna Netrebko, a completely marvelous trancendetal voice singing "Ah! non Credea Mirarti" from
Bellini 's
La Sonnambula
is a perfect example of the other extreme of the continuum. This polarity woke me up and I thought: if everything happens for a reason, I should probably pay attention to why I am hearing this now, and perhaps if the lyrics have any meaning. Incidentally, it starts with a flute.
Oh, I didn't believe to see you so quickly extinct, o flowers; you have passed away like love that one day only lasted. Perhaps new life my tears will bring to you but to revive love my tears, o no, cannot O, inconceivable human thought a wave of contentment I am full: In my feelings I can hardly believe you assure me, o my treasure (darling) O, embrace me, and always together,
always united in a single hope, of the world, we live in we will make a heaven of love Perhaps the most significant line as I am consistently attempting to reinvent myself, is the explanation and human tears can bring new life. The individual has the ability to change ourselves and impact others. Human thought is assuring. However, love is our immediate beyond control.
There are many possible meaningful and significant extrapolations here. Hope you find one as well.
Tackling Difficult Issues
Sep 25, 09
Large issues are easier to understand and synthesize when they are presented in humanized form. I spent my Thursday (which is my Monday in work days) evening and treated
myself impromptuly to Stages Repertory Theatre's production of Eric Coble's "Southern Rapture." The last work I had seen of Eric's dealt with a family desperate need for their toddler to be in the right social circles that they end up committing murder to ensure his admission to an exclusive school. Hilarious. I expected the same out of "Southern Rapture" with the addition of one enticing attribute: nudity. Eric Coble traces the cold to boiling progress of a variety of huge conceptual issues. Censorship, public support of controversial art, the definition of art, the purpose of art, and the fine line between certain artistic content and moral decency. All in about 2 hours. By humanizing the issues, Coble truly makes us look through a cubist perspective: through all angles at the same time.
The story traces the cordial friendship of a small southern town mayor in Georgia and a theater director who decides to put on a play dealing with homosexual issues including a short nude scene where an aids infected young man gets his penis inspected for lesions. Pressure from church and society groups encourages the mayor to first suggest the play not be done, then using legal powers to prevent the performance ending with failed behind the scenes negotiations until the play went on. In essence, the struggle between the characters is a microcosm of the struggles between public funding organizations and progressive and "questionable" art movements.
Best quotes and general thoughts of the night, and excuse me if I get these wrong. They were stored in my head: "Government was no part in deciding what is art and what it isn't. You artists pushed the envelope to cause controversy and public outcry, now we have to. We were happy not caring" "You are spiritual and cultural pollution." "Government either funds everything, of funds nothing." "I'm not a lesbian. I am just hard to live with." Art continues to expand its own vocabulary. Classical arts were easily identifiable. Visual art was on a frame. Sculpture was recognizable. Music was within parameters. Theater was narrative. Dance had rules. Today, lines blur. Performance art redefines genres. Technology expands artistic possibilities. Global connections encourages cultural collaborations. Our definition no longer has clean boundaries. We are forced to come up with parameters, however the task is impossible. So what does art do: Expresses? Symbolizes? Decorates? Entertains? Contemplates? Challenges? Questions? Represents? Contemplates? Perplexes? Angers? Soothes? Connects? Relates? Narrates? Records? Explains? The list goes on. I'd like to think that art makes me think. Thus this blog. You have to go.

Growing Up
Sep 25, 09
Lately, I have been obsessed with feeling like a tourist at home. It is often that visitors visit Houston's best while the locals concentrate of work and no play. Ever think how ridiculous it is to wait until we are out of town to enjoy the things that other cities have but seldom make time an effort to enjoy what we have right here? A place I love to frequent is the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Sculpture Garden at the North East corner of Bissonnet and Montrose. Especially during temperate weather, one can spend many hours being enchanted, confused, and perhaps a little perplexed by the works on display here. Two bronze sculptures always take my breath away. Rodin
"The Walking Man"
is rich in texture, playing on light and shadows. I remember distinctly my art teacher Lucy Durkin explaining how Rodin makes her just want to touch the works. The texture and play is completely sensual.
http://www.mfah.org/sculpturegarden/artworks.asp?pid=1&aid=1 Matisse also has 4 works on display here. Back I, II, III and IV and spanning 21 years of artistic history. The portray the artists concept growth from 1909 to 1930. It gives me a sense of the character growth as the emphasis from anatomical and mannerist representation is abandoned in favor of a formalized and soft geometric approach.
Do you know how you feel when you look at pictures of yourself from 10 years ago? It is amazing to remember where you were, how you were, and more importantly, how you were feeling (although sometimes what were you thinking is appropriate). I feel these give us a deep look inside the artistic concept, and trace trends over 21 years.
Art and Jerry Springer
Sep 25, 09
It can be plausible to assume that some may find the classical arts somewhat boring. Perhaps due to a lack of syntax or one's inability to understand arts language, it can lead to feeling quite disconnected from the aesthetic experience. I have been in a tear to feel like I am a tourist in my own city. Strange concept right? True. We often do not take advantage of the things we have right here right now, and wait until we are in strange far away lands to venture to museums, happenings, and the such. Well, today things change for you. I am giving you permission, actually, I am challenging you to behave like a tourist and explore where you are. Right here, right now. I have been attending the "gallery talks" at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. These are short tours, 1 hour at the most focusing on one subject matter, sometimes even just on one work. They are led by volunteer docents that have a love and passion for the arts, and make the tour fun, accessible, and educational. I learned something terribly naughty and reminded me that sometimes there is such drama surrounding the arts, that the history behind certain works is just worthy of it's own Jerry Springer show. Here is the story of Maurice Utrillo. His mother Suzanne Valadon (changed her name from Marie-Clementine) became an artists model after a fall from a circus trapeze ended her career as an acrobat. She figuratively and literaly took of her clothes for infamous personalities like
Berthe Morisot ,
Pierre-Auguste Renoir ,
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec , and later Edgar Degas who became her mentor.Out of these affairs came Maurice, and the following anecdotal story. Included is her self-portrait on display at MFAH. " After Maurice was born to Suzanne Valadon, she went to Renoir, for whom she had modeled nine months previously. Renoir looked at the baby and said, 'He can't be mine, the color is terrible!' Next she went to Degas, for whom she had also modeled. He said, 'He can't be mine, the form is terrible!' At a cafe, Valadon saw an artist she knew named Miguel Utrillo, to whom she spilled her woes. The man told her to call the baby Utrillo: 'I would be glad to put my name to the work of either Renoir or Degas."
( 'Parting With the Family van Gogh' in the New York Times, April 22, 2006 ) The painting below is by Maurice Utrillo (1883-1955) circa 1914, oil on canvas and on display at MFAH. To add to twists, the central house pictured here in the middle of the street (rue Mont-Cenis) belonged to Mimi Pinson, an eccentric woman appearing in many literary and musical works, who happened to be the model for Puccini's
La Boheme.
A little drama is always good in terms of art. In this case, it heightened my enjoyment of seemingly beautiful yet somewhat boring and unremarkable works. Reminds me of Daniel Pink's
"A Whole New Mind"
where he hypothesizes that due to the three A's, Asia, Automation, and Abundance (remedial jobs can be outsourced, technology makes repetitive tasks easy, and we have more "things" than ever in history), we are drawn to seek a deeper meaning. In that search, we play. In play, we tell stories. The same can be applied to people. Often we dismiss based on physical assumptions. Rich stories, histories (whether dramatic or not) and experiences can provide us so many more life lessons.
La Femme Fatale and Remembrance
Sep 25, 09
G ive it to the French to pack so much drama in every minute of a work. Manon, although I was definitely more familiar with the opera, was exquisite and scandalous, as much as classical ballet would allow, and perhaps a hint more. Here are some of the themes encountered: - Prostitution - Sex - Adultery - Gambling - Cheating - Fighting/Murder - Corruption H ow much more French can we get? Originally novel by
Antoine François Prévost
and published in 1731, part of the story takes place in the swamps of Louisiana and New Orleans. It is a tragic love story where the protagonists have to decide between love and wealth, ending up dead and penniless. I can safely assume that most would not expect classical ballet to explore such subjects outside of Italian cinema, but the beauty of ballet, is that you can, and still call it high art. I can also assume that deep inside all our psyche's, we'd all love to be the enchantress femme fatale having seductive powers through beauty, charm, and allure that drives others to obsession, exhausting, insanity and irrational behavior. As I was facebooking and twittering during the second intermission (yes the work is long, very long, and always think that extremely long works are pompous and self-indulgent, no matter how good they are), I looked at the date, froze, and my disposition changed. I suddenly had a blast of the past, clearly remembering where I was the night before and the morning of the fateful day of 9/11. I had gone to bed early. I was a first year grad student at Rice University, Shepherd School of Music, having taken one-year off to work prior to starting my Master's Degree. I was full of energy, with a strong appetite for academic knowledge, and had set up a nice little routine for myself. Tuesday mornings went this like: Yoga class, practice flute, aesthetics class, practice, flute lesson, opera class, then off to Memorial High School to teach. My schedule was predictable, but my practice time was often filled with moments of blurriness, as often, one does not remember what you are doing all the time. That particular morning, I had taken my flute and began warming up in my aesthetics classroom prior to anyone being there. Paganini Caprices were my project thanks to my teacher instilling a love/hate relationship with them during my undergrad years. Something was odd. It was 5 minutes to class, and no one was here. I started to worry that I was in the wrong place, or perhaps we were to meet somewhere else for a special something. I ignored myself and went on. After all, darn it, I was going to nail and sail through a technical passage that was giving me trouble. Now it was class time, and again, no one was there. Half on hour went by, and no one was there. My friend Katie Young (a ridiculously fabulous oboist with whom I share a long musical and very personal history as we went to undergrad and grad school together, at the time we were working on putting together the Ginastera flute oboe duo) called and said, "we are being attacked." Those words meant nothing at that time. Attacked? What does that mean? I left terrorism and fear (I thought) when we left Peru in the height of the shinning path movement in 1989. Is there suddenly a raid against emerging classical musicians? Those words had no meaning to me as they were out of context in my personal realm of possibility. The rest of the day was a blur. I remember watching the news at the student center, watching people tear up, and being panic stricken at the realization that many had not heard from some friends and family living or visiting NYC. I cancelled my lessons to be taught later at Memorial High School, and spent the day numb. Those immediately close to me were not harmed. But many folks within 2 degrees of separation were. Today, I put my flags half mast to think about them, the millions affected, and the millions who helped. I suppose the rain is very appropriate today. Here is a recording of Katie and I playing the Ginastera
Duo for Flute and Oboe . The second movement is quite eerie.

My Favorite: Instant Color TV
1962:  In 1962 there was only one tv channel in Sweden, and it broadcast in black and white. The station’s technical expert, Kjell Stensson, appeared on the news to announce that, thanks to a new technology, viewers could convert their existing sets to display color reception. All they had to do was pull a nylon stocking over their tv screen. Stensson proceeded to demonstrate the process. Thousands of people were taken in. Regular color broadcasts only commenced in Sweden on April 1, 1970.
Good intentions?

I love the arts. I LOVE THE ARTS. I am happiest when I am being creative, witnessing and experiencing creativity. In an effort to always be supportive of the arts community, I find myself always championing by writing about the organizations, artists, venues and performances that I enjoy, but shy away from being critical to those that I do not. Reasoning: fear of deterring others by giving negative opinions. How do I reconcile this fear?

Strategy in getting what you want
Mar 29, 10
We all have patterns. Some of us want to win, some of us want to be right all the time, others just want to have the last word. These are patterns that are entrenched and hard wired that often do not yield the outcome we want. Issues.
Doing the right thing is always the best policy. But when exerting what your perceive as the truth is where the outcome may cause affliction and tension, it is best to take a step back and ask: what do I want the outcome to be? Sometimes, I’d argue perhaps all the time, it is best to verbalize what the possible outcome and strategize delivery of information in a way that gets you the result you want. Does this sound like political spin or perhaps street smarts?
In art, we always struggle with balancing the process versus the final product. When teaching, process is important. Product is the reminder of the process. When experiencing art, the process is only important if its either explained,  apparent, and uniquely part of the aesthetic experience, if not just for historical or innovative value.
Some think strategy is over thinking. I think its essential. Note to self: remember to be strategic.

What to do when you have too many apples? Apple Crumble with Cashew Maple Drizzle
May 12, 10
Slice of heaven doctored up with cashew maple drizzle
Like bananas, I have a habit of buying way too many thinking that I will munch on them sporadically. For the most part, I do pretty well, trying to keep the doctor away. But for some reason, perhaps working too much has taken a toll on my ability to deplete my stash. So I have WAY too many apples.
When all else fails, bake. Then perhaps you can say, with a grin, how do you like them apples? Not like
“dem apples”
but close enough.
Why should you eat apples anyway? Aside from the biblical reminder that apple eating is naughty and responsible for the fall of humanity and the expulsion from the garden of heavenly delights, this seductive little number is very high in fiber, rich in antioxidants and vitamin C, and may help prevent you from going senile as you prune into your golden years.
Don’t be lame, eat the skin, but avoid the seeds. They are slightly poisonous, not enough to make a dent in humans, but birds shy away.
So buy them apples, and if you don’t eat them quickly, bake them. Like this.
Crust
3 cups of cereal, cookies, graham crackers, whatever you have on hand
1/3 cup of canola oil
3 tablespoons of non-dairy milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
Crumble the cereal or whatever in a food processor and shimmy until it becomes a rough mixture (not a fine powder). Toss in the rest of the ingredients and combine with your hands. It’s fun to get dirty. Press into a 9×13 pan.
Press the crumb topping in your favorite baking dish. Doesn't really matter the shape.
Filling:
3 pounds apples (I like sweet ones) cut in half, cored and sliced thinly (not peeled)
1/3 cup sugar
3 tablespoons whole wheat pastry flour
1 tablespoons canola oil
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
If you still have your food processor out, use the slicing disk to get the slices even. This will ensure the thing, whatever we want to call it, bakes evenly and comes out pretty. Mix everything throughly in a bowl, and pack into the baking dish above the crumb crust.
Delicious thinly sliced apples dirty with cinnamon and ginger
Topping
1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour
3 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons canola oil
dash of ginger and cinnamon
Mix throughly and crumb on top of the apples. Bake at 350 for 1 hour. When almost done, prepare the cashew drizzle.
Ready to bake whatever you want to call it
Cashew Butter Maple Drizzle
2/3 cup of cashew butter
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup of brown rice syrup
Mix all in a pot and heat for about 3 minutes to soften. You may have to add for rice syrup to get the right drizzling consistency.
Mixing the cashew butter, rice syrup and maple syrup into a sweet goo heaven
Apply all over the dish and let cool prior to serving.

Papa Rellena: Stuffed Potato Peruvian Style (with vegan variation)
May 10, 10
My beautiful mother with my childhood poodle, Gigi
Today is Mother’s Day and I can’t see anything more fitting than honoring where I was born:
Lima, Peru . Land of the
Incas,
the delicious
Lucuma ,
Machu Picchu , arid beaches,
Lake Titicaca , the
Nazca Lines
and a huge part of my cultural heritage, the food of Peru is rich, varied, and unmatched. The three major geographical regions, Costa, Sierra y Selva (Coast, Highlands and Jungle) create a diversity of traditions, natural resources and foods. The southern and frigid waters of the
Humbolt Current
mingle with the warmer northern waters allowing for a confluence of seafood that shame most Japanese sushi.
Naming a national dish can inspire heated argument. Some may claim ceviche, a lime marinated seafood dish with onions and ají (pepper), while others cite ají de gallina (hen in a spicy pepper sauce), causa (a pseudo potato shepherd’s pie), or cuy (roasted guinea pig). At any rate, no one will argue that the national drink is chicha morada (a sweet juice made from purple corn) and for festive occasions, the
Pisco Sour .
Tiny Joel enjoying the rough and arid terrains of Sienegilla, a clearing by a brook.
I grew up with a variety of different foods, but one of my favorites was Papa Rellena: a mashed potato shell stuffed with ground beef, hard-boiled egg, olives and raisins sautéed with onions, garlic and spices, deep-fried gently and served with salsa criolla (creole sauce). Of course, I reminisce about the wonderful flavors, but certain that I can recreate the spirit of this down Peru home simple delicacy with simple substitutions.
Start by making the salsa criolla, a staple in every Peruvian table, similar to our status of ketchup, but much, much, much better.
2 medium red onions sliced a la “pluma”
1/2 chili pepper (your choice depending on heat preference)
1 tablespoon vinegar (I like apple cider vinegar)
Juice of 1 lime
salt and pepper
“Pluma,” meaning feather, is a style of cutting thinly on the half moon. Cut the ends off, then half the onion vertically. Place the onion face down on a cutting board and cut very thinly. You may not be able to get through all the onion, but thats ok. Reserve what you cannot slice a la pluma for the filling.
Red onions a la "pluma." Feather thin cut needed for the salsa criolla
Soak the onions in cold salt water for about 10 minutes to remove any harsh bitterness. Drain, and combine the onions with the rest of the ingredients, season with salt and pepper and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes for the onions to macerate and the flavors to combine.
Finished salsa criolla, always better after marinating for at least 30 minutes
Papas Rellenas (for about 6)
5 pounds russet potatoes (3 large – 4 medium)
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon of turmeric
1 teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper
For the dough. There are a wide variety of recipes out there. Some just call for the potatoes, others add seasoning, while some add eggs, cornstarch or both. This recipe ensures the potato stays together well through frying.
Boil the potatoes whole unpeeled for about 45 minutes in salt water until tender. While thats cooking, work on the filling. Let cool slightly and carefully peel while still warm. Pass through a ricer and add the turmeric and salt and pepper.
Passing potatoes through a ricer ensures a smooth consistency
Wait until the potatoes are lukewarm prior to adding the cornstarch. Mix well with your hands.
Filling
1 cup of diced onion
4 cloves of garlic
1/2 chile pepper (your choice depending on heat preference)
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon paprika
4 oz cremini mushrooms in small dice
1/2 package tempeh cut thinly and quasi crumbled
1/2 cup raisins soaked for 10 minutes in hot water
handful of spinach
1 cup cooked quinoa
salt and freshly ground pepper
Start by caramelizing the onions in olive oil for about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and chili pepper and cook. Add the cumin and paprika and cool briefly to release their flavor and aroma. Add the mushrooms, cook until soft then add the tempeh and raisins.
Crumbling the tempeh
Deglace the pan with a white wine if necessary. Add the spinach and wilt. Add the quinoa and season with salt and pepper.
Filling. Although traditionally ground beef, olives and hardboiled egg is used, this is a hearty and delicious animal friendly substitute
Breading and assembly and frying
1/2 cup of flour
dash of cayenne
dash of salt
3 teaspoons
Ener-G Egg Replacer
3 tablespoons water
1/2 cup breadcrumbs (I like Panko)
Canola oil for frying
You’ll need three shallow bowls. In one, combine the flour cayenne and salt, in the other, whisk the egg replacer with the water, in the third, the bread crumbs.
Make a 1/2′ round pancake with your hands kneading well to ensure a smooth and homogenous potato dough. Make a slight indentation in the middle for the filling.
1. Start with a 1/2" thick pancake with a slight indentation in the middle
Place a generous amount in the middle of the pancake. Using both hands, fold in the middle, almost like an omelet. The warmth of your hands will make the dough pliable.
2. Place a generous amount in the middle and start closing up using both hands, folding in the middle
Coax any filling back into the center.
3. Close and coax any escaping filling back inside while creating a shape of a potato
Close and knead back and forth to create a very smooth faux potato. This will ensure it won’t fall apart during frying.
4. Close and knead back and forth between the hands to create a smooth faux potato. Pictured here is rough, prior to handling.
Roll in flour, then egg replacer, then bread crumbs. Heat about 1 1/2″ of canola oil in a pot and heat until it reaches 350-375 degrees. Too cold and the potato will fall apart. Too hot, and it will burn and cook too quickly to warm the inside. Cook for just 2-3 minutes while turned to get all sides beautifully golden.
5. Heat about 1 1/2" of canola oil in a pot. Ensure oil is heated well prior to frying. Too cold, it will fall apart. Perfect temperature is between 350 and 375. Use a slotted spoon to place them inside. Fry until golden brown
Set on a paper bag to drain any excess oil. You may keep them warm in a low oven while you finish the rest. Serve on a big place with the salsa criolla.

When cut….
A gorgeous presentation worthy of the highest praise. Not for long. It will be eaten.
You certainly can experiment with fillings. This is my vegan version. Bon appetite. Filed under:

Quinoa 109: Stuffed Ancho Chili Peppers with Black Quinoa and Purple Potatoes with Roasted Tomato Sauce
May 07, 10
Dried Tan Chiles
- Chiles Chipotles Mecos
Do you ever pass the section in the produce where a large selection of dried whatevers are displayed somewhat neglected by most of the buying public and wonder what cooks do with them? I mean, does anyone every buy them? Have they been there for years?
Well, honestly, I could not give a crap. It seems most of the things I cook require fresh ingredients, and all but one time, I have been required to seek a dried pepper that required me to use my googling skills to familiarize myself with its general appearance. That way, I can easily find it and avoid looking like a jejune cook.
I have many cookbooks that just seem to look good on my bookshelf but truly have not produced. I look at them every once in a while for a glimpse of inspiration, but frequently, they disappoint. But today was different.
Dried Ancho Chili Peppers
I do have a lot of omnivore cookbooks that are begging to be veganized. And today, I took on one recipe from
Rick Bayless ‘
“Mexican Kitchen: Capturing the Vibrant Flavors of a World-class Cuisine”
and modified it slightly to qualify for vegan good eats, my quinoa
raison d’être,
and these gorgeous peruvian purple potatoes that I happen to find at Whole Foods earlier in the week.
So here it goes:
Quick Tomato Chipotle Sauce
1-3 dried tan chipotle chiles (chiles chipotle mecos) – 1 for mild, 2 for medium and 3 for hello, and if brave, 4 for you are loosing your mind insane
5 large garlic cloves
4 tomatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds)
Precarious Peruvian Purple Potatoes
1 Tablespoon oil
Salt
This simple and smoky sauce is very versatile can be used for a variety of dishes. It can also be made ahead of time and stored.
Start by heating a heavy skillet, preferably a cast iron skillet. Then toast the chiles by pressing them down with a spatula for about 10-20 seconds. You will know when they are ready as they will release an exotic and delicious aroma. Do not over toast as we do not want them to burn, but rather just release to the surface their flavor, oils and their natural fragrance
At the same time, toast the unpeeled garlic for about 15 minutes until they soften, allowing the skin to develop black spots but not burn.
Chiles and garlic beginning to impregnate my kitchen
Remove the chiles and place them in hot water for roughly 30 minutes until they rehydrate.
Roasted and plumped tanned chipotle chiles
The garlic will turn soft and very sweet.
Incredibly sweet, soft and fragrant garlic
Broil the tomatoes on the highest oven setting for about 8-10 minutes on each side until the skin blisters.

Remove the stems from the chiles. Pseudo puree in a food processor until all ingredients are incorporated, but still chunky. Then heat the oil in a heavy pan and cook the sauce down to heighten its flavor. Season with salt.

Now for the Stuffed Ancho Chili Peppers
10 large dried ancho chiles (because you will break some) pick the prettiest ones
1 sweet onion
Taking a peak inside the purple potatoes
4 medium purple potatoes, chopped into small dice
1 cup cooked black quinoa, or any variety will do
1 tomato, diced
2 cloves of garlic
salt to taste
The recipe is easy and simple. Start by caramelizing the onions for about 10 minutes until brown, sweet and aromatic. Then add the garlic and potatoes and cook roughly for 5 minutes until the potatoes are tender.
Add the tomatoes, quinoa and season with salt. You can add any additional herbs and spices you may like (cumin, oregano, parsley) although I just want to highlight the sweet smokiness of the ancho chiles.
Ancho chiles are actually not spicy, but rather add a deep complex sweetness to any dish. They are also available ground if you want to be able to readily add the flavor to any other dish, but they will certainly loose their potency over time.
Toasting the ancho chiles
Toast the chiles for about 10 seconds on each side and place in hot water for about 10 minutes to rehydrate.
Rehydrated ancho chiles
After 10 minutes, remove them from the hot water and dry with a paper towel. Handle with care so they do not rip. Cut a slit on one side and remove the seed, as many as you can below the stem.
The filling
By this point, the filling should be nicely cooked. Fill each ancho generously and wrap close.
Filling the ancho chiles
Arrange neatly in a baking dish.
Beautifully filled ancho chiles
Cover with sauce, and bake for 30 minutes at 375 degrees.
Pour the sauce and cover all ancho chiles
Let rest for 20 minutes prior to serving. Careful when serving as the chiles are very fragile. As another possibility, you can bake them each in their own little baking dish for even a more personal presentation. Here is mine.
My dinner. By the time you see this, its gone. All gone.

Another big boy breakfast: my sweet side – Cashew Butter Apple Waffles
May 06, 10
Fluffy, subtle and mysterious sprinkled with powdered sugar and waiting to de moistened by the juices of the maple tree
Perhaps this breakfast isn’t as testosterone filled manly Ahnold Schwarzenegger-esque as yesterday’s
Porcini Spinach Omelet with stuff , but I was in the mood for something just as hearty that would appeal to my sweet tooth. After all, those of you that know me, I go from animaniac type insanity to quiet but troublesome introspection like an unsuspecting cream filled something or other.
Not a pancake done that, not a muffin been there, not a scone as I am not talkative enough to bust out my Brit alter ego, was not in the mood for tea, and I am out of marmalade. So what is a girl to do? Hit the cookbooks and google. Nothing talked to me. The culinary voices were quiet this morning which seemed rather eerie. Are the Dionysian gods mad at me? Have I not been drinking enough wine?
As I opened the refrigerator, one eye focused on an almost empty jar of cashew butter while the other looked at organic unsweetened applesauce. Could they be friends? Somehow, I recalled this most entertaining
international friendship song
and I knew what I had to do: cashew butter apple waffles.
So here is what I did. I started with
Isa Chandra Moskowitz
recipe for peanut butter pancakes on
“Vegan Brunch,”
then made some substitutions. Why recreate the wheel when perfection has already been achieved? This is just another whimsical variation of an original theme by genius.
3/4 cashew butter
3 tablespoons maple syrup, the real thing, no knock offs
1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce
3 tablespoons canola oil
2 cups almond milk
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon really good vanilla
2 1/4 cups whole wheat pastry flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
In one pretty deserving bowl, mix all the dry ingredients minus the cornstarch.
Flour, baking powder, salt and a delicious hint of cinnamon
In another smaller one, dissolve the cornstarch in the milk, whisk, then add the rest of the west ingredients until the cashew butter is incorporated very well. Then pour seductively and whisk intro the dry ingredients.
Wet meet dry...talk amongst yourselves
The batter will be thicker that your standard pancake.
Ready to be waffled
Follow the instructions of your waffle maker. Make sure it has had a change to warm up well prior to cooking. Pour the waffle batter and cook the waffle until the batter has been waffled and the waffle maker makes its usual the-waffle-is-ready whistle sound.
Hello precious
Serve immediately. Perhaps with some powdered sugar, a few berries, and warm maple syrup.
Yeah. Big boy breakfast.
Delicious. Flavors are subtle and not overpowering. A little maple syrup goes a long way. So here we have it. Big boy breakfast part deux. Perhaps a little more sophisticated that yesterdays, bringing in my sweet side. Filed under:

A big boy breakfast: Porcini Spinach Vegan Omelet with stuff
May 05, 10
Supersized vegan breakfast is possible and does not consist of rabbit food
It is my goal to disperse a myriad of myths about vegan food:
It is NOT rabbit food (and we do not eat rabbit)
It is NOT dainty, refined, or even arrogant
It is NOT boring, flavorless or bland
It is NOT veggie protein attempting to pose as meat like a bad drag queen
It is NOT the kind – like some MSG laden chinese food – that 30 minutes later you will get hungry
It is NOT necessarily healthy all the time – we brought you French fries
I am a big boy, and as a big boy, I want my good eats. Over-portioned, supersized, and yes, I’d like fries with that “shake.” This morning was one of those days where I needed homey sustenance and I had no trouble feeding myself. That should come to no surprise, to anyone that knows me.
Isa Chadra Moskowitz
is freaking brilliant. Her cookbooks provide with enough inspiration for a lifetime of food porn. So, yes, I started with her Tofu omelet recipe but decided never to call it that again. Tofu, for some reason, calls images of white, blind, tasteless gelatinous wiggly texture that does not do justice to this do me delicious delicacy.
I didn’t follow the recipe to the t. Yeah, bad big boy, I know.
1 Package of Tofu (not vacuum packed, so from the fridge)
1/2 teaspoon turmeric for color
2 cloves of garlic
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons of olive oil
1 teaspoon black salt (kala namak)
1/2 cup chickpea flour
1 tablespoon arrowroot or cornstarch
1/4 cup of soy milk
Isa does not use soy milk as she calls for silken tofu. I felt the batter needed to be slightly more pliable so I tried it since I only had firm tofu. It worked. The pictures prove it.
Tofu with the rest of the stuff in the food processor
I started by placing the tofu in the food processor and going to town, perhaps longer than I should to ensure it became creamy and delicious. I shimmied while it was rumbling since there was 70s disco in the background (Gloria Gaynor to be exact).
You are probably wondering what
black salt aka kala namak
is. No, it is not putrid salt turned black, but rather a sulfury type powder that is often used in Indian and Pakistani cuisine. It is salty but has that fart-esque type aroma that mimics real eggs. I know I am not making it sound sexy, however, it adds a wonderful exotic and naughty smell that is unmistakable and somewhat essential. You can kind it at any Indian market, or if you google it, you will find many vendors that will be happy to take your money for it.
Kala namak "black salt" up close and personal revealing its gorgeous pinky fleshy colors and not so subtle aroma
I’d say invest. Go for it. You can impress your friends when you cook with them and say,
“hey, can you pass the kala namak?”
You know you want to.
The trick to these omelets is understanding that we are not looking for the consistency of eggs pre-cooking but rather almost like a sticky pancake type batter. They will not pour readily, but rather have to be coaxed and spanked into shape and place.
Do use a large skillet, lager than you think you’ll need as it will be easy for turning over.
Back to the batter. Add the rest of the ingredients and go to town again. Spoon the mixture into a hot oiled non-stick oversized pan. Fill in the batter holes as you spread and attempt to create a circle. It doesn’t have to be perfect. Imperfection is homey goodness.
In the beginning, there was one side
Cook about 5 minutes on each side flipping carefully.
Look at my precious...
Look like an omelet but better. From here on, I put some vegan cheese, my desired toppings of sauteed porcini mushrooms and spinach with some cumin, paprika, salt and pepper and set the ingredients mingle.
Melty vegan cheese. Who needs dairy anyway?
The final product? I happen to also sauté some onions with shredded russet potatoes seasoning with black salt, cumin, salt and pepper, a few strips of tempeh bacon and voila. Oh la la, big boy down home country-esque delicious breakfast. As I am writing this, it’s all gone.
I know you want some.

Quinoa 108: Quiche or Kugel? It doesn’t matter – Spinach Mushroom Tarragon Quiche with Quinoa
May 04, 10
Real men eat quiche, and real mean are vegan. Perhaps we eat quiche with the pinky sticking out as a sign of cultural refinement in the same way we would sip an aged single malt scotch.
Quiche or Kugel? It doesn't matter. Darn good eats. With a glass of wine.
As an omnivore, I loved quiche as it would highlight my favorite vegetables. Whether broccoli, spinach, cauliflower,even fennel, it allowed me to feature them with great subtlety coupled with my herb du jour. As a vegan, I learned quickly how easy it is to recreate the texture and consistency with animal friendly ingredients.
Although we love to think of quiche (say it with puckered lips) as french, its origins are German. Kuchen, meaning cake, became quiche through a series of vernacular transformations. Kugel on the other hand is a noodle or potato casserole, a dish I was forced to learn to enjoy as a child,
now adoring its nostalgic, historic and jew-esque down home country cooking dish.
So, when combining the two traditions with quinoa, I am not sure if I can call this a quiche (since it has quinoa) or kugel (since it does not have noodles or potatoes). A quigel? Kuche? Sounds like a disease or a private part near an erogenous zone.
So here is my concoction. Taking advantage of leftover quinoa and whatever I happen to have on hand I created this Spinach Mushroom Quinoa Quiche or Kugel. Start by pouring a glass of wine. It would be so Julia. So french. Ooh la la.
Ingredients:
2 cups cooked quinoa, any variety
1 large onion chopped
4 cloves of garlic minced
8 ounces cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced
8 ounces baby spinach
1/2 cup dry white wine, more if you intend to drink
1 15 oz can canellini or northern white beans
1 box firm silken tofu (from the shelve, not refrigerated)
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons cornstarch
3/4 cup bread crumbs
1 tablespoon thyme
1 tablespoon tarragon
1/2 cup parsley
salt and freshly ground pepper
paprika for sprinkling
There is nothing sexier than caramelizing onions (although roasting garlic comes pretty darn close). So start by heating some olive oil on medium and tossing in the onions. Let cook for about 10 minutes, stirring sporadically – meaning NOT consistency – to develop a rich gorgeous golden brown color that smells sweet.
Caramelized onions are the perfect start for mainly any dish, but perhaps not a romantic evening
:)
Then add in the garlic, let it mingle before adding it the mushrooms. Cook for another 5 – 8 minutes until the mushrooms are mostly cooked.
Earthy cremini mushrooms sliced generously and cooking in the sexy onions
Add in herbs, salt and pepper, and deglace with the white wine –  if there is any left since you have been drinking –  to dissolve any flavor bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. Add the spinach, wilt, and cook until most of the liquid is evaporated. Season well with salt and freshly ground pepper. Turn off the heat and set aside.
Spinach giving up to the seduction of the onions
Process the beans with the nutritional yeast and cornstarch until a firm paste if formed. Add the tofu and season with salt and pepper.
The final steps prior to baking - mixing it all together
Put all the ingredients, vegetables, bean-tofu mixture, bread crumbs, lemon juice and check for seasoning. Place in a casserole dish, sprinkle with paprika for color, and bake for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.
Sprinkled with a little color, adding paprika is a like adding a little make up
Let it rest for about 20 minutes to the mixture hold together well. You may want to serve this with your favorite  salad, perhaps gravy?
Try this one .

I don’t get it: Why do some vegan restaurants try to recreate meat?
May 01, 10
Yes. I do not get it. No. I don’t.
Mongolian Wonder: truly faux steak with delicious spices and a sassy sauce.
I suppose that if you are vegan you are automatically kosher. Obviously pork is out of the question, shellfish is not in my vocabulary, and mixing dairy and meat, well, its nearly an impossibility.
I remember a funny conversation I had with my rabbi. I cannot remember the context or the circumstances surrounding the discourse. What I do remember is addressing the concept of I-can’t-believe-its-not-shrimp
vegan prawns . His argument was that if the laws of kashrut prohibit the consumption of shellfish, are we then not honoring the larger concept by recreating the taste and texture from other ingredients? It feels a little like cheating. I can’t eat this, so I will create this so I can.
Back door foodie. Technically we are not breaking any rules. But the essence if the practice is violated.
I live, like most of us, in an omnivore nearing on carnivore world. About
3% of the US population is vegetarian . Vegans and vegetarians are the minority. That’s ok. I figure I am one of a very small number of peruvian-american-canadian-belgian-polish-german-jewish decent, and that gave me great skin and awesome hair. So in being in the minority, I am kind of cool. After all, I do believe in Apple’s  Think Different
(and screw up the grammar while you are at it in the name of trendiness).
So, as I devoured a sassy stir fried faux beef-esque type dish –
Loving Hut
restaurant smartly named it “Mongolian Wonder”  – I determined that there was something interestingly screwed up about the world of I-can’t-believe-it’s-not-cow products. People become vegan for a variety of different reasons (health, environment, religious and animal ethics) but enjoy all the benefits. It seems for the 20-30 something population, a transition, whether gradual or cold turkey as a result of a traumatic event, whereas now, we are seeing more and more kids growing up in a vegan environment. So, if our initial reasons for veganism were animal welfare, why on earth do we want to create dishes that remind simulate eating them? Again, this seems rather hypocritical and nears the realm of self-deceit. I suppose the right response would be to feel disgusted by the thought of animal consumption, but instead, we accept it as ok and go on our merry foodie way.
Vegie World
is a business that caters to the faux meat clientele. They have everything from fish, ham crab, even lobster and mutton. I suppose one is used to a meat centric diet, the habit is hard to break. These business then help others transition and stay on their foodie schedule. I will concede, a much preferable habit over the actual consumption of Herman, the name I give all living creatures.
So where does this all stem from? Is this a primal instinct similar to the Freudian Oedipus complex where it is our desire to kill our father to sleep with our mothers? Does it originate from the same urge that allowed the Roman’s to devalue life of gladiators, or the bloody and conqueror nature of the Mayan and Viking warriors? This certainly would contradict the argument that
man was not meant to feed on animals . Perhaps it is just a general territorial nature that incites the need to control and repress against domesticating and civilizing. Whatever it is, it is worth opening conversation.
LIke this
vegetarian tempted by the meat of another , I too was obsessed with not eating,
but recreating something extravagant
in a way that could justify consumption.
All and all, this discussion may be futile, but like everything, sometimes breakthroughs start out of non-sensical thoughts, conversations and associations.
I need a burger. A big, HUGE, meatless soy protein or TVP loaded with fixings and fries. Big faux-pas after eating a chocolate chai cupcake at the

Is it possible? A vegan KFC Double Down?
Apr 30, 10
Yes, and it is sinfully disturbing just like the original (minus the animal of course). I was wondering embarking in a vegan donut making party just so I could use them as “bread” and be just like
Paula Dean , only vegan. The experiment began with a simple seitan exercise due to a recent request from a friend, then a journey into the south, then into the dark side. It made sense.
The idea came from a perturbing article in  CultureMap
where vegetarian Social Media Editor
Fayza A. Elmostehi
was about to break 4 years of living a veggie life and was being seduced by the mere
thought of devouring the “meatiest concoction of them all.” I knew I had to do something as other vegan/vegetarians would probably experience the same inexplainable carnivoresque magnetism. So, think of this as an act of heroism. I am here to save the day, like
mighty mouse . So, this will not be the usual vegan gourmet blog I am used to writing, but I have to admit, I enjoyed the process of putting it together.
The recipe is not for the weak. If you live on lettuce, stop right now. You may be offended. Worse, you may be inclined to spend a morning wondering how this will turn out. Of course I consulted one of my favorite vegan chefs
Isa Chandra Moskowitz
and
“Tomorrow Friendly Food – Vegan Recipes, Food Photos, and Fun Things in Austin, Texas” blog
and combined with some of my own.
SEITAN:
2 cups vital wheat gluten
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1 cup water, stock or soy milk (I prefer soymilk for faux chicken)
1/2 cup
Bragg Liquid Aminos
2 Tablespoons Tomato Paste or Juice
1 Tablespoon Olive Oil
3 cloves of garlic, pressed or grated finely
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1 tablespoon fresh thyme
1/2 cup fresh parsley
COOKING BROTH:
10 cups cold water
2 cups low sodium veggie stock
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup molases
2 Tablespoons Apple cider vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
Dash of cayenne
1 teaspoon dried sage
Handful of Parsley leaves
Combine all broth ingredients in a stock pot and keep cold.
Combine the vital wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, cumin, paprika, and pepper in one bowl. In another combine the rest. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and knead roughly for about 5-6 minutes until the gluten becomes elastic, almost like a melted cheesy consistency when stretched. Let rest for 30 minutes.
Raw seitan. Not the sexiest looking thing, but then again, raw meat is not either.
Shape as desired remembering that seitan grows and almost doubles in size. For chicken fried steak, make 4 or 6 patties, not too thick. They will grow.
Seitan formed into faux chicken cutlets
Place the patties in the cold broth mixture. Bring slowly to a boil, then bring the heat down to a gentle simmer and cook for 1 hour.
Seitan taking a leisurely swim. Ok, it was a whole hour.
Eventually, they will float to the surface. Turn off the heat, and let the seitan cool down in the broth, about one hour. Remove.
If you are stopping at this point, store seitan in the refrigerator for no longer than 5 days in broth. Or, if you are courageous, continue.
VEGAN CHICKEN FRIED STEAK BREADING:
The coating begins with spiked chickpea flour
3/4 Cup Chickpea flour
6 Tablespoons
Ener-G Egg Replacer
10 Tablespoons soy milk
1/2 teaspoon
Bragg Liquid Aminos
1 teaspoon Cumin
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
Dash of Cayenne
1 teaspoon steak seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
Pepper to taste
1 Cup of Panko bread crumbs
1 cup of vegan corn flakes, crushed
Beautifully coated a la Chicken Fried Chicken
You’ll need three plates:
In one comine the chickpea flour and half of the dry seasonings (1/2 teaspoon each cumin, onion/garlic powder, steak seasoning, salt, then dash of cayenne and pepper). Mix
in the second, wish together the egg replaces, soy milk and liquid aminos. It will thicken.
In the third, combine the panko, corn flakes and the rest of the seasonings. (1/2 teaspoon each cumin, onion/garlic powder, steak seasoning, salt, then dash of cayenne and pepper). Combine.
Take one piece of faux chicken, cover the chickpea flour mixture, then the wet mixture and finish with the bread/corn flake mixture.
Finish all piece prior to frying. It may get rather messy. Enjoy it.
Fry in one inch of oil under medium heat, allowing the oil to heat up, in a non-stick pan for about 5 minutes on each side.
The golden pieces of faux chicken are so pretty they would fool anyone.
Set on a brown paper bag to remove any excess oil. At this point, you can stop and serve with your favorite mash potatoes and gravy recipe or try my
White Wine Wild Mushroom Vegan Gravy .
VEGAN KFC DOUBLE DOWN:
The beginning of the I can't believe is not cheese cheese sauce
2 types of vegan cheese
Tempeh or other vegan bacon
VEGAN CHEESE SAUCE
1 medium potato, peeled and cubed
1 medium carrot, peeled and diced
1 medium onion, chopped
1 cup nutritional yeast
1 can white northern beans, drained and rinsed
1 tablespoon cashew butter
1 teaspoon mustard
2 tablespoons any miso paste
Juice of 1 lemon
2 teaspoons garlic powder
Silky smooth and so so good.
salt and pepper to taste
Inspired by
Jo Stepaniak’s “ The Ultimate Uncheese Cookbook “, this recipe has a little more flavor and creaminess. In a small saucepan, heat the soy milk, carrot, onion and potato. Boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Put in a blender with the rest of the ingredients. Adjust seasoning and return to the saucepan to keep warm.
Pre-heat the broiler to high. In metal sheet pan, place the faux chicken, top with two pieces of faux bacon, and add a sliced or shredded vegan cheese. Broil for 5-6 minutes until cheese melts. Be careful not to burn.
Top with a spoonful of the cheese sauce and mount, carefully.
This is the type of dish that needs NOTHING else. Bet you can’t finish it. I could not.
Cheese melted, special sauce mounted.
The presentation? Well, this type of dish is not supposed to be pretty. But there is beauty in the most unexpected moments sometimes.
Beauty or the beast?

Quinoa 107: A few of my favorite things – Falafel Quinoa Cakes
Apr 25, 10
Sometimes it takes some sleep, and a little lack of it perhaps to come up with something brilliant.
Delicious and light, best served simply with some raw veggies, a side salad, and a little bit of tahini. Nothing else.
For quite sometime, I have been obsessed with falafel and I know I am not the only one (yes I am talking about you Shari). The quest for perfection in such a whimsical and unpredictable little folkish fritter is beyond non-sensical if you haven’t tried one. If you had, you would understand that such a hunt is not only justifiable, it is darn right essentially necessary, like the Grand Tour, or important rites of passage events such as a Bar-Mitzvah, Confirmation, or finding our mate (for some mates, plural).
Falafel burgers are done and overdone. Its not a new concept. Some better than others and some just mimicking just a huge falafel patty. We can do better. Others just use chickpea flour to create a pseudo pancake thats more like a latke than a pancake. Now a falafel quinoa burger was a combination that came on suddenly with the imaginary (but so real) ding of a small bell.
I found that it is best to call these cakes rather than burgers. They are light and almost have the texture of a crab cake.
1 cup cooked quinoa
2 cans garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained and rinsed
1 small sweet onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, grated or finely chopped
1/2 cup parsley, chopped
1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
1/4 cup bread coating mixture below (optional) or any flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoons cumin
1 teaspoon coriander
1 teaspoon paprika
1/4 cup of tahini
Juice of a lemon
1 teaspoon salt
Fresh pepper, to taste
BREAD COATING (optional)
3/4 Cup Panko Japanese Bread Crumbs
2 Teaspoons Olive OIl
1/2 Teaspoon Lemon Zest
Dash of Paprika
Dash of Salt
Freshly Ground Pepper to taste
But all the bread coating ingredients in a bowl and mix throughly. You may have to use your hands to get the lemon zest to mix well.
Cornucopia of flavorful ingredients
In a food processor, mash the chickpeas until there are no chickpeas whole left. Place them in a large bowl and add the rest of the ingredients. Mix throughly, with your hands if you like it dirty. Tip: make sure the onions and fresh herbs are finely chopped so the cake stays keeps together through cooking.
The gorgeous cakes ready to fry
The recipe will make 6 generous cakes. Form into thick patties and compress using your bare hands. It feels good. Dip into the bread coating mixture and fry on each for about 5 minutes. Each side should be an enticing golden brown.
Do not crowd your pan. Cook two or three at a time.
The smell is intoxicating. Be careful when you turn them over. If they fall appart slightly, do not worry. Squeeze them back together and treat with care.
Fully cooked. You want it.
Serve with a little tahini or your favorite topping. Nothing too elaborate. These are delicious just as they are.

Quinoa 106: Carbs are evil – Apple Quinoa Spelt Muffins
Apr 24, 10
My precious. Fabulous little muffins that are actually good carbs. Yes there is such a thing.
Carbs have become evil in our society. They are the main cause of obesity, problems with the economy, the downfall of Enron, and of course, they are at the center of the ongoing healthcare debate. There are recent allegations that carbs were indeed responsible for causing Tiger Woods to have repeated faithfulness slips, caused Israel to ban the iPad as well as being directly responsible for the huge Toyota recall.
I have an affair with carbs and I am, today, admitting it in public. Yes, I love carbs. To the rest of you who judge me, go gag on a baguette.
I do believe in a balanced diet (but one that does not include animal products) and carbs are great for you, as long as they are not refined, simple, and cause a sugar spike so high you resemble Clinton during his non-inhaling days. So, staying away from white flour, refined sugar, white rice and white pasta would certainly be a good idea (I hope I don’t have to mention processed foods with high fructose corn syrup, candy, sugary sodas etc.).
So why bake with white flour? So you can have something beautifully textured. I get it. But you can do better.
Spelt flour is delicious, nutritious and slightly nutty coupling beautifully with quinoa. Spelt also has slightly less calories and more protein than wheat. It won’t rise as beautifully as white flour, but I am sure you can live with that knowing that these little guys, lets call them Herman, are earthy homey delicacies. So I get to eat my carbs, but feel better about it.
1 cup of cooked quinoa
1 sweet apple, peeled and chopped
3 tablespoons flax seeds
6 tablespoons of water
1/3 cup of canola oil
1/2 cup maple syrup (the real thing, no high fructose corn syrup knock offs)
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cups of spelt flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup of chopped pecans
Oil a muffin pan or use disposable muffin paper cups. You can find recycled and compostable paper cups easily nowadays. Go green.
All in. Mixing gently as to wake up the protein but not to disturb it too much. Nudge.
Put the flax seeds and water in a blender and shimmy until crushed and frothy. This is actually the binding agent and replaces eggs in some vegan baked recipes. Use it anytime you would not mind a nutty earthy flavor. Place in a bowl and mix in the oil, maple syrup, apple sauce and vanilla.
In another bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Mix well. Pour in the wet ingredients and mix just until all ingredients come together. No more. Spelt is a delicate flour and we do not want to overmix.  The batter with be rather sticky and deliciously earthy.
Fold in the quinoa and apple. Pour in the muffin tins. Its ok if you over fill. Bake for 25 minutes. Swoon. I always do.
The end result?
Up close and personal
These are chunky, homey muffins. Definitely not for the faint at heart. Can you spot the gorgeous quinoa pearls? They are truly stunning, like a fine piece of jewelry that you get to eat.
Melting vegan butter on piping hot goodness. You want some.
These are perfect with a generous helping of vegan butter (unless fats are now evil). I happen to have some cashew butter on hand, so slathered some nut goo and devoured. It matched beautifully the peasant-esque of this pastry.
And this is how I do it…
