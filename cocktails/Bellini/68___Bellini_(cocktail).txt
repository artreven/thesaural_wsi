Stonyhurst College - Credit:

Stonyhurst College , established in 1794, was originally a Catholic boys' school in the
Jesuit
tradition, as well as a seminary for Jesuit priests. It is situated near the town of Clitheroe in Lancashire.
Its role as a seminary came to an end in the 1920s, but it continues as an independent  Catholic boarding and day school , now fully co-educational.

I refused to be an Enfant de Marie

The exact meaning of an
Enfant de Marie
(Fr.
Child of
Mary)
is unclear.
Possibly, it is related to an order known as the
Congregation of the Children of Mary
which was founded in Castelnaudary in the South of France by a Father Dulignan, sometime between 1830 and 1842. This order is what is known as a
Third Order  (one whose members, known as
Tertiaries,
live normally in the outside world, rather than being part of an institutionalised religious community).
The term
Enfant de Marie
is also linked to an organisation formed on the basis of a vision experienced by
St. Catharine Laboure  in 1835, which was especially popular during the mid-20th Century. After a six month period of 'aspirancy', its young women members earn the right to wear a blue cape which they relinquish on marriage.
Does anyone have any more information on this?

by

In the Roman Catholic Church, the  blessed Sacrament  is the name given to the consecrated bread and wine (which are seen as representing the body and blood of Christ) used during Holy Communion (the Eucharist).
Some of the consecrated elements may be kept and stored in a locked cabinet known as a
tabernacle .

A rosary is the term given to a set of
prayer beads
used in a Catholic
devotion *, as well as to the devotion itself (the devotion usually being referred to as
the
Rosary ).
A
decade
is one complete sequence of prayers which is timed by moving a group of 10 beads on the rosary.
*a prayer routine used by Catholics which is not an official public prayer of the Church, i.e., not part of the
liturgy .

David Lloyd George
(1863-1945) was a Welsh Liberal politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1908 to 1915, and as Prime Minister from 1916 to 1922.
As Chancellor of the Exchequer, he is best remembered for introducing financial state support for the sick and infirm, and for initiating the
Old Age Pension
in 1908.
As Prime Minister, he is renowned for steering Britain through the later stages of the First World War, and through the subsequent
peace negotiations at Versailles .
He was a colourful and controversial figure and one may only speculate as to why Cordelia Flyte considered him a suitable object of her rosary devotions!

Wilhelm II
(1859-1941) was the last Emperor of Germany and King of Prussia.
He succeeded his father as King and Emperor in 1888, and ruled until his forced abdication at the end of the First World War in 1918.
In spite of being a grandson of Queen Victoria, his role as Germany's wartime leader inevitably made him a hate figure to the British people and their allies.

Although called a

From the 15th Century onwards, wealthy Venetians buit villas along its banks.

Vittoria Corombona has asked us all to her ball on Saturday

by

Vittoria Corombona
(or
The White Devil ) is the name of a play by
John Webster
(1580-1625); it belongs to the genre known as
revenge tragedy .
The play's central character, Vittoria Corombona, is a young woman from a Venetian family who is tried for adultery and the murder of her husband.
A real event, the murder of Vittoria Accoramboni in Padua in 1585, was the inspiration for the plot.
We can, of course, only speculate as to whether Waugh wishes us to read any particular significance into his choice of name.

British propaganda poster World War 1 - Credit:
Savile Lumley
Charles Ryder and Sebastian Flyte belong to the generation that was just too young to have fought in the
First World War , yet was old enough to be aware of its horrific carnage and suffering.
Sebastian's comment derives from the idea, prevalent in the war's aftermath, that such an event would never be allowed to happen again, and that the First World War would be
the war to end all wars.
Waugh, writing
Brideshead Revisited
during the Second World War (in which he served), and portraying Charles Ryder as an Army Captain, would have been acutely aware of the tragic irony of Sebastian's words.

We may assume, therefore, that Mr Samgrass (whom we will come to know very much better, as the novel progresses) has top notch intellectual abilities.

As mentioned previously (bookmark, p.35), Charles Ryder's cousin Jasper warned against
Boar's Hill , although it was not quite clear why he should do so.
Tea on Boar's Hill might have involved one of the various literary or scholarly figures who lived there in the early decades of the 20th Century. These included the poets John Masefield, Robert Bridges, Robert Graves and Edmund Blunden, as well as the classical scholar, Gilbert Murray. Boar's Hill was also home to the actress Lillah Emma McCarthy (Lady Keeble) who was a leading lady in several plays by George Bernard Shaw.
Keble   is an Oxford College, established in 1870 in memory of John Keble, one of the founders of the Oxford Movement which strove to introduce a more Catholic form of worship into the Anglican Church.
The college was originally heavily involved in theological teaching, although this is no longer the case.  Both its religiosity and its modernity (in the 1920s) might have been reasons to be suspicious of those who attended lectures there.
