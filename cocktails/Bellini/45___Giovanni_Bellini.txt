Shadows Sail Across the Plain

… Clouds pile up in the sky, shadows sail across the plain.
This is from the chapter “The Landscape of Fact” in
Landscape Into Art
by
Kenneth Clark
(1949). This chapter was preceded by “The Landscape of Symbols” and is followed by “The Landscape of Fantasy” to give you the context of what
Clark
is writing (my post from the previous chapter is
here ). I will give the opening sentence of this chapter — which I find surprising — and then jump to cherry pick what I enjoy from the rest of the chapter:
Facts become art through love, which unifies them and lifts them to a higher plane of reality; and, in landscape, this all embracing love is expressed by light.
… [ skipping eight pages of history ]
Bellini
makes an effect of light the motive power of his picture. He chooses, to symbolize his subject, the moment when the plain is still in shadow, but the rising sun has touched the hill-tops. Deeply imaginative as it is, this effect is also perfectly true, as anyone who has visited the walled towns of the Veneto will remember, and it is clearly the result of impassioned observation.
Bellini’s
landscapes are the supreme instance of facts transfigured through love. Few artists have been capable of such universal love, which embraces every twig, every stone, the humblest detail as well as the most grandiose perspective, and can only be attained by a profound humility.
Ruskin , in his chapter on
the pathetic fallacy , in volume three of
Modern Painters , distinguishes three classes of perception: ‘The man who perceives rightly because he does not feel, and to whom the primrose is very accurately the primrose, because he does not love it. Then, secondly, the man who perceives wrongly, because he feels, and to whom the primrose is anything else than a primrose: a star, or a sun, or a fairy’s shield, or a forsaken maiden. And then, lastly, there is the man who perceives rightly in spite of his feelings, and to whom the primrose is for ever nothing else than itself — a little flower apprehended in the very plain and leafy fact of it, whatever and how many soever the associations and passions may be that crowd around it.’
Bellini
was of the third class, and to it, as
Ruskin
says, belong poets of the highest order. In his early work he had loved the poignant light of sunrise and sunset, and these moments of heightened emotion he continued to portray when they could intensify the meaning of his subjects, as in the
Resurrection
in the Berlin Gallery: it is typical of
Bellini’s  charity that the light which irradiates Our Lord has already crept round the tomb to bathe the sleeping soldiers. But as he grew older he became more in love with the full light of day in which all things can expand and be themselves. This is the feeling which pervades the picture of St. Francis now in the Frick Collection. Here, at last, a true illustration of St. Francis’ hymn to the sun. No other great painting, perhaps, contains such a quantity of natural details, observed and rendered with incredible patience: for no other painter has been able to give to such an accumulation the unity which is only achieved by love.
[ … ]
… In so far as we can trace development in
Breughel’s
[sic] short career, it is in his ability to make his criticism of life implicit rather than explicit. He begins with proverbs and allegories, in which landscape is a setting and an accessory; he evolves to the great landscapes in which the accidents of human life are one with the weather and the seasons. Few works of art are less in need of commentary. They are like Handel’s
Messiah
and the
Pilgrim’s Progress , amongst those very rare works of the first order which have a widespread, immediate appeal.
His Hunters in the Snow
has come to hold almost the same place in the popular imagination as was held by the madonnas of
Guido Reni
and
Sassoferrato
a hundred and fifty years ago, and in wintry weather people may be heard muttering the name of
Breughel
much as, in the eighteenth century, travellers invoked the name of
Salvator Rosa , and with a great deal more justice.
… The confidence with which
Breughel  looks back and forward in time and seizes any weapon which comes to hand, is almost Shakespearean, and is used for a similar end: the expression of an all-embracing sympathy with humanity. For although his human beings , their faces simplified to mere discs, seem sometimes to lose their individualities, and become part of the mechanism of the universe, yet in the end it is the struggles and miseries and scarce animal pleasures of their lives which really absorb him, and dictate the character of his landscapes.
Breughel’s
work remains unique. Though he had many imitators, none was able to use his style for a fresh creative purpose. The course of landscape painting was set towards a totality of impression and away from the rich accumulation of incidents with which
Breughel’s
landscapes were filled. But now that impressionism has run its course, some painter who believes that the life of man is linked with nature may once more turn to him for inspiration.
In this next part,
Clark
is talking about
Jacob van Ruysdael :
… This grave, lonely man was evidently subject to fits of depression in which he worked without a spark of feeling or vitality. But when his emotions were rekindled he felt the grandeur and pathos of simple nature with a truly Wordsworthian force. This feeling he expressed, as all the greatest landscape painters have done, through the large disposition of light and dark, so that even before we approach his pictures we feel their dramatic significance: it is only on looking more closely that we find them full of observed facts. Once more light lifts these facts on to a new plane of reality; but here light has a new character. It is no longer static and saturating as in Bellini. It is in continual movement. Clouds pile up in the sky, shadows sail across the plain. Constable said that the best lesson on art he ever had was contained in the words, ‘Remember light and shadow never stand still.’ Nowhere, in the art which preceded him, was this lesson so beautifully demonstrated as in the paintings of
Rysdael , and in fact Ruysdael was to become the model for the whole
East Anglian school
of landscape painting.
