Event: Venice Piazza presents Notte D'Opera Sotto Le Stelle (Opera Night under the Stars)
Awesome! I didn't realize watching opera live would get me glued to the music reminiscing romantic stories and totally swept with so much emotions last Friday, September 2, 2010 at
Venice Piazza , Mckinley Hill, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig. The world class Italian Opera featured outstanding voices of
Danielle Gaspari, Jolanta Stanelite,
Alberto De Meis and Guido Galterio
made each member of the audience stand and shout "Bravo" after hearing each song. Soprano Jolanta Stanelite almost made me cry when she sang one of the most familiar Italian Opera song used in most movies we know (I wasn't able to hear the title). I was so amazed at the performance I didn't feel the drizzle of rain on my side being seated at the left edge of the audience. Authentic Italian costumes of Bolero paraded and danced as intermission between performances of the soloists and it was truly astounding to watch the details of every costume design. I couldn't help but stare at each costume design with such grand detail distinct of Italian culture and stage presence. The event made me feel romantic and made me appreciate Italian Opera more than before as I've watched opera singers only on videos. I wish they'd hold more of these type of events for the Filipino to appreciate opera songs uncommon and not well-patronized against the rise of modern and popular culture today.
Did you know?
We are all familiar with Pavarotti but
Italian opera
is both the art of
opera
in
Italy
and opera in the
Italian language .
Opera was born in Italy around the year 1600 and Italian opera has
continued to play a dominant role in the history of the form until the
present day. Many famous operas in Italian were written by foreign
composers, including
Handel ,
Gluck
and
Mozart . Works by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as
Rossini ,
Bellini ,
Donizetti ,
Verdi
and
Puccini , are amongst the most famous operas ever written and today are performed in opera houses across the world.
