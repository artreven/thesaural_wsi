In
Celtic polytheism
the word
druid
denotes the priestly class in ancient
Celtic
societies, which existed through much of
Western Europe
north of the Alps and in the
British Isles
until they were supplanted by Roman government and, later,
Christianity. Druidic practices were part of the culture of all the
tribal peoples called "Keltoi" and " Galatai " by Greeks and " Celtae " and " Galli " by Romans, which evolved into modern English "Celtic" and " Gaulish ". They combined the duties of priest, arbitrator, healer, scholar, and
magistrate .
The Druids were polytheists, but also deified elements of nature,
such as the sun, the moon, and the stars, looking to them for "signs
and seasons". They also venerated other natural elements, such as the
oak, certain groves, tops of hills, streams, lakes and even plants,
most of all, mistletoe. Fire was regarded as a symbol of several
divinities and was associated with the sun and cleansing.
Their calendar year was governed by the lunar, solar, and vegetative
cycles. Archaeological evidence suggests that ceremonies were conducted
to celebrate the two solstices and two equinoxes every year. These
festivals would have been governed by the position and motions of the
Sun alone. In addition to these, four holidays were celebrated
according to the lunar and vegetative cycles. These include Imbolc
(Imbolg) to denote the first signs of spring, Beltane (Beltain) to
recognize the fullness of life after spring, Lughnassah to celebrate
the power of the Solar deity Lugh, and Samhain to recognize the
lowering of the barrier between the world of the living and that of the
dead. The timing for these latter four festivals would have been
determined by the presence of a full moon and the signs of life implied
by the above. Imbolg would thus be celebrated at a full moon roughly
halfway between the winter solstice and the vernal equinox, Beltane
between the vernal equinox and the summer solstice, Lughnassah between
the summer solstice and the autumnal equinox, and Samhain between the
autumnal equinox and the winter solstice. This is contrary to popular
"New Age" beliefs about Druidism that celebrate a given holiday
according to the Julian calendar, which of course did not exist at the
time of the formulation of these holidays. In modern times, Imbolg has
been transformed into Groundhog Day, elements of Beltane have been
absorbed into Easter, and Samhain has become Halloween (or All Hallows'
Eve or All Saint's Day).
Modern attempts at reconstructing or reinventing Druidism are called
Neo-druidism .

Etymology
The word "Druid" probably traces to the ancient tree magic practiced
by the Celts, and the tree calendars they originally used. A vestige of
this tradition, perhaps the last vestige, survives in the traditional
Irish names for the letters of the alphabet. The traditional name for
each letter of the Irish Alphabet (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, l, m, n,
o, p, r, s, t, u) is the name of a tree.
The etymology given by the editors of the
American Heritage Dictionary
(4th Ed.), based on Pokorny's
Indo-germanisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch , is as follows:
Druid
comes to English from Latin
druides
(pronounced "droo-EE-dess"), which is the same as the term used by
Ancient Greek
writers, the first to discuss the Celts: Δρυίδης ( Druides ), associated by folk etymology with δρυς ( drus , pronounced "drooss," meaning "oak tree"). The Latin and Greek terms trace via
Proto-Celtic
*druwid
(also reconstructed as
*druwis
and
*druwids ) to the
Proto-Indo-European
roots
deru
("dru-") and
weid
("-wid").
"Deru," (also spelled "dreu"), means "to be firm, solid, steadfast."
Thus, the word acquired specialised senses meaning "wood," "tree," and
things made from or analogised to trees and wood. Other modern words
(here, in their English forms) that trace to
deru
include:
tree, truce, true/truth, troth/betroth, trust, tryst, tray, trough,
trim, tar, durum, duress, endure, drupe, dryad, dendron, philodendron,
and deodar.
"Weid" means "to see" and, by extension and figurative use, also
refers to seers, wisdom, and knowledge - especially secret knowledge or
wisdom that requires a kind of deeper sight (or "second sight") to
ascertain. Other modern words (again, in their English forms) that
trace to
weid
include: twit, guide, guise, wise/wisdom, wit,
witenagemot (the "wit" portion), kaleidoscope (the "eid" portion),
view, visa, visage, vision, review, revise, improvise, supervise,
history/story, veda, and penguin (the "guin" portion).
Greek and Latin "druides" bear comparison with Old Irish
druídecht
(pron. "DREE-jekht"; the 'u' is part of the spelling only to indicate
the 'd' and 'r' are broad instead of slender), which yields Modern
Irish
draoiocht
(pron. "DROO-awcht"), "magic."
Welsh
dryw
("DREE-oo", meaning seer) may be
cognate .
The
Modern Irish
for Druid is
drúa
("DROO-uh"), from Old Irish
druí
("droo-EE"); which also produced Irish
draoi
("DROO-ee"), "magician" and
Modern Gaelic
druidh
("dr:ee"; the 'u' is only there to indicate the preceding consonant is broad, not slender), meaning "enchanter" and
draoidh
("DROO-ee"), "magician." Observe that the Irish and Gaelic words are
actually the same word. The spelling difference dates from the
mid-twentieth century, when the government agency that regulates the
standard dialect of the Irish language combed through the lexicon and
modernised many spellings.
Some research done on the ancient Indian scripture Rig Veda,( http://www.bharatvani.org/books/rig/ ) suggests a close parallel between the Druids and the Druhyus referred therein.[ citation needed ] This may represent a common
Proto-Indo-European religious
heritage for the tradition.
History
From what little we know of late Druidic practice, it appears deeply
traditional and conservative, in the sense that Druids were conserving
repositories of culture and lore. It is impossible now to judge whether
this continuity had deep historical roots and originated in the social
transformations of the late
La Tène culture , or whether there had been a discontinuity and a Druidic religious innovation.
Our historical knowledge of Druids is very limited. Druidic lore
consisted of a large number of verses learned by heart and it has been
claimed that twenty years were required to complete the course of
study. There was a very advanced Druidic teaching centre on
Anglesey
( Ynys Môn )
centred on magical lakes and Druids went there from all over Europe to
learn their secrets, but what was taught there, or at other centres, is
conjecture. Of the Druids' oral literature (sacred songs, formulas for
prayers and incantations, rules of divination and magic) not one verse
has survived, even in translation, nor is there even a legend that can
be called purely Druidic, without a Roman and/or Christian overlay or
interpretation.
Roman sources
Caesar
Caesar 's
Commentarii de Bello Gallico
gives the fullest account of the Druids. Caesar notes that all men of
any rank and dignity in Gaul were included either among the Druids or
among the nobles, indicating that they formed two classes. The Druids
constituted the learned priestly class, and as guardians of the
unwritten ancient customary law they had the power of executing
judgments, among which exclusion from society was the most dreaded.
Druids were not a hereditary caste, though they enjoyed exemption from
military service as well as from payment of taxes. The course of
training to which a novice had to submit was protracted.
All instruction was communicated orally, but for ordinary purposes,
Caesar reports that the Gauls had a written language in which they used
Greek characters. In this he probably draws on earlier writers; by the
time of Caesar,
Gaulish
had moved from the Greek script to the Latin script.
As a result of this prohibition — and of the decline of Gaulish in
favour of Latin — no druidic documents, if there ever were any, have
survived. "The principal point of their doctrine", says Caesar, "is
that the soul does not die and that after death it passes from one body
into another" (see
metempsychosis ).
This observation led several ancient writers to the unlikely conclusion
that the Druids may have been influenced by the teachings of the Greek
philosopher
Pythagoras . Caesar also notes the druidic sense of the guardian spirit of the tribe, whom he translated as
Dispater,
with a general sense of
Father
Hades .
However, linguistically
Dis Pater
is related to
Jupiter
(Jovis Pater), from
Proto-Indo-European
word
Dyeus .
Caesar noted that Druids punished members of the society by a form
of excommunication, by preventing them from attending religious
festivals. As these religious festivals were common and well-attended,
this was an effective means of excluding punished persons from society.
Caesar also says that the Druids engaged in human sacrifice, and that it originated in
Britain .
Other writers
Writers such as
Diodorus
and
Strabo , with less firsthand experience than Caesar, were of the opinion that the Celtic priestly order or class included Druids,
Bards
and
Vates
(soothsayers).
It was also claimed by Roman writers that a general assembly of the
order was held once every year within the territories of the
Carnutes
in Gaul.
Pomponius Mela
Pomponius Mela
is the first author who says that the Druids' instruction was secret,
and was carried on in caves and forests. Certain groves within forests
were sacred, and the Romans and Christians alike cut them down and
burned the wood.
Human sacrifice
has sometimes been attributed to Druidism. While this may be Roman
propaganda, human sacrifice was an old European inheritance and the
Gauls may have offered human sacrifices, whether of criminals or, to
judge from Roman reports, of war captives.
Cicero
Cicero remarks on the existence among the Gauls of augurs or
soothsayers, known by the name of Druids; he had made the acquaintance
of one
Divitiacus , an
Aeduan .
Diodorus
Diodorus asserts, on unnamed sources, that a sacrifice acceptable to
the Celtic gods had to be attended by a Druid, for they were the
intermediaries. He also claims that before a battle they often threw
themselves between two armies to bring about peace.
Imperial decrees
Druids were seen as essentially non-Roman: a prescript of
Augustus
forbade Roman citizens to practice Druidical rites. Under
Tiberius
the Druids were suppressed by a decree of the Senate, but this had to be renewed by
Claudius
in 54 CE.
Strabo
In
Strabo
we find the Druids still acting as arbiters in public and private matters, but they no longer dealt with cases of murder.
Pliny
In Pliny their activity is limited to the practice of medicine and
sorcery. According to him, the Druids held the mistletoe in the highest
veneration and groves of oak were their chosen retreats. In what is
probably a fanciful extension of this story, Pliny claims that the
mistletoe was cut with a golden knife by a priest clad in a white robe,
two white bulls being sacrificed on the spot.
Tacitus
Tacitus , in describing the attack made on the island of Mona ( Anglesey
or
Ynys Môn
in Welsh) by the Romans under Suetonius Paulinus, represents the
legionaries as being awestruck on landing by the appearance of a band
of Druids, who, with hands uplifted to the sky, poured forth terrible
imprecations on the heads of the invaders. The courage of the Romans,
however, soon overcame such fears, according to the Roman historian;
the Britons were put to flight, and the sacred groves of Mona were cut
down.
Late Roman
After the 1st century CE the continental Druids disappeared entirely and were referred to only on very rare occasions.
Ausonius , for one instance, apostrophizes the rhetorician Attius Patera as sprung from a race of Druids.
Early Druids in Britain and Ireland
The story of
Vortigern
as reported by
Nennius
provides one of the very few glimpses of Druidic survival in Britain
after the Roman conquest: unfortunately, Nennius is noted for mixing
fact and legend in such a way that it is now impossible to know the
truth behind his text. For what it is worth, he asserts that, after
being excommunicated by
Germanus , the British leader Vortigern invited twelve Druids to assist him.
In Irish literature the Druids are frequently (and reliably)
mentioned, and their functions in the island seem to correspond fairly
well to those they performed in Gaul (the Modern
Irish
word for "magic",
draíocht , derives from
Old Irish
druídecht ). Even in very early times, however, the
bards
usurped many of the duties of the Druids and finally supplanted them with the spread of Christianity.
The most important Irish documents are contained in
manuscripts
of the
12th century , but many of the texts themselves go back as far as the
8th .
In these stories Druids usually act as advisers to kings. Once again
legendary elements crept in: they were said to have the ability to
foretell the future ( Bec mac Dé , for example, predicted the death of
Diarmaid mac Cearbhaill
more accurately than three Christian saints) and there is little
reference to their religious function. They do not appear to form any
corporation, nor do they seem to be exempt from military service.
In the
Ulster Cycle ,
Cathbad , chief Druid at the court of
Conchobar , king of
Ulster ,
is accompanied by a number of youths (100 according to the oldest
version) who are desirous of learning his art. Cathbad is present at
the birth of the famous tragic heroine
Deirdre ,
and prophesies what sort of a woman she will be, and the strife that
will accompany her, although Conchobar ignores him. The following
description of the band of Cathbad's Druids occurs in the epic tale,
the
Táin bó Cuailnge :
The attendant raises his eyes towards heaven and observes the clouds
and answers the band around him. They all raise their eyes towards
heaven, observe the clouds, and hurl spells against the elements, so
that they arouse strife amongst them and clouds of fire are driven
towards the camp of the men of Ireland. We are further told that at the
court of Conchobar no one had the right to speak before the Druids had
spoken.
Before setting out on the great expedition against Ulster in
Táin Bó Cuailnge ,
Medb , queen of
Connacht ,
consults her Druids regarding the outcome of the war. They hold up the
march by two weeks, waiting for an auspicious omen. Druids were also
said to have magical skills: when the hero
Cúchulainn
returned from the land of the fairies after having been enticed there by a fairy woman or goddess, named
Fand ,
whom he is now unable to forget, he is given a potion by some Druids,
which banishes all memory of his recent adventures and which also rids
his wife
Emer
of the pangs of jealousy.
Hill of Tara in County Meath, Ireland, legendary seat of the High Kings.
More remarkable still is the story of
Étain . This lady, later the wife of
Eochaid Airem ,
High King of Ireland , was in a former existence the beloved of the god
Midir ,
who again seeks her love and carries her off. The king has recourse to
his Druid Dalgn, who requires a whole year to discover the haunt of the
couple. This he accomplished by means of four wands of yew inscribed
with
ogham
characters.
In other texts the Druids are able to produce insanity.
Mug Ruith , a legendary druid of
Munster , wore a hornless bull's hide and an elaborate feathered headdress and had the ability to fly and conjure storms.
Social and religious influence
The Druids' influence was as much social as religious. They not only performed roles similar to modern
priests , but were often the
philosophers ,
scientists , lore-masters,
teachers ,
judges
and counsellors to the
kings .
The Druids linked the Celtic peoples with their numerous gods, the
lunar calendar and the sacred natural order. They were suppressed in
Gaul and Britain after the
Roman
conquests, but retained their influence in Ireland until the coming of
Christianity. The Druids' roles were then assumed by the
bishop
and the
abbot , who were usually not the same individual, however, and might find themselves in direct competition.
Nevertheless, much traditional rural religious practice can still be
discerned from Christian interpretations and survives in practices like
Halloween
observances,
corn dollies
and other harvest rituals, the myths of
Puck ,
woodwoses ,
"lucky" and "unlucky" plants and animals and the like.
Orally-transmitted material may have exaggerated deep origins in
antiquity, however, and is constantly subject to influence from
surrounding culture.
Druidic sites
Sites associated with Druidry include:
The Isle of
Ynys Môn
The
Isle of Man
The
Isle of Arran
Wistman's Wood on
Dartmoor
Newland's Corner
in Surrey
Iona
Draoi-Heil
The association of Druids with
Stonehenge
was invented in the sixteenth century in attempts to explain the
mysteries of Stonehenge, a prehistoric monument that was abandoned long
before any Druids came to Britain. There is no evidence whatever that
it was ever used by authentic Druids in ancient times. Nevertheless, it
has become an important site for modern movements calling themselves
druidic.
In Christian literature
In the lives of saints and martyrs, the Druids are represented as
magicians and diviners opposing the Christian missionaries. In
Adamnan 's
vita
of Columba, two of them act as tutors to the daughters of
Lóegaire mac Néill , the
High King , at the coming of
Saint Patrick . They are represented as endeavouring to prevent the progress of Patrick and Saint
Columba
by raising clouds and mist. Before the battle of Culdremne (561) a Druid made an
airbe drtiad
(fence of protection?) round one of the armies, but what is precisely
meant by the phrase is unclear. The Irish Druids seem to have had a
peculiar tonsure. The word
druí
is always used to render the
Latin
magus , and in one passage St Columba speaks of Christ as his Druid.
In many of Stephen R. Lawhead's historical fantasies, however,
druids are represented as poets, philosophers, and learned men who were
simply misled, and in Sigmund Brouwer's Winds of Light series of six
books, they are portrayed as a sect that hid and masqueraded as
commoners in an attempt to usurp power in Britain in the twelfth
century.
Once the public ordination of Christian bishops in strongly Druidic
territories was possible, it was essential for a 4th century bishop to
demonstrate comparable powers.
Sulpicius Severus '
Vita
of
Martin of Tours
relates how Martin encountered a peasant funeral, carrying the body in
a winding sheet, which Martin mistook for some Druidic rites of
sacrifice, "because it was the custom of the Gallic rustics in their
wretched folly to carry about through the fields the images of demons
veiled with a white covering." So Martin halted the procession by
raising his pectoral cross: "Upon this, the miserable creatures might
have been seen at first to become stiff like rocks. Next, as they
endeavored, with every possible effort, to move forward, but were not
able to take a step farther, they began to whirl themselves about in
the most ridiculous fashion, until, not able any longer to sustain the
weight, they set down the dead body." Then discovering his error,
Martin raised his hand again to let them proceed: "Thus," the
hagiographer points out," he both compelled them to stand when he
pleased, and permitted them to depart when he thought good."

This account partly depends on information from the
Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1911
and the
Catholic Encyclopedia, 1908 .
Late Druidic survivals
Ireland
There is some evidence that the druids of Ireland survived into the mid- to late-seventh century. In the
De Mirabilibus Sacrae Scripturae
of
Augustinus Hibernicus
(f.
655 ), there is mention of local
magi
who teach a doctrine of
reincarnation
in the form of birds. The word
magus
was often used in
Hiberno-Latin
works as a translation of
drui .
The idea of reincarnation of the soul in the form of a bird is also found in some Christian literature, specifically
apocrypha
dealing with
Elijah
and
Elisha , where the two are martyred and return to preach in the form of birds. There was also the story of
King Arthur
reportedly turned into a crow upon his death.

edited by John Carey. Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2000.
Flanders
The people of
Flanders
and the
Low Countries
remained pagan as late as the 7th century CE, when
Saint Eligius
travelled from Antwerp to
Frisia , preaching and converting them to
Christianity . One of the best glimpses of late Druidic practices comes from the
Vita
of Eligius written by
saint Ouen ,
his contemporary and companion. Ouen drew together the familiar
admonitions of Eligius to the pagans in Flanders. "It does not
represent anything he said in a particular day in order" Ouen
cautioned, "but is a digest of the precepts which he taught the people
at all times."
Eligius in his sermons denounced "sacrilegious pagan customs." The following excerpted quotes from Ouen's
Vita
of Eligius are instructive, for the negative description they offer of some late druidic practices in Flanders:
"For no cause or infirmity should you
consult magicians, diviners, sorcerers or incantators , or presume to question them."
"Do not observe
auguries
or
violent sneezing
or pay attention to any little
birds singing
along the road. If you are distracted on the road or at any other work,
make the sign of the cross and say your Sunday prayers with faith and
devotion and nothing inimical can hurt you."
"No Christian should be concerned about which day he leaves home or
which day he returns, because God has made all days. No influence
attaches to the
first work of the day or the [phase of the] moon ; nothing is ominous or ridiculous about the
Calends
of January
[what we would call
New Year's Day
].
"[Do not] make
vetulas, *,
little deer
or iotticos
or
set tables [for the house-elf, compare
Puck
] at night
or
exchange New Years' gifts
or
supply superfluous drinks
[a
Yule
custom]."
Vetula , a little figure of the Old Woman. A Roman would have equated her with
Hecate , but precisely who the Old Woman was and what she meant in the pagan
Low Countries
cannot be determined.
"No Christian gives credence to impurity or sits in incantation, because the work is diabolic. No Christian
on the
feast of Saint John * or the solemnity of any other saint performs
solestitia
[summer solstice rites] or
dancing or leaping or diabolical chants. "
The Christian
summer solstice
feast of Saint
John the Baptist
is still celebrated with
bonfires
on June 24th, though the actual June Solstice occurs on June 21 (or 20th) in the Gregorian Calendar.
"No Christian should presume to invoke the name of a demon, not
Neptune
or
Orcus *
or
Diana
or
Minerva
or
Geniscus
or believe in these inept beings in any way. No one should observe
Jove's day in idleness without holy festivities not in May or any other
time, not days of
larvae ** or mice or any day but Sunday. No Christian should make or render any devotion to the
gods of the trivium, where three roads meet
[cf.
Hecate ], to the
fanes or the rocks, or springs or groves or corners. "
Orcus, a chthonic Etruscan/Roman god of the underworld, who enforced the sacredness of oaths and avenged the broken word. ( An essay on Hades/Orcus. )
Larvae
("malignant spirits") in this Latin text more specifically refer to the
Roman
Feast of the Lemures , propitiating the dead, rather than to the Celtic propitiation, which was at
Samhain .
"None should presume to hang any
phylacteries * from the neck
of man nor beast, even if they are made by priests and it is said that
they contain holy things and divine scripture, because there is no
remedy of Christ in these things but only the devil's poison."
Gregory of Tours
set great store by phylacteries.
"None should presume to make lustrations or incantations with herbs, or to
pass cattle through a hollow tree
or ditch because this is to consecrate them to the devil. No woman should presume to
hang
amber
from her neck
or call upon
Minerva
or other ill-starred beings in their weaving or dyeing but in all works
give thanks only to Christ and confide in the power of his name with
all your hearts. None should presume to
shout when the moon is obscured,
for by God's order eclipses happen at certain times. Nor should they
fear the new moon or abandon work because of it. For God made the moon
for this, to mark time and temper the darkness of night, not impede
work nor make men mad as the foolish imagine, who believe lunatics are
invaded by demons from the moon. None should
call the sun or moon lord
or swear by them because they are God's creatures and they serve the needs of men by God's order."
"No one should
tell fate or fortune or horoscopes
by them as those do who believe that a person must be what he was born to be."
"Above all, should any infirmity occur, do not seek
incantators or diviners or sorcerers or magicians , do not use diabolic phylacteries through
springs and groves or crossroads .
But let the invalid confide solely in the mercy of God and take the
body and blood of Christ with faith and devotion and ask the church
faithfully for blessing and oil, with which he might anoint his body in
the name of Christ and, according to the apostle, "the prayer of faith
will save the infirm and the Lord will relieve him."
" Diabolical games and dancing or chants
of the gentiles will be forbidden. No Christian will do them because he thus makes himself pagan. Nor is it right that
diabolical canticles
should proceed from a Christian mouth where the sacrament of Christ is
placed, which it becomes always to praise God. Therefore, brothers,
spurn all inventions of the enemy with all your heart and flee these
sacrileges with all horror. Venerate no creature beyond God and his
saints. Shun
springs and arbors which they call sacred . You are forbidden to
make the crook which they place on the crossroads
and wherever you find one you should burn it with fire. For you must
believe that you can be saved by no other art than the invocation and
cross of Christ. For how will it be if groves where these miserable men
make their devotions, are felled and the wood from them given to the
furnace? See how foolish man is, to
offer honor to insensible, dead trees
and despise the precepts of God almighty. Do not believe that
the sky or the stars or the earth or any creature should be adored
beyond God for He created and disposes of them all."
The Druidic Revival
In the
18th century , England and Wales experienced a revival of interest in the Druids, inspired by the antiquaries
John Aubrey ,
John Toland
and
William Stukeley . The poet
William Blake
was involved in the revival and may have been an Archdruid; the
Ancient Druid Order ,
which existed from 1717 until it split into two groups in 1964, never
used the title "Archdruid" for any member but credited Blake as having
been its Chosen Chief from 1799 to 1827.
John Aubrey was the first modern writer to connect
Stonehenge
and other
megalithic monuments
with Druidry, a misconception that shaped ideas of Druidry during much
of the 19th century. Some modern Druidry enthusiasts claim Aubrey was
an archdruid in possession of an uninterrupted tradition of Druidic
knowledge, even though Aubrey, an uninhibited collector of lore and
gossip, never entered a corroborating word in his voluminous surviving
notebooks.
John Toland
was fascinated by Aubrey's Stonehenge theories, and wrote his own book
about the monument without crediting Aubrey. Toland founded the Ancient
Druid Order in
London
in
1717 ; interestingly enough, modern
Freemasonry
was founded in the same year and the same location, Covent Garden's Apple Tree Tavern.
Druids began to figure widely in popular culture with the first advent of
Romanticism .
Chateaubriand 's novel
Les Martyrs
(1809) narrated the doomed love of a Druid priestess and a Roman
soldier; though Chateaubriand's theme was the triumph of Christianity
over pagan Druids, the setting was to continue to bear fruit. Opera
provides a barometer of well-informed popular European culture in the
early 19th century: in 1817
Giovanni Pacini
brought Druids to the stage in Trieste with an opera to a libretto by
Felice Romani
about a Druid priestess,
La Sacerdotessa d'Irminsul
("The Priestess of
Irminsul "). The most famous Druidic opera, Bellini 's
Norma
was a fiasco at
La Scala , when it premiered the day after Christmas, 1831, but in 1833 it was a hit in London. For its libretto
Felice Romani
reused some of the pseudo-Druidical background of
La Sacerdotessa
to provide color to a standard theatrical conflict of love and duty that was related to
Medea , as it had recently been recast for a popular Parisian play by
Alexandre Soumet : the
diva
of
Norma' s hit aria, "Casta Diva", is the moon goddess, being worshipped in the "grove of the
Irmin
statue".
In the 19th century, some dubious figures arose with outlandish
claims and forged documents they claimed were historical. A central
figure in this Druidic reinvention, inspired by
Henry Hurle , is Edward Williams, better known as
Iolo Morganwg . His writings, published posthumously as
The Iolo Manuscripts
( 1848 ) and
Barddas
( 1862 ),
are not considered credible by contemporary Druidic movements because
it has become impossible to distinguish Williams' inventions from the
genuine material. Williams claimed to have collected ancient knowledge
in a " Gorsedd
of Bards of the Isles of Britain" he had organized. Many scholars deem
part or all of Williams's work to be fabrication, and purportedly many
of the documents are of his own fabrication, but a large portion of the
work has indeed been collected from meso-pagan sources dating from as
far back as 600 A.D. Regardless, it has become impossible to separate
the original source material from the fabricated work, and the
documents are considered irrelevant by most serious scholars.
An unfortunate result of the reinvention, which took place,
ironically, just as modern archaeological and historical methods were
being developed, is that it has shaped public perceptions of historical
Druidry and continues to shape some modern forms of it. The
British Museum
website is suitably blunt:
"Modern Druids have no direct connection to the Druids of the Iron
Age. Many of our popular ideas about the Druids are based on the
misunderstandings and misconceptions of scholars 200 years ago. These
ideas have been superseded by later study and discoveries"
[2] .
Modern Druidism

Some strands of modern Druidism (also known as Modern Druidry), such as the
Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids
(OBOD), are a continuation of the 18th-century revival and thus are
built largely around writings produced in the 18th century and later.
