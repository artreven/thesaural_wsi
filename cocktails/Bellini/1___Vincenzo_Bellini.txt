Maria Callas
Maria Callas ,  Commendatore OMRI  ( Greek :  Μαρία Κάλλας ) (December 2, 1923 – September 16, 1977) was an American-born  Greek   soprano  and one of the most renowned  opera singers of the 20th century. She combined an impressive  bel canto  technique, a wide-ranging voice and great dramatic gifts. An extremely versatile singer, her repertoire ranged from classical  opera seria  to the bel canto operas of  Donizetti ,  Bellini  and  Rossini ; further, to the works of  Verdi  and  Puccini ; and, in her early career, to the music dramas of  Wagner . Her remarkable musical and dramatic talents led to her being hailed as  La Divina .
