Norman Love Chocolates #6: Mango
Mango is one of those fruits that I can't get enough of in the summer. I especially enjoy
Champagne mangos , which have a creamy texture and sweeter flesh than regular mangos--they taste sort of like a
Bellini . However, in the winter, I crave other fruits and if I eat a mango, it just doesn't taste the same. I know it's the wrong season, but it's not so much a taste issue as it is an issue of context--just like eating a pumpkin pie in June. The inside was very fruity, pretty faithful to what a can of mango puree tastes like. It was very sweet, and I'm not sure if it's because of the whole eating-a-mango-in-winter issue that I have, but it started to tasted a little artificial. Sort of like how eating a strawberry candy compares to eating an actual strawberry. I'm sure it's just me, however--with the quality of these chocolates I can't imagine them using anything other than mango puree to make this truffle. I would rather try this again when it's hot out.

Who?
Lavender
I'm a scientist by day and an amateur home chef by night. If I could pick a second career, I would go back to school and become a pastry chef and maybe open my own bakery.
When I'm inspired, I do a bit of crafting.
I live with my two cats, Josie and Sabrina, and my husband Andy.
In addition to my food and craft projects, I run a book club associated with the
Boston Skeptics . Check it out if you enjoy decent scientific/nonfiction books!
