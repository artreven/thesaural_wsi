Bel canto
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Mathilde
Marchesi
(1821-1913), a famous teacher of bel canto technique
For other

Bel canto (disambiguation) .
Bel canto
( Bel-Canto )
( Italian ,
"beautiful singing"), an Italian musical term, refers to the art and
science of vocal technique which originated in
Italy
during the late
seventeenth century and reached its pinnacle in the early part of the
nineteenth century during the Bel Canto
opera
era.
Rossini
(1792-1868),
Bellini
(1801-1835), and
Donizetti
(1797-1848) best exemplify this style,
which flourished from approximately 1805 to 1830. Some have credited the
17th-century composer
Pietro Cavalli
with introducing bel canto, but
his smooth and flowing melodic lines belong to a different style from a
different era.
Bel canto singing
characteristically focuses on perfect evenness throughout the voice, skillful
legato , a light
upper register, tremendous agility and flexibility, and a certain lyric,
"sweet" timbre. Operas of the style feature extensive and florid
ornamentation, requiring much in the way of fast scales and
cadenzas . Bel
canto emphasizes technique rather than volume: an exercise said to demonstrate
its epitome involves a singer holding a lit
candle
to her mouth
and singing without causing the flame to flicker. [1]
Aside from the bel canto era and the bel canto style of opera, singers
can use a bel canto method of singing even in
verismo ,
Wagnerian, Verdian, and modern styles. Geographical studies suggest that the
Italian bel canto technique, like the similar method which formed in Spain, is
likely to have developed from the
Ancient Vocal Method , a vocal technique that
evolved within the ancient cultures of the
Middle East
and
Mediterranean .
Some ethnomusicologists may support this fact.
Miguel
Fleta
was regarded by his native
Spain
as the
"Lord High Keeper of the Seal of the Ancient Method". Fleta's voice
was rich and powerful; qualities that seemed to assist his miraculous facility
in
pianissimo ,
coloratura ,
range ,
legato , and
messa
di voce . Other singers with powerful voices who have used the bel canto
technique include
Eva Turner
(1892-1990),
Elena
Nicolai
(1905-1993),
Todor Mazarov
(Masaroff) (1907-1975),
Ghena Dimitrova
(1941-2005) and
Maria
Caniglia
(1904-1979).
While historians typically date
the bel canto period to the early 19th century, the term itself did not come
into common usage in its current sense until the middle of the 19th century. At
that time composers such as
Wagner
began to call for larger, more dramatic voices, "but he intended for those
voices to retain the bel canto approach; to sing his operas as one would sing
Bellini 's
Norma .
However, the tradition at
Bayreuth
was to declaim, and because the public demanded it,
the singers complied." [2]
Opponents of this trend complained, with
Rossini , "Alas for us, we have lost our bel
canto."
The
sopranos
Maria
Callas
(1923-1977),
Joan Sutherland
(1926- ) and
Montserrat Caballé
(1933-), and the
mezzo-soprano
Marilyn
Horne
(1934- ) probably best exemplify the bel canto singers of the
post-war period. ( Virginia Zeani
(1925- ) and
Leyla
Gencer
(1928-2008), both bel canto sopranos of equal abilities, made fewer
recordings and thus their fame suffered by comparison in America.) In more
recent
years,
June Anderson
has had considerable success in Europe
and the United States,
focusing almost exclusively on soprano roles in the bel canto repertoire.
For many years, few
tenors
sang bel
canto:
Alfredo Kraus
(1927-1999) has been a good instance of
them; however, since the débuts of
Salvatore Fisichella ,
Chris Merritt
and
Rockwell
Blake
they have started to reappear. Some commentators regard Raúl Giménez,
Juan Diego Flórez
and
William
Matteuzzi
as skilled
contemporary
bel canto tenors; other commentators demur,
however, given the clear and distinct differentiation between the bel canto
technique
and the bel canto
repertoire
(the latter of which the said tenors sing
often and successfully). [3]
Although he was not an opera singer per se, tenor
Mario Lanza
(1921-1959) also employed the bel canto technique to his singing, especially in
the earlier part of his career.
