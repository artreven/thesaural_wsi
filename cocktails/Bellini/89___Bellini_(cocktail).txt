Harry’s Bar in Venice: Home to Stars and The Bellini
Posted on

Harry’s Bar
in Venice is one of the most fascinating in Italy. Since 1931, after the seed funding came from an American named Harry, the bar has regularly served such greats as Ernest Hemingway, Arturo Toscanini, Guglielmo Marconi (the guy from Bologna who invented the radio…so you know to whom say thanks for you cellphone), Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, Truman Capote, Orson Welles, Peggy Guggenheim, Woody Allen and many others (including, a few times, your humble blogger — for full disclosure). The cocktail
Bellini
and the dish
Carpaccio
were invented here.
So, now the bar is in the news because the
waiters (but not the cook, cashier, and other workers) have been on strike . The owner, Mr. Cipriani (who is also a journalist and book writer), decided to serve at the tables himself with the cooks. He is confident that the bar will solve any issues.
