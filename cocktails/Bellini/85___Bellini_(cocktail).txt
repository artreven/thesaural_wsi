Kiwi-Strawberry Bellini--Perfect for Celebrations
A few years ago, I discovered
Prosecco
and felt in love right after the first sip.  Prosecco is an Italian sparkling dry white wine.  Taste-wise and mouth feel are very similar to
Champagne , but it’s a lot less expensive.  Isn’t that already a good reason to open a bottle of Prosecco to celebrate?  Seriously, with Prosecco’s price tag, you don’t need a special occasion or reason to enjoy one.
Here, I share with you a refreshing Kiwi-Strawberry
Bellini
that’s perfect to cool down in the summer.  Bellini is a cocktail with mixture of Prosecco and fruit purée (peach purée is the most traditional fruit of choice).  However, I couldn’t resist using Kiwis and strawberries as they are both in season right now.  They are such a perfect match for each other, too.
If you want to turn this drink into a kids friendly version, just substitute the Prosecco with sparkling white grape juice.  Just make sure to use a different shape of glass, decoration, or plastic champagne glasses to distinguish the kid's version.  That way, they won’t “accidentally” drink the REAL Bellini.
Now, we all can celebrate.  Happy Father’s Day to all the awesome fathers out there.  Cheers!
Kiwi-Strawberry Bellini
Makes: 8 servings
4
Zesperi
Kiwi
16 Strawberries
1 (750ml) bottle Prosecco
Remove skin from kiwifruits, cut into quarters.  In a food processor or blender, puree until smooth.
Remove  stems from strawberries, cut in halves.  In a food processor or blender, puree until smooth.
Spoon kiwi puree and strawberry puree onto the bottom of champagne glasses, about 1 to 2 heaping tablespoons each.  Pour Prosecco over fruit puree and enjoy.
*Note: As mention in the post, you can substitute Prosecoo with sparkling white grape juice for a non-alcohol version.
You can also substitute kiwi and strawberry with your favorite kind of fruit for this cocktail as well.

Very pretty. Reply Delete Amy June 20, 2011 at 10:48 AM @ Anonymous:
I used a spoon to put the fruit purees on the bottom of the glasses and slowly pour the Prosecco on top.
They bubbled up like crazy so need to pour slowly.
:)
The kiwi puree remained on the
bottom and the strawberry puree flowed to the top after a while. Amy Reply Delete Ali June 20, 2011 at 11:36 AM What a beautiful cocktail. I love all the colors :) Kiwi was my favorite fruit but I have become allergic to it, it makes me so sad. It is such a great fruit. :) If you are interested, I’d love for you to submit this to my refreshing Summer drinks roundup over at my blog. (Link is in my sidebar) Have a great week :) Reply Delete carolinaheartstrings June 20, 2011 at 11:49 AM What a beautiful cocktail.
