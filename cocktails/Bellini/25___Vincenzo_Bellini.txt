History
1815-1870
3.1 Neo-classical architecture
The programme of architectural renewal with which
Carlo Alberto
intended to give his own imprint to the Savoy capital could not ignore the Teatro of the crown: the restructuring of the auditorium was entrusted to the architect
Ernesto Melano
and the Bolognese painter
Pelagio Palagi , also active at the building sites of
Palazzo Reale , the
Biblioteca Reale
and
Castello di Racconigi .
As is evident from the picture taken when
Grand Duke Alexander of Russia
visited (1839), the Teatro had assumed an austere Neo-classical imprint, with the elimination of the Baroque curves and the use of Corinthian columns.
3.2 Giuditta Pasta and Adelina Patti
Giuditta Pasta , one of the most celebrated singers of the early nineteenth century, debuted in Milan in 1815 and soon made a name for herself in other Italian cities, in Paris and in London. Adored by
Stendhal , she was the leading lady in the “premières” of
Sonnambula ,
Norma
and
Beatrice di Tenda
by
Bellini
and
Anna Bolena
by
Donizetti . After her debut at the
Teatro Carignano
in 1820, she returned to Torino for the 1821-22 season of the Regio, where she met with enormous success in I riti d’Efeso by
Giuseppe Farinelli
and
Rossini’s Edoardo e Cristina . In the second half of the nineteenth century, after the theatre programmes were amplified, the singers were no longer signed on for the entire season but for individual operas instead.
In 1865, the Regio audience had the opportunity to hear
Adelina Patti , the diva par excellence in the world of opera, in four out-of-season performances of
Bellini ’s
Sonnambula
and
Rossini 's
Barbiere di Siviglia . She would then return to Torino in 1879 for Traviata.
Verdi
had appreciated her two years earlier describing her this way: « marvellous voice, very pure singing style; stupendous actress with a charm and a natural???... that nobody else has ».
3.3 Polledro and Mercadante
Under
Carlo Felice
there was a reorganization of the
Royal Chapel , which provided most of the instrumentalists for the Teatro orchestra.
Giovanni Battista Polledro
(1823),
Pugnani ’s student and a celebrated virtuoso, was named first violin, a position he had already held in Dresden.
In Torino,
Polledro
improved the level of the orchestra and introduced the great compositions of instrumental music by the composers of Viennese classicism, acquiring a number of scores by German editors for the Royal Chapel.
In the same years,
Saverio Mercadante , who was trained in Naples, started his international career with the success of Elisa e Claudio, presented in Milan in 1821. He was the only major composer of the time to have a privileged rapport with the Regio of Torino,
where he presented in absolute
“première”
Didone abbandonata
(1823),
Nitocri
(1824),
Ezio
(1827),
I Normanni a Parigi
(1832),
Francesca Donato, ovvero Corinto distrutta
(1835),
Il reggente
(1843) and six other operas that had already been staged in other theatres.
3.4 The romantic ballet
The principal exponents of romantic ballet were guests at the Regio in the 1830s and 1840s:
Fanny Cerrito
debuted at the Regio in the 1835-36 season and returned there ten years later, after great success in the major European capitals.
Natalie Fitz-James
and
Arthur Saint-Léon
danced together in the Italian “première” of
Giselle
(1842). In January 1845 the Torinese audience applauded the “divine”
Maria Taglioni , creator of
La Sylphide
and symbol of the romantic ballerina, who interpreted
L’allieva d’Amore , ballet presented with
Bellini ’s
Norma . Attention for the dance was also evidenced by the restructuring of the dance school commissioned by
Carlo Alberto
in 1846. Thanks to the new involvement of the crown, the school proved to be one of the most prestigious in Italy, alongside those in Milan and Naples.
