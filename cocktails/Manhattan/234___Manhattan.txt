Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta: (born March 28, 1986), better known by her
stage name
Lady Gaga ,
is an American pop singer. She began performing in the rock music scene of
New York City 's
Lower East Side
in 2003 and enrolled at
New York University 's
Tisch School of the Arts . She soon signed with Streamline Records, an imprint of
Interscope Records . During her early time at Interscope, she worked as a songwriter for fellow label artists and captured the attention of
Akon , who recognized her vocal abilities, and signed her to his own label,
Kon Live Distribution .
Released on August 19, 2008, her debut album,
The Fame , reached number one in the UK, Canada, Austria, Germany and Ireland as well as accomplishing positions within the top-ten in numerous countries worldwide; in the United States, it peaked at number two on the
Billboard
200
chart and topped
Billboard 's
Dance/Electronic Albums
chart. Its first two singles, " Just Dance " and " Poker Face ", co-written and co-produced with
RedOne , became international number-one hits, topping the
Billboard
Hot 100
in the United States as well as the charts of other countries. The album, which later earned a total of six
Grammy Award
nominations, won the awards for
Best Electronic/Dance Album
and
Best Dance Recording
for "Poker Face". In early 2009, she embarked on her first headlining tour,
The Fame Ball Tour . By the fourth quarter of the year, she had released her second album,
The Fame Monster , along with the global chart-topping lead single " Bad Romance ", as well as having embarked on her second headlining tour of the year,
The Monster Ball Tour . Her third album,
Born This Way , is scheduled for release in 2011.
Lady Gaga is inspired by
glam rock
artists such as
David Bowie
and
Queen , as well as pop singers such as
Madonna
and
Michael Jackson . She has also stated fashion is a source of inspiration for her songwriting and performances. Gaga was ranked the 73rd Artist of the 200010 decade by
Billboard . As of August 2010, Gaga has sold more than 15 million albums and 51 million singles worldwide.
In May 2010,
Time
magazine included Gaga in its annual
Time 100
list of the most influential people in the world. In June 2010,
Forbes
listed Gaga fourth on its list of the 100 Most Powerful and Influential celebrities in the world; she is also ranked as the second most powerful musician in the world. In October 2010,
Forbes
placed Gaga at number seven on their annual list of the World's 100 Most Powerful Women.
Life And Career
19862004: Early life
Lady Gaga was born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta in New York City on March 28, 1986, to an
Italian American
family, the eldest child of Joseph Germanotta, internet entrepreneur, and Cynthia (née Bissett). She learned to play piano from the age of four, went on to write her first piano ballad at 13 and began performing at
open mike
nights by age 14. At the age of 11, Gaga attended
Convent of the Sacred Heart , a private Roman Catholic school on Manhattan's
Upper East Side , [13] [14]
but has stressed that she does not come from a wealthy background, saying that her parents "both came from lower-class families, so we've worked for everything  my mother worked eight to eight out of the house, in telecommunications, and so did my father." An avid
thespian
in high school musicals, Gaga portrayed lead roles as
Adelaide
in
Guys and Dolls
and Philia in
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum . She described her academic life in high school as "very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined" but also "a bit insecure" as she told in an interview, "I used to get made fun of for being either too provocative or too eccentric, so I started to tone it down. I didnt fit in, and I felt like a freak." [17] [18]
Acquaintances dispute that she did not fit in school. "She had a core group of friends; she was a good student. She liked boys a lot, but singing was No. 1," recalled a former high school classmate. Referring to her "expressive, free spirit", Gaga told
Elle
magazine "I'm
left-handed !"
At age 17, Gaga gained early admission to the
New York University 's
Tisch School of the Arts
and lived in a NYU dorm on
11th Street . There she studied music and improved her songwriting skills by composing essays and analytical papers focusing on topics such as art, religion, social issues and politics. Gaga felt that she was more creative than some of her classmates. "Once you learn how to think about art, you can teach yourself," she said. By the second semester of her sophomore year, she withdrew from the school to focus on her musical career. Her father agreed to pay her rent for a year, on the condition that she re-enroll for Tisch if she was unsuccessful. "I left my entire family, got the cheapest apartment I could find, and ate shit until somebody would listen," she said.
20052007: Career beginnings
Gaga had initially signed with
Def Jam Recordings
at the age of 19, although she was dropped by the label after only three months. Shortly after, her former management company introduced her to songwriter and producer RedOne, whom they also managed. The first song she produced with RedOne was "Boys Boys Boys", a
mash-up
inspired by
Mötley Crüe 's " Girls, Girls, Girls " and
AC/DC 's " T.N.T. " She moved into an apartment on the
Lower East Side
and recorded a couple of songs with hip-hop singer
Grandmaster Melle Mel
for an audio book accompanying the children's book
The Portal in the Park
by Cricket Casey. She also started the Stefani Germanotta Band with some friends from NYU. They recorded an EP of their ballads at a studio underneath a liquor store in
New Jersey , becoming a local fixture at the downtown
Lower East Side
club scene. She began experimenting with
drugs
soon after, while performing at
neo-burlesque
shows. Her father did not understand the reason behind her
drug intake
and could not look at her for several months. Music producer
Rob Fusari , who helped her write some of her earlier songs, compared some of her vocal harmonies to that of
Freddie Mercury . Fusari helped create the moniker Gaga, after the
Queen
song " Radio Ga Ga ". Gaga was in the process of trying to come up with a stage name when she received a text message from Fusari that read "Lady Gaga." He explained,
Every day, when Stef came to the studio, instead of saying hello, I would start singing ' Radio
Ga
Ga'. That was her entrance song. [Lady Gaga] was actually a glitch; I typed ' Radio
Ga
Ga' in a text and it did an
autocorrect
so somehow 'Radio' got changed to 'Lady'. She texted me back, "That's it." After that day, she was Lady Gaga. Shes like, "Don't ever call me Stefani again."
She was known thereafter as Lady Gaga. The
New York Post , however, has reported that this story is incorrect, and that the name resulted from a marketing meeting. Throughout 2007, Gaga collaborated with performance artist Lady Starlight, who helped create her onstage fashions. The pair began playing gigs at downtown club venues like the
Mercury Lounge ,
The Bitter End , and the
Rockwood
Music Hall , with their live performance art piece known as "Lady Gaga and the Starlight Revue." Billed as "The Ultimate Pop Burlesque Rockshow", their act was a low-fi tribute to 1970s variety acts.
In August 2007, Gaga and Starlight were invited to play at the American
Lollapalooza
music festival. The show was critically acclaimed, and their performance received positive reviews. Having initially focused on
avant-garde
electronic dance music , Gaga found her musical niche when she began to incorporate pop melodies and the
glam rock
of
David Bowie
and
Queen
into her music.
Fusari sent the songs he produced with Gaga to his friend, producer and
record executive
Vincent Herbert. Herbert was quick to sign her to his label Streamline Records, an
imprint
of
Interscope Records , upon its establishment in 2007. She credited Herbert as the man who discovered her, adding "I really feel like we made pop history, and we're gonna keep going".
Having already served as an apprentice songwriter under an internship at
Famous Music Publishing , which was later acquired by
Sony/ATV Music Publishing , Gaga subsequently struck a
music publishing
deal with Sony/ATV. [38]
As a result, she was hired to write songs for
Britney Spears
and labelmates
New Kids on the Block ,
Fergie , and the
Pussycat Dolls . While Gaga was writing at Interscope, singer-songwriter
Akon
recognized her vocal abilities when she sang a reference vocal for one of his tracks in studio. He then convinced
Interscope-Geffen-A&M
Chairman and CEO
Jimmy Iovine
to form a joint deal by having her also sign with his own label
Kon Live Distribution
and later called her his "franchise player." Gaga continued her collaboration with RedOne in the studio for a week on her debut album, spawning the future singles " Just Dance " and " Poker Face ." She also joined the roster of
Cherrytree Records , an Interscope imprint established by producer and songwriter
Martin Kierszenbaum , after co-writing four songs with Kierszenbaum including the single " Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say) ."
20082010:
The Fame
and
The Fame Monster
Main articles:
The Fame
and
The Fame Monster
By 2008, Gaga had relocated to
Los Angeles , working closely with her record label to finalize her debut album
The Fame . She combined different genres on the album, "from
Def Leppard
drums and hand claps to
metal
drums on
urban tracks ". [23]
The Fame
received positive reviews from critics; according to the music review aggregation of
Metacritic , it garnered an average score of 71/100. The album peaked at number one in
Austria , the
United Kingdom ,
Canada , and
Ireland , and the top-five in
Australia
and the
United States . [42] [43]
Worldwide,
The Fame
has sold over twelve million copies. Its lead single " Just Dance ", topped the charts in six countriesAustralia, Canada, the Netherlands, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United Statesand later received a Grammy Award nomination for
Best Dance Recording .
The following single, " Poker Face ", was an even greater success, reaching number-one in almost all major music markets in the world, including the United Kingdom and the United States. [
It won the award for Best Dance Recording at the
52nd Grammy Awards , over nominations for
Song of the Year
and
Record of the Year .
The Fame
was nominated for
Album of the Year ; it won the
Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album . Although her first concert tour happened as an opening act for fellow Interscope pop group, the reformed
New Kids on the Block , she ultimately headlined her own concert tour,
The Fame Ball Tour , which began on March 2009.
The cover of the annual "Hot 100" issue of
Rolling Stone
in May 2009 featured a semi-nude Gaga wearing only strategically placed plastic bubbles. In the issue she said that while she was beginning her career in the
New York
club scene, she was romantically involved with a
heavy metal
drummer. She described their relationship and break-up, saying of it, "I was his
Sandy , and he was my Danny [of
Grease ], and I just broke." He later became an inspiration behind some of the songs on
The Fame . She was nominated for a total of nine awards at the
2009 MTV Video Music Awards , winning the award for "Best New Artist", while her single " Paparazzi " won two awards for "Best Art Direction" and "Best Special Effects." In October, Gaga received
Billboard
magazine's Rising Star of 2009 award. She attended the
Human Rights Campaign 's "National Dinner" the same month, before marching in the
National Equality March
in
Washington ,
D.C. [53] [54]
Gaga released
The Fame Monster , a collection of eight songs that dealt with the darker side of fame as experienced by her over the course of 20082009, while travelling around the world and are expressed through a
monster
metaphor. Her second concert tour,
The Monster Ball Tour , was announced in support of
The Fame Monster
and began in November 2009. " Bad Romance " was released as the first single from the album and topped the charts in eighteen countries, while reaching the top-two in the
United States ,
Australia
and
New Zealand . " Speechless ", a song from
The Fame Monster , was performed at
The 2009 Royal Variety Performance
where Gaga met and sang for
Queen Elizabeth II .
Gaga was chosen as of one the "10 Most Fascinating People of 2009" by
Barbara Walters
during Walters' annual
ABC News
special. When interviewed by the journalist, the singer went to dismiss the claim that she is
intersex
as an
urban legend , responding to a question on this issue by stating: "At first it was very strange and everyone sorta said, 'That's really quite a story!' But in a sense, I portray myself in a very
androgynous
way, and I love androgyny." In January 2010, she was named chief creative officer for a line of imaging products for
Polaroid , stating that she will create fashion, technology and photography products. The second single from
The Fame Monster , " Telephone ", which features R&B singer
Beyoncé , became her fourth
UK
number-one single. In March,
Rob Fusari
sued Gaga's production company Mermaid Music LLC, claiming that he was entitled to a 20% share of its earnings. Gaga's lawyer Charles Ortner described the agreement with Fusari as "unlawful" and declined to comment. In August, the
New York Supreme Court
dismissed the lawsuit. In April, it was reported that her music videos gained over one billion
viral views , becoming one of the first artists to reach this milestone. Later that month, Gaga was named one of
Time
magazine's 100 most influential people of the year. In September 2010, she was voted 44th in the "The World's 50 Most Influential Figures 2010" in a list compiled by the
New Statesman
magazine. In May, in an interview with
The Times , Gaga hinted at having
Systemic lupus erythematosus , commonly referred to as lupus, which is a connective tissue disease. In an interview with
Larry King , Gaga confirmed that she does not have lupus but the results were borderline positive.
2010present:
Born This Way
By March
2010, in
an interview with MTV United Kingdom, Gaga stated that she had begun work on her new studio album and already finished writing the core theme of it. Three months later, in an interview with
Rolling Stone , she stated that her second studio album was finished. She remarked: "It came so quickly. I've been working on it for months, and I feel very strongly that it's finished right now. Some artists take years. I don't. I write music every day." She announced the title of the album,
Born This Way , during her acceptance speech for
Video of the Year
at the
2010 MTV Video Music Awards . With already three tracks confirmed by Gaga, "Born This Way", "Living on the Radio" and "You and I", the latter she has been performing during The Monster Ball Tour, the album is scheduled for release in 2011.
Gaga, with
Elton John , is planning to release a duet called "Hello, Hello" for the soundtrack to the forthcoming animated Disney feature film
Gnomeo and Juliet . This will be her first original contribution to a film.
In September 2010, Gaga signed a deal with
Coty, Inc.
to create a fragrance. It will be called "Monster" and is scheduled to launch in 2012.
Musical style and influences
Gaga has been influenced by
glam rock
artists such as
David Bowie
and
Queen , as well as pop music artists such as
Madonna ,
Britney Spears
and
Michael Jackson . The
Queen
song " Radio
Ga
Ga" inspired her stage name, "Lady Gaga". She commented: "I adored Freddie Mercury and Queen had a hit called 'Radio Gaga'. That's why I love the name [...] Freddie was unique  one of the biggest personalities in the whole of pop music." Madonna told
Rolling Stone
that she sees "[her]self in Lady Gaga." In response to the comparisons between herself and Madonna, Gaga stated: "I don't want to sound presumptuous, but I've made it my goal to revolutionise pop music. The last revolution was launched by Madonna 25 years ago." Actress and singer
Grace Jones
was also cited as an inspiration, along with
Blondie
singer
Debbie Harry .
Gaga's vocals have drawn frequent comparison to those of Madonna and
Gwen Stefani , while the structure of her music is said to echo classic 1980s pop and 1990s
Europop . While reviewing her debut album
The Fame ,
The Sunday Times
asserted "in combining music, fashion, art and technology, Lady GaGa evokes Madonna, Gwen Stefani circa ' Hollaback Girl ',
Kylie Minogue
2001 or Grace Jones right now."
Similarly,
The Boston Globe
critic Sarah Rodman commented that she draws "obvious inspirations from Madonna to Gwen Stefani... in [her] girlish but sturdy pipes and bubbly beats."
Though her lyrics are said to lack intellectual stimulation, "[she] does manage to get you moving and grooving at an almost effortless pace." Music critic
Simon Reynolds
wrote that "Everything about Gaga came from
electroclash , except the music, which wasn't particularly 1980s, just ruthlessly catchy
naughties
pop glazed with
Auto-Tune
and undergirded with
R&B -ish beats. In early 2009, Gaga described
M.I.A.
as her "fellow hard working female art student," comparing herself to her and identifying with the musician's work ethic. In
2010, M .I.A. stated "people say were similar...[but] none of her musics reflective of how weird she wants to be or thinks she is. (She) models herself on Grace Jones and Madonna but the music sounds like 20 year-old
Ibiza
disco." Regarding the M.I.A. inspired song " Chillin " by Lady Gaga and
Wale , she added that she felt Gaga had talent but that she was "the industry's last stab at making itself important." Similarly, another of Gaga's inspirations, Grace Jones, said she was irritated by Gaga's imitation of her style, saying "I've seen some things she's worn that I've worn, and that does kind of piss me off, Jones said, adding "I really dont think of her at all. I go about my business. (I'd) just prefer to work with someone who is more original and someone who is not copying me, actually."
Gaga has identified fashion as a major influence. She considers
Donatella Versace
her
muse . Gaga has her own creative production team called the Haus of Gaga, which she handles personally. The team creates many of her clothes, stage props, and hairdos. Her love of fashion came from her mother, who she stated was "always very well kept and beautiful."
"When I'm writing music, I'm thinking about the clothes I want to wear on stage. It's all about everything altogetherperformance art, pop performance art, fashion. For me, it's everything coming together and being a real story that will bring back the super-fan. I want to bring that back. I want the imagery to be so strong that fans will want to eat and taste and lick every part of us." The
Global Language Monitor
named "Lady Gaga" as the Top Fashion Buzzword with her trademark "no pants" coming in at No. 3.
Entertainment Weekly
put her outfits on its end of the decade "best-of" list, saying, "Whether it's a dress made of Muppets or strategically placed bubbles, Gaga's outré ensembles brought performance art into the mainstream."
Critical reception of Gaga's music, fashion sense and persona are mixed. Her status as a role model, trailblazer and fashion icon is by turns affirmed and denied. Gaga's albums have received mostly positive reviews, with critics pointing out her unique place in pop music, the need for new movements in popular culture, the attention Gaga brings to important social issues, and the inherently subjective nature of her art. Her role as a self-esteem booster for her fans is also lauded, as is her role in breathing life into the fashion industry. Her performances are described as "highly entertaining and innovative"; in particular, the blood-spurting performance of "Paparazzi" at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards was described as "eye-popping" by MTV. She continued the "blood soaked" theme in
The Monster Ball Tour , in which she wears a revealing leather corset and is "attacked" by a performer dressed in black who gnaws on her throat, causing "blood" to spurt down her chest, after which she lies "dying" in a pool of blood. Her performances of that scene in
Manchester ,
England
triggered protests from family groups and fans in the aftermath of a local tragedy, in which a taxi driver had murdered 12 people. "What happened in
Bradford
is very fresh in people's minds and given all the violence which happened in
Cumbria
just hours earlier, it was insensitive," said Lynn Costello of Mothers Against Violence.
Chris Rock
later defended her flamboyant, provocative behavior. "Well, she's Lady Gaga," he said. "She's not 'Lady Behave Yourself.' Do you want great behavior from a person named Gaga? Is this what you were expecting?"
Gaga's treatment of her fans as "Little Monsters" has inspired additional criticism, due to the highly commercial nature of her music and image. To some, this dichotomy contravenes the concept of outsider culture. Writing for
The Guardian , Kitty Empire opined that the dichotomy "...allows the viewer to have a 'transgressive' experience without being required to think. At [her performance's] core, though, is the idea that Gaga is at one with the freaks and outcasts. The Monster Ball is where we can all be free. This is arrant nonsense, as the scads of people buying Gaga's cunningly commercial music are not limited to the niche worlds of
drag queens
and hip night creatures from which she draws her inspiration. But Gaga seems sincere."
Camille Paglia
wrote a cover story "Lady Gaga and the death of sex" on September 12,
2010, in
The Sunday Times
in which she asserts that Gaga "is more an identity thief than an erotic taboo breaker, a mainstream manufactured product who claims to be singing for the freaks, the rebellious and the dispossessed when she is none of those."
Public image
Contrary to her outré style, the
New York Post
described her early look as like "a refugee from
Jersey Shore " with "big black hair, heavy eye makeup and tight, revealing clothes."
Gaga is a natural
brunette ; she bleached her hair blonde because she was often mistaken for
Amy Winehouse . She often refers to her fans as her 'little monsters' and got a
tattoo
with that inscription as a tribute. She has another six known tattoos, among them a
peace symbol , which was inspired by
John Lennon
whom she stated was her hero, and a curling German script on her left arm which quotes the poet
Rainer Maria Rilke , her favorite
philosopher , commenting that his "philosophy of solitude" spoke to her. Toward the end of 2008, comparisons were made between the fashions of Lady Gaga and recording artist
Christina Aguilera , noting similarities in their styling, hair, and make-up. Aguilera later said she was "completely unaware of [Gaga]" and "didn't know if it [was] a man or a woman." Gaga released a statement in which she welcomed the comparisons, due to the attention providing useful publicity, saying, "She's such a huge star and if anything I should send her flowers, because a lot of people in America didn't know who I was until that whole thing happened. It really put me on the map in a way." Comparisons continued into 2010 when Aguilera released the music video of her single " Not Myself Tonight ". Critics noted similarities between the song and its accompanying music video with Gaga's video for "Bad Romance". [113]
There have also been similar comparisons made between Lady Gaga's style and that of fashion icon
Dale Bozzio
from the band
Missing Persons . Some have considered their respective images to be strikingly parallel although fans of Missing Persons note that Bozzio had pioneered the look more than thirty years earlier.
Gaga attributes much of her early success as a mainstream artist to her gay fans and is considered to be a rising
gay icon . Early in her career she had difficulty getting
radio airplay , and stated, "The turning point for me was the gay community. I've got so many gay fans and they're so loyal to me and they really lifted me up. They'll always stand by me and I'll always stand by them. It's not an easy thing to create a fanbase." She thanked FlyLife, a
Manhattan -based
LGBT
marketing company with whom her label
Interscope
works, in the liner notes of her debut studio album,
The Fame , saying, "I love you so much. You were the first heartbeat in this project, and your support and brilliance means the world to me. I will always fight for the gay community hand in hand with this incredible team." One of her first televised performances was in May 2008 at the
NewNowNext Awards , an awards show aired by the LGBT television network
Logo , where she sang her song "Just Dance". In June of the same year, she performed the song again at the
San Francisco Pride
event. After
The Fame
was released, she revealed that the song "Poker Face" was about her
bisexuality . In an interview with
Rolling Stone , she spoke about how her boyfriends tended to react to her bisexuality, saying "The fact that I'm into women, they're all intimidated by it. It makes them uncomfortable. They're like, 'I don't need to have a threesome. I'm happy with just you'." When she appeared as a guest on
The Ellen DeGeneres Show
in May 2009, she praised DeGeneres for being "an inspiration for women and for the gay community". She proclaimed that the October 11, 2009,
National Equality March
rally on the
national mall
was "the single most important event of her career." As she exited, she left with an exultant "Bless God and bless the gays," similar to her
2009 MTV Video Music Awards
acceptance speech for Best New Artist a month earlier. [122]
In September 2010, she spoke at a rally in favor of repealing the US military's
Don't ask, don't tell
policy, which prohibits lesbian, gay and bisexual people from serving openly, and released an online video urging her fans to contact their Senators in an effort to get the policy overturned. Editors of
The Advocate
commented that she had become the "fierce advocate" for gays and lesbians that future president Barack Obama had promised to be during his campaign.
Gaga's influence on modern culture and society has provoked the
University of South Carolina
into offering a full-time course titled "Lady Gaga and the Sociology of Fame" in the objective of unravelling "the sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga with respect to her music, videos, fashion, and other artistic endeavors".
