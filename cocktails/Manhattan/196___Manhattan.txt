Brief Bio - Pastor Carter Conlon:
Since 2002, founding pastor  David Wilkerson  has entrusted the senior pastorate of
Times Square Church
to Carter Conlon, formerly an evangelical pastor from eastern Canada. There are also visiting ministers and missionaries who come to preach from all over the world. The church places an emphasis on prayer and even has a "prayer during preaching ministry". On Thursday evenings, prayer meetings are held in the church's annex on 1657 Broadway. There are also high school and young adults programs.  From 2007 to 2009 the church organized an event called  Prayer in the Square , a prayer rally which took place in  Times Square .
Brief History of Times Square Church:
The Times Square Church was founded by Pastor  David Wilkerson  in 1987. At the time, the area was known as a center of X-rated films, strip clubs, prostitution, and drug addiction. Pastor Wilkerson opened the church in response to what he described as "the physically destitute and spiritually dead people" he saw among the pimps, runaways and crack dealers who populated the area. [2]  The Times Square Church briefly held its services in  The  Town Hall  on 43rd Street in  Manhattan  and then in the  Nederlander Theatre  on 41st Street. In 1989 the church moved to the former  Mark Hellinger Theatre , its current location on 51st Street.

"JESUS Bridges the Gap"
Editor's Corner
FALL 2015 - A Season of Reflection:
I Dare You!
Israel is described by the Old Testament prophets as a "fruitless Israel" or the "fruitless fig tree." The Old Testament prophets of yesteryear used this tree to describe this often idol-worshiping, often faithless group of people whom God longed to breathe life into once again. Yes they looked good -well actually from a distance they looked good. They had "green leaves" that attracted, but up close they were full of tradition, they were barren, empty, sinful and without fruit and cold towards God. That is exactly the situation in the early church that the Hebrews writer addresses.
And this by the way is (for the most part) a picture of the church today!
After cautioning his readers against backsliding, he then begins to
speak words of life into them!
He uses history to remind them what God has done in sending Jesus. God longs to restore His chosen people Israel to himself; and He longs for you to be restored and experience Revival in your personal life. When Christ left, he sent His Holy Spirit as a deposit into our hearts. We have the Power!
Do you
speak words of life
into people around you? If not, then why not?
Jesus taught them:
32 “Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
33 Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door.
~ Matthew 24 Israel is the fig tree. This passage can be interpreted as saying that you and me, the Church should be aware of rapid changes happening with Israel, and having an awareness of what is going to happen next. Are you paying attention to how swift changes in the Middle East are happening? Are you "rapture-ready"? Are you speaking words of life into people around you? What about speaking words of life into your immediate family? Time as you know it may be running out.
People following the recent Blood-moon tetrad wondered if something was up; was God using the heavens to alert us? This week we see Russia and it's allies massing with extreme military might just next door to Israel. Today the first Russian attacks happened there. Ostensibly, they are there to combat ISIS in Syria. But God says in Ezekiel 38
" ...I will put hooks in your jaws and draw you (to Israel)" . Israel has apparently recently turned down Russia as a negotiations-partner and end-user in Israel's new-found natural gas discoveries. Time will tell, but Russia may have other plans for Israel's natural resources. This week in Syria, Russia is joining forces with many of Israel's enemies in their coalition formation to preserve Assad the brutal Syrian dictator, whom the USA wants gone. So many nations are gathering in this area, each with their own agenda....just as the prophet said 2600 years ago. Surprisingly, China is hugely involved in this coalition as well. However due to Syria's close proximity, Russia is now just a few miles from Israel, the "apple" of God's eye. Perhaps next week, or the week after (...or "soon" enough) they will find it necessary to attack Israel. This may be a good time for you to review the ancient prophecies of Ezekiel 37, 38 and 39 to see exactly what will happen in this scene. God is now setting the stage for the enormous battle He has in mind, whereby He stands by to show himself strong on behalf of his people Israel. The bible indicates that 5/6's of this coalition army will be destroyed. Then He stands by to complete His Israel Restoration Plan !
"I will no longer hide my face from them, for I will pour my Spirit on the house of Israel, declares the Lord! "
(ch. 39:29) when he shows them beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is He who fights for them.
This past week, the so-called "Pope", the spiritual leader of the Roman Catholic church visited North America. His speaking or "contact points" were many but he seemed to be on more of a social tour. He spoke of equality, concern for immigrants, concern about global warning and climate change, concern about various issues including encouragement to "do good", However, this "spiritual" leader of over a billion people never once shared a bible verse or spoke of God's Plan of Salvation, which is the message of my bible! He kissed many babies, embraced many in wheelchairs, spoke for some marginalized people. However, Pope Francis never once offered any hope for salvation by telling others to turn to Jesus Christ, God's
only
Plan of Salvation.
Jesus said,
"You MUST be born again"
and
"For God so loved the world that He sent his only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life" ~ John 3 I realize it's easy to criticize, but this is a glaring example of a colossal failure of a spiritual leader! As we near wind-up our book of Hebrews tour, I look at the contrast between the Hebrews writer compared to what we've just seen on this leader's "social tour". Hebrews is written as a revival call; a reminder to get right with God; to remember how great He is and what He has done for us through sending His Son as a sacrifice for our sins. It starts, by telling us
"...in these last days, God has spoken to us through His Son!" , and admonishes us to
"Fix our eyes on Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith!"
Thus my thoughts turn to witnessing. What we receive
vertically
from God, we need to use to
horizontally
affect those around us. We learn "bible", not to puff us up or "sit" on what we've learned. We want to affect our world. Both the bible and our newspapers tell us that life as we know it is rapidly changing. End-time prophesies that at one time were seemingly vague and distant have become much sharper in their focus when looking at current events. The Church is sensing the imminence of the Rapture stronger than at any time ever. Time as we know it may be shorter than we think! Let's make reasonable use of the time we have to spread Christ's message. Recently, I've had the opportunity of speaking to several colleagues about their personal relationship with Christ. I've been preparing for that. I've been studying my bible to
"Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.
But to do this with gentleness and respect" ~ 1 Peter 3 " I would want to say that they fell to their knees and right there and then after much sobbing they gave their lives to God on the spot. But no, that's not what happened. What happened is that a seed was planted.
It is my responsibility to be faithful
with a given opportunity...it's the Holy Spirit's job to convict of sin and draw someone towards Christ. That part is not my job; only the Holy Spirit can do that part! When I've asked the Holy Spirit to give me an opportunity for witnessing; He hasn't disappointed me and I've jumped at the opportunity to witness for Jesus. You know the first time you witness, you may think you'll struggle with the wording, but the Word says that if we rely on the Holy Spirit, that He will give us the words to say. In every case, I've found that was true and I had the words to say! And interestingly I've found that most people you witness to will have never heard the gospel message! - YES. Believe it or not, for most people, this will come as new information!
Why don't you this week, ask the Spirit for an opportunity to
speak words of life
into our world and witness for Jesus? ...and then when the opportunity comes stay faithful! I dare you.

E.Dewey-Smith -When I visited Dewey's Decatur (Atlanta), GA church in Spring 2014, he gave me a first class taste of southern hospitality. He had me stand in front of his congregation of 5,000 and gave me a short interview and a very friendly welcome.
The church sisters gave me lots of hugs too. I couldn't have been made more welcome!
He asked if they could sing my favourite GTR song, ...that was easy to decide. I quickly picked "At the Cross". He is highly relational, an awesome leader and speaker. By the way...do you make people welcome when they come to your church?

Tough Love For Singles
Tips for Loving Tough By Dr. James Dobson Tough Love For Singles Let me get very specific with those of you who are single but wish not to be. (No insult is intended to those who are single by design and wish to remain unmarried. That is a legitimate choice which should be respected by friends and family alike.) I have listed 16 suggestions that will help you conform to the principles of loving toughness in matters of the heart. Don’t let the relationship move too fast in its infancy.
The phrase “too hot not to cool down” has validity. Take it one step at a time. Don’t discuss your personal inadequacies and flaws
in great detail when the relationship is new. No matter how warm and accepting your friend may be, any great revelation of low self-esteem or embarrassing weaknesses can be fatal when interpersonal “valleys” occur. And they will occur. Remember that respect precedes love.
Build it stone upon stone. Don’t call too often
on the phone or give the other person an opportunity to get tired of you. Don’t be too quick to reveal your desire to get married—or that you think you’ve just found Mr. Wonderful or Miss Marvelous. If your partner has not arrived at the same conclusion, you’ll throw him or her into panic. Most important: Relationships are constantly being “tested”
by cautious lovers who like to nibble at the bait before swallowing the hook. This testing procedure takes many forms, but it usually involves pulling backward from the other person to see what will happen. Perhaps a foolish fight is initiated. Maybe two weeks will pass without a phone call. Or sometimes flirtation occurs with a rival. In each instance, the question being asked is, “How important am I to you and what would you do if you lost me?” An even more basic issue lies below that one. It wants to know, “How free am I to leave if I want to?” It is incredibly important in these instances to appear poised, secure and equally independent. Do not grasp the other person and beg for mercy. Some people remain single throughout life because they cannot resist the temptation to grovel when the test occurs. Extending the same concept, keep in mind that virtually
every dating relationship that continues for a year or more and seems to be moving toward marriage will be given the ultimate test.
A breakup will occur, motivated by one of the partners. The rejected individual should know that their future together depends on the skill with which he/she handles that crisis. If the hurting individual can remain calm, the next two steps may be reconciliation and marriage. If not, then no amount of pleading will change anything. Do not expect anyone to meet all your emotional needs.
Maintain interest and activities outside the romantic relationship, even after marriage. Guard against selfishness in the relationship.
Neither the man nor the woman should do all the giving. I once broke up with a girl because she let me take her to nice places, bring her flowers, buy her lunch, etc. I wanted to do these things, but expected her to reciprocate in some way. She didn’t. Beware of blindness to obvious warning signs
that tell you that your potential husband or wife is basically disloyal, hateful, spiritually uncommitted, hooked on drugs or alcohol, given to selfishness, etc. Believe me, a bad marriage is far worse than the most lonely instance of singleness. Don’t marry the person you think you can live with ; marry only the individual you think you can’t live without. Be careful to defend the “line of respect”
even during a dating relationship. A man should open doors for a woman on a formal evening; a woman should speak respectfully of her escort when in public, etc. If you don’t preserve this delicate line when the foundations of marriage are being laid, it will be virtually impossible to construct them later. Do not equate human worth with flawless beauty or handsomeness!
If you require physical perfection in your mate, he or she may make the same demands of you. Don’t let love escape you because of the false values of your culture. In the same vein, be careful not to compare yourself with others—which is the root of all inferiority. If genuine love has escaped you thus far,
don’t begin believing “no one would ever want me.”
That is a deadly trap that can destroy you emotionally! Millions of people are looking for someone to love. The problem is finding one another! Regardless of how brilliant the dating relationship has been,
take time to “check your assumptions” with your partner before committing yourself to marriage.
It is surprising how often men and women plunge into matrimony without ever becoming aware of major differences in expectation between them. For example: Do you want to have children? How soon? How many? Where will you live? Will the wife work? How soon? How about after children are born? Who will lead in the relationship? What does that really mean? How will you relate to your in-laws? How will money be spent? Where will you attend church? These and dozens of other “assumptions” should be discussed item-by-item, perhaps with the help of a premarital counselor. Many future struggles can be avoided by coming to terms with potential areas of disagreement. If the differences are great enough, it is even possible that the marriage should never occur. Finally,
