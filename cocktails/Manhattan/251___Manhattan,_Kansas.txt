Question:
This North American mystery bird is part of a taxonomic family that is not closely related to another family with the same name. Can you name this bird's taxonomic family, the other family that shares its common name? Can you name this species?
Response:
This small passerine is a Le Conte's sparrow,
Ammodramus leconteii . This bird lives amongst -- and is often confused with -- Nelson's sharp-tailed sparrows,
A. nelsoni , Baird's sparrows,
A. bairdii , and grasshopper sparrows,
A. savannarum . Adding to this confusion is the mysterious and secretive nature of Le Conte's sparrows: only 355 individuals have ever been banded, but not a single banded bird has ever been recovered, for example. Additionally, this species' nests were not seen until almost 100 years after the birds had first been discovered. Based on the few times their nests have been documented, we know that Le Conte's sparrows construct a cup-shaped nest from dead grasses located in a grass clump just above the ground.
These small monogamous seed-eating birds are specialists of grass/sedge habitats, typically those with tall, dense vegetation and abundant residual vegetation. They have a very quiet insect-like song, as you can hear in this 1:02-second embedded audio recording, thanks to the many talented people who freely contribute their work to
Xeno-Canto :
Here's a 59-second embedded audio recording of another individual singing a very different song, once again, this recording is courtesy of Xeno-Canto:
This species is distinguished (in this image) from the very similar-in-appearance Nelson's sharp-tailed sparrow by its white central crown stripe (buff in sharp-tailed sparrows). The other distinguishing mark, purplish streaks on its nape, are not visible in this photograph.
Le Conte's sparrow is part of the very large (mostly New World) sparrow family, Emberizidae, that originated in South America, moved into North America and then colonized parts of Europe. European Emberizids are usually known as buntings. Even though they share a common group name, the Old World sparrows, Passeridae, are not closely related to Emberizids. The taxon that is probably most closely related to the Emberizids are the Thraupidae (tanagers), and in fact, some tanagers may be more correctly placed into Emberizidae.
