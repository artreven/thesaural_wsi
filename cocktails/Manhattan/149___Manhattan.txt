Terry Jenner, Australian Test cricketer and coach died he was , 66.
Terrence James Jenner  was an Australian
cricketer
who played nine
Tests
and one
ODI
from 1970 to 1975 died he was , 66.. He was primarily a
leg-spin
bowler and was known for his attacking, loopy style of bowling, but he was also a handy lower-order batsman. In his latter years he was a leg-spin coach to many players around the world, and a great influence on
Shane Warne . He was also a radio cricket commentator for the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation .
(8 September 1944 – 25 May 2011)
Playing career
Early cricket
Jenner was born in
Mount Lawley, Western Australia . He was first selected as an all-rounder in
grade cricket
in Perth at the age of 17, playing for Mount Lawley. After two years in grade cricket, he was selected to make his debut for
Western Australia , primarily as a bowling all-rounder in the 1963–64 season. However, as the
WACA Ground
was not conducive to spin, and with
England
left-arm orthodox
spinner
Tony Lock
playing in the team, Jenner rarely appeared in the XI, claiming only 34 wickets in four seasons.
Move to South Australia
He moved to
South Australia
in 1967–68, playing at the more spin-friendly
Adelaide Oval
and became a regular member of the playing team. After three seasons there, he was selected for the 1970 tour to
New Zealand , but did not play in the Test matches.
International cricket
He was finally able to make his debut in the 1970–71 Australian season in the First Test of the
1970-71 Ashes series
at
Brisbane . He did not however make a large impact, scoring 0 and 2 and taking 2/95, resulting in his immediate dismissal from the team. He was recalled for the Seventh, and final Test of the series at the spin-friendly
Sydney Cricket Ground , where took 3/42 as England were dismissed on the first day for 184. In the Australian innings he ducked into a short ball from
John Snow . [3]
This resulted in crowd trouble which forced English captain
Ray Illingworth
to evacuate his players from the ground. Jenner returned to bat at 235-8 and made a brave 30, last man out on 264 – giving Australia a lead of 80 runs – and took 1/39 in the second innings, but Australia lost the test and
The Ashes . [2] [4]
He was then dropped from international cricket for a season, before being selected to tour the
West Indies
in 1972–73, playing the last four matches in a five Test series. He claimed thirteen wickets at 26.7, including career best figures of 5/90 in the fifth Test at
Port of Spain ,
Trinidad , as well as making 38 with the bat without dismissal in the same game. Despite this performance, he was again overlooked for the entirety of the following season, playing next against England in the 1974–75 Australian season, in which he was selected for two matches. He had little success with the ball, taking two wickets at 48.5, but showed some of all-round skill by scoring a Test best of 74 at the
Adelaide Oval . A solitary Test the following year in Australia against the
West Indies , in which he took 2/90, was his last. [4]
Unable to hold down a regular position in the team, Jenner played a total of nine Tests in a four year period. He only played Test cricket outside of Australia on one tour, against the
West Indies . He played one ODI, in which he scored 12 and bowled economically without success, conceding 28 runs in 8 overs. [2]
Final years
His first class career continued for a further two years until the end of the 1976–77 season, participating in a two-pronged South Australian attack with off-spinner
Ashley Mallett . In total, his 131 first class matches yielded 389 wickets at an average of 32.2, including fourteen five wicket hauls and one ten wicket haul. He also regularly contributed with the bat, scoring ten half-centuries. [2]
Post-retirement
In 1988 Jenner was sentenced to six and a half years in prison after stealing funds from his employer in order to repay gambling debts. He was however released after 18 months. [2] [5]
He then become a spin-bowling coach at the
Australian Cricket Academy
in
Adelaide . As a highly respected coach, he had a massive influence on the career of
Shane Warne , and was a mentor to many other slow bowlers across the world. [6]
Death
In April 2010 Jenner suffered a massive heart attack, [6]
and died at home on 25 May 2011. His funeral took place at the
Adelaide Oval
on 30 May 2011. [1]

Gene Smith, American baseball player (Negro Leagues) , died he was 94
Eugene F. ″Genie″ Smith was an
American
pitcher
who played for several
Negro league baseball
teams between
1938
and
1951   died he was 94. Listed at 6′ 1″, 185 lb., Smith was a
switch-hitter
and threw
right-handed . He was born in
Ansley ,
Louisiana . His younger brother,
Quincy Smith , also played in the Negro Leagues.
(April 23, 1917 – May 25, 2011)
Like many Negro Leaguers, Gene Smith never realized his dream of playing
Major League Baseball . By the time
Jackie Robinson
broke the
color barrier
with the
Brooklyn Dodgers
in
1947 , Smith was nearing the end of his own career, with an arm unable to cope with the demands of pitching due to assorted injuries. [2]
Smith was known as a
hard-throwing
pitcher during a solid career that saw him play for nine different Negro league clubs. In addition, he pitched for teams in
Canada ,
Mexico ,
Puerto Rico
and
Minor league baseball , taking a three-year break to serve in the
US Army
during
World War II
(1943-1945). [3] [4]
Smith entered the Negro Leagues in 1938 with the
Atlanta Black Crackers , playing for them one year before joining the
Ethiopian Clowns
(1939),
New Orleans-St. Louis Stars
(1940-1941),
Kansas City Monarchs
(1941) and
New York Black Yankees
(1942). Following military discharge, he played for the
Pittsburgh Crawfords
(1946),
Homestead Grays
(1946-1947),
Cleveland Buckeyes
(1946-1950) and
Chicago American Giants
(1951). [5]
In 1938, while pitching for the Black Crackers, Smith threw two
no-hitters
in one day, and in 1941 with the Stars hurled another against the Black Yankees. He also started Games 3 and 6 of the
1947 Negro League World Series
against the
New York Cubans . [2] [3]
Smith ended his career in 1953, dividing his playing time with the
Statesboro Pilots
of the
Georgia State League
and the
Fond du Lac Panthers
of the
Wisconsin State League . [6]
Following his baseball career, Smith worked as a packer for National Lead Co., retiring in 1977. He also coached baseball for the Mathews-Dickey Boys’ & Girls’ Club. Then, in 1983 he gained induction into the St. Louis Amateur Baseball Hall of Fame. [2]
In 1997, Smith and other Negro League veterans were honored during a
St. Louis Cardinals
home game for their work in paving the way for Robinson to make his jump from the Negro Leagues to the Brooklyn Dodgers. [2]
Smith was a long resident of
Richmond Heights, Missouri , where he died at the age of 94, following a
congestive heart failure . [2]

Paul Splittorff, American baseball player and broadcaster (Kansas City Royals), died from complications from melanoma he was , 64.
Paul William Splittorff Jr. was a
Major League Baseball
starting pitcher
who spent his entire career with the
Kansas City Royals
died from complications from melanoma he was , 64. Listed at 6′ 3″, Splittorff batted and threw
left handed .
( October 8, 1946 – May 25, 2011)
Early years
Splittorff was born in
Evansville, Indiana . He was drafted by the Royals in the 25th round of the
1968 Major League Baseball Draft
out of
Morningside College
in
Sioux City, Iowa , where he was a member of
Delta Sigma Phi
Fraternity. He pitched for the Corning Royals in 1968 (a year before the major league club existed), and has the distinction of throwing the first pitch in Royals organization history. He went 28-27 with a 4.01
earned run average
in three seasons in the Royals’ farm system before receiving his first call to the majors in September
1970 . He took the loss in his major league debut, pitching seven innings and giving up three
earned runs
against the
Chicago White Sox . [2]
Kansas City Royals
Splittorff began the
1971
season with the
Omaha Royals , but after going 5-2 with a 1.48 ERA in eight starts for Omaha, he earned a second call up to the majors. He stayed with Kansas City for the rest of the season, going 8-9 with a 2.68 ERA.
From there, he became a fixture in the Kansas City rotation. He enjoyed his only 20-win season in
1973 , when he went 20-11 with a 3.98 ERA. Splittorff was the starting pitcher in the inaugural game at
Kauffman Stadium
(known at the time as Royals Stadium) on April 10, 1973; Splittorff earned the victory that evening in a 12-1 rout of the
Texas Rangers . After finishing second to the
Oakland A’s
three of his first five seasons in the majors, Splittorff and the Royals emerged as
American League West
champions in
1976 .
Kansas City faced the
New York Yankees
in every
American League Championship Series
from 1976 to
1978 , with the Yankees emerging victorious in all three. For his part, Splittorff was 2-0 with a 2.84 ERA against the Yankees in the five appearances he made against them in the ALCS. After both teams missed the play-offs in
1979 , the Royals and Yankees resumed their post-season rivalry in the
1980 American League Championship Series . Kansas City swept the series, with Splittorff starting the third and deciding game, and receiving a no-decision. [3]
The Royals lost the
World Series
in six games to the
Philadelphia Phillies
with Splittorff making his only appearance in game six. [4]
Never an All-Star and usually overshadowed by teammates
Steve Busby ,
Dennis Leonard
and
Larry Gura , Splittorff’s consistency and longevity resulted in his winning more games than any of them. Splittorff accumulated 166 career victories over a 15-year career with the Royals.
Besides this, Splittorff was known for staring down hitters after he struck them out. He was particularly effective pitching against the
New York Yankees , who tended to stock up on left-handed hitters to take advantage of the dimensions of
Yankee Stadium , and Splittorff compiled a 2-0 record with a 2.68
earned run average
pitching in four championship series against them.
Splittorff retired when his effectiveness faded. At the same time, the Royals had numerous young pitchers coming through the ranks. His final game was on June 26,
1984 .
Personal life
After his retirement, Splittorff became a television
color commentator
for the Royals. He was inducted into the Royals Hall of Fame in
1987 . [5]
On May 16, 2011, Splittorff’s battle with oral cancer and melanoma became public. [6]
Nine days later, on the morning of May 25, he died in his
Blue Springs, Missouri , home at the age of 64. [7]

Paul J. Wiedorfer, American soldier, Medal of Honor recipient died he was , 90.
Paul Joseph Wiedorfer
was a
United States Army
soldier and a recipient of the United States military’s highest decoration, the
Medal of Honor , for his actions in
World War II
died he was , 90..
(January 17, 1921 – May 25, 2011)
Biography
Born in
Baltimore, Maryland , raised in the 2400 block of McElderry Street, he attended St. Andrew’s School, and graduated in 1940 from
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute . On November 11, 2008, a plaque honoring him was placed in Poly’s Memorial Hall. [2]
Married to his bride, Alice Stauffer, for just six months when Wiedorfer enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1943, he was working as an apprentice power station operator at the Baltimore Gas & Electric Company in Baltimore, [3]
and was living in the 1900 block of Bank Street. [4]
Wiedorfer received basic training at Camp Lee, Virginia. He was then assigned to the Quartermaster Corps, and then passed the examination for cadet air training. He was training to be a pilot, but the Army switched him to infantry because of greater need. On the way to England he crossed the
Atlantic Ocean
on the
HMS Queen Mary , and by December 25, 1944, was serving as a
private
in Company G,
318th Infantry Regiment ,
80th Infantry Division . [2] [3]
“So I thought, somebody’s got to do something. And all of a sudden I said, ‘Goddammit, let’s see if we can get that nest.’ I remember slipping, falling and the good Lord was with me and I got it. I got two of ’em.”
Paul J. Wiedorfer
On the Medal of Honor suicide charge [3]
On that
Christmas
Day, near
Chaumont ,
Belgium , Wiedorfer single-handedly charged across 40 yards of open ground, destroyed two
German
machine gun emplacements and took six Germans prisoner. He was subsequently promoted to
staff sergeant
and on May 29, 1945, issued the Medal of Honor for his actions during the battle.
While crossing the
Saar River , he was severely wounded February 10, 1945, by a mortar shell that blew up near him; shrapnel broke his left leg, ripped into his stomach, and seriously injured two fingers on his right hand. The soldier next to him died from his wounds and Paul credited that soldier for saving his life. Recent research has discovered the soldier’s name to be PFC Milton C Smithers of Huntingdon, New Jersey. Paul was evacuated to the 137th United States Army General Hospital in
England
where he was placed in traction. While in the hospital a sergeant reading
Stars and Stripes
asked him how he spelled his name, and then told him he had received the Medal of Honor. Later, on May 29, 1945, Brigadier General Egmont F. Koenig with a band entered the ward to present him with his medal. [2] [3]
“Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the Medal of Honor didn’t exist because there were no wars and we could all live in peace? And that the only way to spell war was love? Wouldn’t that be wonderful?”
Paul J. Wiedorfer
On the Medal of Honor [5]
Wiedorfer reached the rank of
master sergeant
before retiring from the Army. In addition to the Medal of Honor he was also awarded a
Bronze Star
and two
Purple Hearts . [3]
He returned to Baltimore on June 11, 1945, and was given a ticker tape parade with General
George C. Marshall
and Maryland governor
Herbert O’Conor
in attendance. [2]
After the war he spent another three years recovering in different Army hospitals and then returned to Baltimore Gas & Electric, and retired in 1981 after 40 years of service. He and Alice had four children. [2] [3]
Wiedorfer died in Baltimore on May 25, 2011, at age 90. He will be buried in Baltimore’s Moreland Memorial Park Cemetery on June 7, 2011. [6]

stars that died, celebrity deaths, stars that died, Huguette M. Clark, American heiress, daughter of William A. Clark
Huguette Marcelle Clark
was the youngest daughter of former U.S. Senator and industrialist William A. Clark died she was , 104.. She lived a reclusive life after 1930 and her activities were virtually unknown to the public. Upon Clark’s death in 2011, she left behind a vast fortune, most of which was donated to charity. Substantial sums were also left to her long time nurse, her goddaughter, some employees and her attorney. Her accountant and her attorney are part of a criminal investigation concerning suspicions of mishandling Clark’s assets.
(June 9, 1906 – May 24, 2011)
Early life
Huguette Marcelle Clark was born in 1906 in
Paris, France , the second daughter of
William A. Clark
with his second wife, Anna Eugenia ( née
La Chapelle) (1878—1963). [3]
She had an elder sister, Andrée Clark, and several half siblings from her father’s first marriage: William Andrews Clark, Jr., Charles W. Clark, Katherine Clark Morris and Mary J. Clark. Following the death of her father in 1925, she and her mother moved from a mansion at 962 Fifth Avenue to a 12th floor apartment at
907 Fifth Avenue . She later purchased the entire 8th floor in the building. In 1928, she agreed to donate $50,000 (equivalent to $641,131 in 2010 dollars [4] ) to excavate the salt pond and create an artificial freshwater lake across from Bellosguardo (
34.418376°N 119.660664°W ), her 23-acre (93,000 m 2 ) estate on the
Pacific Coast
in
Santa Barbara, California . She stipulated that the facility would be named the
Andrée Clark Bird Refuge
after her deceased sister.
In 1928, she married
Princeton
graduate and then-law student William MacDonald Gower but they divorced in 1930. [5]
The daughter of a former staff member described Clark and her mother as not “odd or strange” but rather “quiet, loving, giving ladies”. Over the years she developed a distrust of outsiders, including her family, because she thought they were after her money. She preferred to conduct all of her conversations in French so that others were unlikely to understand the discussion. [6]
Huguette Clark was a musician and an artist who, in 1929, exhibited seven of her paintings at the
Corcoran Gallery of Art
in
Washington, D.C.
The last known photograph of her was taken in 1930 and she was rarely seen in public following the death of her mother in 1963. She reportedly had a very small group of friends. [7]
Her closest friend and former employee, Suzanne Pierre, died of
Alzheimer’s
in February 2011. [2] [8]
Later years and controversy
In February 2010, Clark became the subject of a series of reports on
msnbc.com , which said caretakers at her three residences had not seen her in decades, and that her palatial estates in
Santa Barbara, California , and
New Canaan, Connecticut , had lain empty throughout that time, although the houses and their extensive grounds were meticulously maintained by their staff. [9]
Msnbc.com investigative reporter
Bill Dedman
later determined that she was in the care of a New York City hospital, and that some of her personal possessions had been quietly sold. Possessions sold included a rare 1709 violin called
La Pucelle
(or The Virgin) made by
Antonio Stradivari
and an 1882
Pierre-Auguste Renoir
painting entitled
In the Roses . [7]
Building staff reported that she was frail but not ill when Clark left her Fifth Avenue co-op in an ambulance in 1988. Initially she took up residence at
Mount Sinai Medical Center
to be more comfortable but was later transferred to another hospital in
Manhattan . [10]
In August 2010, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office initiated a probe into her affairs managed by her accountant, Irving Kamsler, and her attorney, Wallace Bock. [11]
Then a former paralegal for Wallace Bock’s law firm, Cynthia Garcia, said that Bock received many lavish gifts from Huguette, including a $1.5 million gift after
9/11
to build a bomb shelter in an Israeli settlement in the
West Bank
near the homes of his daughters. [12]
According to Garcia, Bock tried many times to get Clark to sign a will, including versions that included him as a beneficiary. Bock’s spokesperson acknowledged that she had a will. [13]
In September 2010, in a one-paragraph ruling, Judge Laura Visitacion-Lewis turned down a request from a grand-half-nephew and two grand-half-nieces, Ian Devine, Carla Hall Friedman and Karine McCall, to appoint an independent guardian to manage Clark’s affairs. [14]
The Manhattan District Attorney interviewed her twice and found she did not have all her faculties, and both her vision and hearing were, unsurprisingly, poor. [15]
Death and interment
Clark died at
Beth Israel Medical Center
on the morning of May 24, 2011, two weeks short of her 105th birthday. She had been moved a month earlier to an intensive-care unit and later to a room with hospice care. She had been living at Beth Israel under pseudonyms; the latest was Harriet Chase. The room was guarded and she was cared for by full-time private nurses. Her room on the 3rd floor had a card with the fake room number “1B” with the name “Chase” taped over the actual room number. A criminal investigation into the handling of her money was ongoing at the time of her death. [2] [16]
She was interred on the morning of May 26, 2011, in the family mausoleum in section 85 of
Woodlawn Cemetery
in the Bronx before the cemetery gates were open to the public. Her attorney said she had specific instructions that no funeral service or mass be held. In 2008, Clark’s representatives obtained consent from other Clark family members to alter the mausoleum originally commissioned by her father. It was not until early 2011 that the mausoleum was altered to accommodate her entombment. [17]
Clark’s will was filed on June 22, 2011 in Surrogate’s Court. The last will and testament was made in 2005 and left 75% of her estate, about $300 million, to charity. Her longtime nurse, Hadassah Peri, received about $30 million, her goddaughter, Wanda Styka, received about $12 million and the newly created Bellosguardo Foundation $8 million. Other employees who managed her residences received smaller sums. Her attorney and accountant each received $500,000. One of
Claude Monet ‘s 250 oil paintings inspired by
Water Lilies
(Nymphéas) in his
Giverny
flower garden was bequeathed to the
Corcoran Museum of Art . [18]
She purchased the 1907 painting from
Galerie Durand-Ruel
in 1930. [19] [20]

Arthur Goldreich, South African-born Israeli political activist died he was , 82.
Arthur Goldreich
was a South African-Israeli abstract painter and a key figure in the
anti-apartheid
movement in the country of his birth died he was , 82.
(1929–24 May, 2011)
Early life
Goldreich was born in
Johannesburg ,
South Africa , and settled in
Israel , where he participated in the
1948 Arab-Israeli war
as a member of the
Palmach , the elite military wing of the
Haganah . [3]
In time he became a leading figure at
Bezalel Academy
in
Jerusalem . In 1966, he became the head of Industrial and Environmental Design Department, which he helped transform into an internationally recognized center for
design .
By the age of 33, Goldreich had moved to South Africa where he became one of the country’s most successful artists. In 1955, he won South Africa’s Best Young Painter Award for his figures in black and white, but to the
Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd’s
government, he was a key suspect in the clandestine operations of the anti-apartheid underground.
Escape from jail
Arthur Goldreich and
Harold Wolpe , a lawyer, used
South African Communist Party
funds to buy
Liliesleaf Farm , which was to become the key location in the
Rivonia Trial , following the arrests of 19
African National Congress
members and leaders by the National Party there. Goldreich and Wolpe also helped locate sabotage sites for
Umkhonto we Sizwe , the military arm of the ANC, and draft a disciplinary code for
guerrillas .
Wolpe, father of
Nicholas Wolpe , the administrator of the new
Liliesleaf Trust , was arrested shortly after the Liliesleaf raid where Goldreich, along with
Nelson Mandela
and others were also jailed. He was taken to Marshall Square prison in the city, where Goldreich was already being held.
The two met up with
Mosie Moola
and
Abdulhay Jassat , members of the
Natal Indian Congress , allied to the
African National Congress . Moola and Jassat had been held in solitary confinement, where they had been tortured (they were believed to be the first political activists tortured in South African jails). Eventually the four men, working together with the aid of a prison warden, escaped successfully from custody, splitting up outside the prison (with Goldreich disguised as a priest).
Wolpe and Goldreich spent several days hiding in and around Johannesburg’s suburbs to avoid capture. Eventually, they were driven to
Swaziland , and from there were flown to
Botswana , still disguised as priests to avoid being identified by potentially pro-South African British colonial authorities (at this time Swaziland was not independent).
Criticism of Israel
According to
the Guardian , Feb. 2006, Goldreich was living in the city of
Herzliya . There was a time when he believed the young Jewish state might provide the example of a better way for the country of his birth. As it is, Goldreich sees Israel as closer to the white regime he fought against and modern South Africa as providing the model. Israeli governments, he says, ultimately proved more interested in territory than peace, and along the way
Zionism
mutated.
Goldreich speaks of the “ bantustanism
we see through a policy of occupation and separation”, the “abhorrent” racism in Israeli society all the way up to cabinet ministers who advocate the forced removal of Arabs, and “the brutality and inhumanity of what is imposed on the people of the occupied territories of Palestine”. “Don’t you find it horrendous that this people and this state, which only came into existence because of the defeat of fascism and Nazism in Europe, and in the conflict six million Jews paid with their lives for no other reason than that they were Jews, is it not abhorrent that in this place there are people who can say these things and do these things?” he asks.
