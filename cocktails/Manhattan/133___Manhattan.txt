"Sepia" refers to a color (brownish), not to the fish. Antique-looking photographs are sepia-toned.

Sepia is also the latin name of the fish.
I'd go for cuttlefish.

Thanks for reminding me... my English gets rusty every now and then!...
Is soup with cuttlefish right???
It sounds eekling to me, but then I've been a vegetarian for almost 30 years!
Thanks Angel, we crossed replies

In the US at least we sometimes say 'squid' to translate 'seppia'.
'Cuttlefish' sounds rather British to me ...
Often Italian dishes call for 'nero di seppia', the black ink that these animals -- whatever we call them -- produce. In that case I've seen translations like 'squid ink', or if the squid is included, 'squid in their ink'.

I wouldn't use soup but chowder - like the Boston Clam Chowder.

I've never had an Italian soup that resembled
chowder
as that term is used in AE.
Chowder typically has milk in the base, while
brodo
strikes me as more like broth.

Manhattan
clam chowder has clear broth, plus
tomato
for red color and flavor. In the
1890s , this chowder was called " Coney Island
clam chowder" and " Fulton Fish Market
clam chowder." The name "Manhattan clam chowder" became attached in the early
1900s . Restaurants typically serve New England or Manhattan chowder, but not both.
Rhode Island
clam chowder has clear broth. Though less popular than the other two, clear, white chowders are still served, especially at long-established New England restaurants and hotels, such as those on
Block Island .

I am not native but when I read "brodo con seppia" I imagined it would be a soup with the black ink the fish produces(as flaviano also mentioned). I have had of Pizza con seppia and that was pizza with squid and the black ink that it produces.

A proposito di seppie volevo chiedere se c'e' un modo in inglese per distinguerle dai calamari in quanto a volte sento che i due termini vengono usati interscambiabilmente.

In UK the word "calamari" is often used and people know what it means.
They'll ask for a plate of "calamari" - quite fashionable at present.
So you can keep the word in Italian, if you want.

From a bit of
online research , it appears that calamari = squid, and seppie = cuttlefish.
But the two cephalopods seem very similar.
The word calamari appears on Italian restaurant menus in the U.S., too.
