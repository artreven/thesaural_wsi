Making a Mosquito Trap
http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf22399231.tip.html
Because mosquitoes are attracted to the CO2 we breathe out, I started looking for ideas that used CO2 as the bait for the mosquito trap. I did think of dry ice but it does dissipate fairly quickly.
I found a cached link on Google
here . It seems to be active again now. I’ve rewritten the instructions some and hopefully it will work as well.
Thanks to the students for their hard work on this project. I’ve used some of their photos for illustration.
Supplies:
1 2 liter soda bottle
a sharp knife
black paper
tape
candy thermometer
Take a 2 liter soda bottle. Cut off the top right below where it starts to narrow for the top, invert and place inside the lower half.
Make a simple sugar syrup.
Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
1 cup water
2 cups cool water
1 tsp. active dry yeast
Directions:
Bring 1 cup of the water to a boil.
Dissolve the sugar into the boiling water.
Once the sugar is dissolved completely, remove the pan from the heat. Stir in 2 cups cool water, stir well.
Check the temperature of the syrup to make sure it is no hotter than 90 degrees F, if hotter, let cool to 90 degrees F, add 1 tsp. active dry yeast, no need to mix. Put syrup in the bottom part of the bottle, using the cut off neck piece, leave in place.
Be sure to seal the two parts of the bottle with the tape. The fermenting yeast will release carbon dioxide. Put black paper around the bottle since mosquitoes like dark places and carbon dioxide. This mosquito trap will then start working.
TIPS: Put the trap in a dark and humid place for 2 weeks, you’ll see the effect. You’ll have to replace the sugar water + yeast solution every 2 weeks.

London Underground mosquito
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The  London Underground mosquito  is a  form  of  mosquito  in the genus  Culex  found in the  London Underground . It is thought to have  evolved  from the overground species Culex pipiens  recently. [ when? ]   Biologists  named the London Underground mosquito  Culex pipiens  f.  molestus  due to its voracious biting. Notably the London  C. p.  f.  molestus assaulted Londoners sleeping in the Underground during  the Blitz , [1]  although similar populations were already known. The London Underground mosquito, although first discovered in the  London Underground  system, has been found in underground systems around the world. It is suggested that it may have adapted to human-made underground systems since the last century from local above-ground  Culex pipiens , [2]  although more recent evidence suggests that it is a southern mosquito variety related to Culex pipiens  that has adapted to the warm underground spaces of northern cities. [3]
The evidence for this mosquito being a different  species  from  Culex pipiens  comes from research by Kate Byne and Richard Nichols. The species have very different behaviours, [1]  are extremely difficult to mate, [2]  and with different  allele frequency  consistent with  genetic drift  during a  founder event . [4]  More specifically, this mosquito,  Culex pipiens  f.  molestus , breeds all-year round, is cold intolerant, and bites rats, mice, and humans, in contrast to the above ground species  Culex pipiens  that is cold tolerant, hibernates in the winter, and bites only birds. When the two varieties were cross-bred the eggs were infertile suggesting reproductive isolation. [1] [2]
Since that paper more information has accumulated. The fundamental results still stand: the genetic data indicate that the  molestus  form in the London Underground appeared to have a common ancestry, rather than the population at each station being related to the nearest above-ground population (i.e. the  pipiens  form). Byrne and Nichols’ working hypothesis was that adaptation to the underground environment had occurred locally in London once only – since there are many hurdles to jump in order to become adapted to the subterranean environment, it is understandable that it would occur rarely. This hypothesis implies that local adaptation would be expected in different locations around Europe and beyond, as each local pipiens population evolved an offshoot that overcame the problems of living underground.
However, more recently-collected genetic evidence suggests that a single  molestus  form has spread throughout Europe and beyond, since populations over a large area share a common genetic heritage. These widely separated populations are distinguished by very minor genetic differences, which suggest that the  molestus  form developed recently: a single  mtDNA  difference shared among the underground populations of ten Russian cities; [5]  a single fixed  microsatellite  difference in populations spanning Europe, Japan, Australia, the middle East, and Atlantic islands. [3]  This worldwide spread might have occurred after the last glaciations or be even more recent, due to the insects hitch hiking on world trade routes. One possibility is the international second-hand tire trade. The tires retain water in which the larvae can survive (Completely removing water from an old tire can be difficult).
What has always been more intriguing about the  molestus  story was that the reproductive isolation in north European populations appears to be almost complete, whereas there is clearly  gene flow  between them in populations to the south. Byrne and Nichols attributed this pattern to the inability of the underground form (and perhaps their hybrids) to survive above ground in harsh northern winters.
Now it appears that the persistence of hybrids in northern climates may be another evolutionary problem that can be solved but only rarely: the Fonseca paper obtained genetic evidence that the recent colonization of America by  Culex  mosquitoes actually involves a strain derived from a rare successful hybridization between  pipiens  and  molestus . They suggest that hybridization may explain why the American form bites both birds and humans (this interpretation is controversial, see letter from Spielman  et al. [6]  and the response that follows it in  Science ). The consequences of this more indiscriminate feeding hit the news in 1999 with the outbreak of human encephalitis in New York, caused by West Nile virus. It was the first documented introduction of this virus into the Western Hemisphere; perhaps because in the longer established populations the old world northern above-ground pipiens almost exclusively bite birds, the human biting ones being incarcerated below ground.
New York outbreak
In the summer of 2011, an invasion of  Culex pipiens  f.  molestus  appeared on the  Upper West Side  in the  borough  of  Manhattan ,  New York City . The mosquito is well known for being in commonly found in sewers of New York and thrive throughout the year feeding off of humans. Residents of older  brownstones  found the mosquitoes coming from the underground into basements and then through air vents and other openings into the homes. The city government did not make this infestation of the pest a top priority because they tested negative for  West Nile Virus  and the high cost of mosquito control. [7]

Catch of the day!
23
May
Every week, vector specialists from the the Department of Health, place a trap in manholes to monitor the mosquito population underground. The mosquito headcount in the sewer system on West 84th Street was relatively stable at approximately 100 mosquitoes per 24-hour period through most of the winter.  It has shot up to 350 mosquitoes / 24 hr over the past couple of weeks . It is only a matter of weeks or months before we reach last year’s headcount of 900 to 1,000 mosquitoes / 24hr.
May 17th, 2012, mosquito trap from manhole in the middle of the on West 84th Street between Riverside Drive and West End Avenue: headcount 350!

As Fierce As Culex Pipiens Molestus
19
May
Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal vigorously conducted Thursday’s Town Hall Meeting on West 88th Street.  Roughly 200 UWS citizens swarmed the room.  Linda pulled together representatives of the Departments of Health, Environmental Protection, Transportation, ConEd and even a mosquito expert from Cornell University.
It took persistence, facts, a few big pictures of mosquitoes and the ravaged limbs and faces of our children to get the message across, but our concern with the ravages of the fierce mosquito  Culex Pipiens Molestus finally got the attention of the City Agencies. There was a tremendous turnout and no one wanted to leave the room without getting the mike!

NYC fights mosquito infestation
16
May
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg unveils a mosquito surveillance and control plan May 29, 2002 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. Since the outbreak in New York of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus in 1999, the city has been attempting to quell the disease by advocating increased public surveillance of mosquito breeding areas and by promoting the use of insect repellent, among other measures. The goal of New York’s 2002 plan is to prevent disease caused by mosquitoes through aggressive source reduction and larviciding. Health experts have noted that a larger population of the blood-sucking insects could hasten the spread of the West Nile virus, responsible for the deaths of 18 people and 187 horses in the United States over the past three years.

“Tear it up and start again,” Rosenthal said. “In this case it seems like that may very well be what will solve the problem.”
