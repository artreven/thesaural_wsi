Praise for Juan Felipe Herrera
Elaborating on the selection  of Juan Felipe Herrera, 66, as the next U.S. poet laureate, James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, compared Herrera's work to Walt Whitman's, calling Herrera an "American original."
Like Whitman's
Leaves of Grass , Herrera's poems "engage in a serious sense of play--in language and in image--that I feel gives them enduring power," said Billington in a
Library of Congress statement.  "I see how they champion voices, traditions and histories, as well as a cultural perspective, which is a vital part of our larger American identity."
One of the hallmark lines in Whitman's "Song of Myself" could easily pertain to Herrera's life and career: "I resist anything better than my own diversity."
That's Whitman's way of saying, "Don't you dare pigeonhole me, reader. If you label me one thing, I'll cast myself the opposite." Likewise, it's foolish to sum up Herrera's biography and poetry with a fistful of adjectives. His range has been wide and ever-shifting.
"He's always trying to get outside what he's already done, line by line, poem by poem, book by book," Stephen Burt, a professor at Harvard who has written about Herrera, told the
New York Times . "He's really unpredictable in the best possible way."
Personally, I've always appreciated how Herrera creates sublimity through surprising sounds.
Read aloud these lines from his "Let Me Tell You What a Poem Brings," and you'll discern his skill in creating polyrhythms, like a jazz composer:
let me tell you what a poem brings,
first, you must know the secret, there is no poem
to speak of, it is a way to attain a life without boundaries,
yes, it is that easy, a poem, imagine me telling you this,
instead of going day by day against the razors, well,
the judgments, all the tick-tock bronze, a leather jacket
sizing you up, the fashion mall, for example, from
the outside you think you are being entertained,
when you enter, things change, you get caught by surprise...
His repetition of words like "you" and "poem" are a palpably pleasing sonic contrast to the "z" sounds of "razors," "bronze," "sizing," and, surprisingly, "leather" and "example." Note, too, the subtle, internal almost-rhymes of "attain," "day by day," "entertained," and "change." Taken together, these effects create a meaty mix for both readers and listeners.

Seeing "Song of Myself" in "Goodbye, Columbus"
In Philip Roth's 1995 preface to
Goodbye, Columbus  (1959), he lists the names of 23 writers he was reading at the time of that book's composition. It's an authorial master stroke, with enough believable names (Malamud, Bellow, Freud) that you can easily make the mistake of taking an artist at his word.
Everybody knows artists are famously coy in citing their real influences. You'll relent on the obvious--Roth admitting to Malamud, Bellow, and Freud is hardly surprising--and stay elusive where you can.
Thus it's curious to me why Roth didn't list Walt Whitman in his preface. Sure, you could argue that citing Whitman is like citing Shakespeare; hardly necessary, since to use the English language is to acknowledge your debt.
Yet there are two words in the Roth novella "Goodbye, Columbus," which I think owe a strong debt to Whitman's use of them in "Song of Myself." Those words are "wet" and "acquisitive."
Let's explore "acquisitive" first. It stands out no matter where you read it, because it's by and large a word you read, rather than one you use in speaking. So any writer who uses it better be careful, for he'd be rightly accused of "writerly" usage, which is to say, being hifalutin when you don't have to be. Here's how Whitman's narrator uses it:
Undrape....you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded
I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,
And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless....and can never be shaken away (139).
Now here's how Roth's narrator, 23-year-old Neil Klugman, uses it. For context, Klugman is sitting in St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, amusing himself by formulating a half-assed prayer while his girlfriend is seeing a doctor about getting a diaphragm:
If we meet You at all, God, it's that we're carnal, and acquisitive, and thereby partake of You. I am carnal, and I know you approve, I just know it. But how carnal can I get? I am acquisitive. Where do I turn now in my acquisitiveness? Where do we meet? Which prize is You? (100).
You need not be well-versed in Whitman to grasp the parallels. Young Klugman is, frankly, acting like for all of the reading he's done at Rutgers and the public library, he's never come upon "Song of Myself." If he had, he'd know one of the chief joys of the Whitman-narrator-God's dissenting transcendentalism is his embrace of all joys and bodily freedoms, be they carnal, acquisitive, lazy, heartfelt, or suicidal. Klugman is musing on the conventional God of the bible when he should be finding solace in the all-encompassing ubiquitous ultra-deity at the heart of Whitman's oeuvre.
As for "wet": In "Goodbye, Columbus," the word is central to one of the novella's thematic binaries: the raw and natural versus the manufactured and artificial. Here's how Brenda Patimkin, Klugman's girlfriend, uses the word "wet" when playing a poolside game with Klugman:
Why don't you go in the water, and I'll wait for you and close my eyes, and when you come back you'll surprise me with the wet (52).
Like that? It's "wet" as a noun. It's not entirely unheard of. The dictionary still says it's allowed. And yet...it catches you off-guard each time you read it. As with "acquisitive," it's a bit writerly. And it, too, is arguably rooted in the Whitman-narrator-God's usage of wet as a noun in "Song of Myself." Here's an extended cut from "Song" culminating in wet:
You sea! I resign myself to you also....I guess what you mean,
I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers,
I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me;
We must have a turn together....I undress....hurry me out of sight of the land,
Cushion me soft...rock me in billowy drowse,
Dash me with amorous wet....I can repay you (455).
Wow. While those six lines deserve limitless dissertations, here I'll limit myself to noting one parallel with the "Goodbye, Columbus" passage. In both, there are twined acts of faith and resignation, confidence and vulnerability. A man is essentially closing his eyes in the belief his lover (Brenda, or the sea) will return and hold him. While the passage in "Song" is evocative of death and Oedipal longings and other traits that make comparing it to the "Goodbye, Columbus" passage perhaps a foolish idea on my part, I'm still taken in by the passages' shared use of "wet" as a noun in a sensual context.
Moreover, there are parts of "Goodbye, Columbus" that make me believe Roth was intent on only using "wet" where he really needed to. For example, in the story's famed first paragraph, it seems as if Klugman takes pains to not use the word "wet" in describing Brenda:
She dove beautifully, and a moment later she was swimming back to the side of the pool, her head of short-clipped auburn hair held up, straight ahead of her, as though it were a rose on a long stem. She glided to the edge and then was beside me. "Thank you," she said, her eyes watery though not from the water (3).
Pay special attention to that last sentence.

The Influence of The Book of Mormon on Fitzgerald and Bellow
Whether "influence," always a loaded word, is the accurate one, is a homework assignment for another day.
For today, let the following observation suffice: There are echoes of the intro to The Book of Mormon (1830) in the intros of both F. Scott Fitzgerald's
The Great Gatsby
(1925) and Saul Bellow's
The Adventures of Augie March
(1953). First, TBOM:
I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.
Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians.
And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.
Okay. Now let's examine
Gatsby's
intro for the nine-millionth time:
In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."
He didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.
Before moving on to
Augie , let's enumerate the parallels in the first two intros:
1. First person male narrative.
2. Deference to a biological father's wisdom.
3. Early evocations of "privilege," that is, the notion that the narrator is aware of how "highly favored" his life has been so far.
Now, on to
Augie :
I am an American, Chicago born--Chicago, that somber city--and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style, and will make the record in my own way: first to knock, first admitted; sometimes an innocent knock, sometimes a not so innocent. But a man's character is his fate, says Heraclitus, and in the end there isn't any way to disguise the nature of the knocks by acoustical work on the door or gloving of the knuckles.
Everybody knows there is no fineness or accuracy of suppression; if you hold down one thing you hold down the adjoining.
My own parents were not much to me, though I cared for my mother.
Look at super Saul dishing it! How I dig his lack of hyphenation! Glaring, here, is the absence of the father. Glaring, too, is Augie's assertion that he's self-taught. Especially in contrast to the paternalistic openings of TBOM and
Gatsby .
But what else? Check the rhythms of the passages. Check the use of the phrase "make the record." In these two traits, you can see why I'm comparing (and raising the "influence" question) between the opening of
Augie  and the opening of TBOM. In the latter, Nephi states, "I make a record" twice, once in each of the first two paragraphs. In the third paragraph he states:
And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.
Now let's stack Nephi's statement on top of Augie's:
I am an American, Chicago born--Chicago, that somber city--and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style, and will make the record in my own way: first to knock, first admitted; sometimes an innocent knock, sometimes a not so innocent.
One hallmark of first-person storytelling--what all three male narrators are doing here--is establishing your bona fides to tell the story.
You assert: Here's who I am, in a nutshell; here's where I came from; and here's why you should believe the tale I'm about to tell. I'm not just anybody. I've witnessed a few things in my time.

My first published poem in
Hobart
I wanted to give an official thanks to Aaron Burch and the team at
Hobart
for publishing my poem,
"A request to the new tenant."
The image on the left is one that team
Hobart
found for my poem. I have to admit, I'm pretty excited to print it out on a color printer and laminate it. (Yes, I actually do things like that.)
I have more poetry announcements coming in the next few weeks. Please stay tuned. Meanwhile, I'll raise a few glasses (filled with zero-calorie beverages) to toast this news.

The Blue-Flag in the Bog
Edna St. Vincent Millay’s
“The Blue-Flag in the Bog,”
which first appeared in her
Second April
collection (1921), never fails to disarm me. Its unpretentious structure belies the nuance of its blasphemies. And by blasphemies, I don’t mean strictly sacrilegious sentiments. I mean, too, the assertion of seeking your own private symbols in times of need.
The poem has 43 stanzas, each with four seven-syllables lines. Of the four lines in each stanza, the second and fourth always rhyme. In four of the 43 stanzas (the second, fourth, 35th and 36th), the first and third lines rhyme too. Here are the first two stanzas:
God had called us, and we came;
Our loved Earth to ashes left;
Heaven was a neighbor's house,
Open flung to us, bereft.
Gay the lights of Heaven showed,
And ’twas God who walked ahead;
Yet I wept along the road,
Wanting my own house instead.
You can see how the singsong, nursery-rhyme innocence of the structure is so disarming. Yet the complexity of the blasphemy is immediate--and surprising. There’s respect for God in the first line. Then the third line calls heaven “a neighbor’s house.” There’s no metaphor or simile cushioning the blow with feathers of figurative comparison. Heaven is not
like
a neighbor’s house, nor is heaven, say, as toasty
as
a neighbor’s house. Heaven simply
was
a neighbor’s house. Which changes everything.
It tells us, first and foremost, that heaven was on earth. Further, it tells us heaven was within a human-built structure--but not a church. More than this, it tells us heaven was not within the speaker’s house. And she’s none too happy about that: “Yet I wept along the road, / Wanting my own house instead.” By the 10th stanza, the speaker’s rebellion is clear in her mind--and in her heart--if not yet in her actions:
God had called us, and we came,
But the blessed road I trod
Was a bitter road to me,
And at heart I questioned God.
I love how this poem chronicles the curve of a contrarian idea. Before the speaker acts on it, she muses on it, tests it, talks it out. Then physical rebellion occurs, nine stanzas later:
All their eyes were fixed on Glory,
Not a glance brushed over me;
“Alleluia! Alleluia!”
Up the road,--and I was free.
Everyone else is chanting, but it’s the speaker in jubilation. She’s escaped unnoticed! And then-- most charming--she looks around for her own sign or symbol: Something, anything, that will validate what she’s felt in her heart and now acted upon, in breaking away from the masses. In the 27th verse, she finds it. And in it, she finds a source of inspiration:
And I peered into the smoke
Till it rotted, like a fog:–
There, encompassed round by fire,
Stood a blue-flag in a bog!
Little flames came wading out,
Straining, straining toward its stem,
But it was so blue and tall
That it scorned to think of them!
Red and thirsty were their tongues,
As the tongues of wolves must be,
But it was so blue and tall–
Oh, I laughed, I cried, to see!
All my heart became a tear,
All my soul became a tower,
Never loved I anything
As I loved that tall blue flower!
As a human being, when are you most unassailable? It varies from person to person, from hour to hour. It might be when you’re in the fever-grip of a new idea. It might be when you’re praying or meditating. Or picking apples. Or watching football. It might be when you’re drunk and dancing to “I Know You Got Soul,” either the Bobby Byrd version or the Eric B. & Rakim version.
Here, our speaker beholds an unassailable blue-flag flower, an iris lording it high above threatening flames. Its insouciance under duress moves her to lovelorn declarations about her own “heart” and “soul.” Tears are flowing, love is in the air. She sees the flower and she knows, instantaneously, that it has soul. That will happen, when you find the right sign--or the right person--at the right time. There is also the feeling of feeling needed: By a plant, by a pet, by a friend, by a lover. The theme of mutual rescue dominates the last third of the poem, beginning in the 33rd stanza:
In a breath, ere I had breathed,–
Oh, I laughed, I cried, to see!–
I was kneeling at its side,
And it leaned its head on me!
And a funny thing happens after the speaker finds bliss in the blue-flag. She finds, too, that she wants to protect it. And with this new need, this new love, this new priority, she finds herself returning to--and reconciling with--a newfound appreciation for God.
I will tell Him all my grief,
I will tell Him all my sin;
He will give me half His robe
For a cloak to wrap you in.
It’s one thing to rebel when you’re on your own. It’s different when you feel responsible for others. The gift of “The Blue-Flag in the Bog” is in the way it recognizes how our needs for protection, divine and otherwise, can vary depending on inner and outer circumstances. There are times you’ll savor nothing more than your presence at a religious ceremony or a holiday party. There are other times you’ll want nothing more, during these occasions, than to take a long walk, by yourself, in search of your own blue flag to believe in.

Whitman, and Books I Wish Existed
One of my favorite things about Walt Whitman's
Leaves of Grass
is its inversions of commonplace linguistic sequences. No matter how many times you read it or recite it, you're pleasantly surprised by lines like this:
"Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever I keep, for the dead I loved so well…"
That little "mine and I" piece does it to me every time.
Anyway, as I was reading one of Harold Bloom's amazing Whitman essays this morning, I caught this interesting lament from my former professor:
"We still need a Variorum Whitman, a giant volume that would print, in sequence, the five editions that matter most: 1855, 1856, 1860,
Drum-Taps
and
Sequel , 1865, and the 1891 'deathbed' volume, approved by the poet a year before his departure."
I loved reading this. Even for a scholar like Bloom, even for an eminence like Whitman, there remains a significant absence in the way publishers past and present have packaged the poetry.
It got me thinking about all of the books and compilations that I have always wanted to dream into existence. Here's a short list (for it's the last Saturday morning in August, and the beach awaits me):
1.
An Anthology of Elite Czech Fiction .  Everyone knows about Kundera and Kafka. Too few know about Bohumil Hrabal and Karel Capek. And that's a shame. Especially in light of how popular Stefan Zweig has become, thanks to Wes Anderson's
Grand Budapest Hotel . That movie was inspired by Zweig; and all I can say is, if you liked that movie, or like Zweig, you'll dig the work of these Czechs. If you can find it.
2.
The 20th Century American One-Hit Wonder Resolution.
So many American authors of the last 75 years are known primarily for one great novel or novella. In some cases--Harper Lee--its the author's doing. There just wasn't another book. In other cases--John Knowles, Stephen Crane--the authors went on to write more, but that "more" is not well known. I'd love to see a well publicized compilation of Knowles' and Crane's life's work at a local bookstore.
3.
The Marvel or DC Comics Book of Firsts.
Here's my marketing side speaking. Or asking: Aren't there millions of passionate comic fans who'd pay $20-$40 for a gorgeous hard-bound compilation of the classic "first" issues of significant comic book series--all in one volume? I know that I would.
Okay. Signing off for August now with two announcements:
1. Happy birthday, Mary Shelley.
2. The literary journal  Hobart  is publishing my poetry very soon. Stay tuned for more news on that front. I am very excited about this. It will fuel my positive thoughts today as I read at the beach.

A Belated Recap of the
Zinsky
Reading at the University of Rhode Island
My new bad habit is taking way too long to update this blog. The process of moving on from the 11-year life adventure that is/was  Zinsky
continues apace, and lately it's been manifesting itself in strange ways. Like caring way more about losing weight--and sending selfies like this to my mom--than I do about marketing
Zinsky . (Mom's reply: "Are you going to shave?")
I love my debut novel to pieces. I will treasure it always. I still dream of its finding a larger audience. But I'm now committed to realizing this dream in a slow-burn kind of way. Specifically, this: Working on future books for the rest of my life. Books that I hope I'll come to love as much as I love
Zinsky . And perhaps, over time, those books will help to enhance my reputation as an author, and bring my debut novel the audience I think it warrants.
All this makes it sound like I'm upset with how things turned out for
Zinsky . In truth, I'm elated. I framed my rave reviews from Kirkus, Booklist, and Publishers Weekly. I framed my writeup in the
Boston Globe . I printed out and laminated many of the other glowing reviews the book received, not to mention the countless tweets and emails and messages of support from enthusiastic readers. I'm overwhelmed with gratitude. In fact, not a day goes by where I don't once feel ecstatic about the overall
Zinsky
outcome. My dream came true. My book came out. I did readings at big-time stores.
So what am I driving at here? Well, let's put it like this: Before
Zinsky
came out, I could not possibly imagine wanting one day to move past it. It seemed like the quest of a lifetime. Moving past it, for me, was comparable to a parent moving past her child. Yes, perhaps, you ease up as the child gets older. But your love, your fanaticism, it never really goes away.
But now I see things differently. I can see a new me, 20 years from now, with a few other books out there, viewing Zinsky as a first step, one of several, free from the locked-in obsession one might have for an only child.
And the larger point is that I had a wonderful time reading an excerpt from
Zinsky
at the University of Rhode Island in Kingston. It was more than one month ago now: June 21. The birthday of my mother's mother. I have wanted to blog about it since June 22. But my motivations, right now, are in other places.
Anyway: This came about thanks to one my favorite people and favorite fellow authors, a recent birthday celebrator herself, the one and only Maria Mutch. That's she, all the way on the right, reading from her masterpiece of a debut memoir,
Know the Night .
For the current issue of the
Ocean State Review , which is URI's official literary journal, I interviewed Maria about her book. What a joy that was. Maria had already read
Zinsky , and even though I was technically interviewing her as an assignment, I felt as if our call-and-response in the Q&A contained the ever-gratifying elements of mutual artistic respect. (I'd include a link here, but
OSR , like many print journals, does not put all of its content online. But if you'd like to order one, bang this link
right here .) Maria already knew I loved her book, but I was really happy to make it official in an interview like that, and to have an excuse to ask her strictly literary questions that it's often easier not to dive into with one's author friends. Especially friends who share the sacred bond of the IABEGSLL. (The inaugural and best ever Grub Street Launch Lab. Hooty-hoo!)
Because of the interview, the editors of
OSR
invited me to their two-day writing conference in Kingston. Now that was cool. On Friday, June 20, I took the day off from the day job and hopped the Amtrak to Kingston. I enjoyed a lovely iced coffee on the campus, cold-chilling with Maria before her reading, depicted above. Already, the trip was worthwhile.
That night, I crashed in a URI dorm. There I had a superb conversation for the ages with
Ted Delaney , who teaches writing at nearby Roger Williams and is the author of
several books . We talked of writing, sports, more sports, and more writing, sharing a bottle of wine. It wasn't easy for me to hit the bottle, given my recent dietary initiatives, but on certain occasions you just have to have a few pops to savor the moment. This was one of them.
The next day I had my own reading, during an outdoor lunch on the campus. There I am, sporting my touch of gray, my still-too-beefy biceps, and my prized Brooklyn Poets t-shirt, sporting the name Whitman and the number 55 on the back.
Prior to the reading I enjoyed a great three-person conversation about
Jane Eyre
with professor
Carolyn Betensky
and another conference attendee. Now Carolyn and this attendee know: I seize upon any chance I get to wax on the virtues of
Jane Eyre . The influence of
Jane
on
Zinksy
is so profound, it's almost incalculable. So it was an especial treat to hold this
Jane Eyre
conversation before I read my
Zinsky
excerpt to the gathered crowd. With joy and fervor, we dissected and analyzed every morsel of
Jane Eyre's
first chapter. And then it was oh-so evident, at least to Carolyn and the attendee I shall not name, why I hold
Jane Eyre
so dear: You can hear echoes of
Jane's
voice in  Zinsky's , but it's the sort of thing you only really grasp if you read both of them in rapid succession. Which is to say, most of all, that
Zinsky
is a 19th-century style narrative, a life story, told through selected scenes of bullying and despair, and formative romances.
Doesn't it sound like I had a great time? I did. But the entire time, too, I was aware that it might be my last time rocking the microphone on
Zinsky's
behalf. As of right now, there are no more book-marketing events on my calendar. It's a reality I'm fine with. I had a great time. I'll always remember it fondly.

WHERE TO BUY
ZINSKY THE OBSCURE,
ILAN MOCHARI'S PUSHCART-NOMINATED DEBUT!
Head to the
Zinsky the Obscure
page on Amazon.com
or on
Barnes and Noble.com .
Want to buy it at a bookstore? I wish you could. But now that we're two years past the release date (4/15/13)...and because it was far from a bestseller....they have no reason to stock it.
Still, for the curious, here's a
list of the places that carried it, and took a chance on it, when the time was right.
ACCLAIM
“A powerful debut with Dickensian touches in its heartbreaking and occasionally humorous chronicle of the life of a modern young man.” –
Kirkus Reviews “ This wry debut novel takes on the classic coming-of-age saga, and it makes the reader rethink common assumptions about how young people get from here to there. ”
–
Booklist “ This eloquent novel from Mochari...is both bleak and affecting. ”
–
Publishers Weekly “ Brutally funny....forged from the same literary hearth that has given us such delightful and fussy oddballs as Ignatius J. Reilly, Don Quixote, and Kilgore Trout....this book has the scope of something like Irving's
The World According to Garp . It also has that book's heart.
”
–
DigBoston “A terrific novel, whose pileup of emotional honesty is visceral and powerfully real -- just try to look away.” –

While they numb themselves with the latest celebrity rehab story or the third-world atrocities replayed without ceasing on cable news, he sets out to write his autobiography as an exercise in his own self-medication, recasting himself as the hero in a coming-of-age story. Fans of
A Confederacy of Dunces
and
The Perks of Being a Wallflower
will relate to this tale of overcoming your childhood's traumas, and the world's indifference to them.
