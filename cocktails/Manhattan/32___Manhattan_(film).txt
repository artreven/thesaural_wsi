Schuman carried a frying pan with a shamrock painted on it, which he
said “Brings ’em luck.” Fans were encouraged to bang on the pot with a
spoon to make noise. The pot made a distinctive sound that echoed

Michael Tabor, American Black Panther Party member, died from complications from a stroke he was , 63
Michael Aloysius Tabor
2010) was an American member of the
Black Panther Party
who was charged and tried as part of an alleged
conspiracy
to bomb public buildings in
New York City
and kill members of the
New York Police Department
died from complications from a stroke he was , 63.  Four months into the trial Tabor and another defendant fled to
Algeria . Despite his ultimate
acquittal
on all charges, Tabor remained in exile in
Africa
until his death, never returning to the United States.
(December 13, 1946 – October 17,
Tabor was born on December 13, 1946, in
Harlem
and joined the Black Panther Party while in his teens. In 1970, Tabor
and 12 other members of the Black Panthers were charged for their
involvement in a plot to kill police officers and to plant bombs in New
York City commercial and public buildings, including the
New York Botanical Garden
in the
Bronx .
Support for the prosecution’s case came from undercover officers who
claimed that the defendants had developed plans for a series of bombings
and had conducted classes to instruct those participating in the plot
how to construct explosive devices. [1]
Together with fellow defendant
Richard Moore , Tabor failed to appear at their trial in February 1971, forfeited $150,000 in
bail
and were declared fugitives. Blank Panther leader
Huey P. Newton
called Moore and Tabor “enemies of the people” for evading justice
while on trial and putting the other defendants and the party at risk. [2]
Connie Matthews, Newton’s former secretary and Tabor’s wife, also left
the country and was said to have taken valuable records with her. [2]
The two finally surfaced in Algeria the following month together with
Eldridge Cleaver . [3]
The New York Times
published a lengthy letter from Moore on the day before the verdicts
were read explaining that they had fled the U.S. because they feared
that their lives were at risk. [4]
On May 13, 1971, after an eight-month-long trial, the jury in
New York Supreme Court
in
Manhattan
delivered an acquittal on all 156 counts. [5]
In a statement issued from
Algiers ,
Tabor stated that the trial represented “an attempted railroad and that
the defendants’ rights were flagrantly violated” and said that he was
“overjoyed that the brothers are free”. [1]
Algeria expelled Tabor and he and Matthews moved to
Zambia
in 1972, where Tabor wrote about politics and hosted a radio show.
Despite repeated requests, Tabor refused to return to the United States.
He died at age 63 in
Lusaka ,
Zambia , on October 17, 2010, due to complications of multiple
strokes . He was survived by his second wife, Priscilla Matanda, as well as by a daughter and three sons. [1]

Dennis Taylor,
American saxophonist, died from a
heart attack he was 56,
Dennis Taylor   was a
Nashville -based
musician ,
arranger
and
author
died from a  heart attack he was 56,. Taylor had recording credits on saxophone (alto, tenor and baritone) as well as clarinet, and as an arranger.
(November 13, 1953 – October 17, 2010)
Career
New England
born, Taylor was best known for his recordings with
Delbert McClinton ,
Clarence “Gatemouth” Brown ,
Michelle Shocked ,
Buckwheat Zydeco
and many others, and for writing a series of instructional books through
Hal Leonard
Publishing, in which he discussed blues playing, jazz playing and phrasing. [1]
Taylor played on five
Grammy
nominated albums. He was a two-time nominee for the Nashville Music
Awards, “Miscellaneous Wind Instrumentalist of the Year.” He has
appeared on, “Austin City Limits,” “The Road,” “Country Music Hall of
Fame 25th Anniversary Celebration,” “Texas Connection,” “ABC in Concert
Country,” “American Music Shop,” and “Music City Tonight.” On April 30,
2010, Taylor appeared on the “Imus in the Morning Program” on national
TV and radio. After his solo on the song, “Givin’ It Up for Your Love,”
http://www.youtube.com/v/PxNnEEK6uG0?fs=1&hl=en_US
Taylor’s playing earned the attention and praise of host
Don Imus .
He was also known as a jazz educator. He also analyzed other players’
styles and offered tips for emulating and understanding work from the
masters of the instrument. Some of the sax legends explained by Taylor
include
King Curtis ,
Stanley Turrentine
and
Eddie “Lockjaw” Davis . The final part of “Jazz Saxophone” features 17 solos over classic jazz standards (including
Doxy ,
Easy Living ,
Maiden Voyage
and
So What ) and a wide variety of forms and styles (minor blues,
soul jazz ,
3/4 time , and
bebop . The
theory
lessons cover all the common
major scale ,
minor scale , dominant,
pentatonic
chords and scales plus modes, as well as altered dominant scales and
diminished options. Taylor also wrote other three other instructional
books: Amazing Phrasing, Blues Saxophone and Jazz Saxophone.
Taylor was also an educator, who taught at
Johnson State College
in Vermont, and taught private saxophone lessons in Nashville until the
time of his death. He is survived by both of his parents, as well as
his wife, Nashville songwriter and publicist Karen Leipziger.
“Pinpointing all these idiosyncratic elements in other players is
essential in developing your own voice,” wrote Mr. Taylor, whose own sax
“voice” could vary from a sensuous growl to the kind of buzzing, bluesy
howl he employed on McClinton’s “People Just Love To Talk.” [1]
Critical book review
“(In the book
Amazing Phrasing ) Photos and biographical
information are included for each artist along with a demonstration cd
recording of Dennis Taylor’s written solo. The solos are intended to
closely shadow what the original artist would have played. It is obvious
that Mr. Taylor has made an exhaustive effort in demonstrating all
these many varied styles.” – Skip Spratt [2]
Playing style
“Dennis had an old-school kind of tone that I don’t hear in anyone
else’s playing anymore. He knew how to make it sing, and he had a great
sensibility for what was supposed to happen. He knew what to play, and
he knew what not to play.” –
Kevin McKendree
Singer/songwriter
Todd Snider
said, “He was a free-spirited artist. His playing was so tasteful, and
he was such a warm and good person to be around. What a loss.”
Discography
Mr. Taylor’s first solo recording, which received help from
Kevin McKendree ,
also of McClinton’s band, was completed shortly before his death. The
recording featured saxophone, organ and drums, some of Taylor’s original
compositions, and also a guest appearance by
Delbert McClinton .
Details on the release of the recording have not yet been released. He
has appeared as a side-man on countless albums (see below for partial
list).
His solo album, “Steppin’ Up,” features Taylor on saxophone, McKendree on organ, and three different drummers, including former
Weather Report
drummer
Chester Thompson .
Delbert McClinton
also makes a guest appearance on one song. The album was recorded at
The Rock House in Franklin, TN, and is expected to be released in
January 2011 on Kizybosh Records.

Who is Stephen Gilchrist Glover?
Who is
Stephen Gilchrist Glover ? The entertainment world knows him as
Steve-O. He   is a
daredevil
and television personality. He is
best known as one of the performers on the TV series
Jackass
and
Wildboyz .
//
Early life
Steve-O was born on June 13,
1974 in
London
to an
American
father and a
Canadian
mother. His family was based in England for many years due to his
father’s presidency of the South American division of
Pepsi-Cola .
During his childhood Steve-O lived in a number of countries, including
Brazil
–
speaking his first words in
Portuguese
–
Venezuela ,
and
Uganda ,
where he spent 2 years before returning to the United States. His first
hometown in the
United States
was
Darien, Connecticut
at the age of four. He moved to
Miami
two
years later. When he was nine his family returned to London. He then
spent three years in
Canada
before returning to London once more.
Steve-O graduated from
Leggett
Valley High School
in 1992 before moving to the U.S.
He attended the
University Of Miami
but dropped out after one year due to poor grades and lack of interest
in school. He then attended and graduated from the
Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown
College .
After graduation he was not selected to join the
Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus ,
but worked as a clown in a circus at the
Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop
flea
market. He filmed his stunts, including his clown performances,
throughout this period.
Like fellow
Jackass
star
Bam
Margera , Steve-O is also an avid
heavy metal
fan. He has a
tattoo
of
an inverted
Christian cross
on his left shoulder and a
tattoo of an
Ichthys
with the word “SATAN” in it on his right
shoulder.
Jackass and
tours (2000-2003)
While performing in the flea market circus, Steve-O began sending
videos of himself to
Big Brother Magazine
editor and
future
Jackass
director
Jeff
Tremaine . Tremaine recruited Steve-O for MTV’s television series
Jackass , which became an instant
hit.
From this popularity, MTV decided to release three movies based on the
series:
Jackass: The Movie
(2002) http://www.youtube.com/v/FGTrTyscmvI?fs=1&hl=en_US ,
Jackass Number Two
(2006) http://www.youtube.com/v/gl9GpOdAVIU?fs=1&hl=en_US
and direct-home release
Jackass 2.5
(2007). http://www.youtube.com/v/4VYtkmQ8UOQ?fs=1&hl=en_US
Both
Jackass: The
Movie
and
Jackass Number Two
became
box
office
hits. In 2001, he released
Don’t Try This at
Home
http://www.youtube.com/v/5muq_FBNgcs?fs=1&hl=en_US on DVD, which contained material MTV censored.
It went on to sell 140,000 copies.
He toured promoting the DVD doing stunts, which was filmed and released
as
Don’t Try This at Home Volume 2: The Tour
The tour gained national attention after Steve-O was arrested on July
31, 2002 in
Los Angeles
on
obscenity
and
assault
charges for stapling his
scrotum
to his leg, and for beating a
principal
to a second-degree
battery ,
during a performance at a nightclub in
Houma, Louisiana
on July 11, 2002. After several delays, in March 2003 Steve-O made a deal with Louisiana
prosecutors placing him on supervised
probation
for one year, requiring him to make a charitable donation of $5,000 to a
shelter for battered women and children and forbidding him from ever
performing in
Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana
again.
In 2003, Steve-O toured Europe with Bam Margera. On May 22, 2003
Steve-O was arrested and jailed while in
Sweden
due
to a comment he made during an interview about smuggling drugs into the
country, remarking that he swallowed a condom containing
cannabis
to get it past the authorities. Steve-O reached a
plea
bargain
with the Swedish prosecutors and was released on May 27,
2003 after paying a 45,000
Kronor
(about 6,700
dollars )
fine. As part of the plea bargain Steve-O admitted to possessing one
ecstasy
tablet and five
grams
of
marijuana , although he claimed he had no
knowledge of where the ecstasy came from.
The Swedish arrest was included in the third installment of the DVD
series titled
Steve-O:
Out on Bail . http://www.youtube.com/v/Y_m7DQUNYR8?fs=1&hl=en_US
Two months later on July 19, 2003, Steve-O was arrested on charges of
disorderly conduct
for urinating on
potato chips in public during a
Lollapalooza
tour concert in
Burgettstown, Pennsylvania .
Steve-O claimed he was kicked off the tour by Lollapalooza producers
because of the incident.
Steve-O was again seen urinating in public at the March 5, 2006
Key Club
Party for the
Oscars , urinating on the red
carpet outside the club and then stripping off to his “birthday suit.”
After Jackass
(2004-2007)
After the
Jackass
show ended, he co-starred with
Chris
Pontius
on MTV’s
Wildboyz , which lasted a few seasons until 2006.
The two performed stunts and acts with animals, often putting themselves
in situations for which they are not trained.
In mid 2005, Steve-O launched his own shoe company called Sneaux
Shoes. Television commercials promoting the shoe company include such acts as
Steve-O jumping into garbage, getting his foot bitten by an alligator
and drinking rotten milk. His slogan is “They’re darn good shoes.” http://www.youtube.com/v/a_cdt5mhwz8?fs=1&hl=en_US
On March 27, 2006, Jackass co-stars Steve-O and
Chris
Pontius
visited
The Dean Blundell Show , a morning show on
Toronto radio station
CFNY
(102.1 The Edge), to promote their “ Don’t Try This At
Home ” tour. Steve-O urinated on the floor and performed a stunt
called “Unwrapping the Mummy” all in front of a live studio audience.
Hosts Dean Blundell, Jason Barr, and Todd Shapiro were suspended for the
week following the appearance, after many complaints.
In April 2006, Steve-O later sued manager Nick Dunlap and attorney
Jason Berk accusing them of lying to him to fund their lifestyles.
On July 18, 2006, Steve-O became a late contestant on the British
reality show
Love Island
broadcast on
ITV
from
Fiji
in an
effort to boost ratings. Despite stating he has stopped drinking, he
asked for beer while on the show. On July 19, 2006 he abruptly left
Love
Island
because he was not allowed the beer and chocolate which he
had requested.
In November 2006, he went on a drug binge after being misdiagnosed
with
cardiomyopathy , a serious heart condition.
He was later examined by heart specialists who concluded he was in good
health.
In 2007, Steve-O starred in his own television show called
Dr.
Steve-O
on the
USA Network . In the show, he helped make his
guests cool and “de-wussify” them. That same year he appeared in
Jackass 2.5 , which mainly consisted of
material that didn’t appear in the second
Jackass
movie.
Additionally, he appeared with some
Jackass
alumni in
National Lampoon’s TV: The
Movie . http://www.youtube.com/v/uofA9O622co?fs=1&hl=en_US
On February 5, 2008, Steve-O appeared on
The Howard Stern Show
with
Howard
Stern ,
Robin Quivers
and
Artie
Lange
on Sirius Satellite radio to promote his upcoming rap album
Hard
As a Rock . Another mix-CD released by Steve-O is called
The
Dumbest Asshole In Hip Hop .
Psychiatric problems and
rehab (2008)
On February 23, 2008 Steve-O joined the rest of the Jackass crew for
the
Jackass MTV 24 Hour Takeover ,
which promoted JackassWorld.com. During the live broadcast Steve-O was
kicked out of MTV studios on the request of executives for his behavior
and intoxication. Eventually, he was allowed back in the MTV Studios.
On March 9, 2008, Steve-O’s friends, including co-star
Johnny
Knoxville , physically removed him from his house
and forced him to check into Thalians Mental Health Center due to
ongoing drug abuse problems.
Steve-O was placed on a
72 hour psychiatric hold
which was later lengthened to 14 days due to an alleged suicide
attempt.
In a mass e-mail addressed to his friends, Steve-O expressed that he
previously had thought of his drug abuse and
bipolarity
as a “good thing,” but that he now realizes
that his drug abuse was hurting those he loved most.
On June 4, 2008, Steve-O pleaded guilty to felony possession of
cocaine .
He avoided jail by the successful completion of his treatment program.
In July, after 115 days of sobriety, Steve-O announced he was “back in
the loony bin”.
He returned to the mental institution, he said, because “I’ve had
horrible mood swings and severe
depression . My brain is fucked up
from using so much cocaine,
ketamine ,
PCP ,
nitrous
oxide , and all sorts of other drugs.”
Post-rehab
(2009-2010)
In March 2009, Steve-O was on the 8th season of
Dancing with the Stars ,
paired with
Lacey Schwimmer . After the first week, he
complained of
pinched nerves
and
back spasms
and did not compete in the second
week after injuring his back further by falling on his microphone pack
during
dress rehearsal . The
judges based their scores on his performance at the dress rehearsal.
He was eventually eliminated in the sixth week of the competition.
On May 3, 2009, MTV premiered a documentary titled
Steve-O:
Demise and Rise http://www.youtube.com/v/fkvVcQr6JU4?fs=1&hl=en_US
about how his life was affected by the use of
drugs and alcohol.
The show featured home-made video footage of Steve using drugs and
vandalizing his apartment. In an August 2009 interview with Johnny
Knoxville for
The Times-Picayune , Knoxville on the topic of
Steve-O’s recovery and rehabilitation said “He’s taking to sobriety like
he took to drugs and alcohol, I’m very proud of him. I think we’ll see
him doing some stuff here really soon. As a matter of fact, I know we
are.”
And later stated “Something’s coming. We’re pretty excited”. Later, he
added: “I think it’ll be a big year next year, but I don’t want to talk
about it yet.”
Then in January 2009, Steve-O announced on his website the release of
a new DVD titled
Steve-O: Pounding Out Randoms , of which only
1000 copies have been made.
Steve-O will be part of
Jackass
3D , http://www.youtube.com/v/fKwjU_pSSW4?fs=1&hl=en_US
the third installment of the
Jackass
series. The
movie is in
3D
and started production on January 25, 2010.
In December 2009, Paramount issued a press release that it will be
released October 15, 2010.
In late May 2010, Knoxville has stated that Steve-O’s sobriety is at
its best and “There is no beer on set this time around even if some of
us wish there was”. He also said “And to be honest it’s going great.
Everyone has had different injuries throughout which is a good sign and
Steve-O is probably getting the best footage out of everybody. He is
really going for it. He wants to prove to everyone he can do these
stunts sober. It’s been two years since he had a drink now. Everyone has
been real supportive of him.”

Barbara Billingsley American actress (Leave It to Beaver). died she was , 94,
Barbara Billingsley
[1] [2]
was an American film, television, voice and stage actress, died she was , 94. She gained prominence in the 1950s movie
The Careless Years , acting opposite
Natalie Trundy , followed by her best–known role, that of
June Cleaver
on the television series
Leave It to Beaver
(1957–1963) and its sequel
Still the Beaver
(1985–1988, retitled in season two as
The New Leave It to Beaver ).
(December 22, 1915 – October 16, 2010)
Early life
Billingsley was born
Barbara Lillian Combes
in
Los Angeles, California
in 1915, the youngest child of Anglo–American parents: patrolman Robert Collyer Combes (1891–1950) [3]
and his first wife, the former Lillian Agnes McLaughlin. [4]
She had one elder sibling, Elizabeth (1911–1992). [5]
Her parents divorced sometime before her fourth birthday, and her father, who later became an assistant chief of police, [3]
remarried. [6]
After her divorce, Lillian Combes went to work as a forelady at a knitting mill. [7]
Billingsley fell in love with drama in the second grade, and during her years at George Washington High School in
Los Angeles
(now
Washington Preparatory High School ), she performed in all the school plays. She was voted “Class Queen”. She graduated from George Washington in 1934. [ citation needed ]
Name change
Until 1941, the actress used the name Barbara Combes. After 1941,
when she married her first husband, Glenn Billingsley, she used
Barbara Billingsley .
Starting out
After attending
Los Angeles Junior College
for one year, Billingsley traveled to Broadway, when
Straw Hat ,
a revue in which she was appearing, attracted enough attention to send
it to New York. When, after five days, the show closed, she took an
apartment on 57th Street and went to work as a $60–a–week
fashion model . She also landed a contract with
MGM Studios
in 1945.
She usually had uncredited roles in major motion picture productions
in the 1940s. These roles continued into the first half of the 1950s
with
The Bad and the Beautiful ,
Three Guys Named Mike , opposite
Jane Wyman , as well as the sci-fi story
Invaders from Mars
(1953). Her film experience led to roles on the
sitcoms
Professional Father
(with
Stephen Dunne
and
Beverly Washburn ) and
The Brothers
as well as an appearance with
David Niven
on his anthology series
Four Star Playhouse . In 1957, she guest starred in the episode “That Magazine” of the
CBS
sitcom
Mr. Adams and Eve , starring
Howard Duff
and
Ida Lupino . She co–starred opposite
Dean Stockwell
and
Natalie Trundy
in
The Careless Years , which was her first and only major role in the movies.

http://www.youtube.com/v/E4j1dGrdo4E?fs=1&hl=en_US
http://www.youtube.com/v/OO7VtZ-dhJk?fs=1&hl=en_US
In 1952, Billingsley had her first guest–starring role on an episode of
The Abbott and Costello Show . The part led to other roles on
The Lone Wolf , two episodes of
City Detective ,
The Pride of the Family ,
Schlitz Playhouse of Stars ,
Letter to Loretta ,
General Electric Summer Originals ,
You Are There ,
Cavalcade of America ,
Panic! ,
Mr. Adams and Eve ,
The Love Boat ,
Silver Spoons ,
Parker Lewis Can’t Lose ,
Mike Hammer ,
Empty Nest , among many others. She reprised her
June Cleaver
role three times, in
Amazing Stories ,
Baby Boom
and
Roseanne . She also guest-starred on an episode of
Make Room For Daddy ,
in which Thomas’s character is a widower. The producers reportedly
considered casting her as his second wife, but later decided against it,
and
Marjorie Lord
eventually got the role.
Leave It to Beaver
After Billingsley signed a contract with
Universal Studios
in 1957, she made her mark on TV as everyday mother
June Cleaver
on
Leave It to Beaver , alongside other 1950s family sitcoms such as
Father Knows Best ,
The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet ,
Make Room For Daddy
and
The Donna Reed Show . It debuted on
CBS
in 1957, to mediocre ratings and was soon cancelled. However, the show moved to
ABC
the following year and stayed there for the next five seasons. The show was featured in over 100 countries. Also starring on
Beaver
were
Hugh Beaumont , in the role of
Ward Cleaver , June’s husband and the kids’ father, as well as
child actors
Tony Dow
in the role of
Wally Cleaver
and
Jerry Mathers
as
Theodore “Beaver” Cleaver .
In the show, Billingsley often could be seen doing household chores
wearing pearls and earrings. The pearls, which in real-life were
Billingsley’s trademark, were in turn her idea to have her alter ego
wear on television. The actress had what she termed “a hollow” on her
neck [3] [8]
and thought that wearing a strand of white pearls would lighten it up
for the cameras. In later seasons, she started wearing high heels to
compensate for the fact that the actors who played her sons were growing
up and getting taller than she was. [3] [9]
So associated was the pearl necklace with the character, that an entire
episode of the sequel series dealt with the necklace when lost.
Billingsley had one regret about the show’s lasting success:
residual payments
ended after six reruns in standard 1950s actors’ contracts. [10]
“She was the ideal mother,” Billingsley said of her character in 1997 in
TV Guide .
“Some people think she was weakish, but I don’t. She was the love in
that family. She set a good example for what a wife could be. I had two
boys at home when I did the show. I think the character became kind of
like me and vice versa. I’ve never known where one started and where one
stopped.” As for the idealized TV family on “Leave It to Beaver,” which
continues in reruns on cable more than half a century after its debut,
Billingsley had her own explanation for the Cleavers’ enduring appeal.
“Good grief,” she told
TV Guide ,
“I think everybody would like a family like that. Wouldn’t it be nice
if you came home from school and there was Mom standing there with her
little apron and cookies waiting?” Billingsley, however, did question
her character’s reactions to the Cleaver children’s misbehavior, basing
her concern on personal experience as the mother of two sons. As
co-producer Joseph Connelly explained, “In scenes where she’s mad at the
boys, she’s always coming over to us with the script and objecting. ‘I
don’t see why June is so mad over what Beaver’s done. I certainly
wouldn’t be.’ As a result, many of Beaver’s crimes have been rewritten
into something really heinous like lying about them, in order to give
his mother a strong motive for blowing her lady-like stack.” [11]
After six seasons and 234 episodes, the popular series was canceled
due to the cast’s desire to move on to other projects, especially
Mathers, who retired from acting to enter his freshman year in high
school. The younger actor considered Billingsley a mentor, second mother
and a close professional friend:
As I say, Barbara was always, though, a true role model for me. She
was a great actress. And a lot of people, you know, when they see her
talk jive talk, they always go she can do other things besides be a mom
on
Leave It to Beaver.
And I tell them,
Airplane!
(1980), she’s been a great comedian all her life. And in a lot of ways, just like
All in the Family,
we kind of stifled her, because her true talent didn’t really come out in
Leave it To Beaver.
She was like the straight woman, but she has an awful lot of talent.
After the show’s cancellation, Mathers remained her close friend for over 45 years. They were reunited on
The New Leave It to Beaver . Billingsley, Mathers, Dow,
Frank Bank
and
Ken Osmond
also celebrated the show’s 50th anniversary together.
After
Beaver
When production of the show ended in 1963, Billingsley had become
typecast
as saccharine sweet and had trouble obtaining acting jobs for years.
She traveled extensively abroad until the late 1970s. After an absence
of 17 years from the public eye (other than appearing in two episodes of
The F.B.I.
in 1971), Billingsley spoofed her wholesome image with a brief appearance in the comedy
Airplane!
(1980), as a passenger who could
“speak
jive “ . She became the voice of Nanny and The Little Train on
Muppet Babies
from 1984 to 1991.
Billingsley appeared with
Robin Williams
and
Pam Dawber
in a 1982 episode of
Mork & Mindy . [12]
She appeared in a
Leave It to Beaver
reunion television movie entitled
Still the Beaver
in 1983.
Hugh Beaumont
had died the year before of a heart attack, so she played the
widow . She also appeared in the subsequent revival of the series,
The New Leave It to Beaver
(1985–1989). In the
1997 film
version of
Leave It to Beaver , Billingsley played the character “Aunt Martha”. In 1995, she appeared with other “TV Moms” on
Roseanne . In 1998, she appeared on
Candid Camera , along with
June Lockhart
and
Isabel Sanford , as audience members in a spoof seminar on motherhood.
On October 4, 2007, she and her surviving castmates,
Jerry Mathers ,
Tony Dow ,
Ken Osmond
and
Frank Bank , were reunited on
ABC ‘s
Good Morning America , to celebrate
Leave It to Beaver’ s 50th anniversary. According to interviewer
Tom Bergeron , both of Billingsley’s co-stars, Mathers and Osmond, currently get financial advice from another co-star, Bank.
On May 6, 2008, hospitalized at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center , she was unable to attend the Academy Leonard Goldenson Theatre in
North Hollywood, California , where the Academy of Television Arts & Science presented “A Salute to TV Moms.”
Personal life
Billingsley was married to:
Glenn Billingsley, Sr. (1912–1984), a restaurateur who was a nephew of
Sherman Billingsley , the owner of the
Stork Club . [13]
Her husband’s businesses included Billingsley’s Golden Bull,
Billingsley’s Bocage, and the Outrigger Polynesian restaurants in Los
Angeles, and a Stork Club in Key West, Florida, where the couple lived
briefly after their marriage in 1941 (divorced 1947). [1] [13]
They had two sons, Drew and Glenn, Jr., who now own and operate Billingsley’s Steak House in
West Los Angeles ,
California , which was formerly their father’s original Golden Bull restaurant. [2]
By this marriage, the actress was related to actor/producer
Peter Billingsley .
Roy Kellino
(1912–1956), a British-born movie director who had previously been married to British actress
Pamela Mason . He and Billingsley were married from 1953 until his death.
Dr. William S. Mortensen (1907–1981), whom she married in 1959. [14]
By this marriage, she had stepchildren; the oldest was William
Mortensen, Jr., retired Chairman of the Board of old First Federal of
Santa Monica [15]
Death
Billingsley died of
polymyalgia
at her home in
Santa Monica, California
on October 16, 2010, at the age of 94. [16]
She is interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California. [17]

Eyedea American rapper and musician (Eyedea & Abilities) died from he was ,opiate toxicity 28,
Micheal Larsen [1]
, known by his stage name
Eyedea , was a well-known
freestyle battle
champion and underground rapper died from he was ,opiate toxicity  28,. His notable wins included the televised
Blaze Battle
sponsored by
HBO
(2000) and a victory at
Scribble Jam
(1999). He had appeared as a solo artist, and as the
emcee
half of the duo
Eyedea & Abilities
(along with longtime friend and collaborator
DJ Abilities ). His non-battle rhymes were generally
philosophically
or
thematically
based, and often told a definite
narrative .
(November 9, 1981 – October 16, 2010)
Biography
http://www.youtube.com/v/z9-eKhCukW8?fs=1&hl=en_US For much of his youth, Eyedea lived with his mother, Kathy, just east of Downtown
Saint Paul ,
Minnesota , where he attended
Highland Park Senior High School . [1]
Eyedea became known as a battle emcee, touring the circuit between
1997 and 2001. During this time he won top prizes at Scribble Jam ’99,
the
Rock Steady
Anniversary 2000, and Blaze Battle New York 2000. He contributed a track to the
anticon.
compilation, Music for the Advancement of Hip Hop. Additionally, he toured extensively as second emcee and support
DJ
for
Atmosphere .
http://www.youtube.com/v/40MA0pl7Oa0?fs=1&hl=en_US
In 2001, he released
First Born
with his partner
DJ Abilities
(collectively, they were initially called the Sixth Sense, but they are now known as
Eyedea & Abilities ). In 2002, under his pen name “Oliver Hart”, he released the self-produced
The Many Faces of Oliver Hart . In 2004, he and Abilities reunited to release the self-titled album
E&A
(released March 23, 2004).
All of Eyedea’s releases have been on the
Rhymesayers
record label, with the exception of Carbon Carousel’s “The Some of All
Things or: The Healing Power of Scab Picking”, which was released on his
own independent label, Crushkill Recordings. In addition to touring
independently and with Rhymesayers labelmates and members of Face Candy,
Eyedea and Abilities participated in the

Who Killed the Robots?
tour, titled by Eyedea.
He was signed to Rhymesayers Entertainment, and collaborated with
Slug
of the underground hip hop group
Atmosphere , as well as
Sage Francis ,
Aesop Rock , and
Blueprint .
After Eyedea released “This Is Where We Were,” recorded with his live
freestyle/jazz group Face Candy, he created Carbon Carousel, an
alternative rock band. They have released one EP titled “The Some of All
Things or: The Healing Power of Scab Picking”. This brought on
speculation that Eyedea & Abilities were no longer together.
However, in August 2007, the duo announced on their Myspace that they
would be at the Twin Cities Celebration of Hip Hop performing old songs,
as well as new material.
In December 2007, Eyedea & Abilities embarked upon their Appetite
for Distraction Tour with Crushkill labelmate Kristoff Krane and
Minnesotan
duo Sector7G.
The summer of 2009 saw Eyedea & Abilities joining the touring hip hop festival

for a limited amount of dates, performing alongside such acts as
Sage Francis ,

M.O.P.
and
the Knux . E&A also performed at the first
Rock the Bells
concert in 2004, infamous for being
Ol’ Dirty Bastard ‘s last performance with
The Wu-Tang Clan .
Eyedea died in his sleep on October 16, 2010. He was found dead by his mother, according to friends. [2]
Cause of death was released November 18, 2010 and ruled an accident,
from opiate toxicity, ( Opioid
toxicity:
The toxic reaction of the body to the substance,
possibly via allergic reaction or overdose.)

according to the Ramsey County medical examiner’s
