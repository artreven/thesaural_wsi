HIDE TEXT
Early life
Vartan was born in
Boulogne-Billancourt , Hauts-de-Seine, France, the son of Doris
(née Pucher), a painter and artist,
and Eddie Vartan, a musician. [3] [4]
His paternal aunt is singer
Sylvie Vartan
and his stepfather is writer
Ian La Frenais . [5]
Vartan's
Bulgarian -born father was of
Armenian , Bulgarian, and
Hungarian
ancestry, [6] [7]
and Vartan's American mother is
Jewish
and originally from
Poland . [8] [9] [10]
Vartan has said about his French background that "The funny thing is
I'm actually a Polish Jew who
happens to be born in France. My mom is
Polish and my dad is Bulgarian. I don't have an ounce of French blood.
But I work it". [8] [11]
He has stated that he tends to be considered a Frenchman in the United
States and an American in France. [12]
His parents divorced when he was
five and he moved to
America
with his mother. [13]
He moved back to France to be with his father
until his high school
years, and grew up a "farm kid" in a "simple environment" [10]
in
Fleury, Manche , a small town in
Normandy . [13] [14]
At the age of eighteen, Vartan moved back in with his mother in Los
Angeles, telling her that he wanted to be an artist, [15]
because he did not wish to fulfill the
mandatory military service
required in France. [10]
In Los Angeles,
he attended an acting school after he was told he
possessed acting talent. He had also attended the prestigious
Lycée Français de Los Angeles . Vartan now considers himself to be
American and stated on the talk show
Rove
that he would like
Australia to be his second home. [16]
He is
bilingual , speaking both English and French fluently. [17]
Career
After starring roles in European

(1999),
One Hour Photo
(2002) and
Monster-in-Law
(2005). [16]
In 2007, he appeared in the Australian horror film

and starred in the film

date has been as

Tom Selleck 's character's son) and
Ally McBeal
(as Jonathan Basset). He also appeared on the show
Kitchen Confidential , which starred his former
Alias
co-star
Bradley Cooper , as a French chef who was Cooper's rival. In
September 2007, Vartan played James Walker,
a main role in the
ABC
drama
Big Shots . However, the show was canceled after one season.
Vartan is co-starring opposite
Jada Pinkett Smith
in
TNT 's series
Hawthorne . Vartan replaced
Jeffrey Nordling ,
who played the role in the pilot. [18]
Personal life
Vartan at the 23rd Genesis
Awards, Beverly Hills, California, March 28, 2009
Over the course of his
relationship with
Alias
co-star
Jennifer Garner , he never made any public appearances with her.
Garner confirmed their relationship in August 2003. [19]
Vartan began dating Garner in mid-2003, and though rumors of their
break-up
began in March 2004, [20]
Garner only confirmed the end of their relationship in August 2004. [21] [22]
On March 5, 2010,
he announced his engagement to Lauren Skaar, whom he
met in a
Whole Foods Market
parking lot in Los Angeles in 2009. [23]
The couple married on April 2, 2011 at the Pelican Hill Resort in
Newport Beach, California . [24]
Vartan is a keen supporter of
Australian rules football , having watched the game on numerous
visits to Australia,
in particular Melbourne. He is good friends with
Brendan Fevola
and supports
Carlton . [25]
After the completion of the film
Rogue , Vartan got a Southern Cross tattoo on his right arm to show
his love for Australia. [26]

2006, 2007, and 2008. 2009 was the first year in which he did not
receive an Emmy Award nomination for his work on
Entourage .
Piven was also the star and producer of the short-lived ABC dramedy
series
Cupid , and was a supporting cast member on the last three
seasons of the sitcom
Ellen . He played the part of Ellen's cousin, Spence. He also
voiced
Elongated Man
in three episodes of
Justice League Unlimited .
In 2007, Piven appeared in the
video for "Drivin' Me Wild", the third single taken from rapper
Common 's seventh album
Finding Forever . The two were co-stars in
Smokin' Aces , and appeared together when Piven hosted
SNL
in January 2007. [7]
Piven appeared in the first
Broadway revival of
David Mamet 's
Speed-the-Plow , co-starring
Mad Men
star
Elisabeth Moss
and three-time
Tony
nominee
Raul Esparza . The production began preview performances on October
3, 2008, and opened on October 23, 2008; the play was due to run
through February 22, 2009. After Piven missed several performances, on
December 17, 2008, Piven's rep announced that due to an undisclosed
illness, Piven would be ending his run in the play effective
immediately. [8]
The illness was revealed to be
hydrargaria , a disease caused by exposure to
mercury
or its compounds, though the source is unknown. Rumours
have indicated that the high level of mercury could potentially have
been caused by Piven's habit of consuming fish twice a day for the
past 20 years. [9]
An alternative explanation is that the herbal remedies Piven was
taking were responsible for his high levels of mercury. [10]
Mamet joked that Piven was leaving the play "to pursue a career as a
thermometer." [11]
On September 1, 2009, Piven, in a guest appearance on
Late Show with David Letterman , explained that he had given up
red meat and poultry, and had been getting all of his protein from
fish for the past 20 years.
William H. Macy
and
Norbert Leo Butz
replaced Piven in the Broadway show. [12]
Personal life
Piven considers himself a
Jewish Buddhist . [13]
He starred in the
Travel Channel
special
Jeremy Piven's Journey of a Lifetime
detailing his journey across India.

worker. [6]
He was raised in
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , and had said that
the experience still shapes and affects his character. [7]
His parents divorced when he was young. Gosling was taken out of
elementary school and
homeschooled
because of being harassed and picked on in elementary
school. [8]
Gosling dropped out of high
school at age 17. He then moved to New Zealand, where he worked on the
series
Young Hercules
for two years, with the company that created
Xena, Warrior Princess . [9]
Career
Gosling was a cast member on the
hit show
The Mickey Mouse Club
alongside fellow stars;
Britney Spears ,
Christina Aguilera ,
Justin Timberlake ,
J.C. Chasez , and
Keri Russell . He was part of the last set of new

Road to Avonlea
and
Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy . [10]
He starred in the Canadian television show
Breaker High , which aired on YTV in Canada and UPN in the
United States from 1997 to 1998. Then from 1998–1999 Gosling starred
in
Young Hercules
which was shot on location in New Zealand. The
show told the tale of
Hercules
as a teenager while he learned his warrior skills at a
training academy. [11]
In 2000, he got his breakout role in
Remember the Titans
as Alan Bosley, working alongside
Denzel Washington .
Gosling has had no formal
training as an actor. His fame spread to the United States after he
starred in the 2001 controversial drama
The Believer ,
which won the Grand Jury Prize at the
Sundance Film Festival . [12]
In 2002 Gosling's film,
The Slaughter Rule , showcased at
Sundance Film Festival [13]
and
Murder by Numbers
screened out of competition at the 2002
Cannes Film Festival . [14]
Then back to the
Sundance Film Festival
in 2003 for
The United States of Leland , [15]
which also starred
Don Cheadle
and
Kevin Spacey . He also briefly met
Michelle Williams
the first time while on set: she played his
character's girlfriend,
Jena Malone 's sister.
Gosling won the Best Actor
category at the

drug-addicted , junior high school history teacher in the 2006 film

in Derek Cianfrance's directorial debut,
Blue Valentine , taking the director 12 years to make. [19]
Blue Valentine
premiered at the 2010
Sundance Film Festival
as one of 16 films selected from 1,058

screenplay won the 2006 Chrysler Film Project contest, which came with
$1 million of funding. [21]

Following those three festivals, the film has since been screened at
various festivals around the world. [24]
Gosling and Williams promoted their film and also shared the cover of
W Magazine
October 2010 issue. [25]
The authentic chemistry in the raw emotionally driven film affected
both actors, "Most movies when you're acting you're trying to block
out the lights and the trailers. Here, you had to remind yourself you
were making a film," says Gosling. "Michelle and I found it hard to
take off our wedding bands when it was over. We'd built this castle
and then had to tear it down." [26]
In 2010, Ryan Gosling narrated
Phillip Montgomery’s
ReGeneration , a documentary that explores
the widespread cynicism in today’s youth and young adults, and the
influences that perpetuate our culture's apathetic view towards social
and political causes. Gosling also produced the documentary along with
Anonymous Content’s Matt DeRoss and Engine 7 Films’ Joel Goulder and
Jeremy Goulder. Montgomery said, "It is an honor to work with one of
the most talented and intelligent artists of our generation. As a
socially conscious individual himself, Ryan brings an inspired
freshness to the films core message of hope and action. There is truly
no better voice to guide us through this film." [27]
Ryan Gosling will be co-starring
in
Crazy, Stupid, Love
with
Steve Carell ,
Julianne Moore ,
Kevin Bacon ,
Emma Stone ,
Marisa Tomei ,
Analeigh Tipton , and
Josh Groban . The film is being distributed by
Warner Brothers [28] [29]
and is set for theatrical release in July 29, 2011. [30]
In September 2010, Gosling began
filming on the independent feature,
Drive , by Danish director
Nicolas Winding Refn . The film co-stars
Carey Mulligan ,
Bryan Cranston , and
Ron Perlman . [31]
FilmDistrict picked up distribution rights [32]
and will release it on September 16, 2011. [33]
Gosling even built the car used in the film during production for a
more authentic performance as a stunt driver and wheelman.
Gosling is also scheduled to star
in the
George Clooney -directed film version of
Beau Willimon 's award-winning
play,
Farragut North , now known as
The Ides of March . [34] Sony
Pictures Entertainment
has set
The Ides of March
for a
release date of October 14, 2011. [35]

up with director Derek Cianfrance for the film
The Place Beyond the
Pines [36]
and director
Nicolas Winding Refn
to shoot a remake of
Logan’s Run
which
will be distributed by
Warner Brothers . [37]
Personal Life
Gosling with
Emily Blunt
at amfAR's Cinema Against AIDS Gala in May 2010.
Gosling dated actress
Rachel McAdams , whom he met during the filming of
The Notebook , from 2004 to February 2007. The relationship was
popular in both the media and amongst fans, even being mentioned in
the popular
Saturday Night Live
sketch " Lazy
Sunday ", in the lyrics "I love these cupcakes like McAdams loves
Gosling". He has stated that he has encountered many fans who took the
news of their breakup as hard as he and McAdams did and would be
forced to console them. Of the relationship, Gosling said the
following to
GQ Magazine
in 2007: "I mean, God bless
The Notebook ...
It introduced me to one of the great loves of my life. But people do
Rachel and me a disservice by assuming we were anything like the
people in that movie. Rachel and my love story is a hell of a lot more
romantic than that." [38]
Of their actual breakup, Gosling has also remarked, "The only thing I
remember is we both went down swingin' and we called it a draw." [39]
Gosling has always been
supportive of various causes, working closely with
John Prendergast , who is Co-Founder of the
Enough Project . [40]
He was a Hollywood's representative at the
Campus Progress National
Conference
and spoke out about
Darfur . [41]
Gosling said, "For some reason, there's an interest in what people who
do what I do have to say. I don't particularly have that much to say
... but I do have these experiences that I can relay. I'm honored to
have these experiences." [42]
In December 2010 Ryan Gosling traveled with Enough Project Co-founder
John Prendergast
and Enough field analyst Fidel Bafilemba to
eastern Congo. [43]
During their visit to Goma and other areas of North Kivu province,
Gosling met with civil society organizations, human rights defenders,
and survivors of the ongoing violent conflict, the deadliest in the
world. Through the collection of original video footage Gosling
intends to cast a spotlight on their stories of courage, survival, and
hope. [44]
In 2008, Gosling endorsed
Barack Obama 's presidential campaign. [45]
Gosling is one of
GQ Magazine 's
2010 Men of the Year, as "Contender of the Year". [46]
Dead Man's Bones
Dead Man's Bones
is a multi-musical duo between Ryan Gosling and
Zach Shields. When Shields and Gosling met in 2005 they discovered a
mutual obsession with ghosts and decided to write love stories about
ghosts and monsters. The pair chose to play all the instruments on the
record, even those they had never touched before. They also imposed
rules on themselves during the recording process, like not playing
with a click track, or trying to do no more than three takes on any
song, letting any imperfections highlight the strengths of the music. [47]
On December 25, 2008,
Dead Man's Bones
released a music video and free download for
their song "In The Room Where You Sleep," [48]
and on April 4, 2009, the band released another music video for their
song "Name In Stone" on
MySpace
and
YouTube . The self-titled debut album from the band, featuring
members of the
Silverlake Conservatory of Music 's children's choir, was released
on October 6, 2009 through
ANTI-
records and was produced by Tim Anderson of I’m A Robot. [49]
Gosling and Shields also toured [50]
around
North America
for fall/Halloween 2009 [51]
with a local choir and talent show at every show to rave reviews. [52]
Each children's choir was similar to the LA group, Silverlake
Conservatory Children's Choir, which they recorded with on the album. [53]
In 2010, they released two other music videos for tracks: "Dead
Hearts" [54]
and "Pa Pa Power". [55]
