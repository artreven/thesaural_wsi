The Irish Breakfast, Redux
Happy St. Patrick’s Day. In honor of the holiday,
a reprint of a post last year :
I was in Boston a week or so ago and after getting accosted by Occupy Boston I stopped into one of the many Boylston Street brunch joints for an  Irish Breakfast  and (what else for breakfast?) a  Manhattan . I snagged a seat at a window table where I could blog and also people-watch and camped for two hours.
It appears the meal is a triumph of expert-testimony marketing:
“The full breakfast traditionally comprises several fried foods, usually including bacon and eggs, and is popular throughout the British Isles and other parts of the English-speaking world. The name “bacon and eggs” was popularised by Edward Bernays in the 1920s. To promote sales of bacon, he conducted a survey of physicians and reported their recommendations that people eat hearty breakfasts. He sent the results of the survey to 5,000 physicians, along with publicity touting bacon and eggs as a hearty breakfast.”
I doubly recommend the breakfast Manhattan. If you are a bruncher as is common among American SWPLs, it will stand out as manly and distinctive amongst the Mimosa and Bellini drinkers.

Yer wants a half-pint mug o’ builders’ tea (stewed, with milk, & as much sugar as you can choke down). One with blue&white stripes, refilled as necessary.
For afters, if it wasn’t illegal now, Capstans or Senior Service (stubbed out in the remains of the egg) and a couple of pints of stout. “Racing Post” on table unnecessary, as Cheltenham’s over .

Ironic how educated liberals exercise+cook for themselves, but insist that the poor couldn't be expected to do the same. 				 1 year ago

RT @ PlayDangerously : Imagine a man said, "Sitting down at dinner with your family is beta." We'd laugh that guy out of the movement. 				 1 year ago
