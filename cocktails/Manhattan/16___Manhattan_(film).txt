1984–2004: Early life Life and career
Songz was born November 28, 1984 in  Petersburg, Virginia . [1] Raised a  military brat , Songz did not have aspirations to have a musical career as a child due to his shyness, saying “Singing wasn’t a reality for me, until other people started noticing I sounded good.” [2]
He recognized his vocal abilities at the age of 14 in 1998. [2]
Reluctant to sing, he began performing with encouragement by friends and family in high school. Record producer Troy Taylor
discovered Songz during a  talent show
in 2000, which led him to signing a recording contract with  Atlantic Records
in 2002. [2]
After graduating from high school in 2002, Songz moved to  New Jersey
to begin recording his debut album, though recording didn’t actually begin until 2003. [1]
2004–2006:  I Gotta Make It
While recording his debut album in 2004, Songz released multiple mixtapes under the alias  Prince of Virginia . [1]
One of the mixtapes featured an “answer track” to  R. Kelly ‘s “ Trapped in the Closet “, entitled “Open the Closet”. The song gave Trey some notoriety. [3]
His debut album,  I Gotta Make It
was released on July 26, 2005. [4]
It debuted at #20 on the  Billboard
200 , selling 40,000 copies in its first week of sales. [5]

http://o.aolcdn.com/videoplayer/AOL_PlayerLoader.swf was released in July of 2005 and reached #67 on the Hot 100 and #11 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming even more successful than his debut single in the R&B/urban community and in the mainstream community.

2007–2008:  Trey Day
In mid-2006, Songz began work on a follow-up album to his debut with longtime collaborator  Troy Taylor
and also employed hitmakers  Bryan-Michael Cox ,  Danja ,  Stargate (production team)
and  R. Kelly
to help create the album. Trey aimed for the album to be more mainstream-oriented than his debut album.
His second studio album,  Trey Day , was released on October 2, 2007. The album reached #11 on the Billboard
200 , [6]
selling 73,000 copies in its first week. It has since sold 400,000 records in the US, becoming his second album not to be certified by the RIAA. The album was going to be released on May 8, 2007, but was continually delayed in order for a successful single to precede the album, as the lead single failed to impact charts.
His sophomore album was preceded by the lead single, “ Wonder Woman “,
http://www.youtube.com/v/IpH3lqDsQ1E?fs=1&hl=en_US
which was released in February of 2007. It reached #54 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, but failed to impact the Hot 100. Because of the single’s failure, his second album was delayed from May 2007 to October 2007. The album’s second single, “ Can’t Help but Wait “,
http://www.youtube.com/v/uE7uc9Q7GE8?fs=1&hl=en_US
was released in August of 2007 and was released to promote his second album and the film  Step Up 2 the Streets
soundtrack as a single for it. The single reached #14 on the Hot 100, and #2 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It became Songz’s first Top 20 hit on the Hot 100, and helped to boost his second album’s sales. The single was also nominated for  Best Male R&B Vocal Performance
at the 2008  50th Grammy Awards .
The third single from the album, “ Last Time “,

2009–2010:  Ready

and  Troy Taylor
and aimed for the record to be more mature than his first two. Before releasing his third album, Songz released a mixtape titled  Anticipation
in June of 2009 through his blog, which featured songs from his third album. [8]
Another mixtape from Trey was released in the summer of 2009, called Genesis .  Genesis
was a collection of Trey Songz’s first recordings when he was fifteen years old and was released to show his fans the dedication that he had to making a record when he was young. [9]
Trey released his third studio album,  Ready , on August 31, 2009. The album reached #3 on the  Billboard
200 , selling 131,000 copies in its first week. [10]
These are his best first week sales to date and the album was his first to reach the Top 10 on the Billboard 200. The album has since sold over 800,000 records in the US, earning a Gold certification from the RIAA in February of 2010, becoming his first album to be certified by the RIAA.
The lead single from the album, “ I Need a Girl “,

Joseph Sobran American political writer, died from diabetes he was 64
Michael Joseph Sobran, Jr.   was an American journalist and writer, formerly with
National Review
and a syndicated columnist died from diabetes he was 64. He was born in
Ypsilanti ,
Michigan .
(February 23, 1946 – September 30, 2010)
Academic and professional career
Sobran graduated from
Eastern Michigan University
and received a
Bachelor of Arts
in
English . He studied for a graduate degree in English, concentrating on
Shakespearean
studies, following his graduation. In the late 1960s, Sobran lectured
on Shakespeare and English on a fellowship with the university.
In 1972, Sobran began working at
William F. Buckley Jr. ‘s
National Review
magazine. (During the 1970s, he frequently used the byline M.J.
Sobran.) He stayed 21 years, 18 as senior editor, before being removed
from the publication amidst controversial charges.
Along with his work at
National Review ,
Sobran spent 21 years as a commentator on the
CBS Radio
“Spectrum” program series and was a syndicated columnist, first with the
Los Angeles Times , and later with the
Universal Press Syndicate . In 2007, his newsletter discontinued distribution by the U.S. mail.
http://www.youtube.com/v/-NJZ3FZ4iiw?fs=1&hl=en_US
Sobran wrote a column for the
Catholic
newsweekly
The Wanderer
entitled
Washington Watch
from 1986 to 2007. He also had a monthly column that appears in
Catholic Family News .
He wrote the “Bare Bodkin” column for
Chronicles . Additionally, his essays have appeared in
The Human Life Review ,
Celebrate Life! , and
The Free Market . Sobran was media fellow of the
Ludwig von Mises Institute . [1]
Sobran was named the
Constitution Party ‘s vice presidential nominee in 2000, but withdrew in April 2000 citing scheduling conflicts with his journalistic commitments.
[2]
In 2001 and 2003 Sobran spoke at conferences organized by
Holocaust denier
David Irving , [3]
sharing the podium with
Paul Fromm ,
Charles D. Provan , and
Mark Weber , director of the
Institute for Historical Review . In 2002 he spoke at the Institute for Historical Review’s annual conference. [4]
Referring to his appearance at IHR conferences, historian
Deborah Lipstadt
wrote, “Mr. Sobran may not have been an unequivocal [Holocaust] denier, but he gave support and comfort to the worst of them.” [5] Writing in the
National Review ,
Matthew Scully
said, “His appearance before that sorry outfit a few years ago …
remains impossible to explain, at least if you’re trying to absolve
him.” [6]
National Review
controversy
Further information:
Neoconservatism and paleoconservatism
Sobran was fired from
National Review
in 1993 and was accused of being an
anti-Semite
(most notably by
Norman Podhoretz ). Podhoretz wrote that “Joe Sobran’s columns … [are] anti-Semitic in themselves, and not merely ‘contextually. ‘ ”
Buckley disagreed with Podhoretz’s accusation, noting that he “deemed
Joe Sobran’s six columns contextually anti-Semitic. By this I mean that
if he had been talking, let us say, about the lobbying interests of the
Arabs or of the Chinese, he would not have raised eyebrows as an
anti-Arab or an anti-Chinese.” [7]
One such comment was that the
New York Times
“really ought to change its name to
Holocaust Update. “ [8]
Sobran claimed that founder William F. Buckley told him to “stop antagonizing the Zionist crowd,” and Buckley accused him of
libel
and moral incapacitation. [9]
Sobran also complained of “a more or less official national obsession with a tiny, faraway socialist
ethnocracy .” [10]
At the time of his dismissal from
National Review , Sobran wrote that Buckley
kowtowed
to the liberal
Manhattan
social elite. Shortly after Buckley’s death in 2008, Sobran wrote that
the two had reconciled: “My employment ended unhappily, much to my
regret now, but I rejoice to say we patched things up a year or so ago.” [11]
Political philosophy
Through much of his career, Sobran identified as a
paleoconservative
and supported strict interpretation of the
U.S. Constitution . In 2002 Sobran announced his philosophical and political shift to libertarianism ( paleolibertarian
anarcho-capitalism ) citing inspiration by theorists
Murray Rothbard
and
Hans-Hermann Hoppe . [12]
He has referred to himself as a “theo-anarchist.” [13]
Sobran said
Catholic
teachings are consistent with his opposition to
abortion
and the
Iraq War . He also argued that the
9/11 attacks
were a result of the U.S. government’s policies regarding the
Middle East . He claimed those policies are formed by the “Jewish-Zionist powers that be in the United States.” [14]
Books and other publications
Sobran was the author of many books, including one about William Shakespeare,
Alias Shakespeare: Solving the Greatest Literary Mystery of All Time
(1997), wherein he endorsed the aberrant
Oxfordian theory
that
Edward de Vere , the 17th Earl of Oxford, was the true author of the plays usually attributed to William Shakespeare of
Stratford-on-Avon .
At the time of his death, he was working on two books: one concerning
Abraham Lincoln ‘s presidency and the
United States Constitution , and another about de Vere’s poetry.
He is also the author of:
Single Issues: Essays on the Crucial Social Questions
– Human Life Press – 1983
Alias Shakespeare: Solving the Greatest Literary Mystery of All Time
– Free Press 1997
Hustler: The Clinton Legacy
– Griffin Communications 2000
Sobran has produced a number of published articles and speeches, including:
Anything Called a Program is Unconstitutional
– Griffin Communications – 2001
The Church Today: Less Catholic Than the Pope?
– National Committee of Catholic Laymen – 1979
How Tyranny Came to America ,
Sobran’s , n.d.
Pensees: Notes for the reactionary of tomorrow
National Review , December 31, 1985. (extended essay)
Power and Betrayal
– Griffin Communications – 1998
At the 1994 Costs of Wars conference at the Mises Institute, Sobran presented a speech on
“Shakespeare on War and Empire” .

Andy Albeck, American film executive, President of United Artists (1978–1981), died from heart failure he was , 89
Andreas “Andy” Albeck   was an American movie executive, who was president and chief executive of
United Artists , died from heart failure he was , 89 during a time when it released two films by
Woody Allen , along with two films in both the
James Bond
and
Rocky
film series. He also oversaw production of
Martin Scorcese ‘s
Raging Bull , a movie frequently mentioned as one of the
films considered the greatest ever , as well as
Heaven’s Gate , the
box office bomb
that led to the studio’s demise as an independent studio.
(September 25, 1921 – September 29, 2010)
Biography
Albeck was born on September 25, 1921, in
Vladivostok ,
Russia . His father was a
Danish
executive with a shipping firm, while his mother was a
Russian
escaping the
Bolshevik Revolution . His family was taken aboard an American naval vessel to
Yokohama ,
Japan , where Albeck was raised and educated at
St. Joseph College [1] . His first connection to the film industry was in 1939, when he became a sales representative for
Columbia Pictures
in what was then the
Dutch East Indies , present day
Indonesia . He came to United Artists when the company made the 1951 acquisition of
Eagle-Lion Films , the British film company he had been working for. [2]
His first marriage, to Nelly Stal, produced two children, Johannes
and Nina. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1958 Albeck remarried Lotte
Jamel, [2]
whom he had met in 1952 when she had been brought to the United States by her cousin
Mickey Marcus , a colonel in the
United States Army
and
Israel ‘s first general. Albeck later had Marcus’s experience during
World War II
and the
1948 Arab–Israeli War
made into the 1966 United Artists film
Cast a Giant Shadow , starring
Kirk Douglas . [3]
Albeck worked his way up through the sales department at United
Artists, earning promotions to become president of its broadcasting
division and senior vice president of operations. In 1978,
Transamerica Corporation
chose him to head the studio after its former chairman
Arthur B. Krim
left with a group of executives to form
Orion Pictures , picking Albeck for his ability to control costs and his positive relationship with wary Transamerica executives. Author
Steven Bach , who served as head of production at United Artists under Albeck, [4]
wrote, “Andy Albeck was not show business; that much was clear,” in his book
Final Cut . [2] [5]
During his tenure at United Artists, the studio produced
The French Lieutenant’s Woman
starring
Meryl Streep ,
Manhattan
and
Stardust Memories
by director
Woody Allen
and the James Bond films
Moonraker
and
For Your Eyes Only . Albeck also oversaw two films in the
Rocky
series, both of which were box office successes.
Raging Bull , with
Robert DeNiro
playing the role of
Jake LaMotta , was a critical success that went on to be ranked on the
American Film Institute ‘s
top 100 films of all time . [2]
Albeck’s undoing was the film
Heaven’s Gate ,
which went several times over its original budget and earned little in
box office revenue in the wake of overwhelmingly negative reviews, such
as by
Vincent Canby
of
The New York Times , who called the film a “an unqualified disaster” when it was released in November 1980. [6]
In the following weeks Albeck was named chairman of United Artists and
removed from his post as president, resigning from the firm in February
1981 in the wake of media reports that he had been forced to retire. In
the wake of losses amounting to $44 million, making it what was then the
biggest money losing film in history, the studio was purchased in May
1981 by
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
from Transamerica to form MGM/UA in a deal valued at $380 million. [2] [7] [8]
In his retirement, he operated the award-winning Albeck Family Christmas Tree farm in
Lafayette Township, New Jersey , growing
blue spruce
trees on a 200 acres (81 ha) farm. [3]
A resident of
Manhattan , Albeck died there at the age of 89 on September 29, 2010, at
NYU Langone Medical Center
due to
heart failure . [3]
He was survived by his second wife, Lotte, as well as by his son and
daughter from his first marriage, six grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren. [2]

at the
Collège de France , Paris, where he worked in the laboratory of
Frédéric Joliot-Curie .

multiwire proportional chamber ,
which he patented and that quickly superseded the old bubble chambers,
allowing for better data processing. He eventually retired from CERN in
1991.
In 1980, Georges Charpak became professor-in-residence at École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles in Paris ( ESPCI )
and held the Joliot-Curie Chair there in 1984. This is where he
developed and demonstrated the powerful applications of the particle
detectors he invented, most notably for enabling better health
diagnostics. He is indeed the co-founder of a number of start-up in the
biomedical arena, including Molecular Engines Laboratories, Biospace
Instruments and SuperSonic Imagine – together with
Mathias Fink .
He was elected to the
French Academy of Sciences
on 20 May 1985.
Georges Charpak was awarded the
Nobel Prize in Physics
in 1992 “for his invention and development of particle detectors, in particular the
multiwire proportional chamber “, with affiliations to both École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles ( ESPCI ) and CERN. This was the last time a single person was awarded the physics prize.
In March, 2001 Charpak received Honorary degree Ph.D from
University of the Andes, Colombia
in Bogotá. [3]
In France, Charpak was a very strong advocate for
nuclear power . Prof. Charpak was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists . [4]
