Birdbooker Report 191
Books to the ceiling,
Books to the sky, My pile of books is a mile high. How I love them! How I need them! I'll have a long beard by the time I read them.
~ Arnold Lobel [1933-1987] author of many popular children's books.
Compiled by Ian "Birdbooker" Paulsen, the
Birdbooker Report
is a weekly report listing the wide variety of nature, natural history, ecology, animal behaviour, science and history books that have been newly released or republished in North America and in the UK. The books listed here were received by Ian during the previous week, courtesy of various publishing houses.

Apples versus kitten
Kittens are the epitome of silliness, especially this particular kitten, which has decided that two apples, innocently huddled on a bed, are her mortal enemies:

Germanium

Today's element is Germanium, which has the atomic symbol Ge and the atomic number 32. This is a hard but brittle and very lustrous silvery-white semi-metallic solid that acts as a semiconductor. It is used to make transistors in electronic devices and special glass for fibre optics. It is also used in infrared optics and in solar panels. But most of us have met Germanium because it is used to make wide-angle camera lenses due to its high refractive index.
In this video, our favourite chemistry Professor tells us more about Germanium:

2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry

Did you understand what Daniel Shechtman's discovery of quasicrystals was about and why it is so exciting to this year's Nobel Prize committee? This video interviews our favourite chemistry professor, Martyn Poliakoff, and physics professor Phil Moriarty, the star of the
Sixty Symbols
video series. Together, they explain this discovery and provide more detail about its importance and and how it changed our thinking about what a crystal is:

Stem Cell Awareness Day: The potential of amniotic fluid stem cells
Even as we celebrate the scientific advances that are being honoured by the Nobel Prizes, let's not forget current research that will be winning the Nobel Prizes a few short years. One of those research areas could be stem cell research and technology.
Millions of people around the world suffer from incurable diseases, like cancer, and injuries, such as spinal injuries. Stem cell research is providing ground-breaking advances in science and medicine -- advances that represent the best hope for healing treatments that people have who are suffering from these diseases or injuries.
This video provides a brief glimpse into one of the many illnesses that stem cell technology is being developed to address:

Dragonflies: The flying aces of the insect world

[ Meganeura ize ]
Dragonflies are remarkable insects, with especially remarkable flying abilities. They are not only among the fastest of flying insects, but they perform a number of amazing aerial maneuvers, such as flying upside down, straight up or straight down, or hovering like a helicopter as they mate or catch their insect meals on the wing. But since these large insects are such quick and skilled fliers, what sorts of technologies can be used to study how dragonflies hunt?
"Unless we film it in high speed, we can't see whether it caught the prey, but when it gets back to its perch, if we see it chewing, we know that it was successful," says Harvard biomechanist, Stacey Combes. But now, Dr Combes and her team are using high speed cameras to study the details of how dragonflies pull off their intricate aerial feats:

Gummy bears and the chemistry of drugs
Screen grab from video.
In this video from
Chemical and Engineering News , Art Olson, a professor at the Scripps Research Institute demonstrates how chemists in his lab predict how well the drugs that they design will work in real life.
Olson's lab prints 3-D models of molecular structures, both targets -- like the HIV protease enzyme shown in the video below -- and the drugs they've designed to interact with those targets. When Olson holds 3-D models in front of a webcam, chemical analysis software that his team built interacts with and analyses how well the drugs physically fit their targets. This allows the researchers to test how well they chemically interact on a molecular level before testing the drug
