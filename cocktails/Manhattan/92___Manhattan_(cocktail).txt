Local flavours (III): beverages

Oh man, does this take me back …
Time to pick up where I left off and finish this first round of sharing what I know about distinctly local things to eat and drink in the central Hastings area. I hope I’ll find out about many more as Raymond and I spend more time there.
Wilson's Ginger Ale came from Toronto, Pure Spring from Ottawa. Both are, sadly, long gone.
So this post is about things to drink, and I’m going to start nostalgically by mentioning two soft drinks that are no longer extant:
Wilson’s Ginger Ale
and
Pure Spring Ginger Ale . Wilson’s, in the distinctive green bottle with the white lettering, was produced in Toronto, and Pure Spring in Ottawa, so neither was specifically connected to Hastings County. But both were regional – I don’t suppose you could have got either in Western Canada, or perhaps even Western Ontario – and quite popular in my youth. There seemed to be a Pure Spring push-bar on every general-store door in the area, and I bet you can still find them on some long-shuttered stores. (I am going to look.) Pure Spring made other soft drinks too, but it’s the ginger ale that I most associate with the name – perhaps because ginger ale was generally the soft drink of choice on the extremely rare occasions when our family had what we called “pop” at all.
And then there’s rye, which was very much – and I think maybe still is – the preferred liquor for the liquor-drinkers in that part of the world. I recall a phase when some rye company was attaching stickers that said “A Proud Canadian” to its bottles somehow, and it seemed liked every kid on the school bus had one or more (sometimes many) of those stickers on his or her school binders – except the Sedgwick kids, whose parents’ lips never went near strong drink.
On one of our early visits to look at the Manse, Raymond and I stayed overnight in Tweed and visited that town’s L.C.B.O. (that’s
Liquor Control Board of Ontario
for you outside-Canada readers) store, hoping to find some
wines from not-far-away Prince Edward County . Which we did; for a small liquor store, it has a good selection, and a very friendly and knowledgeable clerk who guided us. But what really struck us was the huge wall of rye. I might be exaggerating to say that more space was allotted to rye than to all other products in the store combined, but I don’t think I’m exaggerating by much. And we subsequently discovered that it’s much the same at the big
LCBO at the Quinte Mall
in Belleville and at the one in Madoc. It’s rye country, for sure. Probably partly because of the big
Corby
distillery that used to be at
Corbyville
(gee, I wonder where they got the name), which is just north of Belleville. There is a history of the distillery operation
here , on an excellent site called
ghosttownpix.com . (“This website is dedicated to all those forgotten communities, which whether due to lousy planning, impossible dreams, or rotten luck, just didn’t make it.”)
Here
is the Ontario section of the site. And here is a wonderful re-creation of the slideshow that was shown to visitors to the Corbyville plant in 1969:
As it happens, rye – especially good rye – has become a rather popular and trendy drink again, doubtless due to the
Mad Men
influence. My long-ago colleague
Beppi Crosariol , who worked with me at the
Kingston Whig-Standard
and is now the wine and spirits writer at the
Globe and Mail , has done several recent columns recommending good rye and good rye drinks, notably the classic
Manhattan . I had clipped
one of those articles , and Raymond and I were able to find most of the brands Beppi was recommending at the good old
Tweed liquor store . And I can now make a mean Manhattan – just like Beppi, who in a helpful video can show you how too,
here .
Finally, what might be the most exciting one of all: a winery in central Hastings! It’s at  Sulphide , a tiny place with a funny name a little east of Tweed (ergo very close to Queensborough), and it’s called the
Potter Settlement Winery . According to the
Harvest Hastings website , it is scheduled to open in 2013 but “already consists of 10 planted acres of vinifera, hybrid and VQA-recognized grapes.” ( VQA
stands for Vintners Quality Alliance, and it’s a Canadian regulatory and appellation system like
AOC
in France or
DOC
in Italy.)
So sometime in 2013, Raymond and I will be trying out the wares of our own local winemaker. Perhaps at our first open house at the Manse. If you are reading this, consider yourself invited.

I just realized, if you look closely at the rounded door on the 2nd floor of your home, it looks like the symbol of a cross in the window…appropriate, don’t you think, for this weekend? And, for the manse…

A nice observation, Eloise. And on that note: a very happy Easter to all!

I swear that I remember every single word of a Pure Spring commercial from my childhood.
“It tingles, it sparkles, every time and every thirst, Pure Spring ginger ale!”. Or am I mistaken?
It’s all I could think of when I saw the photo you included.

Too funny, Valerie! You might be interested in this old (1970s? very early ’80s?)
TV commercial , which I came across while writing that post. Having just watched it again, I’m pretty sure one of the four young Pure Spring ginger ale enthusiasts in it is Cynthia Dale.

I would love to see Wilsons gingerale come back, it was the best made. If there is some way of bringing it back, please, please do so.

Carole, I could not agree more. And I think it tasted especially good when one drank it (very cold) directly from that green glass bottle. What a nice memory on a hot and muggy day!

Sadly my family sold Wilson’s to Crush, so if you want Wilson’s Ginger Ale, write to them, maybe you can convince them to make up a small batch.

Oh wow, Connor – how exciting to hear from a member of the Wilson family of Wilson’s Ginger Ale! I sure wish it was still around, and I know many others do too. I wonder if Crush would consider the return of that cool vintage drink. I wonder if they even still have the recipe. But then again, maybe
you
do…

I have been searching for the, or a Wilson commercial from the ’70’s ( I think). The Retrontario Facebook Site would benefit from its inclusion.
It had the jingle ‘Wilson’s is, here come the fizz’.
Plus I can’t get it outta my head.

Oh man, John, I think I can just vaguely, ever so vaguely, remember that ad, or at least the jingle. Was it a takeoff on “Here comes the fuzz!” and “Here come the judge!” (which, for whatever reason, used to be popular catchphrases around then)? Now you’ve got me intrigued. We must find this ad! I found
this link , but it fails to convey the jingle. We are on a mission!

Excellent.
:) .
I think the jingle went Lang the lines of: “fizzy, gingery, Wilson’s is, here comes the fizz”.
I don’t remember the rest. And yes,
here comes the fuzz was a catch phrase in the early 70’s.

John, I’ve been super-busy lately and haven’t had time for internet searches of 1970s Ontario soft-drink ads, but I’ll poke around when I can. I trust you’ll keep me (and readers) posted if you strike Wilson’s gold!

So, with an oblique reference to your recent post about legless things in your garden, you’ll be holding that open house in the winter? Or did I miss it entirely because I didn’t know about your blog until just a few months ago?

Brenda, we had thought about a Christmas open house at the Manse last year, but then were both so a) busy and b) sick with flu in late December that we never got it together. But be assured it is still on the agenda, either as a summertime thing (and don’t worry! We will protect you from the slithery legless things) or a Christmas-holiday thing. I would just love to invite all the people from Queensborough and friends from the surrounding area – I think it would be more fun than anything. Sadly, I won’t be able to serve Wilson’s ginger ale…
