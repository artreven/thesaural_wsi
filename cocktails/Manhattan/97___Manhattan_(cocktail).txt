A Stately Dinner
Last night we had our dinner inspired by a few American States.  If you remember, we came up with this idea during the
International dinner with had with our neighbors
a few months ago.  Each couple drew a U.S. State and a course. Each course had to have a drink to go with it.  Bryce and I drew appetizer and New York.
With all the children having fun with a babysitter next door we were free to relax and enjoy.  The night was super fun, the conversation lively and inappropriate and the courses tasty and inspired.  Here is the run down ~
Appetizer from New York
Bagels with a schmear of cream cheese, topped with
lox
and capers served with a

Swedish meatballs,
lefse , and picked cabbage served with the Champagne of beers,

Dessert from California

ice cream  served with wine.
As you can imagine we're all still digesting . . .
