Peter Herbolzheimer died he was 74,
Peter Herbolzheimer
died he was 81. Herbolzheimer was a
German
jazz
trombonist
and
bandleader .
(31 December 1935 – 27 March 2010)
Herbolzheimer was born in
Bucharest
and migrated from communist
Romania
to
West Germany
in 1951. In 1953 he moved to the
United States of
America , where he worked as guitarist.
He returned to Germany in
1957, took up the trombone and for one year studied at the
Nuremberg
Conservatory. In the 1960s he played with the Nuremberg radio dance
orchestra and with
Bert Kämpfert ‘s orchestra. In 1968 he
became member of the pit orchestra of
Hamburg
theater (Deutsches Schauspielhaus) directed by
Hans Koller .
In 1969 Herbolzheimer formed his
Rhythm Combination and Brass
(RC&B) for which he wrote most of the arrangements. This big band
was unique in that it had an international lineup of eight brass, but
originally only one saxophone, with
Herb
Geller
in that chair. The list of brass players included
Allan Botschinsky
(Denmark),
Art
Farmer
(USA),
Dusko Goykovich
(Bosnia),
Palle Mikkelborg
(Denmark),
Ack van Rooyen
(Netherlands) and
Jiggs Whigham
(USA). The rhythm section
consisted of two keyboards, guitar, bass, drums and percussion and
included renowned musicians such as
Dieter Reith
(Germany),
Philip Catherine
(Belgium),
Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen
(Denmark),
Bo Stief
(Denmark),
Alex
Riel
(Denmark),
Grady Tate
(USA), and
Nippy
Noya
(Indonesia). For special events the group was augmented as
necessary, but the basic combination remained as such for several years.
In the late 1970s the band toured successfully with a “jazz gala”
program featuring guest stars such as
Esther Phillips ,
Stan
Getz ,
Nat Adderley ,
Gerry Mulligan ,
Toots Thielemans ,
Clark
Terry
(( Tony Lujan)) and
Albert Mangelsdorff . In later years the
RC&B
played many concert tours, television shows and jazz festivals. It was
later replaced by a regular sized big band that is still active today.
In 1972 Herbolzheimer wrote music for the
Edelhagen Band ‘s opening of the
Olympic
Games
in
Munich . Later he worked for German television as
leader and arranger, and accompanied visiting American musicians such as
Al
Jarreau
and
Dizzy Gillespie . Between 1987 and 2006
Herbolzheimer was the musical director of Germany’s national youth jazz
orchestra, the
BundesJazzOrchester
(BuJazzo). He conducted
regular workshops and clinics for big band jazz.
In 1974 Herbolzheimer’s
Rhythm Combination & Brass
entered
an annual television competition held in the Belgian seaside resort
Knokke ,
winning the coveted
Golden Swan Award . He also won the
International
Jazz Composers Competition 1974
in
Monaco .
Herbolzheimer’s arrangements are a distinctive amalgam of swing, latin
and rhythmic rock music.
Herbolzheimer died aged 74 in his hometown of
Cologne ,
Germany on 27 March 2010.

Washington-Lee High School
,
where she was a cheerleader, participated in high school theater
productions and dated a football player. [ 8 ]
She graduated in 1982 and enrolled in
East Carolina University
in
Greenville, North Carolina . She
left East Carolina during her senior year in the spring of 1986, only
three credits short of graduating, to pursue an acting career. [ 8 ]
She moved to Manhattan to pursue auditions and supported herself with a
variety of odd jobs (bartender, cocktail waitress, coat checker, etc.) [ 8 ]
Bullock later completed her coursework at East Carolina University. [ 9 ]
While in New York, Bullock took acting classes at the
Neighborhood Playhouse . She appeared
in several student films, and later landed a role in an Off-Broadway
play
No Time Flat . [ 8 ]
Director Alan J. Levi was impressed by Bullock’s performance and
offered her a part in the made-for-TV movie
Bionic Showdown: The Six
Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman
(1989). After filming the TV
movie, Bullock stayed in Los Angeles and was cast in a series of small
roles in several
independent films
as well as in the lead
role of the short-lived
NBC
television version of the film
Working Girl
(1990). She later
appeared in several films, such as
Love Potion No. 9
(1992),
The Thing Called Love
(1993) and
Fire on the Amazon
(in which she agreed to appear
topless if the camera did not show that much; she covered herself with
duct tape, which apparently was somewhat painful to remove). [ 8 ]
One of Bullock’s first notable movie appearances was in the
science-fiction/action movie
Demolition Man
(1993), which
starred Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes. This role then led to her
break-through performance in
Speed
the following year. She became a high-level
movie star in the late 1990s, carrying a string of successes, including
While You Were Sleeping ,
replacing actress
Demi Moore , who was originally scheduled to star,

World in 1996 and 1999, and was also ranked #58 in
Empire
magazine’s Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time
list. She was presented with the 2002
Raúl Juliá
Award for Excellence [ 10 ]
for her efforts, as the executive producer of the sitcom
The George Lopez Show , in
helping expand career openings for Hispanic talent in the media and
entertainment industry. She also made several appearances on the show as
Accident Amy , an
accident-prone employee at the factory Lopez’s character manages. In
2002, she starred opposite
Hugh
Grant
in the global hit
Two Weeks Notice
and in a lesser known film
Divine Secrets of
the Ya-Ya Sisterhood .
In 2004, Bullock had a supporting role in the film
Crash . She received positive reviews for her
performance, with some critics suggesting that it was the best
performance of her career. [ 11 ]
Bullock later appeared in
The Lake House , a romantic drama also
starring her
Speed
co-star,
Keanu
Reeves ; it was released on June 16, 2006. Because their film
characters are separated throughout the film (due to the plot revolving
around
time travel ), Bullock and Reeves were only on set together
for two weeks during filming. [ 12 ]
The same year, Bullock appeared in
Infamous , playing author
Harper
Lee . Bullock also starred in
Premonition
with
Julian McMahon , which was released in March 2007. [ 13 ]
2009 proved to be especially good for Bullock, giving the actress two
record highs in her career, as earlier in the year she released
The Proposal , a huge hit that took in more than
$314 million at the box office worldwide, making it her most successful
picture to date. [ 14 ]
In November 2009, Bullock starred in
The Blind Side , which opened at #2 behind
New Moon
with $34.2
million, making it her highest opening weekend ever. The Blind Side is
unique in that it had a 17.6% increase at the box office its second
weekend, and it took the top spot of the box office in its third
weekend. The movie cost $29 million to make according the Box Office
Mojo. It has grossed over $200 million to date, making it her highest
grossing film and the first movie in history to pass the $200 million
mark with only one top-billed female star. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]
She won the award for Best Actress at the
Golden Globes ,
Academy Awards , and the
Screen Actors
Guild Award
for her performance in “The Blind Side”. [ 17 ]
Bullock runs her own production company, Fortis Films. Her sister,
Gesine Bullock-Prado, was president of the company, but has since quit
the business and moved to
Montpelier, Vermont , where she opened a
pastry shop and published a book. [ 18 ]
Her father, John Bullock, is the company’s
CEO . [ 19 ]
Bullock was an executive producer of
The George Lopez Show , which
garnered a lucrative syndication deal that banked her some $10 million
(co-produced with Robert Borden). [ 20 ]
Bullock tried to produce a film based on
F.X.
Toole ‘s short story,
Million-Dollar Baby , but could not
interest the studios in a female boxing drama. [ 21 ]
The story was eventually adapted and directed by
Clint Eastwood
as the
Oscar -winning film,
Million Dollar Baby
(2004). Bullock’s production
company, Fortis Films, also produced
All About Steve , which was released in September 2009. [ 22 ]
Since November 2006, Bullock has owned an
Austin ,
Texas
restaurant, Bess Bistro. [ 23 ]
She later opened another business in downtown Austin called Walton’s
Fancy and Staple, a bakery and floral shop that also offers services
such as event planning. [ 24 ]
Bullock was once engaged to actor
Tate
Donovan ,
whom she met while filming
Love Potion No. 9 ; their
relationship lasted four years. [ 8 ]
She previously dated football player
Troy
Aikman ,
Austin musician
Bob
Schneider
(for two years), [ 8 ]
and actors
Matthew McConaughey
and
Ryan
Gosling .
Bullock married motorcycle builder and
Monster Garage
host
Jesse James
on July 16, 2005. They met when Bullock arranged
for her ten-year-old
godson
to meet James as a Christmas present.
On December 20, 2000, Bullock survived the crash of a chartered
business jet at
Jackson Hole Airport . The aircraft hit a snowbank
instead of the runway, resulting in both the nose gear and nose cone
being ripped off, the right wing partially separating from the aircraft,
and the left wing being bent back. [ 25 ]
Bullock has been a public supporter of the
American Red Cross , twice donating $1 million, first to
its
Liberty Disaster Relief Fund
and four years
later in
response
to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunamis . [ 26 ]
In 2010, she donated $1 million to relief efforts in Haiti following
the
devastating Haiti earthquake .
[ 27 ]
In October 2004, Bullock won a multimillion dollar judgment against
Benny Daneshjou, the builder of her
Lake
Austin ,
Texas
home; the jury ruled the house was uninhabitable. It has since been
torn down and rebuilt. [ 28 ]
Bullock also owns a house on
Tybee Island , which is a few miles from
Savannah, Georgia .
O n April 22, 2007, a woman was lying outside James and Bullock’s
Southern California home in
Orange County . When James
confronted the woman, she ran inside her 2004 silver Mercedes and tried
to run him over. The woman is said to be an obsessed fan of Sandra
Bullock. The woman, Marcia Diana Valentine, was arrested on
investigation of assault with a deadly weapon. [ 29 ]
In May 2007, Bullock won a three-year restraining order against the
woman. Valentine pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated assault and
stalking. [ 30 ]
On April 18, 2008, while Bullock was in
Massachusetts
shooting the film
The Proposal , she and her husband were in an
SUV
that was hit head on (drivers side offset) at
moderate speed by a drunken driver. Vehicle damage was not catastrophic
and there were no injuries. [ 31 ]
In November 2009, Bullock and James entered into a custody battle
with James’ ex-wife, former porn star
Janine Lindemulder ,
with whom James had a child, and
subsequently won full legal custody of James’ five year old daughter. [ 32 ]
llock is reportedly consulting with divorce attorneys, prompting
speculation that the Oscar-winning
actress
is planning to dissolve her
marriage to reality star Jesse James. The
Blind Side
actress — whose husband cheated on her with
tattoo model Michelle ‘Bombshell’ McGee — has reportedly asked her
assistants to search for a “high-end” legal team to represent her if she
decides to split from the motorcycle enthusiast for good

Herb Ellis died he was 88
Mitchell Herbert (Herb) Ellis
was an
American
jazz
guitarist .
(August 4, 1921 – March 28, 2010 [ 1 ] )
Growing up on the outskirts of
Dallas, Texas , Ellis first heard the
electric guitar
performed by
George Barnes
on a radio program.
This experience is said to have inspired him to take up the guitar. He
became proficient on the instrument by the time he entered
North Texas
State University
as a music major. Ellis majored in music, but
because they did not yet have a guitar program at that time, he studied
the
string bass . Unfortunately, due to lack of funds, his college
days were short lived. In 1941 Herb dropped out of college and toured
for 6 months with a band from the
University of Kansas .
In 1943 joined
Glen Gray
and the
Casa Loma Orchestra
and it was with Gray’s band that he
got his first recognition in the jazz magazines. After Gray’s band,
Ellis joined the
Jimmy Dorsey
band where he played some of his
first recorded solos. Ellis remained with Dorsey through 1947, traveling
and recording extensively, and playing in dance halls and movie
palaces. Then came a turnabout that would change Ellis’s career forever.
Then, as pianist Lou Carter told journalist Robert Dupuis in a 1996
interview, “The Dorsey band had a six-week hole in the schedule. The
three of us had played together some with the big band.
John
Frigo , who had already left the band, knew the owner of the Peter
Stuyvesant Hotel in Buffalo. We went in there and stayed six months. And
that’s how the group the Soft Winds were born.”
The Soft Winds was fashioned after the
Nat
King Cole
Trio. They stayed together until 1952. Herb Ellis then
joined the Oscar Peterson Trio (replacing
Barney
Kessel ), forming what
Scott
Yanow
would later on refer to as “one of the most memorable of all
the piano, guitar, and bass trios in jazz history”.
Ellis became prominent after performing with the
Oscar Peterson
Trio from 1953 to 1958 along with pianist
Peterson and bassist
Ray Brown . He was a somewhat controversial member
of the trio, because he was the only white person in the group in a time
when racism was still very much widespread.
In addition to their great live and recorded work as the Oscar
Peterson Trio, this unit served as the virtual “house rhythm section”
for
Norman Granz ‘s
Verve
Records , supporting the likes of tenormen
Ben
Webster
and
Stan Getz , as well as trumpeters
Dizzy Gillespie ,
Roy
Eldridge , and
Sweets Edison
and other jazz stalwarts. With
drummer
Buddy Rich , they were also the backing band for popular
“comeback” albums by the duet of
Ella Fitzgerald
and
Louis Armstrong .
The trio were also the mainstays of Granz’s
Jazz at the Philharmonic
concerts as they
swept the jazz world, almost constantly touring the United States and
Europe .
Ellis left the Peterson Trio in November 1958, to be replaced not by a
guitarist, but by drummer
Ed
Thigpen . The years of 1959 through 1960 found Ellis touring with
Ella Fitzgerald .
The three provided a stirring rendition of “Tenderly” as a jazz
improvisational backdrop to John Hubley’s 1958 cartoon The Tender Game,
Storyboard
Film ‘s version of the age-old story of boy falling head over heels
for girl. [ 2 ]
With fellow jazz guitarists Barney Kessel, Charlie Byrd and Joe Pass,
he created another ensemble, the Great Guitars.
