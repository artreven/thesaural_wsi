“The
Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916
were a series of
shark attacks
along the coast of
New Jersey
between July 1 and July 12, 1916, in which four people were killed and
one injured. Since 1916, scholars have debated which shark species was
responsible and the number of animals involved, with the
great white shark
and the
bull shark
most frequently being blamed. The attacks occurred during a deadly summer
heat wave
and
polio
epidemic in the
northeastern United States
that drove thousands of people to the seaside
resorts
of the
Jersey Shore .
Shark attacks
on the
Atlantic Coast of the United States
outside the
semitropical
states of
Florida ,
Georgia , and
the Carolinas
were rare, but scholars believe that the increased presence of sharks and humans in the water led to the attacks in 1916.
Local and national reaction to the attacks involved a wave of panic
that led to shark hunts aimed at eradicating the population of ‘man-eating’ sharks and protecting the economies of New Jersey’s seaside
communities. Resort towns enclosed their public beaches with steel nets
to protect swimmers. Scientific knowledge about sharks before 1916 was
based on conjecture and speculation. The attacks forced
ichthyologists
to reassess common beliefs about the abilities of sharks and the nature of shark attacks.
The Jersey Shore attacks immediately entered into American popular culture, where sharks became
caricatures
in
editorial cartoons
representing danger. The attacks inspired
Peter Benchley ’s novel
Jaws
(1974), an account of a
great white shark
that torments the fictional coastal community of Amity.
Jaws
was made into an influential
film
in 1975 by
Steven Spielberg .”

Harlem
taxidermist

Barnum and Bailey
lion tamer
Michael Schleisser caught a 7.5 foot (2.3 m), 325 pound (147 kg) shark while fishing in
Raritan Bay
only a few miles from the mouth of Matawan Creek. The shark nearly sank
the boat before Schleisser killed it with a broken oar. When he opened
the shark’s belly, he removed a 'suspicious fleshy material and bones’
that took up 'about two-thirds of a milk crate’ and 'together weighed
fifteen pounds.’
Scientists identified the shark as a young great white and the ingested remains as human. Schleisser mounted the shark and placed it on display in the window of a
Manhattan
shop on
Broadway
but it was later lost. The only surviving photograph appeared in the
Bronx Home News .”
