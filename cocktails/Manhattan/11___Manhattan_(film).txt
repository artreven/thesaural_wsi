Frances Conroy
(born November 13, 1953) is an American actress who plays
Loretta Stinson
on
How I Met Your Mother .
Biography Edit
Frances Conroy was introduced and encouraged by her parents to explore the elements of theater. Born in
Georgia
in 1953, she attended high school in
Long Island
and experienced classes at the Neighborhood Playhouse as a teenager. Frances Conroy also studied at
Juilliard
where she was taught by theater greats
John Houseman
and
Marian Seldes . Following potent dramatic roles in such classical productions as "Mother Courage...and Her Children," "King Lear," "All's Well That Ends Well," "Measure for Measure" and "Othello" (as Desdemona) in the late 70s, she made her
Broadway
debut with
The Lady from Dubuque
in 1980. She went on to earn a well-respected name for herself under the Broadway and off-Broadway lights throughout the 1980s in such esteemed plays as
Our Town
(as Mrs. Gibbs),
The Little Foxes
(as Birdie) and
In the Summer House . She also appeared with Seldes in the well-received plays
Ring Round the Moon
and
A Bright Room Called Day . She won a
Drama Desk Award
for
The Secret Rapture
and an
Obie
for
The Last Yankee . In 2000 she received the
Outer Critics Circle Award
and a
Tony
nomination for
The Ride Down Mt. Morgan .
An actress of subtle power, great depth and astonishing versatility, she has both an aloof serenity and faintly sad/sensitive ambiance that makes her all the more mysterious and intriguing. She came out to California in 1985 at the invitation of director Houseman and appeared in more theater plays, including
Richard III , at San Diego's Globe Theater. She also earned a sprinkling of generally overlooked film and TV parts, including small parts in
Woody Allen ' s
Manhattan
(1979),
Another Woman
(1988) and
Crimes and Misdemeanors
(1989).
Showing a distinct flair for the offbeat, nothing really pushed the envelope for her on screen quite like her series' turn as the dowdy, emotionally frail undertaker's widow in the cult hit TV series
Six Feet Under
(2001). During the five-season run she won both
Golden Globe
and
Screen Actors Guild
awards and was nominated four times for an
Emmy . Since then she has been offered a number of interesting, more prominent parts in such movies as
Die, Mommie, Die!
(2003),
Catwoman
(2004),
The Aviator
(2004) and
Shopgirl
(2005). In 1992 she married actor/husband Jan Munroe, an
L.A.
performance artist. After a six-year absence, Frances returned to the theater in a 2006 production of Pyrenees by
David Greig
at the
Kirk Douglas Theater
in Los Angeles.
In 2011, Conroy began appearing in the television series
American Horror Story , on the
FX
network, as one of two actresses playing the housekeeper.
