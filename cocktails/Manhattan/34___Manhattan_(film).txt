Zinsky the Obscure: August 2012
Sunday, August 19, 2012
A Guide to the References: Chapter 13 -- Diana's Acceptance
1. The Cellar
-- This is an actual bar in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I've spent many an evening. Its official name, which nobody uses, is "Garden at the Cellar." For many years, The Cellar was an ideal "stomping ground" for me and my coworkers from the
Full Moon
restaurant.
2.
The Elephant Man
-- A 1980 film about a man with a deformed face -- hospital nurses are "horrified" by his appearance, to quote the Wiki page. It's no surprise Zinsky -- given how harshly girls have reacted to
his
appearance -- would liken his own visage to this character's.
3. PalmPilot
-- Exhibit A of how contemporary fiction can, in a heartbeat, assume the traits of historical fiction. Chapter 13 takes place in the Boston area in the year 2000. (It was
Only Yesterday , to quote one of my favorite nonfiction books.) In many ways it was just like today: Locals cared a little too much about baseball; young adults cared a little too much about going to grad school; ink-stained wretches cared a little too much that the newspaper industry was dying; and the The Cellar was one of the coolest restaurant-bars in Cambridge. But one way that life was different in 2000 was in the portable devices favored by white-collar professionals. Instead of smartphones, the handheld of choice was the PalmPilot. Having lived through it -- and diarized it excessively at the time -- I scarcely needed to research it when the time came for drafting
Zinsky . The lesson here, for writers young and old: When you keep a journal, you not only help yourself in all the generally recognized ways (venting, practicing your powers of description, honing your memory); you also unwittingly create a sociocultural document of how you and your contemporaries are living.
4. Woody Allen
-- The legendary director needs no introduction from me, so I'll just riff a bit on
Hannah and Her Sisters   (1986), which I think is his best film. At first blush it will seem strange for me to compare
Hannah
to Wes Anderson's
Moonrise Kingdom   (2012), but here's what I mean: Each movie represents a culmination of artistic achievement. In
Moonrise , you could see traces of Anderson's previous work, but it was as if the earlier movies -- excellent as some of them were -- were all stepping stones to
Moonrise . The auteur finally came to the heart of the matter -- and the result was his magnum opus. I feel the same way about
Hannah . It contains traces of the previous Allen -- the romance, the emotional intimacy, the nods to ancient Greek tragedy, the slapstick, the erudition, the adultery, the sexual jealousy, the siblings -- and ties all of it into something we'd yet to see from Allen: A film that was genuinely believable. Think about it: His previous films all contain elements of whimsy -- corny nods to the fact that they are merely movies. Even
Manhattan , which I love, and which you could argue is the lone exception to the generalization I've just made, is premised upon a farfetched romance. I love
Interiors
too, but one gets the feeling, while watching it, that one is watching a play about a family, rather than an actual family.
Hannah , however, manages to be believable despite a mix of plot and characters that, in lesser hands, would be impossible to pull off. The ending of the movie is one of the best in the history of the film. (For my money, the only other final scenes on
Hannah's
level are in  The 400 Blows  (1959) and  The Grand Illusion   (1937).)
5.
Some Kind of Wonderful
(1987)
-- If you are beginning to guess that Ariel Zinsky and Diana Kennedy watch a movie in this chapter, you are correct! This '80s gem is the film they settle on after their trip to the video store (another relic from the year 2000). Here I'm just going to include Zinsky's summary of the plot, from which we can learn a lot about who he is at age 25. (The general idea, of course, is that we always learn a lot about the people we know from how they interpret or react to movies, books, music, etc.):
We had chosen a romantic comedy called
Some Kind of Wonderful
– I
had never heard of it, though Diana had termed it “a classic” from the
80s. My ignorance of it made her all the more insistent we rent it. She
was quiet throughout the movie, save for periodic chuckles and one
remark about the buttery smell of our eggs. The house was hushed,
except for the film itself and the clanks of our dishes and silverware.
The plot involved two comely high school boys and two comely high
school girls in a love diamond: the artistic middle class boy pines for
the popular girl, who has just broken up with the rich athletic boy.
Meanwhile, a musically oriented girl pines for the artistic boy – pines
for him so much, that she is willing to help him attain the popular girl.
Eventually, the artistic boy realizes the musical girl is the one for him.
The credits roll.
How different this drama was from
my
high school reality! Even at
age 25, I could not sit back and accept the données. I thought: “How
am I supposed to empathize, nay, root for, any character who finds lust
in high school?” By the movie’s end I hated all four protagonists. I
wondered whether Diana’s affinity for the film signified key differences
between us – differences I longed to ignore because I was in no position to reject any woman who welcomed my advances.
6. Bugs Bunny
-- On Saturday morning at Diana's house, Ariel walks downstairs and finds Diana's roommate, Harper Pratt, watching Bugs cartoons with her boyfriend. Now, the main concern I have as an author here is this: What, realistically, was on non-cable TV on Saturday mornings in the year 2000, and what, of those precious few options, would a young couple be watching? Personally, I'm a huge fan of the rascally rabbit. Back when my boy Greg Lawson lived here in the Boston area, we used to check out the annual
Bugs Bunny Film Festival at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge . Ever since Greg left town, I've been looking for someone to go with. It's a weird feeling to be in the theater during these movies, surrounded by mothers and young children. You definitely get that "What are you doing here" look, as if you're some pervy male spinster impinging on their wholesome family activity.
7.
Cupid / Hephaestus
-- Cupid is the rare instance of a god more known by his Roman name than his Greek one (Eros). (Which is why, in the passage below, I have Zinsky use his Roman name, despite theorizing about Cupid/Eros's Greek creator.) As for Hephaestus: If you've read the previous entry on the Elephant Man, you know why Zinsky identifies himself with the homely men of the Western tradition and modern film. What Zinsky does here that I find interesting (and of course, I'm biased) is link these two gods who, for some reason, seldom share the page in actual mythology:
It was clear to me
that some ugly Ancient Greek must have invented both Hephaestus,
the patron saint of the hideous, and Cupid, the demi-God whose arbitrary arrow-slings seemed as likely an explanation as any for the mystifying science by which females selected their gross objects of affection.
A shout-out to my mom before I go: She first kindled my interest in these deities by bringing home a copy of Edith Hamilton's
Mythology
when I was but a lad.

Thoughts on Gore Vidal's Lincoln
Not long ago I was workshopping a short story in which the young Abraham Lincoln is a key character.
The story takes place in Illinois (Springfield and New Salem) in the 1830s. In one scene, Lincoln and some other politicians watch a pair of women slip in the mud while trying to cross the street -- and promptly crack jokes at their expense.
Someone in my workshop asked: Why didn't Lincoln help them up? Would
the
Abe Lincoln really have stood there, laughing?
This is why historical fiction is hard to write. Based on what we know of the young Lincoln, it is entirely believable he would've stood there giggling. But when many readers think of Lincoln, their minds go on autopilot. They consider him a hero. They expect him to behave like a legendary president, rather than what he was in the 1830s: a politically astute young man who'd never pass on the chance to bond with his peers through humor.
I'll always love
Gore Vidal's
Lincoln
because of the way it unabashedly portrays the title character -- warts and all, but with plausible historical accuracy. I sometimes wonder if Vidal had to endure meretricious questions from his editors at Random House. Here's a quick dose of the Lincoln we come to know through Vidal's novel:
"For several years Washburne, stout and rosy, had been urging Lincoln to eat more, if only to cure himself of a constipation so severe that he seldom moved his bowels more than once a week" (9).
"About 1839 or '40, Speed was keeping a pretty woman in Springfield, and Lincoln, desirous to have a little, said to Speed, 'Speed, do you know where I can get some?' and Speed said, 'Yes, I do and if you'll wait a moment, I'll send you to the place with a note....Lincoln told his business, and the girl, after some protestations, agreed to satisfy him. Things went on right. Lincoln and the girl stripped and went to bed" (288).
"They say there's a lot of syphilis here, thanks to the army and all. God knows there was a lot of it in Illinois back in the 'thirties, when Lincoln had it" (290).
"Lincoln turned his cloudy gaze on the large man, a minister from New York. 'The aspiration of men is to enjoy equality with the best when free, but on this broad continent not a single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of ours'....Although Lincoln had a true hatred of slavery, as much for the brutal effect it had on the masters as on the enslaved, he was unshaken in his belief that the colored race was inferior to the white" (356).
***
Back in May, at Grub Street's outstanding
Muse & the Marketplace  conference, I went to a terrific talk by  Thomas Mallon . Mallon described a few schools of historical fiction. One of them, which Vidal's
Lincoln
embodies, is what you might call "accurate." These books are thoroughly researched, and the idea is to make the story believable. Then there are what you might call "campy" historical fictions: Whimsies like
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter , which aim for fun and frivolity from the first and which lean far more on authorial imagination than genuine homework.
What I'll always treasure about
Lincoln
is how firmly rooted it is in fact. Quoting Vidal's afterward: "All of the principal characters really existed, and they said and did pretty much what I have them saying and doing, with the exception of the Surratts and David Herold...."
To read
Lincoln
is to ruin yourself for half-assed forays into historical fiction. To this day, I get headaches from  Don Lee's
Country of Origin , which is, to be fair, a highly
decorated novel from a well-respected author . But I will never forget hearing Lee read from the novel at the Wordsworth bookstore in Harvard Square. One attendee challenged Lee on his depictions of Japan in 1980. Lee admitted to the audience that he was far more concerned with crafting a well-paced mystery than with believably recreating the Japan of 1980. It just didn't matter to him.
As I skimmed the novel, I noticed that
Lee had named a character Doug Marabelli . The name caught my attention because, at the time, the Red Sox had a player named
Doug Mirabelli . So I asked Lee: Did you actually name a character after a backup catcher? And he admitted to it. He wasn't even remotely ashamed about it either. In no way did it crimp his aesthetic.
And that's fine. Different strokes for different authors, and all that. If my debut,
Zinsky the Obscure , is half as successful or acclaimed as
Country of Origin , I'll be elated. But...when I think about Vidal and the thrills he provided me as a reader, I'll always appreciate the way that
Lincoln
was both a page-turner and a testament to the role research can play in the creation of a masterpiece.

WHERE TO BUY
ZINSKY THE OBSCURE,
ILAN MOCHARI'S PUSHCART-NOMINATED DEBUT!
Head to the
Zinsky the Obscure
page on Amazon.com
or on
Barnes and Noble.com .
Want to buy it at a bookstore? I wish you could. But now that we're two years past the release date (4/15/13)...and because it was far from a bestseller....they have no reason to stock it.
Still, for the curious, here's a
list of the places that carried it, and took a chance on it, when the time was right.
ACCLAIM
“A powerful debut with Dickensian touches in its heartbreaking and occasionally humorous chronicle of the life of a modern young man.” –
Kirkus Reviews “ This wry debut novel takes on the classic coming-of-age saga, and it makes the reader rethink common assumptions about how young people get from here to there. ”
–
Booklist “ This eloquent novel from Mochari...is both bleak and affecting. ”
–
Publishers Weekly “ Brutally funny....forged from the same literary hearth that has given us such delightful and fussy oddballs as Ignatius J. Reilly, Don Quixote, and Kilgore Trout....this book has the scope of something like Irving's
The World According to Garp . It also has that book's heart.
”
–
DigBoston “A terrific novel, whose pileup of emotional honesty is visceral and powerfully real -- just try to look away.” –
Dara Horn , National Jewish Book Award winner and two-time
New York Times Book Review

Ilan's interview on Boston's NPR station ! S ummary: Thirty-year-old Manhattan bachelor Ariel Zinsky is still recovering from his abusive childhood when he realizes no one -- including his few living relatives -- is truly interested in his narrative. While they numb themselves with the latest celebrity rehab story or the third-world atrocities replayed without ceasing on cable news, he sets out to write his autobiography as an exercise in his own self-medication, recasting himself as the hero in a coming-of-age story. Fans of
A Confederacy of Dunces
and
The Perks of Being a Wallflower
will relate to this tale of overcoming your childhood's traumas, and the world's indifference to them.
