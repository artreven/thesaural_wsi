A
rapid transit ,
underground ,
subway ,
tube ,
elevated , or
metro(politan)
system is a
railway
system, usually in an
urban area , with a high capacity and frequency of service, and
grade separation
from other traffic. The oldest rapid transit system in the world is the
London Underground , which opened in 1863. The Tunnel a 573 m long subway opened in 1875 in Istanbul is the second oldest . [1]
The First
American
system is the
Boston Subway . [2]

Characteristics and nomenclature Edit
See also
Passenger rail terminology .
There is no one term that all
English
speakers use for rapid transit or metro systems. This is a reflection on national and regional usage and differing definitions of what characteristics are essential for these systems.
A common definition would be:
an
urban ,
electric
mass transit
railway
system;
totally
independent
from other traffic;
with
high service frequency .
Those who prefer the terms "subway" (American) or "underground" (British) would additionally specify that the tracks and stations are:
located
below street level , in at least the most important places,
so that the streetscape is unaltered by the line's presence. In some cities the word "subway" applies to the entire system, in others only to those parts that are actually underground, but is commonly called as "Metro".
Those who prefer the terms "rapid transit" or "metro" tend to view this as a less important characteristic and include systems that are entirely elevated or at ground level ( at grade ).
Rapid transit systems that are above street level may be called "elevated" systems in the US, often shortened to
el
(or sometimes
L , as in
Chicago 'L' ). In the UK, elevated systems are generally classified as
light railways
such as the
Docklands Light Railway
(DLR) in east London - although not all British light railways are elevated.
For a more comprehensive listing showing names of this kind of system in cities around the world, see the
list of rapid transit systems .
Extent Edit
In larger metropolitan areas the underground system may extend only to the limits of the central city, or to its inner ring of
suburbs , with trains making relatively frequent station stops. The outer suburbs may then be reached by a separate
commuter ,
suburban
or
regional rail
network, where more widely spaced stations allow a higher speed. These trains are often more expensive, less frequent, and, in some cities, operate only during
rush hour
periods. Sometimes, for political reasons, commuter lines are operated by a separate authority that tends not to co-operate with the city's transit authority
(except in
Japan
and
South Korea , where the commuter routes are frequent in
suburbs
and form the backbone of the networks).
Many of these regional railways were first built to operate in one direction from a city centre terminus, but some have been extended across the city centre, sometimes running in tunnels. By making multiple stops in the city, they can offer suburban passengers a choice of stations and also provide useful
transportation
within the city. A notable example is the
Paris
RER
system, where (in co-operation with the city's transit authority) several pairs of existing suburban lines running in opposite directions from the city have been extended in tunnel to join up and form new through routes across the city. They are provided with frequent service and, within the city, the same fares as the
Métro
are charged, providing an integrated network. In
Tokyo
and
Osaka , Japan private companies operate the world's most extensive suburban railways, each with their own fare system that integrates with the entire system. In
German-speaking
countries, the Paris style system is called an
S-Bahn . In
Italian-speaking
countries such a system is called Linea S or Treno Suburbano, where as in Spain it is referred to as
Cercanías .
In some cases, such as the
San Francisco
Bay Area Rapid Transit
(BART) and
Washington
Metrorail
systems, the rapid transit system runs to the suburbs and effectively functions as a regional rail service as well. (Note, however, that the Washington, DC, area has two regional rail services as well:
VRE
and
MARC , and the San Francisco area has three:
Caltrain ,
ACE
and the soon-to-be-developed
SMART .) Where there are separate systems, the rapid transit system is typically a self-contained service with its own dedicated tracks and stations and technologically incompatible with other railways. Suburban rail services, on the other hand, often share tracks and stations with long-distance trains (historically they were usually operated by the same company, which also owned the rails and ran freight, although this has become less common) and are subject to the same standards and regulations. There are exceptions; some
London Underground
lines share tracks with suburban rail services. In some cases, underground railway lines have been extended by taking over existing regional rail lines, notably parts of the Central and Northern Lines in London. The
Athens Metro 's Blue Line shares tracks with suburban rail services in order to connect the metro to
Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport , but does not stop at the suburban rail stations because the platforms of the stations are a lot lower than the train's floor. In
Hong Kong
and
São Paulo ,
Brazil ], metro-like frequent service is provided by electrifying existing railway lines, while continuing to share the tracks with the much less frequent intercity and freight trains. The
KCR West Rail
in Hong Kong is designed to accommodate intercity and freight traffic in future, whilst at present provides only metro-like service.
The Tyne and Wear Metro in the North East of England is another Metro service which shares some of its tracks with suburban rail services.
The extension of the system to Sunderland sees the Metro sharing tracks with Northern train services between Sunderland and Pelaw.
Elevated railways were a popular way to build
mass transit
systems in cities around the turn of the
twentieth century , but they have fallen out of favour; and many elevated lines were later demolished, being replaced by subways or
buses . Elevated rail saw something of a resurgence in the late
twentieth century , with the construction of a number of new lines such as the
Docklands Light Railway
in
London
and the
Bangkok Skytrain
and
Vancouver SkyTrain ; in the
United States
a few such lines have been built, including the Atlanta's
MARTA , New York's
AirTrain JFK
and the
Las Vegas Monorail , but these are typically seen as more
futuristic , and are not representative of the overall trends in U.S. transit development.
Importance, functions, and station design Edit
The volume of passengers a metro train can carry is often quite high, and a metro system is often viewed as the
backbone
of a large city's public transportation system. In many cities passengers beginning their journeys on a streetcar/tram, bus, or suburban rail system must finish their journey into the city center on the metro as their first
mode of transport
will terminate at a metro station to avoid congesting the city center above ground.
Budapest
is a perfect example where the two more modern metro lines connect with buses and trams and also with two circular streetcar/tram routes (one closer to and one further from the city center) that allow travel between suburbs and also into the centre of the city by changing onto the metro.
In some cities, the urban rail system is so comprehensive and efficient that the majority of city residents use it as their primary means of transport.
London ,
Moscow ,
New York City ,
Madrid ,
Paris ,
Seoul ,
Tokyo
and
Osaka
are such examples; these cities have the most extensive and convenient
metro
systems in the world. In greater
Tokyo , by far the world's most extensive rail system for any
metropolitan area , the region's 15-line subway network is a mere fraction of the over 75
heavy rail
lines, transporting well over 20 million people daily, where the majority of suburban residents in addition to city dwellers do not own automobiles and depend on rail as the primary means of travel.
Osaka , Japan is similar to Tokyo's system except about half as big, but still has a ridership exceeding that of New York City. In Europe,
London
(in 1st place) and
Madrid
(in the second one) have the biggest metro systems.
Due to a general low population density and a different urban plan, many cities in the
United States
have very low rates of transit usage. About one in every three users of mass transit in the United States and two-thirds of the nation's rail riders live in just one city: New York (see
Transportation in New York City ). Older cities such as
Chicago ,
Washington, D.C. ,
Boston , and
Philadelphia
follow New York, while the rest of the cities in the United States have only partial or poorly-used systems, especially in
sunbelt
cities such as
Phoenix ,
Los Angeles ,
Atlanta ,
Dallas ,
Las Vegas
or
Houston .
In the
Western Hemisphere ,
Mexico City
also has a large system. In Canada, only
Toronto
and
Montreal
have extensive metro networks serving their urban centers (see
Toronto subway and RT
and
Montreal Metro );
Vancouver 's
SkyTrain
also provides high-grade service, but at present acts primarily as a connection between Vancouver and the surrounding area. This is scheduled to change by 2009, when the first of two new lines will be completed.
Most underground systems are for public transportation, but a few cities have built freight or
postal
lines. One example was the
Post Office Railway , which transported mail underground between sorting offices in
London
from 1927 until it was abandoned in 2003. Similarly, until the 1970s the
London Underground 's Circle Line (originally the Metropolitan Railway) transported goods as well as running passenger trains. Another example was the
Chicago Tunnel Company , which had a dense grid of tunnels under downtown
Chicago .
During the
Cold War
an important secondary function of some underground systems was to provide shelter in case of a nuclear attack.
Urban rail systems have often been used to showcase economic, social, and technological achievements of a nation, especially in the
Soviet Union
and other
Communist
countries. With their marble walls, polished granite floors and splendid mosaics, the metro systems of
Moscow
and St. Petersburg are widely regarded as some of the most beautiful in the world. Modern metro stations in
Russia
are usually still built with the same emphasis on appearance. Similarly, the
Independent Subway System
in
New York City
was built to compete with the private
IRT
and
BMT
systems.

Technology Edit
Main article:
Rapid transit technology
Most rapid transit trains are
electric
multiple units . Power is commonly delivered by a
third rail , or in systems without much length in tunnel, by
overhead wires , for example the
Tyne and Wear Metro
in North East England. Most run on conventional steel railway tracks, although some use
rubber tires . Crew sizes have decreased throughout history, with some modern systems now running completely unstaffed trains. The method of tunnel construction used varies from place to place, depending on the situation.
Cut-and-cover
tunnels are constructed by digging up city streets, which are then rebuilt over the tunnel. Alternatively,
tunnel-boring machines
can be used to dig deep-bore tunnels.
History Edit
Before any plans were made for transit systems with underground tunnels and stations, several railway operators built tunnels for their trains, usually to reduce the
grade
of the railway line. Examples include
Trevithick's Tunnel
from 1804, built for the
Penydarren locomotive .
[3]
The
London Underground , usually referred to by Londoners simply as "the Underground" or more familiarly "the Tube", began operations on January 10, 1863 on the
Metropolitan Railway . The Underground currently serves 274
stations
and runs over 253  miles
( 408 km ) of lines. There are also a number of stations and tunnels that are
now closed , some of which can be seen from trains.
In Chicago on
World's Columbian Exposition
1893 ran the first
electrically driven
elevated railway
the "Intramural Railway".
A major breakthrough in the development of modern electrically driven rapid transit occurred when the American
inventor
Frank J. Sprague
successfully tested his system of
multiple-unit train control
(MUTC) on the Chicago L in 1897. MUTC, which allowed all the motors in an entire train to be dependably controlled from a single point, freed rapid transit systems from dependence on
locomotive -hauled coaches.
The first underground railway in continental Europe was the
Tünel , an underground 573-meter
funicular
between the quarters of
Beyoğlu
and
Galata
in the European part of
Istanbul , completed in 1875 by French engineers on behalf of the
Ottoman Empire . It rarely figures as continental Europe's first metro, though, partly because of its limited length, partly because the cars were pulled by horses until the line was converted to electric operation in 1910. After the Tünel, the first underground railway to be completed in continental Europe was opened in
Budapest
in 1896, after only two years of construction. It stretches from
Vörösmarty tér
(the city centre) to
City Park
and the local zoo, over a total length of 3.7 km (2.3 mi). It is now part of the
Budapest Metro
and remains largely in its original state, with the original cars modernised and the stations restored in keeping with their original design, and with the route the same except for a very short extension north to
Mexikói út
to connect with the city's tram network. It lays claim to a second title, that is the first electric underground railway with overhead cables, like the Newcastle system, rather than the more common third rail in the world. The 10.4 km (6.5 mi)
Glasgow Subway
in
Scotland
opened the same year and used
cable haulage
until it was electrified in 1935.
The first line of the
Paris Metro
opened in 1900. Its full name was the
Chemin de Fer Métropolitain , a direct translation into
French
of London's
Metropolitan Railway . The name was shortened to
métro , and many other languages have since borrowed this word. The Berlin
U-Bahn
(for
underground railway ) opened in 1902; because large sections of the line were elevated, it was also called
Hochbahn
( high railway ) until the 1920s.
Boston
has the oldest subway tunnel in the United States that is still in use, part of the
Green Line
downtown, dating from 1897. The original construction was a short four-track tunnel downtown, with only two stations, built to take
light rail
cars from outlying areas off the streets. Later subways in Boston carried full-size trains; the Green Line still operates with
light rail
equipment. In 1901, heavy rail trains began to use the tunnel as part of the original configuration of the
Main Line Elevated , the first elevated railway in Boston.
The
New York City Subway , which has become the world's largest (by some measures), did not open its first section until 1904, but this was a fully independent four-track line, stretching 9 miles (14.5 km) from
City Hall
to
145th Street . Extensions were soon built, reaching
the Bronx
and
Brooklyn ; this is now part of the
IRT
system. Two major subway systems, operated by the
BMT
and the
IND
were constructed later, and many pre-existing
elevated railway
lines were incorporated into the
BMT
and
IRT
systems. The
Hudson and Manhattan Railroad , which also opened a subway tunnel in
Manhattan
in 1908 and connected with
New Jersey , remained a separate railroad company, and later came under the control of the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
as the
Port Authority Trans-Hudson
(PATH). New York City subway trains now run on right-of-way first used in 1863, and converted
R44
subway cars run on the 1860
Staten Island Railway .
In
Italy
the first line was built for the 1906
World Exhibition Fair
in
Milan . It was an elevated light rail that linked the two main areas of the fair. The line was dismantled eight years later.
In 1907, the first line in
Philadelphia , now part of the
Market-Frankford Line , began running on both elevated and underground structures.
The oldest subway in the
Southern Hemisphere ] opened in 1913 in
Buenos Aires ,
Argentina , which is also the oldest one in
Latin America
and the
Spanish-speaking world . [4]
The system is now known as
El Subte .
In
Madrid
the metro opened on October 17, 1919 under the direction of the Compañía de Metro
Alfonso XIII . Metro stations served as air raid shelters during the
Spanish Civil War .
Asia's oldest commuter
heavy rail
lines are in Japan, with private companies
Meitetsu
railways ( Nagoya ) opening in 1895, and
Tokyo 's
Keihin Kyūkō
in 1896, both still serving dense urbanized areas. Asia's first cities to have subway lines are
Tokyo
in 1927 and
Osaka
in 1933. Japan's rail system is quite different from others in that the vast majority of its rapid transit is above ground, and privately owned and operated, and train stations blur the distinction between vast underground malls and corporate skyscrapers and gigantic high rise department stores. Train stations in Japan, like highways in the US, become the center and backbone of town and create their own skyline, especially in suburbs like
Saitama
and
Fujisawa . Other major Japanese cities also have subway systems, including
Yokohama ,
Nagoya ,
Sapporo ,
Kobe ,
Kyoto ,
Fukuoka , and
Sendai .
The first underground in the former
USSR
(in Russian метрополитен
metropoliten
or метро
metro ) opened in 1935 in
Moscow . The first line — between
Sokolniki
and
Park Kul'tury
— was 11.2 km long. And the project of one of the first stations,
Krasniye Vorota , was awarded a Grand Prix at the 1937
World's Fair
in Paris. The
Moscow metro
is one of the most elaborately decorated undergrounds of the world, with its stations often being called
underground palaces . (As of 2005, the Moscow metro has 278 kilometers of railways and 171 stations.) In Russia and other republics of the former Soviet Union as a whole, subways opened in
Saint Petersburg
(1955),
Kiev
(1960),
Tbilisi
(1965),
Baku
(1967),
Kharkov
(1975),
Tashkent
(1977),
Yerevan
(1981),
Minsk
(1984),
Nizhniy Novgorod
(1985),
Novosibirsk
( 1986 ),
Samara
(1987),
Yekaterinburg
(1991),
Dnipropetrovsk
(1995),
Kazan
(2005). In
Volgograd
and
Kryvyi Rih
in 1980s a "metrotram" opened – it runs underground, along with common city trams.
In 1959, a metro system was inaugurated in
Lisbon , called
Metropolitano de Lisboa . It was the first underground rail system in the
Portuguese -speaking world.
In the past 30 years, a number of cities in Korea have also developed modern and
extensive subway systems. The largest,
Seoul , has nine lines over approximately 178 miles of track (approximately 287 km).
Pyongyang ,
Busan ,
Daegu ,
Incheon ,
Gwangju
and
Daejeon
also have subway systems.
China
and
India
are rapidly expanding their urban rail systems as well.
The
Toronto Subway
opened in 1954. One experimental trainset consisted of the first aluminum subway cars, which reduced weight and therefore operating costs. [5]
With the next car order in 1963, only aluminum was used. The new cars, at 75 feet/23 m, were at the time the longest in the world. The
Montreal Metro , was the second
subway system
in
Canada
and was inaugurated in 1966 as part of
Expo 67
that would be held in
Montreal .
In
Brazil , the first underground opened in 1974 in
São Paulo , and now carries some four million passengers on an average weekday as part of the
São Paulo Metro . Part of it consists of converted older railways; some of its stations actually date from the 1880s. Underground lines have been built also in
Rio de Janeiro ,
Belo Horizonte ,
Recife ,
Porto Alegre
and
Brasília .
Metro de Santiago
is the metro system serving
Santiago , the capital of the
Republic of Chile . It is a network of five lines with a total of 85 stations.
The
Washington Metro
in
Washington, D.C.
opened in 1976, as part of changing attitudes towards transportation in the
United States , leading to subway systems opening in many cities that had done without.
In 1979,
Hong Kong 's subway line, the
MTR , began operations. It currently has seven lines, including four that run underneath
Victoria Harbour . By 1982, the British section of the Kowloon-Canton Railway, now known as
KCR East Rail , started to provide metro-like service upon electrification was completed.
1987 saw the
Mass Rapid Transit
in
Singapore
open. It was the world's first
heavy rail
system to feature
platform screen doors . The country made news again by having the world's first automated heavy rail system. The network has three lines with another one to be ready by 2010.
The most recently completed fully underground heavy rail metro line in
North America
is the
LACMTA Red Line
in
Los Angeles , which goes from Union Station in downtown Los Angeles, through the mid-Wilshire area, East Hollywood, central
Hollywood , and ending 17 miles away in
North Hollywood
in the
San Fernando Valley . Construction was started on this line in 1986 and completed in 2000. In autumn 2005, several politicians including Los Angeles mayor [[Wikipedia:[Antonio Villaraigosa|[Antonio Villaraigosa]] indicated a desire to complete the originally conceived subway route along
Wilshire Boulevard
to
West Los Angeles
and
Santa Monica .
Similarities to light rail Edit
There has always been some crossover between rapid transit and "lighter"
streetcar/tram
systems. For example, some lines of the
Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company
in
New York City
were elevated in built-up areas and ran at street level, often along streets, in less crowded areas.
In many German cities, such as Hanover, the opposite applies, with
trams
descending into tunnels to cross the city centre.
In the other direction,
interurban streetcars
provided rapid transit-style transit from cities to suburbs and other cities, running mainly on separate
rights-of-way
(sometimes sharing tracks with
intercity rail ) but using
streetcar
equipment. Most interurbans have been abandoned, but some (like the
Norristown High Speed Line
near
Philadelphia ) have been reconstructed to rapid transit specifications.
Additionally, many streetcar/tram systems include underground and (less commonly) elevated sections, in which everything about the system except the right-of-way is built to streetcar standards. Notably, the first subway in the
United States ,
Boston 's
Green Line , opened in 1897 to take streetcars off downtown streets, though it did carry elevated trains from 1901 until the
Washington Street Subway
opened. Likewise,
San Francisco 's
Market Street Subway
carries
Muni Metro
light rail on the upper tracks and
Bay Area Rapid Transit
metro trains on the lower level.
The coming of modern
light rail
in the 1970s brought new crossovers. New systems were built and old streetcar/tram systems were upgraded with higher capacity and speeds, but retaining some aspects of streetcars and trams. Some systems known as
light rail , such as the
Docklands Light Railway
in
London ,
Manchester Metrolink
in
Manchester ,
UK
and
New York City 's
AirTrain JFK , are rapid transit systems but commonly described as light rail (though some argue the
light rail
in AirTrain's case may be due to its common use to describe
Bombardier 's
Advanced Rapid Transit ). Indeed, in a many Asian countries,
light rail
is usually used to refer to some sort of rapid transit system but not used to refer to street cars or trams. Other light-rail systems may use high platforms but otherwise run as streetcars. A few systems similar to
interurban streetcars
have come back, such as
New Jersey 's
River LINE , which operates over freight rails for most of its trip, and along streets on one end. The
KCR Light Rail , which runs as streetcars, operates with high platforms, with some of its sections elevated or street level right-of-way, and some at ground-level by away from streets.
