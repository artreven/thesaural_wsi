Alice, Texas
Posted by graywacke on March 7, 2009
First timer? In this once-a-day blog, I have my computer select a random latitude and longitude that puts me somewhere in the continental United States (the lower 48). I call this “landing.” I keep track of the watersheds I land in, as well as the town I land near. I do some internet research to hopefully find something of interest about my landing location. To find out more about A Landing A Day (like who “Dan” is and what the various numbers and abbreviations mean), please see “About Landing,” above.
Dan –  Well, thanks, LG.  I needed a three for four and I got it.  When I’m down, what state is the most likely to come to the rescue?  Of course!!  It’s . . . TX, 114/147; 5/10; 1; 166.5.
For the 10 th
time, I landed in the Nueces R watershed (on to the G of M).
I landed north of Alice, the county seat of Jim Wells County.  Here’s my landing map (today’s landing is the centrally-located one):
A bunch of cool Texas names (besides Alice):  Ben Bolt, Agua Dulce, Banquette, Edroy and Alfred.  This is going to be one of those a little of this, a little of that posts . . .
I must start with Edroy, from Texasescapes.com
History in a Pecan shell
The land around the present town of Edroy was owned by John Welder of
Victoria .  When the railroad came through from
San Antonio
to
Corpus Christi , Ed Cubage and Roy Miller combined their assets and their first names to form Edroy.
A post office opened in 1914 but closed in 1917.  It reopened in 1950 and remains open today.
I also was opened (born) in 1950 and remain open (alive) today!!!  Wow.  Such a thing to have in common with the Edroy Post office!  Continuing from Wiki:
Edroy was a major shipping point for vegetables; Edroy’s aging water tower may date back to that time.
Here’s a picture of the “aging water tower.”
Back to Wiki:
The economy of Edroy has always been agriculture. Mexican laborers in the 30s are said to have hand grubbed the fields to prepare them for planting.
Today half of Edroy is comprised of grain elevators.
There you have it.  I love that last line from Wiki.  I mean half of how many towns are comprised of grain elevators?
So, here’s an interesting Edroy picture (with the caption below):

And here’s a picture of a wonderful tree in Edroy:
Well, I should get back to Alice.
I love the logo!  From Wiki:
Alice
is a city in and the
county seat
of
Jim Wells County ,
Texas ,
United States .  The population was 19,010 at the
2000 census .  Alice was established in 1888.  First it was called
Bandana , then
Kleberg
and finally Alice after
Alice Gertrudis King Kleberg , the daughter of
Richard King , who established the
King Ranch .
Oh my!  The famous King Ranch.  Also from Wiki:
King Ranch , located in south
Texas
between
Corpus Christi
and
Brownsville , is one of the world’s largest
ranches
(85% as large as
Rhode Island ). It is the largest ranch in the United States.  The 825,000  acres
ranch, founded in 1853 by Captain
Richard King
includes portions of six Texas counties, including most of
Kleberg County
and much of
Kenedy County , with portions extending into
Brooks ,
Jim Wells ,
Nueces , and
Willacy
counties.
The ranch does not consist of one single contiguous plot of land, but rather four large sections called
divisions . Only two of the four divisions border each other, and that border is relatively short. The ranch was designated a
National Historic Landmark
in 1961.
Here’s a map:
You can see Alice way up north.  Anyway, about Richard King:
Born in
New York City
into a poor Irish family, King was indentured as an apprentice to a jeweler in
Manhattan
at the age of nine.  In 1835, he ran away from his indenture, stowing away on ship bound for
Mobile, Alabama .  Upon discovery, he was adopted into the crew and trained in navigation, becoming a
steamboat
pilot by the age of sixteen.
While serving in the end of the
Second Seminole War
in 1842, he met
Mifflin Kenedy , who would later become his partner.  From 1842 to 1847, King would operate steamboats on the
Apalachicola
and
Chattahoochee
rivers, in
Florida
and
Georgia .
(I’ve had 2 hits in the Chattahoochee River watershed.  The Chattahoochee flows to the Apalachicola, with 6 hits).
During the
Mexican-American War , King’s friend Kenedy enlisted as ship master, running men and supplies to the
United States Army
along the
Rio Grande River .  In 1850, following the war, King and Kenedy formed King, Kenedy and Company.  This firm achieved “nearly monopolistic” control on the Rio Grande for most of the years between 1850 and 1874, when the partnership was dissolved.
As soon as King had arrived in Texas, he began speculating in land, beginning with lots in
Brownsville, Texas
and
Cameron County, Texas , and continued investing the large profits from the riverboat firm.  The “King Ranch” was born.
Here’s a picture of the famous “Running W” brand from the King Ranch:
While no one knows (or fesses up to) the origin of the brand, it seems likely to me it has to do with a certain common rattlesnake:
I’ll finish up with this shot of sunflowers just outside of Orange Grove:
