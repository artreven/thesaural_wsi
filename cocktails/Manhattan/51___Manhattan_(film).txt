Traditions & Turkey Day...
We've had so many "traditions" as we've moved around.
What traditions do you embrace? We'll be eating something with turkey at Sarah Beth's restaurant in NYC once more.  We may be ogling the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade floats the night before the event.  We might be avoiding the crowds that day.  We might have a good perch from Trump Tower as we have been lucky to do in the past.   You might find us walking through Central Park as we did the day after Thanksgiving last year when my daughter got engaged. Little bit of Broadway, wee speck of shopping.
We have to go back to remember, go back to close the past, go back to move forward into our present future.
You? The International Folk Art Museum folks would ask you to scrutinize your cultural traditions, why you do what you do and the role you play in how you do that day.
Janet , the Kentucky transplant blogger and Pooh fan had a link to a quiz  and I found out that
at least I am NOT STUFFY. HA. You go take the test.  What are you?
I Am The Stuffing
I'm  complicated and complex, yet all my pieces fit together. People miss me if you're gone - but they're not sure why.
What Part of Thanksgiving Are You?

Stuff to Buy...
The window displays in NYC are, like those in Paris, enticing and artsy.  For the first time ever, all of Macy's store windows at their flagship NYC store were devoted to one designer -- all for
Martha Stewart's new collection
(some 2,000 things) exclusively sold through the Macy's stores. It is the single biggest private label launch in Macy's history, according to the Washington Post.  Macy's is the largest department store in the world.
There has been a flattening of the markets so that designer goods are no longer commanding the cachet.  People can go buy more inexpensive replicas of fashion items because today's fashion can be duplicated instantaneously.
It was interesting to read my reader's comments on the
article
about the 100th anniversary of Neiman's...
Bellaza
commented about the Neiman's anniversary catalogue, "they seem nothing more than an icon to superficiality and materialism.
From one who loves beautiful things, I was truly annoyed at the lack of
meaning I found in anything within its pages. I guess the beautiful
things I love are more in the world, or at least down to earth."
I think Bellaza's thoughts are typical of many who are not blinded by commercialism.
New York shopping holds a certain appeal for a population that lives on the streets and the commercial world is so ever-present, and for visitors, too.  Somehow products that "lift-off" there impact the marketing of the products elsewhere.  The marriage of Martha and Macy's is culturally interesting.  It comes well after the strategic example set by
Target , with its design partners including architect Michael Graves and New York fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi.  I never saw a Target when I lived in Manhattan.

Life: Eating It Up...
You can eat up life or it can eat you up.  Now that I've left the Big Apple*,   I'd like to say I ate it up.
Crunch crunch.
* ( note the redefinition:
Big Apple in terms of NYC is now the
new Apple Store
on Fifth Avenue, generating more revenue per square foot than any other store.

On Elmeretta Fudd & Being Fuddly
Or alternatively, the headline: On Being Ernestly Elmeretta-ish. Like the country bumpkin of yester-yore, the myopic world view of the urban-est eastern establishment, culture trend-setting opinionistas is that anything
not here
is over-there-square.  It isn't just here; it is everywhere.  I tried to raise my children to chart their own sense of their tunes and to find their own path and not look to others to define their sense of self.  There has to be a biological drive to "fit in" and, in a place like NYC where many people come from elsewhere, maybe this is a swan song.  However so many people come from so many places that refreshing differences are more the norm.
Still, I'm hearing here: You're cool or you're
Elmer Fudd .  A new buzz-word for Hicksville residents and an in-arbiter word that my ears (or eyes, reading about western fashion trends) pick up, or just a regional thing and I'm the new one?
Right? I write, I just report.  You tell me.  Where is Fuddsville, I wonder.   Does it have anything to do with the rising popularity of country music?   I think NYC doesn't even have a country music station.  Mount a Broadway play and mine this I say.  Cultural fodder, for sure.

Ramble: Best Musical?
Art should make you think.  A Broadway show is a live art piece of production.   The theatre was definitely full of electricity - the performers excited about all of the
Tony Awards
this Best Musical brought in and this was their first performance since Sunday's awards night.  The crowd was excited, too.
Spring Awakenings
is a musical of teenage sexual anxiety that mixes a setting in the past with modern (or timeless?) issues and I wonder how many tourists will flock to it with their children or parents in tow and not realize that, as we saw Kevin Spacey masturbate in the opening scene of the film
American Beauty,
a "teenage" boy sits facing front on stage and does the same.  My mother didn't like
American Beauty
at all because of that scene - she, who remembers the whole theatre gasping when Rhett Butler said a cuss word ("Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.") in
Gone with the Wind.
I would not take her to see this.  She would not find the on-stage bare-breasted, buttocks-exposed missionary position sex scene appealing in the least and she would not like the gay kissing although many in the audience must have related and thought the lines funny.
A mother of a 13-ish girl, in line for the bathroom at intermission, asked her daughter, "what do you think of it?" and the daughter replied, "well, I like the music."  It looks to be an appealing show for the 20-something set who has grown up with nothing private, nothing kept back.   Maybe if art is to generate thinking of things in a new way, it might.  It might make people think of times when sex had consequences and was not considered fodder for explicit conversation.   Like not talking about politics or religion at dinner.  It had that edge to it and it might have been more jolting had we not been exposed to Britney kissing Madonna.  Sexual edginess keeps creeping in our culture - very gallavantingly Romanesque in the empire-peak cavorting period.  It is a very American play, in that way.
This is the yen to the ying of the Lion King, Mary Poppins, Wicked and such.   We really liked Wicked.

This Purse Thing: A Trenchant Cultural Sign
The over-the-top purse frenzy is in full steam in NYC , lemme tell ya.  My first clue was when my daughter asked for a Fendi B bag for her birthday last year, after only one year in Manhattan, and I went to the Fifth Avenue to price them and I was absolutely speechless that she would think I would buy a purse that costs over $1,000 for her.   It isn't just here in Manhattan, I've discovered.  An SMU college student was featured in the school's student newspaper this spring for spending something like $40,000 on designer bags (they also spend for
plastic surgery
but maybe that is another story).   Hello?
But my daughter has a sharp eye so this investigative journalist checked out every on-the-street hand bag knock-off vendor on Madison and Fifth Avenues to see what was hot (and yes, I bought).  After checking out the first vendor, she called on the cell and her advice is this: buy Chloe and Mark Jacobs knock-offs as Chloe purses are so expensive that no one will really know the tell-tale signs of the real vs. the  fake.
I'm just not a fashionista so my fashion reportage might just be the same as my real-life experience and my daughter, when she sees my purchases, will probably say: Mom, you just don't get it.
I wonder:
will these ever be appreciable assets over time?   Certainly this can't  be a wise investment.
Curators, host an exhibit.  There's got to be something to this, culturally.

Yipee! Tony Awards...
Yesterday afternoon I saw Welsh actor Michael Sheen playing David Frost in the Broadway play
Frost/Nixon
and I completely forgot that he had done a smash-up job playing Tony Blair in The Queen and I didn't realize it was the same actor until I read the review this morning.  Drats.  I missed a detail. Actor Frank Langella, playing Nixon, just won a
Tony Award
for his role.  I'm sure they were all nervous about the Tony Awards that night.  I wanted to see the play because of my interest in media, particularly.  Nixon learned how to position himself.  The book, The Selling of the President, is a landmark book on branding candidates and his nationally televised Checker's speech is a study in creating an image.  I studied both in political communications as part of my media studies curriculum.
My dear husband was able to get tickets to Spring Awakening and I just received a call checking to see if I was planning on being present tomorrow night and that the order wasn't a "spam" order.  Ha!  With all of the Tony awards
it has just won , I'm sure demand for the Best Musical is out the roof.  I can't wait.
One of my girlfriends came to spend a few days with me before the movers come so she was with me.  Let me tell you that the Fifth Avenue parade honoring everything Puerto Rican was a real hitch in our plans to get down to Times Square with stops to the MET along the way.  It made me think I was not in NYC but on that island, swimming through Central Park against the boistrous flood of (red-white-blue striped one-star) flag-waving waves of over one-million by-standers rushing to celebrate the Parade.   Eee-Gad. There must be more Puerto Ricans here than there.
I would have paid more attention to Michael Sheen had I remembered his previous role as Blair.  I'm reading
the review
of Spring Awakening before I go.    My tv is disconnected so we didn't watch the
Tony Awards
but here is the list of winners.  Had I been here longer, I might have tried to see the three-part nine-hour Best Play The Coast of Utopia.  Gotta save something for next time.   I should be doing my emails before we run off down Madison.  OK. OK. I will.

Manhattan: The Movie, The Reality...
Woody Allen's 1979
Manhattan
is filmed in black and white.  It shows a
classic Manhattan -- bustling streets, the fundamental axis hub of Central Park, the intellectual nature
and sense of spaces, both public and private -- that is still relevant.  Knowing I'm leaving Manhattan, I wanted to think about how the city is different from when Woody Allen filmed it without color.  For one, the phone booths are gone and
although black is the color of this city (at least for clothing), it has become red, white and blue, too.   The street life is still vibrant but people shut out the clamour with i-Pods or, with people all around, chat incessantly into cell phones to people who aren't with them physically.
The conversation is much faster now than it was in the movie
Allen made that also showcases his interior life and views of the city  -- he plays the central character and it also stars Diane Keaton, Meryl Streep and Mariel Hemingway with music by  Gershwin.
Then things were slower.
Crime was a problem then while NYC today, crime-wise, is one of the safest cities around.  Today terror threats and barricades and flags everywhere remind people that the city has changed and
fear has become a factor of living and while things may seem black and white, good and evil in this blue city in this blue state, today it is black and blue still from 9/11 and patriotic.
The biggest flag I've found is this one on the New York Stock Exchange.  Or maybe it is a new sign of protection for our national financial and other interests.

Imagine...
How you live in a city and how you visit a city as a tourist is always an interesting adventure, either way.  I had visited NYC several times before I moved here a little over 18 months ago.  But having my brother come as a first-time visitor,
it was interesting to see the city again from a new tourist perspective.
I'd never been to Strawberry Fields, Yoko Ono's tribute to John Lennon after his death.  It is in a little area in Central Park on the west side near the Dakota where they lived and where he was fatally shot. My brother wanted to see this. As we passed all of the sidewalk vendors along Central Park on the Upper East Side and down around the Plaza Hotel, we saw a lot of Beatles and Paul McCartney memorabilia for sale. Strawberry Fields had a lot of graying hippies and boomers hanging around.
I didn't realize the peace sign was spelled out in roses until I put the digital pic on the computer.  At the time I was just noticing all the crowds around me trying to snap a photo, too.
Imagine:  a stop along the pilgrimage of our collective cultural memories.

Activist Elders and Others...
These
Grandmothers Against the War
were demonstrating at Rockefeller Center this week.  I wondered if NYC blogger
Naomi
was there.  She is a concerned activist and very concerned also about the
rising incidence of HIV in women over 50.
My brother is also an activist and works to educate people about HIV and is on the board of Eagle County Red Ribbon Project (Vail Valley, Colorado).  As we stood watching these women, I wondered how we identify bloggers we know only online...  She's a VLF, not a RLF (virtual life friend vs. real life friend).
He is here this week helping me with lots of tech problems.  I've had to completely erase my PC hard drive.  It has taken all week to work on our family tech problems.   We have a lot of play time built in to all of this.
Those who volunteer time to help make our world a better place
-- whatever the cause -- are not only people to appreciate but their
lives are lived thinking beyond their own sphere.
This is one of the keys to happiness.  I appreciate my brother's volunteer time to help me fix my tech woes and the woes and needs of my husband and children.  Soon I'll be up and running (online) but I still enjoy the face time with my brother.
