Stop Whining About Cocktails and Enjoy the Revolution's Well-Poured Drinks
Written by

“Cocktails have jumped the shark.”
I hear this every so often from jaded food writers and even a few of my colleagues at
Bon Appétit . I just listen to them and then go drown my sorrows in an expertly made
Sazerac . I have to remind them that it wasn’t too long ago that you had a better chance of winning the lottery than finding a properly made
Manhattan .
Today, every city has at least one spot that takes their drinks seriously. Do these cocktail naysayers want to go back to the dark ages of drinks when orange juice and vodka qualified as a proper tipple? Not me. No thanks.
Admittedly, there are certain aspects of this new cocktail world I could do without. For starters, there are the bartenders, I mean mixologists, who are more concerned with lecturing you about your drink choice rather than actually making it. Fortunately, they are the exception. The price of cocktails at certain spots can be a bit shocking. $18 for Tequila Smash? Really? Anytime you have a hot trend (pork belly! kimchi tacos! cocktails!) you are going to get places taking advantage of it, thinking they can just throw a few belly sliders or fancy cocktails on the menu and charge whatever they want without quality control. Those places are easy to spot (telltale signs: sloppy bartenders, only one kind of bitters, and a menu that doesn’t change) and should be avoided. All in all, we at
Bon Appétit
will continue to support the cocktail and spirit revolution by profiling smart bartenders, new and classic spirits, and timeless drinks.
And just in case you are wondering how far the cocktail movement has come, take a look at the cover of the April catalogue of Pottery Barn. Yep, that’s right, Pottery Barn. It reads:
The Home Bartender: The Art of the Cocktail . Inside, you can buy a bar and hutch set for $2,000 as well as an array of bar tools and glassware including a jigger, zester, strainer, and bar spoon. I’m just waiting for the day when I visit my parents and my mom offers me a
Ramos Gin Fizz . Until then, I’ll enjoy the cocktail renaissance.
Need liquid proof that the cocktail boom isn’t dead? Here are three new spots where the staff knows how to mix a drink.
Esquire Bar , San Antonio After a four years of darkness, San Antonio’s classic watering hole, featuring the longest bar in Texas (77-feet, exactly), recently reopened with a revamped cocktail program.
Bar Congress , Austin Chef David Bull’s restaurant trifecta (Congress, Second Bar & Kitchen, and Bar Congress) is home to one of Austin’s best barkeeps, Adam Bryan. (I also dig the drinks Bill Norris is doing nearby at
Haddingtons .) Try the Preferred Lies cocktail (Earl Grey infused Bourbon, apple drinking vinegar, Cangon Ginger foam)
Aviary , Chicago I’m still trying to wrap my head around
what I’ve seen (and heard) about Grant Achatz’s new bar adjacent to his new restaurant, Next. There’s liquid nitrogen in play as well as foams and small-batch spirits. There’s also no bar, per se, just a cocktail kitchen with no bottles in sight.
Also, if you’ve had a cocktail recently that you loved and want the recipe for it,
email me
and I’ll try to get it.
Friday is drinks day
here at the
BA Blog
so look for your cocktail then.
