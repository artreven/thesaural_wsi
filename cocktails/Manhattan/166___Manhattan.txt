Character
Middle Park East shares the same characteristics with its neighbouring districts, Lancaster and Hatton Gardens. Middle Park East contains a variety of several high-rise apartments and commercial buildings, including one of Niko's safehouses. It is assumed that many businessmen in Algonquin reside in Middle Park East, since the area is filled with businessmen walking around. Unlike
Middle Park West , these two neighborhoods have opposite personalities. Middle Park West and its surrounding area are centered on the arts and culture, whereas Middle Park East and its neighbours are more focused on business and commerce.
Influence
It is based on the
Upper East Side , a high-end residential/commercial neighborhood in
Manhattan .
