Godzilla
is a 1998 American
science fiction
monster film
directed and co-written by
Roland Emmerich . A reimagining of the popular
Japanese film monster of the same name , the film focuses on a giant reptilian monster, mutated by nuclear tests in
French Polynesia , that migrates to New York City to nest its young. The cast features
Matthew Broderick ,
Maria Pitillo ,
Hank Azaria ,
Kevin Dunn
and
Jean Reno . The film is dedicated to the memory of Godzilla franchise producer and creator
Tomoyuki Tanaka , who died during the film's production.
The film was a co-production between
Centropolis Entertainment
and
TriStar Pictures , with TriStar distributing theatrically, and
Sony Pictures Entertainment
for home media. It is the 23rd film in the
Godzilla film series
and the first Godzilla film to be completely filmed and produced by a Hollywood studio, [ note 1 ]
and also marks the only time that producer Devlin and director Emmerich worked on a film based on established source material not of their own.
The film was released on May 20, 1998. The film grossed $136 million domestically and $379 million worldwide at the end of its theatrical run. [ 2 ]
The film was met with a negative reception from critics and fans alike. Criticism highlighted by film critics included the film's script, acting, and directing [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
while fans targeted the film's drastic reinvention of Godzilla, which included its radical redesign and departure from the source material. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
Planned sequels were abandoned and an
animated series
was produced instead. In later years, producer Devlin and director Emmerich have admitted to the film's faults, with Devlin admitting that he "screwed up" his version of Godzilla [ 12 ]
while Emmerich admitted that he was "never a big Godzilla fan." [ 13 ] [ 14 ]
In later years, TriStar's Godzilla became recognized as a stand-alone character and was officially
retconned
as " Zilla " by Toho (the license owners) for future appearances. [ 11 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]
The character has since appeared in other media as "Zilla". [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ]

Plot
Following a nuclear test in
French Polynesia , the fallout irradiates a lizard's nest. Decades later, an enormous sea creature suddenly attacks a Japanese fishing vessel in the South Pacific, leaving only one fisherman alive. Dr. Niko "Nick" Tatopoulos, an
NRC
biologist, is sent to
Tahiti
and to
Jamaica , where a wrecked village, footprints, and ship are found. Nick collects skin samples that lead him to believe the creature is an enormous mutant created by nuclear testing. It travels to
New York City
during the rainiest week of the season, leaving a path of destruction in its wake.
The city is evacuated before the military attempts to kill it but fails in an initial attempt. Nick later collects a blood sample, and after performing a pregnancy test, discovers that the creature reproduces asexually and is collecting food for its offspring. Aspiring journalist and ex-girlfriend of Nick's, Audrey Timmonds, uncovers a tape in his possession containing classified information about the creature. However, her superior, Charles Caiman, appropriates the tape as his own and broadcasts it on television, revealing the creature's nuclear origins in French Polynesia and its name, spoken by the surviving fisherman: " Gojira ", but Caiman jumbles it up as
"Godzilla" . Nick is then removed from the operation, and abandons Audrey. Soon, he is kidnapped by Philippe Roaché, an "insurance guy" he met before coming to Manhattan. Revealing himself as an agent of the French secret service, Philippe and his colleagues have been keeping close watch on the events and plan to cover up their country's role in the nuclear testing that spawned Godzilla. Suspecting a nest somewhere in the city, they cooperate with Nick to trace and destroy it.
Following a second military attempt to kill Godzilla, the creature dives into the
Hudson River
to escape. Attacked by US Navy submarines, it sinks to the river bed, presumably killed. Meanwhile, Nick and Philippe's strike team, followed by Audrey and her cameraman Victor "Animal" Palotti, find the nest inside
Madison Square Garden
and locate over 200 eggs. Before the French succeed in destroying them, the eggs suddenly hatch and the offspring attack the strike team, killing most of them. Nick, Animal, Audrey and Philippe take refuge in the Garden's broadcast booth and send out a live news-report to alert the military of what will happen if the offspring escape. A prompt response involving an airstrike is initiated as the four escape moments before Air Force jets bomb the arena. Audrey and Nick reunite, before the adult Godzilla, however, having survived, emerges from the Garden's ruins. It chases the four across Manhattan, believing them responsible for the deaths of its young. After a taxi chase, they manage to trap Godzilla within the
Brooklyn Bridge
where the returning Air Force jets manage to shoot it down. Godzilla dies from its wounds, while the remaining citizens celebrate. Audrey tells Caiman that she quits working for him after what he did, before leaving with Nick. Philippe parts ways after thanking Nick for his help.
Back at Madison Square Garden, a surviving egg hatches.

Production
Development
Stan Winston created a design for de Bont that was faithful to Toho's Godzilla, but was later scrapped by Emmerich.
The first talk of an American production of a
Godzilla
film started in the early 1980s when director
Steve Miner
received special permission from
Toho
to produce a 3D feature film titled,
Godzilla, King of The Monsters in 3-D . Miner tried to find backers to finance the project, presenting concept art and storyboards from artist
William Stout
and a full screenplay written by
Fred Dekker . Despite igniting some interest in Hollywood, studios were unwilling to gamble on Miner's proposed $30 million budget and the film rights died in 1983. [ 21 ]
In 1992,
TriStar Pictures
acquired the rights to
Godzilla
from
Toho
to produce a trilogy of
Godzilla
films, with the promise of "remaining true to the original series—cautioning against nuclear weapons and runaway technology." [ 22 ]
Screenwriters
Ted Elliott
and
Terry Rossio
were tapped to write the script and submitted their final draft in late 1994. [ 23 ]
Earlier that year,
Jan de Bont
became attached to direct and began pre-production on the film for a 1996 summer release. [ 24 ]
De Bont's Godzilla would have discarded the character's atomic origin and replaced it with one wherein Godzilla is an artificial creation constructed by
Atlantians
to defend humanity against a shape-shifting extraterrestrial monster called "The Gryphon". [ 25 ]
Stan Winston
and his company were employed to do the effects for the film. Winston crafted sculptures of Godzilla, in vein of the classic design, and the rival monster, The Gryphon. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]
De Bont later left the project after TriStar refused to approve his budget of $100–120 million. [ 28 ]
Prior to the release of
Independence Day , director
Roland Emmerich
and producer
Dean Devlin
signed on to do
Godzilla
under the condition they would be able to handle the film "their way." [ 29 ]
Emmerich and Devlin discarded Elliott and Rossio's script and provided a new script where the Godzilla character was largely re-written.
Patrick Tatopoulos
was contacted early on by Emmerich and asked to design the new Godzilla. According to Tatopoulos, the only specific instructions Emmerich gave him was that it should be able to run incredibly fast. [ 30 ]
Godzilla, originally conceived as a robust, erect-standing, plantigrade reptilian sea monster, was reimagined by Tatopoulos as a lean, digitigrade bipedal iguana-like creature that stood with its back and tail parallel to the ground. Godzilla's color scheme was designed to reflect and blend in with the urban environment. [ 30 ]
At one point, it was planned to use
motion capture
from a human to create the movements of the computer-generated Godzilla, but it ended up looking too much like a human in a suit. [ 31 ]
Filming
Production began in May 1997, in New York City, and moved to Los Angeles in June. [ 32 ]
Scenes in New York were filmed in 13 days; tropical scenes were filmed in the
Hawaiian Islands . [ 33 ]
The
United States Marine Corps
participated in the filming of the movie. An actual Marines Reserve pilot, Col. Dwight Schmidt, was the pilot of the plane that "fired" the missiles that killed Godzilla. [ 34 ]
Soundtrack
Main article:
Godzilla: The Album
The soundtrack featuring alternative rock music was released on May 19, 1998 by
Epic Records . [ 35 ]
It was a success on the music charts, peaking at number 2 on the
Billboard
200
and was certified platinum on June 22, 1998. The original score was composed by
David Arnold . The film's score was not released on CD until 9 years later, when it went on sale as a complete original film score in 2007 by
La La Land Records .
Release
Marketing
Taco Bell
contributed to the marketing of the film with $20 million in media support. [ 36 ]
The marketing campaign featured commercials of the
Taco Bell chihuahua
chanting, "Here, lizard lizard lizard!" while attempting to trap the monster in a box. [ 37 ]
Trendmasters
manufactured the toys for the film, including the 11-inch tall "Living Godzilla" [ 38 ]
and the 21-inch tall "Ultimate Godzilla". [ 39 ]
However, poor merchandise sales for the film led to a cancellation of a toyline based on the animated series, and resulted in significant financial losses for Trendmasters, which went out of business three years later. [ 40 ]
Box office
The film premiered in cinemas on May 20, 1998 in wide release throughout the United States for the
Memorial Day
holiday weekend. [ 1 ]
The film was initially projected to break the four-day Memorial Day long weekend opening record of $90 million (set by
The Lost World: Jurassic Park
a year earlier). Instead, it grossed $55,726,951 in business showing at 3,310 locations over the four-day weekend. [ 41 ]
The film
Deep Impact
opened in second place during that weekend with $19,381,788 in revenue. [ 41 ]
The film's revenue dropped by 59% in its second week of release, earning $18,020,444. For that particular weekend, the film remained in first place as the romantic drama
Hope Floats
overtook
Deep Impact
for second place with $14,210,464 in box office business. [ 42 ]
During its final week in release, the film opened in 19th place grossing $202,157. For that weekend,
Lethal Weapon 4
starring
Mel Gibson
made its debut, opening in first place with $34,048,124 in revenue. [ 43 ]
The film went on to top out domestically at $136,314,294 in total ticket sales through an eight-week theatrical run. Internationally, the film took in an additional $242,700,000 in business for a combined worldwide total of $379,014,294. [ 1 ]
For 1998 as a whole, the film was the ninth highest grossing film domestically [ 44 ]
and the third-highest grossing film worldwide. [ 45 ]
Critical reception
The film received generally negative reviews from critics. [ 46 ]
Rotten Tomatoes
reported that only 16% of 74 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 4 out of 10. [ 47 ]
At
Metacritic , which assigns a
weighted average
out of 100 to critics' reviews, the film received a score of 32 based on 23 reviews. [ 46 ]
In 1999, at the Huntley Hotel Garden Room in Santa Monica, California, the film won
Golden Raspberry Awards
for Worst Supporting Actress for Pitillo and Worst Remake or Sequel. The film was also nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay. [ 48 ]
Critics and journalists criticized the film's attempt at humor, the performances from Matthew Broderick and Maria Pitillo, the Baby Godzilla sequences bearing similarities to
Jurassic Park , and stated that the titular character, despite the film's eponymous title, did not feature or strike any resemblance to Godzilla at all, in character or design. [ 3 ]
Barbara Shulgasser, writing in
The San Francisco Examiner , said in a one star review, "OK. Maybe the special effects are slightly more sophisticated than they were in
Jurassic Park , but the techno-stuff is all getting a bit boring. When a movie is nothing but relentless action, there's little chance for dramatic tension to develop." She wrote that the film was "devoid of any discernible plot logic." [ 49 ]
Mick LaSalle
in the
San Francisco Chronicle , wrote that the film was "an overblown action monstrosity with no surprises, no exhilaration and no thrills... What passes for thrills is a succession of scenes lifted and extended from
Jurassic Park
and
The Lost World . Godzilla, shot mostly from the waist down, steps on cars and strafes the sides of buildings with his tail." [ 50 ]
Rita Kempley of
The Washington Post
said the film "neither draws upon our fears nor revels in the original's camp charms. The picture really isn't about anything unless it is the deep pockets and shallow minds of the honchos who begat this colossal bore." She wrote further, "Size vanquishes both substance and subtlety in the overhyped, half- @#!*% and humorless resurrection of dear old
Godzilla . It might well be titled
Iguana Get You Sucka ." [ 51 ]
The film, however, was not without its supporters. Kevin Thomas of the
Los Angeles Times , wrote that the film was an "expertly designed theme park ride of a movie that packs nonstop thrills." [ 52 ]
In a slightly positive fashion, Gary Kamiya of
Salon.com
commented that "The plot is about as ridiculous as you'd expect, but for the most part its absurdities are tolerable." [ 53 ]
Joe Leydon
of
Variety
contributed mildly to the positive sentiment by saying "Throughout
Godzilla , New York endures the most sustained rainfall in all of movie history. Most of the action takes place at night, but even the daytime scenes unfold under darkly overcast skies, which, of course, makes it all the easier for Emmerich to obscure Godzilla's features for the maximum amount of time to generate the maximum amount of suspense." [ 54 ]
Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-Manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind. The script isn't just 'dumbed down,' it's lobotomized.
Godzilla
lives and dies on special effects alone.
—James Berardinelli, writing in
ReelViews [ 55 ]
Writing for the
Chicago Sun-Times ,
Roger Ebert
gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, noting that "One must carefully repress intelligent thought while watching such a film. The movie makes no sense at all except as a careless pastiche of its betters (and, yes, the Japanese
Godzilla
movies are, in their way, better—if only because they embrace
dreck
instead of condescending to it). You have to absorb such a film, not consider it. But my brain rebelled, and insisted on applying logic where it was not welcome." Ebert also pointed out in his review that the characters Mayor Ebert and his assistant Gene were Devlin and Emmerich's jabs at his and
Gene Siskel 's negative reviews of
Stargate
and
Independence Day . [ 4 ]
In an entirely negative review,
James Berardinelli
writing for
ReelViews , called the film "one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time, it's like spitting into the wind. Emmerich and Devlin are master illusionists, waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors. It's probably too much to hope that some day, movie-goers will wake up and realize that they've been had." [ 55 ]
Stephen Holden
of
The New York Times
wrote that the film "is so clumsily structured it feels as if it's two different movies stuck together with an absurd stomping finale glued onto the end. The only question worth asking about this $120 million wad of popcorn is a commercial one. How much further will the dumbing down of the event movie have to go before the audience stops buying tickets?" [ 56 ]
In Howard Hawks'
The Thing , there is a great scene where scientists in the Arctic spread out to trace the outlines of something mysterious that is buried in the ice, and the camera slowly pulls back to reveal that it is circular — a saucer. In
Godzilla , the worm expert is standing in a deep depression, and the camera pulls back to reveal that he is standing in a footprint. Which he would have already known.
—Roger Ebert, writing for the
Chicago Sun-Times [ 4 ]
Michael O'Sullivan of
The Washington Post
queried, "The question is this: Are the awe-inspiring creature effects and roaring battle scenes impressive enough to make you forget the stupid story, inaccurate science and basic implausibility?" Thoughtfully disillusioned, he wrote, "The cut-rate cast seems to have been plucked from the pages of
TV Guide . There's Doug Savant from
Melrose Place
as O'Neal, a scaredy-cat military man who looks like Sgt. Rock and acts like
Barney Fife . There's Maria Pitillo ( House Rules ) as Nick's soporific love interest, Audrey;
The Simpsons ‍ '​ Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer as a wise-cracking news cameraman and superficial reporter; Vicki Lewis of
NewsRadio
as a lusty scientist. Shall I continue?" [ 57 ]
However, in a more upbeat tone,
Owen Gleiberman
writing for
Entertainment Weekly
thought "There's no resonance to the new
Godzilla , and no built-in cheese value, either. For a while, the filmmakers honor the sentimental paradox that seeped into the later
Godzilla
films: that this primitive destroyer, like
King Kong , doesn't actually mean any harm." He opined that the film contained "some clever and exciting sequences", but ultimately came to the conclusion that, "It says much about today's blockbuster filmmakers that they could spend so much money on
Godzilla
and still fail to do justice to something that was fairy-tale destructo schlock to begin with." [ 58 ]
Film critic Aladino Debert of
Variety
was consumed with the nature of the special effects exclaiming, "the title creature is wonderfully designed and the animation is excellent." Complimenting the technical aspects of the film, he summarized, "The integration of the lizard into its surroundings is for the most part very well accomplished, with rigged cars collapsing under the massive weight of Godzilla, and buildings either demolished or partially damaged. The compositing of the debris and pyrotechnics is generally good, especially when the monster runs or walks on the streets: The asphalt gives way convincingly every time the massive feet touch the ground, and a variety of
CGI
elements are seamlessly composited. Debris flies off buildings with every touch of the monster." [ 59 ]
Director Emmerich later admitted regretting the film's production, particularly due to the rushed shooting schedule that was required for a Memorial Day weekend release and the studio's insistence on not test-screening the film. However, he defended the film as better than critics gave it credit for, as it was financially successful, and out of all the films he directed, it was the one which parents told him their children enjoyed the most. [ 60 ]
However, director Emmerich admitted to never being a fan of Godzilla, stating, "I was never a big Godzilla fan, they were just the weekend matinees you saw as a kid, like Hercules films and the really bad Italian westerns. You’d go with all your friends and just laugh." [ 13 ] [ 14 ]
In later years, producer Devlin admitted to "screwing up" his Godzilla, mainly blaming the script that he co-wrote with Emmerich as the source of the film's failure. [ 12 ] [ 61 ]
Devlin additionally emphasized "two flaws" that he believed hurt the film, stating, "The first is we did not commit to anthropomorphizing Godzilla - meaning we did not decide if he was a heroic character, or a villainous character. We made the intellectual decision to have him be neither and just simply an animal trying to survive." Devlin admitted the decision was a "big mistake" and revealed the second flaw of the film was "...deciding to exposit the characters' background in the middle of the film rather than in the first act (where we always do). At the time we told the audience who these characters were, they had already made their minds up about them and we could not change that perception". Devlin concluded by stating, "These were 2 serious mistakes in the writing of the film, and I take full responsibility." [ citation needed ]
Toho's reaction
Toho's trademark for incarnations of TriStar's Godzilla.
Veteran
Godzilla
actors
Haruo Nakajima
and
Kenpachiro Satsuma , as well as
Shusuke Kaneko
(who would later direct
Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack ), were also critical of the film and its character. Nakajima stated "its face looks like an iguana and its body and limbs look like a frog". [ 9 ]
Satsuma walked out of the Japanese premiere of the film and commented, "it's not Godzilla, it doesn't have his spirit". [ 10 ]
The "Godzilla" on the film was considered so different from Toho's Godzilla by the fans and the audience that the term
GINO , "Godzilla In Name Only", was coined by critic and Godzilla fan Richard Pusateri to distinguish the character apart from Toho's Godzilla. [ 62 ]
Kaneko pondered on the treatment the character was given by the studio, stating "It is interesting [that] the US version of Godzilla runs about trying to escape missiles... Americans seem unable to accept a creature that cannot be put down by their arms." [ 63 ]
In 2004, Toho (Godzilla's license owners) officially
retconned
the character as " Zilla " for future appearances. [ 15 ] [ 17 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ]
This decision was made by producer
Shōgo Tomiyama
and
Godzilla: Final Wars
director
Ryuhei Kitamura
because they felt Emmerich's film "took the God out of Godzilla” by portraying the character like a mere animal. [ 11 ]
The name "Zilla" was chosen for the character by Tomiyama as a satirical take on counterfeit Godzilla products that use "Zilla"
as a suffix . [ 66 ]
The character has since appeared in other media as "Zilla". [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ]
Accolades
The film was nominated and won several awards in 1998–99. Furthermore, it was screened out of competition at the
1998 Cannes Film Festival . [ 67 ]
The film was also nominated for multiple
Razzie Awards
including Worst Picture and Worst Director.

Sequels
TriStar planned to produce a trilogy of Godzilla films upon acquiring the license for Godzilla in 1992. Emmerich and Devlin only went as far as to hire
Tab Murphy
to write a treatment for a sequel. The sequel would have involved the surviving offspring battling a giant insect in
Sydney ,
New South Wales . [ 80 ]
However, due to the overwhelming negative reception the first film received and a lack of enthusiasm from fans, audiences, theater owners, and licensees, the planned sequels were abandoned and TriStar let their rights to Godzilla expire and revert to Toho in 2003. [ 81 ]
Producer Devlin stated that they left the film with an open-ending in case the film's success allowed them to return for sequels. [ 82 ]
