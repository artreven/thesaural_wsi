NYT Wednesday 12/30/09 - My Misfortune
Based on my solving time, I did fairly well with this Wednesday
New York Times
crossword, but what is that if you can't actually get the letters right? The theme seemed straightforward enough, but - as if to compensate - the rest of the puzzle was unusually thorny.
I skated on thin ice at the intersection of 22d
O'Day
and 36a
My Love . Not knowing either of these, I was grateful to be informed of
Anita O'Day 's
pig Latin
etymology in the clue ... that pointed to an
-ay
ending. A close call, but I escaped this particular trouble spot.
Woe is me, there were much worse dangers at the bottom middle of the grid. I had no clue about either 57d
Vaca
or 64a
The O.C.
and did my usual thing of assessing which of the two answers narrowed down the possibilities better. In this case I thought 64-Across would repay close attention and reasoned there must have been a medical show called
The OR .
Vara
looked about as likely a name for an explorer as
Vaca , so I went with it. I'm not sure I could have done any better here in the absence of the required knowledge of either answer.
A couple of readers have emailed me to point out that
The New York Times Crossword Puzzle
was featured on yesterday's
Wheel of Fortune , being the answer to the question "what are you doing?". This has been a good year for the profile of the NYT puzzle in the popular media, as it was also the category an episode of
Jeopardy! , which I commented on in
my post for the April 2 puzzle .
Solving time: 11 mins ( solo, no solving aids, two wrong answers )
Clue of the puzz: 31d
dog whistle
{Item used with high frequency?}

New To Me
18a
Shawn
{Wallace ___ of "Manhattan "}. There seems to be an uncharacteristic focus on
Woody Allen
movies today: not a problem for this fan ... it's just unusual to see repetitiveness rather than variety in such references. Although I recall
Wallace Shawn 's face and his role in
Manhattan
as the "homunculus" of an ex-husband, I couldn't easily cough up his name. I gather
Shawn
is also a notable playwright in an
absurdist
style, and co-wrote
My Dinner with Andre
(1981), based on his conversations with
Andre Gregory .
50a
Elks
{Order whose members have included five U.S. presidents}. Have come across the
Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks
(sometimes a crossword answer as
BPOE ), but wasn't previously aware of its presidential history. Since the BPOE was only founded in 1868 (when it was a social club called the "Jolly Cork") that rules out presidents up to #18. I'm reliably informed that the Elk presidents were:
Warren G. Harding
Franklin D. Roosevelt
Harry S Truman
John F. Kennedy
Gerald R. Ford
52a
Ali
{Rubina ___ of "Slumdog Millionaire "}. We still haven't seen
Slumdog Millionaire
(2008) despite its success at the awards ceremonies.
Rubina Ali
is the child actress who plays the youngest version of Jamal's one true love, Latika, in the movie.
64a
The O.C.
{Former Fox series set in Newport Beach}. I had big problems here and still can't quite believe that a show based in
Orange County, CA
would be called
The O.C. : why the definite article?!? ... it doesn't make sense. Anyway, not knowing the show, nor
Cabeza de Vaca , I just had to guess at the most likely name for a Fox series and went for
The OR
... well, there seem to be as many medical series on TV as stars in the sky. But Magdalen points out the show that would be called
The OR
is actually
Gray's Anatomy . Boo (hoo).
65a
Alen
{Art Deco architect William Van ___}.
William Van Alen
(1883–1954) was an American architect, best known for being the lead designer of New York City's
Chrysler Building
(1929-30), which earned him the title "Doctor of Altitude". Unfortunately,
Van Alen
doesn't seem to have been fond of paperwork and neglected to enter into a contract with  Walter Chrysler
to design the famous skyscraper; after Chrysler refused to pay the standard fee of 6% of the building costs,
Van Alen
sued and won; but the court case damaged his reputation and effectively brought an end to his career.
2d
Lila
{Oscar winner Kedrova}. Never heard of
Lila Kedrova
(1918–2000), a Russian-born French actress who got her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for playing "Madame Hortense", proprietress of the "Hotel Ritz", in
Zorba the Greek
(1964).
22d
O'Day
{Jazz singer who took her surname from pig Latin}. Strange but true:
Anita O'Day
(1919–2006), born
Anita Belle Colton , based her name on "dough" as in money, which in
pig Latin
becomes
O'Day . Here's her
Stella by Starlight
in a 1963 live performance.
45d
Ojai
{Ventura County's ___ Valley}. Had to get this largely from crossings, as I'm not sure I've met the
Ojai Valley
(pronounced "oh-high") before.
Ojai
means "Valley of the Moon" in the language of the
Chumash
Indians. It is apparently the venue for a famous music festival: the
Ojai Music Festival
was founded in 1947, features some of the world's top musicians and composers, and occurs on the first weekend after
Memorial Day .
57d
Vaca
{Explorer Cabeza de ___}. As far as I could see, the third letter of this answer could be just about any consonant. I decided to choose it on the basis of what would make a sensible TV show name at 64-Across and went for
Vara . But
Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca
(ca. 1490/1507–1557/1559) is the man I was expected to know: he was a Spanish explorer, one of four survivors of the
Narváez expedition , which attempted to
install
Pánfilo de Narváez
as governor of
Spanish Florida
during the years 1527–1528.
Cabeza de Vaca
recorded his experiences of the Native Americans in the 1542 work
La Relacion
(The Report), later known as
Naufragios
(Shipwrecks).
Noteworthy
35a
Seth
{Green of "Radio Days"}; 4d
Dianne
{Wiest of "Radio Days"}. Here are the other two
Woody Allen
references - actors in the 1987 movie
Radio Days , which introduced me to
Coney Island
years before I even thought about coming to the USA. The young radio addict Joe is played by
Seth Green
as a child actor.
Dianne Wiest
is his aunt Bea, whose search for love is a significant part of the plot. Since
Wallace Shawn
is also in this movie as the diminutive performer of the "Masked Avenger" on radio, I'm surprised we didn't get {Wallace of "Radio Days"} for 18-Across which would definitely have made a feature of the coincidence of getting all three into the same grid. I guess it might have something to do with
Shawn
being a surname, while these two are forenames.
36d
Myra
{Vidal's "___ Breckinridge"}. I knew the title of this
Gore Vidal
novel, maybe via
the 1970 movie adaptation , though I know I've never seen it.
Myra Breckinridge
(1968) is a campy satirical novel set in the Hollywood of the 1960s. Despite its stellar cast, the movie is apparently famously bad and often cited as one of the
worst films ever made .
58d
oyer
{___ and terminer}. Nice gimme, which I knew from
The Chambers Dictionary .
oyer and terminer
(literally "hear and determine") is an obsolete term in English law, being a royal commission with the power to hear and determine criminal causes.

A literary nit to pick: Keats was hardly a "colleague" of Shelley and Byron, though I know the three are often lumped together as the three English "High Romantic" poets. I don't know that Keats ever met Byron, and he met Shelley only one time, about whom he had serious misgivings, though he did take Shelley up on his kind offer to finance travel to Italy for health reasons...too late, as it turned out. Of course, there's Shelley's famous ode to Keats, "Adonais"---but it says much more about Shelley than Keats, really.
Sorry for going on, but this is rather my bailiwick here. I think "contemporary" rather than "colleague" would have been much more apt. Oh, Ross, about the "t"s turning to "d"s - It's pretty much inevitable unless you spend an undue amount of time watching BBC America or listening to Guardian podcasts etc that you will soon be telling people that you're "Briddish" - Well, that's been my experience anyway, despite little rebellions I've staged from time to time.

Hi Daniel. Thanks for your expert opinion on the poets. It's funny to imagine Keats, Shelley and Byron as colleagues in a verse-writing team, going on morale-building exercises (I think they'd have made an ace paintballing team)! "Contemporaries" definitely puts it better. BTW, Shelley was expelled from my Oxford college, and is now commemorated there by one of the most ugsome memorials anywhere.

LOL Ross - Yes, seen the memorial - truly UGSOME - disgrace to Shelley and University College, makes one think they still haven't forgiven him. I was at Balliol for a short while before my transatlantic migration led me to finish up my undergraduate here. Shelley and Byron did actually shoot real pistols together, about which the dour Byron wrote. "Shelley is the better shot, but his head is full of metaphysics."
Oh, and you're quite right about the subjunctive.

Found
Byron on Keats
interesting. Given their class differences, could Byron and Keats have ever been "colleagues"?

Interesting article. - No, they couldn't be "colleagues."
Byron's poetry is frankly very bad, a tawdry imitation of Alexander Pope, but he did cut a Romantic "figure," as it were.
The only reason he countenanced Shelley's association whilst both were in Italy was that Shelley was from the landed gentry - father a baronet, and he admits in one of his letters that he's never understood what is called "friendship." OK, you get the idea, I don't fancy Byron, and I've never met ANYONE who likes him for his poetry.
I find him, as a man, even more detestable.
Shelley and Keats were never "colleagues" either, of course, but - in their poetry at least - there are more than passing similarities - They both wrote famous odes to birds, for one. And Shelley, like Keats, wrote from the imagination. -
Further, they were both decent sorts and might have become colleagues, even friends, if either had lived past his 20s.

Thanks, that's fascinating ... your knowledge in this area goes way beyond mine. I can't think of anything to add except how wonderful crosswords are for provoking such discussions.
