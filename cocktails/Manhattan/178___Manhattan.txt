What is gossip girl actually??
Gossip Girl
is an American teen drama series based on the
book series
of the same name written by
Cecily von Ziegesar .
The series was created by
Josh Schwartz
and
Stephanie Savage , and premiered on
The CW
on September 19, 2007. Narrated by the omniscient yet unseen
blogger
"Gossip Girl", voiced by
Kristen Bell , the series revolves around the lives of privileged young adults on
Manhattan 's
Upper East Side
in New York City.
What the plot of the story??
The series begins with the return of Upper East Side "It" girl,
Serena van der Woodsen
( Blake Lively ) from a mysterious stay at a boarding school in Cornwall, Connecticut. [ 1 ]
Blair Waldorf
( Leighton Meester ), whom creators describe as the queen at the center of their chess game, [ 2 ]
is a longtime friend and occasional rival of Serena's, and the
Queen Bee
of Constance Billard School's social scene. [ 3 ]
The story also follows
Chuck Bass
( Ed Westwick ), the bad boy of the Upper East Side; "Golden boy"
Nate Archibald
( Chace Crawford ), Chuck's best friend and Blair's ex; and other characters of the turbulent Manhattan scene:
Dan Humphrey
( Penn Badgley ), Nate's friend and Serena's on-again, off-again ex;
Vanessa Abrams
( Jessica Szohr ), Dan's best friend; and Dan's sister,
Jenny Humphrey
( Taylor Momsen ). [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Each
episode begins with the blog page of the Gossip Girl blog with
Serena's picture from the pilot episode. Afterward, a recap of events
relevant to the upcoming narrative is shown, which ends again with the
blog page, only this time with a picture from other character(s) with a
text about a recent event connected with the picture.
The narrator is Gossip Girl, voiced by Kristen Bell.
She begins the
recap with the sentence "Gossip Girl here, your one and
only source into
the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite," and ends
the recap with
whispered voices saying "Where has she been?" "Serena"
then the voice of
Gossip Girl says: " And who am I? That's one secret I'll never tell. You
know you love me. xoxo, Gossip Girl. "
Some episodes also end with Gossip Girl saying
"You know you love me. xoxo, Gossip Girl." I can't remember when I start to watch Gossip Girl and addicted with this drama!!!
