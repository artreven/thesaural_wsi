The Old City Federal
This building in the heart of North Birmingham used to be the tallest in the city, and in its day was host to pop radio stations back in Bull Connor's Birmingham. The building is, unfortunately, condemned now - the last inhabitants that were allowed to live there did so on the top floors that were re-made into loft apartments before the asbestos levels were declared unsafe about ten years ago. They don't even light the sign on the top anymore.

Alabama Information and History
Home to five Native American tribes (Creek, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole), this area of fertile soils was the heart of the "cotton kingdom" before the Civil War.
Today Alabama lies at the center of a revitalized Deep South. Birmingham, the state's largest city, has become a focus for medical research, and is a major manufacturer of steel, iron, and coal. Leading industries include textiles and apparel, rubber and plastics, paper, chemicals, primary metals, and automobile manufacturing. The Alabama Research and Education Network, first state-funded computer network in the U.S., links universities and school systems across the state. The Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, a transportation corridor for industry and agriculture, connects 16,000 miles of U.S. inland waterways to the Gulf of Mexico via Mobile's port. Economy Industry: retail and wholesale trade, services, government, finance, insurance, real estate, transportation, construction, electrical equipment. Agriculture: poultry, forest products, cattle, nursery stock, cotton, eggs, peanuts, soybeans.

Alabama Fine Dining
This is the Roadkill Cafe in Elberta, Alabama. Very popular indeed with the locals and completely renovated after a kitchen fire a few months ago. I drove by there on a Sunday morning so it was closed at the time but I was hoping to find a menu posted in a window but that was a no-go as well.

The mask of Mardi Gras
Mobile Alabama Mardi Gras Museum. Before visiting the museum I believed mardi gras to be nothing but a big party. However, I discovered the garish nature of this southern institution. Seems that southern societies proclaims a mardi gras king and queen. There are up to 25 societies. Being chosen as a king or queen is deemed an honour. It may cost the family of the king and queen up to $200,000 to pay for the ragalia and parties involved. A mardi gras king or queen may be set up for life in society. It is a great thing to place on your CV. However I saw it as a remnant of the Southern class system looking after the right families and old money. I found the robes and paraphernalia assosciated with the festivals garish and over the top. The extravagance placed on the festival is disturbing considering the poverty present in Alabama. This was a model where you can pose as King or queen.

White Gulf Sands
Not many people think of this type of landscape when they think of Alabama. The gulf coast in Gulf Shores is absolutely stunning there. If you've never been, it's worth the trip.

Noccalula Falls
This is Noccalula Falls in Gadsden, Alabama. This waterfall was one of the more impressive in the state. Legend is that a native american girl named Nocalula threw herself over the falls when the love of her life was killed. Of course, I could have this story completely wrong, so if anyone knows the excat story, let me know.

Top of the State
This was a shot atop Mount Cheaha (Alabama's highest point). The peak is approximately 3-4,000 feet high. I like this shot because of the shadows from the clouds above, and the lush green landscape of the Alabama countryside. You can also see Lake Cheaha in the valley below.

Forest Deep
Deep in the Dismal's Canyon in northwest Alabama, I stumbled upon this meandering creek within the forest. It was a hot & sunny day when I started the hike into Dismal's Canyon, but the forest canopy was so thick, that it turned cool and dark.

Winter Sunset at Kiesel-Alabama
Kiesel Park is located about 5 miles west of Auburn, Alabama (home of Auburn University). The park features a two and one quarter mile gravel trail which winds through wide open fields full of all sorts of wildflowers, thistle and other interesting plants. The park is a favorite with dog owners. I went there to run and to view beautiful sunsets. Sometimes I would go to star gaze even though it is nominally closed after dark. In recent years the park has been made accessible from Auburn by way of bicycle trails. Auburn is a designated Bicycle Friendly Community. This was taken in February. The trees at the bottom of the frame grow along a small creek flowing through the park.

United States of America
The United States of America
(commonly referred to as the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a
federal
constitutional republic
comprising
fifty states
and a
federal district . The country is situated mostly in central
North America , where its
forty-eight contiguous states
and
Washington, D.C. , the
capital district , lie between the
Pacific
and
Atlantic Oceans , bordered by
Canada
to the north and
Mexico
to the south. The state of
Alaska
is in the northwest of the continent, with Canada to its east and
Russia
to the west across the
Bering Strait . The state of
Hawaii
is an
archipelago
in the mid-Pacific. The country also possesses
several territories , or
insular areas , scattered around the
Caribbean
and Pacific.
At 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km²) and with about 305 million people, the United States is the
third or fourth
largest country by total area, and third largest by land area and
by population . The United States is one of the world's most
ethnically diverse
and
multicultural
nations, the product of large-scale
immigration from many countries . [7]
The
U.S. economy
is the largest national economy in the world, with an estimated 2008
gross domestic product
(GDP) of
US$ 14.3 trillion (23% of the world total based on nominal GDP and almost 21% at
purchasing power parity ). [4] [8] The nation was founded by
thirteen colonies
of
Great Britain
located along the
Atlantic seaboard . On July 4, 1776, they issued the
Declaration of Independence , which proclaimed their independence from Great Britain and their formation of a cooperative union. The rebellious states defeated Great Britain in the
American Revolutionary War , the first successful
colonial war of independence . [9]
A
federal convention
adopted the current
United States Constitution
on September 17, 1787; its ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a strong central government. The
Bill of Rights , comprising ten
constitutional amendments
guaranteeing many fundamental civil rights and freedoms, was ratified in 1791. In the 19th century, the United States acquired land from
France ,
Spain , the
United Kingdom ,
Mexico , and
Russia , and
annexed
the
Republic of Texas
and the
Republic of Hawaii . Disputes between the
agrarian South
and
industrial North
over
states' rights
and the expansion of the
institution of slavery
provoked the
American Civil War
of the 1860s. The North's victory prevented a permanent split of the country and led to the
end of legal slavery
in the United States. By the 1870s, the national economy was the world's largest. [10]
The
Spanish–American War
and
World War I
confirmed the country's status as a military power. In 1945, the United States emerged from
World War II
as the
first country with nuclear weapons , a permanent member of the
United Nations Security Council , and a founding member of
NATO . The end of the
Cold War
left the United States as the sole
superpower . The country accounts for
approximately 50% of global military spending
and is a leading economic, political, and cultural force in the world. [11] Etymology In 1507, German
cartographer
Martin Waldseemüller
produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere
"America"
after Italian explorer and cartographer
Amerigo Vespucci . [12]
The former British colonies first used the country's modern name in the
Declaration of Independence , which was the "unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America" adopted by the "Representatives of the united States of America" on July 4, 1776. [13]
The current name was finalized on November 15, 1777, when the
Second Continental Congress
adopted the
Articles of Confederation , the first of which states, "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.'" The short form United States is also standard. Other common forms include the U.S., the USA, and America. Colloquial names include the U.S. of A. and the States.
Columbia , a once popular name for the United States, was derived from
Christopher Columbus . It appears in the name " District of Columbia ". The standard way to refer to a citizen of the United States is as an
American . Though United States is the formal adjective, American and U.S. are the most common adjectives used to refer to the country ("American values," "U.S. forces"). American is rarely used in English to refer to people not connected to the United States. [14] The phrase "the United States" was originally treated as plural—e.g., "the United States are"—including in the
Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , ratified in 1865. It became common to treat it as singular—e.g., "the United States is"—after the end of the Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom "these United States." [15] Geography & Environment
The United States is situated almost entirely in the
Western Hemisphere : the
contiguous United States
stretches from the Pacific Ocean on the west to the Atlantic Ocean on the east, with the
Gulf of Mexico
to the southeast; it is bordered by Canada on the
north
and Mexico on the
south . Alaska is the largest state in area; separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, it touches the Pacific on the south and the Arctic Ocean on the north. Hawaii occupies an
archipelago
in the central Pacific, southwest of North America. After Russia and Canada, the United States is the world's third or fourth
largest nation by total area , ranking just above or below
China . The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and
India
are counted and how the total size of the United States is calculated: the CIA World Factbook gives 3,794,083 sq mi (9,826,630 km2), [1]
the United Nations Statistics Division gives 3,717,813 sq mi (9,629,091 km2), [16]
and the Encyclopedia Britannica gives 3,676,486 sq mi (9,522,055 km2). [17]
Including only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada. [18]
The United States also possesses several
insular territories
scattered around the
West Indies
(e.g., the
commonwealth
of
Puerto Rico ) and the Pacific (e.g.,
Guam ). The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to
deciduous
forests and the rolling hills of the
Piedmont . The
Appalachian Mountains
divide the eastern seaboard from the
Great Lakes
and the grasslands of the
Midwest . The
Mississippi – Missouri River , the world's
fourth longest river system , runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile
prairie
of the
Great Plains
stretches to the west, interrupted by
a highland region
in the southeast. The
Rocky Mountains , at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in
Colorado . Farther west are the rocky
Great Basin
and deserts such as the
Mojave . The
Sierra Nevada
and
Cascade
mountain ranges run close to the
Pacific coast . At 20,320 feet (6,194 m), Alaska's
Mount McKinley
is the country's tallest peak. Active
volcanoes
are common throughout Alaska's
Alexander
and
Aleutian Islands , and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The
supervolcano
underlying
Yellowstone National Park
in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature. [19] The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the
100th meridian , the climate ranges from
humid continental
in the north to
humid subtropical
in the south. The southern tip of
Florida
is tropical, as is Hawaii. The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains are
alpine . The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest,
Mediterranean
in
coastal California , and
oceanic
in coastal
Oregon
and
Washington
and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to
hurricanes , and most of the world's
tornadoes
occur within the country, mainly in the Midwest's
Tornado Alley . [20] The U.S. ecology is very diverse: about 17,000 species of
vascular plants
occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of
flowering plants
are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland. [21]
The United States is home to more than 400 mammal, 750 bird, and 500 reptile and amphibian species. [22]
About 91,000 insect species have been described. [23]
The
Endangered Species Act
of 1973 protects threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the
United States Fish and Wildlife Service . There are fifty-eight
national parks
and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and
wilderness areas . [24]
Altogether, the government regulates 28.8% of the country's land area. [25]
Most of this is
protected , though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, [26]
mining, or cattle ranching. History Native Americans and European settlers The
indigenous peoples
of the U.S. mainland, including
Alaska Natives ,
migrated from Asia . They began arriving at least 12,000 and as many as 40,000 years ago. [27]
Some, such as the
pre-Columbian
Mississippian culture , developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies. After Europeans began settling the Americas,
many millions of indigenous Americans died
from epidemics of imported diseases such as
smallpox . [28] In 1492,
Genoese
explorer
Christopher Columbus , under contract to the Spanish crown, reached several Caribbean islands, making
first contact
with the indigenous people. On April 2, 1513, Spanish
conquistador
Juan Ponce de León
landed on what he called " La Florida "—the first documented European arrival on what would become the U.S. mainland. Spanish settlements in the region were followed by ones in the present-day
southwestern United States
that drew thousands through Mexico. French
fur traders
established outposts of
New France
around the
Great Lakes ; France eventually claimed much of the North American interior, down to the Gulf of Mexico. The first successful English settlements were the
Virginia Colony
in
Jamestown
in 1607 and the
Pilgrims '
Plymouth Colony
in 1620. The 1628 chartering of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony
resulted in a wave of migration; by 1634,
New England
had been settled by some 10,000
Puritans . Between the late 1610s and the American Revolution, about 50,000 convicts were shipped to Britain's American colonies. [29]
Beginning in 1614, the Dutch settled along the lower
Hudson River , including
New Amsterdam
on
Manhattan Island . In 1674, the Dutch ceded their American territory to England; the province of
New Netherland
was renamed New York. Many new immigrants, especially to
the South , were
indentured servants —some two-thirds of all Virginia immigrants between 1630 and 1680. [30]
By the turn of the century,
African slaves
were becoming the primary source of bonded labor. With the 1729 division of
the Carolinas
and the 1732 colonization of
Georgia , the thirteen British colonies that would become the United States of America were established. All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient
rights of Englishmen
and a sense of self-government stimulating support for
republicanism . All legalized the
African slave trade . With high birth rates, low death rates, and steady immigration, the colonial population grew rapidly. The Christian
revivalist
movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the
Great Awakening
fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty. In the
French and Indian War , British forces seized Canada from the French, but the
francophone
population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the
Native Americans
(popularly known as "American Indians"), who were being displaced, those thirteen colonies had a population of 2.6 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain; nearly one in five Americans were black slaves. [31]
Though
subject to British taxation , the American colonials had no representation in the
Parliament of Great Britain . Independence & Expansion Tensions between American colonials and the British during the
revolutionary period
of the 1760s and early 1770s led to the
American Revolutionary War , fought from 1775 through 1781. On June 14, 1775, the
Continental Congress , convening in
Philadelphia , established a
Continental Army
under the command of
George Washington . Proclaiming that " all men are created equal " and endowed with "certain
unalienable Rights ," the Congress adopted the
Declaration of Independence , drafted largely by
Thomas Jefferson , on July 4, 1776. That date is now celebrated annually as America's
Independence Day . In 1777, the
Articles of Confederation
established a weak federal government that operated until 1789. After the
British defeat
by American forces
assisted by the French , Great Britain
recognized the independence of the United States
and the states'
sovereignty
over American territory west to the
Mississippi River . A
constitutional convention
was organized in 1787 by those wishing to establish a strong national government, with powers of taxation. The
United States Constitution
was ratified in 1788, and the new republic's
first Senate, House of Representatives , and
president —George Washington—took office in 1789. The
Bill of Rights , forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791. Attitudes toward
slavery
were shifting; a
clause in the Constitution
protected the African slave trade only until 1808. The Northern states abolished slavery between 1780 and 1804, leaving the
slave states
of the South as defenders of the " peculiar institution ." The
Second Great Awakening , beginning about 1800, made
evangelicalism
a force behind various social
reform movements , including
abolitionism . Americans' eagerness to
expand westward
prompted a long series of
Indian Wars
and an
Indian removal
policy that stripped the native peoples of their land. The
Louisiana Purchase
of French-claimed territory under President Thomas Jefferson in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size. The
War of 1812 , declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S.
nationalism . A series of U.S. military incursions into Florida led
Spain to cede
it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. The United States annexed the
Republic of Texas
in 1845. The concept of
Manifest Destiny
was popularized during this time. [32]
The 1846
Oregon Treaty
with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day
American Northwest . The U.S. victory in the
Mexican-American War
resulted in the 1848
cession
of
California
and much of the present-day
American Southwest . The
California Gold Rush
of 1848–49 further spurred western migration.
New railways
made relocation easier for settlers and increased conflicts with Native Americans. Over a half-century, up to 40 million
American bison , or buffalo, were slaughtered for skins and meat and to ease the railways' spread. The loss of the buffalo, a primary resource for the
plains Indians , was an existential blow to many native cultures. Civil War & Industrialization Tensions
between slave and
free states
mounted with arguments over the relationship between the
state and federal governments , as well as
violent conflicts
over the spread of slavery into new states.
Abraham Lincoln , candidate of the largely antislavery
Republican Party , was elected president in 1860. Before he took office, seven slave states declared their
secession —which the federal government maintained was illegal—and formed the
Confederate States of America . With the Confederate
attack upon Fort Sumter , the
American Civil War
began and four more slave states joined the Confederacy. Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation
committed the
Union
to ending slavery. Following the Union victory in 1865, three amendments to the U.S. Constitution
ensured freedom
for the nearly four million
African Americans
who had been slaves, [33]
made them citizens , and
gave them voting rights . The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in
federal power . [34] After the war, the
assassination of Lincoln
radicalized Republican
Reconstruction
policies aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves. The resolution of the disputed
1876 presidential election
by the
Compromise of 1877
ended Reconstruction;
Jim Crow laws
soon
disenfranchised many African Americans . In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented
influx of immigrants
from
Southern
and
Eastern Europe
hastened the
country's industrialization . The wave of immigration, lasting until 1929, provided labor and transformed American culture. High tariff protections, national infrastructure building, and new banking regulations encouraged growth. The 1867
Alaska purchase
from Russia completed the country's mainland expansion. The
Wounded Knee massacre
in 1890 was the last major armed conflict of the
Indian Wars . In 1893, the
indigenous monarchy
of the Pacific
Kingdom of Hawaii
was overthrown in a coup led by American residents; the United States annexed the archipelago in 1898. Victory in the
Spanish-American War
the same year demonstrated that the United States was a
world power
and led to the annexation of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the
Philippines . The Philippines gained independence a half-century later; Puerto Rico and Guam remain U.S. territories. World War I, Great Depression & World War II At the outbreak of
World War I
in 1914, the United States remained neutral. Most Americans sympathized with the British and French, although many opposed intervention. [35]
In 1917, the United States joined the
Allies , turning the tide against the
Central Powers . After the war, the Senate did not ratify the
Treaty of Versailles , which established the
League of Nations . The country pursued a policy of
unilateralism , verging on
isolationism . [36]
In 1920, the
women's rights
movement won passage of a
constitutional amendment
granting
women's suffrage . The prosperity of the
Roaring Twenties
ended with the
Wall Street Crash of 1929
that triggered the
Great Depression . After his election as president in 1932,
Franklin D. Roosevelt
responded with the
New Deal , a range of policies increasing government intervention in the economy. The
Dust Bowl
of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration. The United States, effectively neutral during
World War II 's early stages after
Nazi Germany 's
invasion of Poland
in September 1939, began supplying
materiel
to the
Allies
in March 1941 through the
Lend-Lease
program. On December 7, 1941, the United States joined the Allies against the
Axis powers
after a surprise
attack on Pearl Harbor
by Japan. World War II cost far more money than any other war in American history, [37]
but it boosted the economy by providing capital investment and jobs. Among the major combatants, the United States was the only nation to become richer—indeed, far richer—instead of poorer because of the war. [38]
Allied conferences at
Bretton Woods
and
Yalta
outlined a new system of international organizations that placed the
United States
and
Soviet Union
at the center of world affairs. As
victory was won in Europe , a 1945
international conference
held in
San Francisco
produced the
United Nations Charter , which became active after the war. [39]
The United States, having
developed the first nuclear weapons , used them on the Japanese cities of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki
in August.
Japan surrendered
on September 2, ending the war. [40] Cold War & Protest politics The United States and Soviet Union jockeyed for power after World War II during the
Cold War , dominating the military affairs of Europe through
NATO
and the
Warsaw Pact . The United States promoted
liberal democracy
and capitalism, while the Soviet Union promoted communism and a centrally
planned economy . Both supported dictatorships and engaged in
proxy wars . American troops fought
Communist Chinese
forces in the
Korean War
of 1950–53. The
House Un-American Activities Committee
pursued a series of investigations into suspected leftist subversion, while Senator
Joseph McCarthy
became the figurehead of anticommunist sentiment. The 1961 Soviet launch of the
first manned spaceflight
prompted President
John F. Kennedy 's call for the United States to be first to land
"a man on the moon,"
achieved in 1969. Kennedy also faced a
tense nuclear showdown
with Soviet forces in Cuba. Meanwhile, the United States experienced sustained economic expansion. A growing
civil rights movement , led by African Americans such as
Rosa Parks
and
Martin Luther King, Jr. , fought segregation and discrimination. Following
Kennedy's assassination
in 1963, the
Civil Rights Act of 1964
and
Voting Rights Act of 1965
were passed under President
Lyndon B. Johnson . Johnson and his successor,
Richard Nixon , expanded a proxy war in Southeast Asia into the unsuccessful
Vietnam War . A widespread
countercultural movement
grew, fueled by
opposition to the war ,
black nationalism , and the
sexual revolution .
Betty Friedan ,
Gloria Steinem , and others led a
new wave of feminism
that sought political, social, and economic equality for women. As a result of the
Watergate scandal , in 1974 Nixon became the first U.S. president to resign, rather than be
impeached
on charges including obstruction of justice and abuse of power; he was
succeeded
by Vice President
Gerald Ford . The
Jimmy Carter
administration of the late 1970s was marked by
stagflation
and the
Iran hostage crisis . The election of
Ronald Reagan
as president in 1980 heralded a significant
rightward shift in American politics , reflected in major changes in
taxation and spending priorities . His second term in office brought both the
Iran-Contra scandal
and significant
diplomatic progress with the Soviet Union . The subsequent Soviet collapse ended the Cold War. Contemporary era The leadership role taken by the United States and its allies in the UN–sanctioned
Gulf War , under President
George H. W. Bush , and the
Yugoslav wars , under President
Bill Clinton , helped to preserve its position as a superpower. The longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history—from March 1991 to March 2001—encompassed the Clinton administration and the
dot-com bubble . [41]
A
civil lawsuit
and
sex scandal
led to
Clinton's impeachment
in 1998, but he remained in office. The
2000 presidential election , one of the closest in U.S. history, was resolved by a
U.S. Supreme Court decision — George W. Bush , son of George H. W. Bush, became president. On
September 11, 2001 ,
al-Qaeda
terrorists struck the
World Trade Center
in New York City and
The Pentagon
near Washington, D.C., killing nearly three thousand people. In response, President Bush launched the
War on Terrorism . In late 2001, U.S. forces led an
invasion of Afghanistan , removing the
Taliban
government and al-Qaeda training camps. Taliban insurgents continue to fight a guerrilla war. In 2002, the Bush administration began to press for
regime change
in Iraq on
controversial grounds . [42]
Lacking the support of NATO or an explicit UN mandate for military intervention, Bush organized a
Coalition of the Willing ; coalition forces
preemptively
invaded Iraq
in 2003, removing dictator and former U.S. ally
Saddam Hussein . The
Iraq War , now opposed by most Americans, continues, though the violence is waning. [43]
Amnesty International
has accused the United States of human rights violations in its pursuit of the War on Terrorism and the Iraq War. [44]
In 2005,
Hurricane Katrina
caused severe destruction along much of the
Gulf Coast , devastating
New Orleans . On November 4, 2008, amid a global
economic recession ,
Barack Obama
was elected president. He is the first African American to hold the office. Government & Elections The United States is the world's oldest surviving
federation . It is a
constitutional republic , "in which
majority rule
is tempered by
minority rights
protected by
law ." [45]
It is fundamentally structured as a
representative democracy , though U.S. citizens residing in the territories are excluded from voting for federal officials. [46]
The government is regulated by a system of
checks and balances
defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document and as a
social contract
for the American people. In the
American federalist system , citizens are usually subject to
three levels of government , federal, state, and local; the
local government 's duties are commonly split between
county
and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a
plurality vote
of citizens by district. There is no
proportional representation
at the federal level, and it is very rare at lower levels. Federal and state judicial and
cabinet
officials are typically nominated by the executive branch and approved by the legislature, although some state judges and officials are elected by popular vote. The federal government is composed of three branches: Legislative : The
bicameral
Congress , made up of the
Senate
and the
House of Representatives , makes
federal law ,
declares war , approves treaties, has the
power of the purse , and has the power of
impeachment , by which it can remove sitting members of the government. Executive : The
president
is the
commander-in-chief
of the military, can veto
legislative bills
before they become law, and appoints the
Cabinet
and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies. Judicial : The
Supreme Court
and lower
federal courts , whose judges are appointed by the president with Senate approval, appoints, interpret laws, and can overturn laws they deem
unconstitutional . The House of Representatives has 435 members, each representing a
congressional district
for a two-year term. House seats are
apportioned
among the states by population every tenth year. As of the
2000 census , seven states have the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, has fifty-three. The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected
at-large
to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office
no more than twice . The president is
not elected by direct vote , but by an indirect
electoral college
system in which the determining votes are apportioned by state. The Supreme Court, led by the
Chief Justice of the United States , has nine members, who serve for life. The state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion;
Nebraska
uniquely has a
unicameral
legislature. The
governor
(chief executive) of each state is directly elected. All laws and procedures of both state and federal governments are subject to review, and any law ruled in violation of the Constitution by the judiciary is voided. The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states.
Article One
protects the right to the "great writ" of
habeas corpus , and
Article Three
guarantees the
right to a jury trial
in all criminal cases.
Amendments to the Constitution
require the approval of three-fourths of the states. The Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times; the first ten amendments, which make up the
Bill of Rights , and the
Fourteenth Amendment
form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. Parties, Ideology & Politics The United States has operated under a
two-party system
for most of its history. For elective offices at all levels, state-administered
primary elections
choose the major party nominees for subsequent
general elections . Since the
general election of 1856 , the major parties have been the
Democratic Party ,
founded in 1824 , and the
Republican Party ,
founded in 1854 . Since the Civil War, only one
third-party
presidential candidate—former president
Theodore Roosevelt , running as a
Progressive
in
1912 —has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. Within American
political culture , the Republican Party is considered center-right or " conservative " and the Democratic Party is considered center-left or " liberal ". The states of the
Northeast
and
West Coast
and some of the
Great Lakes
states, known as " blue states ", are relatively liberal. The " red states " of the
South
and much of the
Great Plains
and
Rocky Mountains
are relatively conservative. The winner of the
2008 presidential election , Democrat
Barack Obama , is the
44th U.S. president
and the first
African American
to hold the office. All previous presidents were men of solely European descent. The 2008 elections also saw the Democratic Party strengthen its control of both the
House
and the
Senate . In the
111th United States Congress , the Senate comprises 56 Democrats, two
independents
who caucus with the Democrats, and 41 Republicans (one seat remains in dispute); the House comprises 255 Democrats and 178 Republicans (two seats are vacant). Geographic divisions The United States is a
federal union
of fifty states. The original thirteen states were the successors of the
thirteen colonies
that rebelled against British rule. Most of the rest have been carved from territory obtained through war or purchase by the U.S. government. One set of exceptions comprises
Vermont ,
Texas , and Hawaii: each was an independent republic before joining the union. Another set of exceptions comprises those states created out of the territory of the original thirteen. Early in the country's history, three states were created in this manner:
Kentucky
from
Virginia ;
Tennessee
from
North Carolina ; and
Maine
from
Massachusetts . During the
American Civil War ,
West Virginia
broke away from Virginia. The most recent state—Hawaii—achieved statehood on August 21, 1959. The states
do not have the right
to
secede
from the union. The states compose the vast bulk of the U.S. land mass; the two other areas considered integral parts of the country are the District of Columbia, the
federal district
where the capital, Washington, is located; and
Palmyra Atoll , an uninhabited but
incorporated territory
in the Pacific Ocean. The United States also possesses five major overseas territories:
Puerto Rico
and the
United States Virgin Islands
in the Caribbean; and
American Samoa ,
Guam , and the
Northern Mariana Islands
in the Pacific. Those born in the territories (except for American Samoa) possess
U.S. citizenship . Foreign relations & Military The United States exercises global economic, political, and military influence. It is a permanent member of the
United Nations Security Council
and New York City hosts the
United Nations Headquarters . Almost all countries have
embassies
in Washington, D.C., and many host
consulates
around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host
American diplomatic missions . However,
Cuba ,
Iran ,
North Korea ,
Bhutan ,
Sudan , and the
Republic of China
(Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States. The United States enjoys a
special relationship
with the
United Kingdom
and strong ties with
Australia ,
New Zealand ,
Japan ,
Israel , and fellow NATO members. It also works closely with its neighbors through the
Organization of American States
and
free trade agreements
such as the trilateral
North American Free Trade Agreement
with
Canada
and
Mexico . In 2005, the United States spent $27 billion on
official development assistance , the most in the world. However, as a share of
gross national income
(GNI), the U.S. contribution of 0.22% ranked twentieth of twenty-two donor states. Nongovernmental sources such as private foundations, corporations, and educational and religious institutions donated $96 billion. The combined total of $123 billion is also the most in the world and seventh as a percentage of GNI. [47] The president holds the title of commander-in-chief of the nation's armed forces and appoints its leaders, the
secretary of defense
and the
Joint Chiefs of Staff . The
United States Department of Defense
administers the armed forces, including the
Army ,
Navy ,
Marine Corps , and
Air Force . The
Coast Guard
is run by the
Department of Homeland Security
in peacetime and the
Department of the Navy
in time of war. In 2005, the military had 1.38 million personnel on active duty, [48]
along with several hundred thousand each in the
Reserves
and the
National Guard
for a total of
2.3 million troops . The Department of Defense also employs about 700,000 civilians, disregarding contractors. Military service is voluntary, though
conscription
may occur in wartime through the
Selective Service System . American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft and aerial refueling tankers, the Navy's fleet of eleven active aircraft carriers, and
Marine Expeditionary Units
at sea in the Navy's
Atlantic and
Pacific fleets . Outside of the United States, the military is
deployed to 770 bases and facilities , on every continent
except Antarctica . [49]
The extent of this global military presence has prompted scholars to describe the United States as maintaining an "empire of bases." [50] Total U.S. military spending in 2006, over $528 billion, was 46% of global military spending and greater than the next fourteen largest national military expenditures combined. (In
purchasing power parity
terms, it was larger than the next six such expenditures combined.) The per capita spending of $1,756 was about ten times the world average. [51]
At 4.06% of GDP, U.S. military spending is ranked 27th out of 172 nations. [52]
The proposed base
Department of Defense budget
for 2009, $515.4 billion, is a 7% increase over 2008 and a nearly 74% increase over 2001. [53]
The estimated cost of the
Iraq War
to the United States through 2016 is $2.267 trillion. [54]
As of December 12, 2008, the United States had suffered 4,209 military fatalities during the war and almost 31,000 wounded. [55] Economy The United States has a
capitalist
mixed economy , which is fueled by abundant
natural resources , a well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity. [61]
According to the
International Monetary Fund , the U.S. GDP of $14.3 trillion constitutes 23% of the
gross world product
at market exchange rates and almost 21% of the gross world product at
purchasing power parity
(PPP). [4]
The largest national GDP in the world, it was about 4% less than the combined GDP of the
European Union
at PPP in 2007. [62]
The country ranks eighth in the world in
nominal GDP per capita
and fourth in
GDP per capita at PPP . [4]
The United States is the largest importer of goods and third largest exporter, though
exports per capita
are relatively low. Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners. [63]
The leading export commodity is electrical machinery, while vehicles constitute the leading import. [64]
After an expansion that lasted just over six years, the U.S. economy has been in
recession
since December 2007. [65] The
private sector
constitutes the bulk of the economy, with government activity accounting for 12.4% of GDP. The economy is
postindustrial , with the
service sector
contributing 67.8% of GDP. [66]
The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is finance and insurance. [67]
The United States remains an industrial power, with chemical products the leading manufacturing field. [68]
The United States is the third largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its largest importer. [69]
It is the world's number one producer of electrical and nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. While
agriculture
accounts for just under 1% of GDP, [66]
the United States is the world's top producer of corn [70]
and soybeans. [71]
The
New York Stock Exchange
is the world's largest by dollar volume. [72]
Coca-Cola
and
McDonald's
are the two most recognized brands in the world. [73] In 2005, 155 million persons were employed with earnings, of whom 80% had full-time jobs. [74]
The majority, 79%, were employed in the service sector. [1]
With about 15.5 million people, health care and social assistance is the leading field of employment. [75]
About 12% of workers are
unionized , compared to 30% in Western Europe. [76]
The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers. [77]
Between 1973 and 2003, a year's work for the average American grew by 199 hours. [78]
Partly as a result, the United States maintains the highest labor productivity in the world. However, it no longer leads in productivity per hour as it did from the 1950s through the early 1990s; workers in Norway, France, Belgium, and
Luxembourg
are now more productive per hour. [79]
The United States ranks third in the
World Bank's
Ease of Doing Business Index . [77]
Compared to Europe, U.S. property and corporate
income tax rates
are generally higher, while labor and, particularly, consumption tax rates are lower. [80] Income & Human development According to the
United States Census Bureau , the pretax
median household income
in 2007 was $50,233. The median ranged from $68,080 in
Maryland
to $36,338 in
Mississippi . [60]
Using
purchasing power parity
exchange rates, the overall median is similar to the most affluent cluster of
developed nations . After declining sharply during the middle of the 20th century,
poverty rates
have plateaued since the early 1970s, with 11–15% of Americans below the
poverty line
every year, and 58.5% spending at least one year in poverty between the ages of 25 and 75. [5] [82]
In 2007, 37.3 million Americans lived in poverty. [60]
The U.S. welfare state is now among the most austere in the developed world, reducing both
relative poverty
and
absolute poverty
by considerably less than the mean for rich nations. [83] [84]
While the American welfare state does well in reducing poverty among the elderly, [85]
the young receive relatively little assistance. [86]
A 2007
UNICEF
study of children's well-being in twenty-one industrialized nations ranked the United States next to last. [87] Despite strong increases in productivity, low unemployment, and low inflation, income gains since 1980 have been slower than in previous decades, less widely shared, and accompanied by increased economic insecurity. Between 1947 and 1979,
real median income
rose by over 80% for all classes, with the incomes of poor Americans rising faster than those of the rich. [88] [89]
Median household income
has increased for all classes since 1980, [90]
largely owing to more dual-earner households, the closing of the gender gap, and longer work hours, but growth has been slower and strongly tilted toward the very top (see graph). [83] [88] [91]
Consequently, the share of income of the top 1%—21.8% of total reported income in 2005—has more than doubled since 1980, [92]
leaving the United States with the greatest income inequality among developed nations. [83] [93]
The top 1% pays 27.6% of all federal taxes; the top 10% pays 54.7%. [94]
Wealth, like income, is highly concentrated: The richest 10% of the adult population possesses 69.8% of the country's household wealth, the second-highest share among developed nations. [95]
The top 1% possesses 33.4% of net wealth. [96] Science & Ttechnology The United States has been a leader in scientific research and technological innovation since the late 19th century. In 1876,
Alexander Graham Bell
was awarded the first U.S.
patent for the telephone .
Thomas Edison 's laboratory developed the
phonograph , the first
long-lasting light bulb , and the first viable
movie camera .
Nikola Tesla
pioneered
alternating current , the
AC motor , and
radio . In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of
Ransom E. Olds
and
Henry Ford
promoted the
assembly line . The
Wright brothers , in 1903, made the
first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight . [97]
The rise of
Nazism
in the 1930s led many European scientists, including
Albert Einstein
and
Enrico Fermi , to immigrate to the United States. During World War II, the
Manhattan Project
developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the
Atomic Age . The
Space Race
produced rapid advances in rocketry,
materials science , and computers. The United States largely developed the
ARPANET
and its successor, the
Internet . Today, the bulk of research and development funding, 64%, comes from the private sector. [98]
The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and
impact factor . [99]
Americans possess high levels of technological consumer goods, [100]
and almost half of U.S. households have
broadband Internet access . [101]
The country is the primary developer and grower of
genetically modified food ; more than half of the world's land planted with biotech crops is in the United States. [102] Transportation As of 2003, there were 759 automobiles per 1,000 Americans, compared to 472 per 1,000 inhabitants of the European Union the following year. [103]
About 40% of
personal vehicles
are vans,
SUVs , or light trucks. [104]
The average American adult (accounting for all drivers and nondrivers) spends 55 minutes driving every day, traveling 29 miles (47 km). [105]
The U.S. intercity passenger rail system is relatively weak. [106]
Only 9% of total U.S. work trips use
mass transit , compared to 38.8% in Europe. [107]
Bicycle usage is minimal, well below European levels. [108]
The civil airline industry is entirely privatized, while most major airports are publicly owned. The five largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are American:
American Airlines
is number one. [109]
Of the world's thirty busiest passenger airports, sixteen are in the United States, including the busiest,
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport
(ATL). [110] Energy The United States energy market is 29,000
terawatt
hours per year.
Energy consumption per capita
is 7.8 tons of oil equivalent per year, compared to Germany's 4.2 tons and Canada's 8.3 tons. In 2005, 40% of this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and
renewable energy
sources. [111]
The United States is the world's largest consumer of petroleum. [112]
For decades, nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other developed countries. Recently, applications for new nuclear plants have been filed. [113] Demographics The United States population is projected by the U.S. Census Bureau to be 305,856,000, [2]
including an estimated 11.2 million
illegal immigrants . [114]
The United States is the third most populous nation in the world, after China and India. Its
population growth
rate is 0.89%, [1]
compared to the European Union's 0.16%. [115]
The
birth rate
of 14.16 per 1,000, 30% below the world average, is higher than any European country's except
Albania
and
Ireland . [116]
In fiscal year 2007, 1.05 million immigrants were granted
legal residence . Mexico has been the leading source of new residents for over two decades; since 1998, China, India, and the Philippines have been in the top four sending countries every year. [117]
The United States is the only industrialized nation in which large population increases are projected. [118] The United States has a very
diverse population —thirty-one
ancestry groups
have more than a million members. [119]
White Americans
are the largest
racial group , with
German Americans ,
Irish Americans , and
English Americans
constituting three of the country's four largest ancestry groups. [119]
African Americans
are the nation's largest
racial minority
and third largest ancestry group. [120] [119]
Asian Americans
are the country's second largest racial minority; the two largest Asian American ancestry groups are
Chinese
and
Filipino . [119]
In 2007, the U.S. population included an estimated 4.5 million people with some
American Indian
or
Alaskan native
ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and over 1 million with some
native Hawaiian
or
Pacific island
ancestry (0.5 million exclusively). [120] [121] The population growth of
Hispanic and Latino Americans
(the terms are officially interchangeable) is a major
demographic trend . The 45.4 million Americans of Hispanic descent are identified as sharing a distinct " ethnicity " by the Census Bureau; 64% of Hispanic Americans are of
Mexican descent . [122]
Between 2000 and 2007, the country's Hispanic population increased 27% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 3.6%. [120]
Much of this growth is from immigration; as of 2007, 12.4% of the U.S. population was foreign-born, with 54% of that figure born in
Latin America . [123]
Fertility is also a factor; the average Hispanic woman gives birth to three children in her lifetime. The comparable fertility rate is 2.2 for non-Hispanic black women and 1.8 for non-Hispanic white women (below the
replacement rate
of 2.1). [118]
Minorities
(as defined by the Census Bureau, all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constitute 34% of the population; they are projected to be the majority by 2042. [124] About 79% of Americans live in
urban areas
(as defined by the Census Bureau, such areas include the
suburbs ); about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000. [125]
In 2006, 254
incorporated places
had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than 1 million residents, and four
global cities
had over 2 million (New York City,
Los Angeles , Chicago, and
Houston ). [126]
There are fifty
metropolitan areas
with populations greater than 1 million. [127]
Of the fifty fastest-growing metro areas, twenty-three are in the West and twenty-five in the South. The metro areas of
Atlanta ,
Dallas ,
Houston ,
Phoenix , and
Riverside
all grew by more than three-quarters of a million people between 2000 and 2006. [128] Language English
is the de facto
national language . Although there is no
official language
at the federal level, some laws—such as
U.S. naturalization requirements —standardize English. In 2005, about 216 million, or 81% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home.
Spanish , spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught foreign language. [131] [132]
Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. [133]
Both
Hawaiian
and English are official languages in Hawaii by state law. [134]
While neither has an official language,
New Mexico
has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as
Louisiana
does for English and French. [135]
Other states, such as
California , mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms. [136]
Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English:
Samoan
and
Chamorro
are recognized by Samoa and Guam, respectively;
Carolinian
and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands; Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico. R eligion The United States is officially a
secular nation ; the
First Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the
free exercise of religion
and forbids the establishment of any religious governance. In a 2002 study, 59% of Americans said that religion played a "very important role in their lives," a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation. [137]
According to a 2007 survey, 78.4% of adults identified themselves as
Christian , [138]
down from 86.4% in 1990. [139]
Protestant
denominations accounted for 51.3%, while
Roman Catholicism , at 23.9%, was the largest individual denomination. The study categorizes white
evangelicals , 26.3% of the population, as the country's largest religious cohort; [138]
another study estimates evangelicals of all races at 30–35%. [140]
The total reporting non-Christian religions in 2007 was 4.7%, up from 3.3% in 1990. [139]
The leading non-Christian faiths were
Judaism
(1.7%),
Buddhism
(0.7%),
Islam
(0.6%),
Hinduism
(0.4%), and
Unitarian Universalism
(0.3%). [138]
From 8.2% in 1990, [139]
16.1% in 2007 described themselves as
agnostic ,
atheist , or simply having
no religion , [138]
still significantly less than in other postindustrial countries such as Britain (2005: 44%) and Sweden (2005: 85%). [141] Education American
public education
is operated by state and local governments, regulated by the
United States Department of Education
through restrictions on federal grants. Children are required in most states to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally,
kindergarten
or
first grade ) until they turn eighteen (generally bringing them through
twelfth grade , the end of
high school ); some states allow students to leave school at sixteen or seventeen. [142]
About 12% of children are enrolled in
parochial
or
nonsectarian
private schools . Just over 2% of children are
homeschooled . [143]
The United States has many competitive private and public
institutions of higher education , as well as local
community colleges
with open admission policies. Of Americans twenty-five and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a
bachelor's degree , and 9.6% earned graduate degrees. [144]
The basic
literacy rate
is approximately 99%. [1] [145]
The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world. [146] Health The United States
life expectancy
of 77.8 years at birth [147]
is a year shorter than the overall figure in Western Europe, and three to four years lower than that of Norway, Switzerland, and Canada. [148]
Over the past two decades, the country's rank in life expectancy has dropped from 11th to 42nd in the world. [149]
The
infant mortality rate
of 6.37 per thousand likewise places the United States 42nd out of 221 countries, behind all of Western Europe. [150]
U.S. cancer survival rates are the highest in the world. [151]
Approximately one-third of the adult population is
obese
and an additional third is overweight; [152]
the obesity rate, the highest in the industrialized world, has more than doubled in the last quarter-century. [153]
Obesity-related
type 2 diabetes
is considered
epidemic
by health care professionals. [154]
The U.S. adolescent pregnancy rate, 79.8 per 1,000 women, is nearly four times that of France and five times that of Germany. [155]
Abortion , legal on demand, is highly controversial. Many states ban public funding of the procedure and restrict late-term abortions, require parental notification for minors, and mandate a waiting period. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations. [156] The U.S. health care system far outspends any other nation's, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP. [158]
The
World Health Organization
ranked the U.S. health care system in 2000 as first in responsiveness, but 37th in overall performance. The United States is a leader in medical innovation. In 2004, the nonindustrial sector spent three times as much as Europe per capita on biomedical research. [159] Unlike in all other developed countries, health care coverage in the United States is not
universal . In 2004, private insurance paid for 36% of personal health expenditures, private out-of-pocket payments covered 15%, and federal, state, and local governments paid for 44%. [160]
In 2005, 46.6 million Americans, 15.9% of the population, were uninsured, 5.4 million more than in 2001. The main cause of this rise is the drop in the number of Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. [161]
The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans—estimates of which vary widely—is a major political issue. [162]
In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance. [163] Crime & Law enforcement Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police and
sheriff 's departments, with
state police
providing broader services. Federal agencies such as the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) and the
U.S. Marshals Service
have specialized duties. At the federal level and in almost every state, jurisprudence operates on a
common law
system. State courts conduct most criminal trials;
federal courts
handle certain designated crimes as well as
appeals
from state systems. Among
developed nations , the United States has above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of
gun violence
and
homicide . [164]
In 2007, there were 5.6 murders per 100,000 persons, [165]
three times the rate in neighboring Canada. [166]
The U.S. homicide rate, which decreased by 42% between 1991 and 1999, has been roughly steady since. [165]
Gun ownership rights
are the subject of
contentious political debate . The United States has the highest documented
incarceration
rate [167]
and total prison population [168]
in the world. At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults. [169]
The current rate is about seven times the 1980 figure. [170]
African American males are jailed at about six times the rate of white males and three times the rate of Hispanic males. [167]
In 2006, the U.S. incarceration rate was over three times the figure in Poland, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) country with the next highest rate. [171]
The country's high rate of incarceration is largely due to
sentencing
and
drug policies . [167] [172]
Though it has been abolished in most Western nations,
capital punishment
is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and in thirty-seven states. Since 1976, when the U.S. Supreme Court
reinstated the death penalty
after a four-year moratorium, there have been over 1,000 executions. [173]
In 2006, the country had the sixth highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran,
Pakistan , Iraq, and
Sudan . [174]
In December 2007,
New Jersey
became the first state to abolish the death penalty since the 1976 Supreme Court decision. Culture The United States is a
multicultural
nation, home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values. [7] [175]
There is no "American" ethnicity; aside from the now small
Native American
and
Native Hawaiian
populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors immigrated within the past five centuries. [176]
The culture held in common by most Americans is referred to as mainstream American culture, a
Western culture
largely derived from the traditions of
Western European
migrants, beginning with the early
English
and
Dutch
settlers.
German ,
Irish , and
Scottish
cultures have also been very influential. [7]
Certain cultural attributes of
Mandé
and
Wolof
slaves from West Africa were adopted by the American mainstream; based more on the traditions of Central African
Bantu
slaves, a distinct
African American culture
developed that would also deeply affect the mainstream. [177]
Westward expansion integrated the
Creoles
and
Cajuns
of Louisiana and the
Hispanos
of the Southwest and brought close contact with the
culture of Mexico . Large-scale immigration in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries from
Southern
and
Eastern Europe
introduced many new cultural elements. More recent immigration from
Asia
and especially
Latin America
has had broad impact. The resulting cultural mix may be described as a homogeneous
melting pot , or as a pluralistic
salad bowl
in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics. [7] While the mainstream culture holds that the United States is a
classless society , [178]
scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting
socialization , language, and values. [179]
The
American middle and professional class
has initiated many contemporary social trends such as
modern feminism ,
environmentalism , and multiculturalism. [180]
Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree. [181]
While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being
ordinary or average
is generally seen as a positive attribute. [182]
Though the
American Dream , or the perception that Americans enjoy high
social mobility , plays a key role in attracting immigrants, some analysts find that the United States has less social mobility than Western Europe and Canada. [183] Women now mostly work outside the home and receive a majority of
bachelor's degrees . [184]
In 2005,
28% of households
were married childless couples, the most common arrangement. [185]
Same-sex marriage
is contentious—several states permit
civil unions
in lieu of marriage. Between 2003 and 2008, the supreme courts of
Massachusetts ,
California , and
Connecticut
ruled those states' bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. The California ruling was superseded by
a state constitutional amendment , approved by voters in November 2008, that defines marriage as between a man and woman; the legality of the amendment is currently being contested in court. Between 2004 and 2008, voters in
13 other states
approved similar constitutional bans on same-sex marriage. Popular Media The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using
Thomas Edison 's
Kinetoscope . The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of
sound film 's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around
Hollywood, California . Director
D. W. Griffith
was central to the development of
film grammar
and
Orson Welles 's
Citizen Kane
(1941) is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time. [186]
American screen actors like
John Wayne
and
Marilyn Monroe
have become iconic figures, while producer/entrepreneur
Walt Disney
was a leader in both
animated film
and movie
merchandising . The
major film studios
of Hollywood have produced the most commercially successful movies in history, such as
Star Wars
(1977) and
Titanic
(1997), and the products of Hollywood today dominate the global film industry. [187] Americans are the heaviest television viewers in the world, [188]
and the average viewing time continues to rise, reaching five hours a day in 2006. [189]
The four major broadcast networks are all commercial entities. Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercialized, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day. [190]
Aside from
web portals
and
web search engines , the most popular websites are
MySpace ,
YouTube ,
Facebook ,
eBay , and Wikipedia. [191]
Twelve million Americans keep a blog. [192] The rhythmic and lyrical styles of
African American music
have deeply influenced
American music
at large, distinguishing it from European traditions. Elements from
folk
idioms such as the
blues
and what is now known as
old-time music
were adopted and transformed into
popular genres
with global audiences.
Jazz
was developed by innovators such as
Louis Armstrong
and
Duke Ellington
early in the 20th century.
Country music ,
rhythm and blues , and
rock and roll
emerged between the 1920s and 1950s. In the 1960s,
Bob Dylan
emerged from the
folk revival
to become one of America's greatest songwriters and
James Brown
led the development of
funk . More recent American creations include
hip hop
and
house music . American pop stars such as
Elvis Presley ,
Michael Jackson , and
Madonna
have become global celebrities. [193] Literature, philosophy & The arts In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as
Nathaniel Hawthorne ,
Edgar Allan Poe , and
Henry David Thoreau
established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century.
Mark Twain
and poet
Walt Whitman
were major figures in the century's second half;
Emily Dickinson , virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet. A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as
Herman Melville 's
Moby-Dick
(1851), Twain's
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
(1885), and
F. Scott Fitzgerald 's
The Great Gatsby
(1925)—may be dubbed the " Great American Novel ." Eleven U.S. citizens have won the
Nobel Prize in Literature , most recently
Toni Morrison
in 1993.
Ernest Hemingway , the 1954 Nobel laureate, is often named as one of the most influential writers of the 20th century. [194]
Popular literary genres such as the
Western
and
hardboiled crime fiction
developed in the United States. The
Beat Generation
writers opened up new literary approaches, as have
postmodernist
authors such as
John Barth ,
Thomas Pynchon , and
Don DeLillo . The
transcendentalists , led by
Ralph Waldo Emerson
and Thoreau, established the first major American
philosophical movement . After the Civil War,
Charles Peirce
and then
William James
and
John Dewey
were leaders in the development of
pragmatism . In the 20th century, the work of
W. V. Quine
and
Richard Rorty
brought
analytic philosophy
to the fore of U.S. academics.
Ayn Rand 's
objectivism
won mainstream popularity. In the visual arts, the
Hudson River School
was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European
naturalism . The 1913
Armory Show
in New York City, an exhibition of European
modernist art , shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene. [195]
Georgia O'Keeffe ,
Marsden Hartley , and others experimented with new styles, displaying a highly individualistic sensibility. Major artistic movements such as the
abstract expressionism
of
Jackson Pollock
and
Willem de Kooning
and the
pop art
of
Andy Warhol
and
Roy Lichtenstein
developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then
postmodernism
has brought fame to American architects such as
Frank Lloyd Wright ,
Philip Johnson , and
Frank Gehry . One of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario
P. T. Barnum , who began operating a lower
Manhattan
entertainment complex in 1841. The team of
Harrigan and Hart
produced a series of popular
musical
comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on
Broadway ; the songs of musical theater composers such as
Irving Berlin ,
Cole Porter , and
Stephen Sondheim
have become
pop standards . Playwright
Eugene O'Neill
won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple
Pulitzer Prize
winners
Tennessee Williams ,
Edward Albee , and
August Wilson . Though largely overlooked at the time,
Charles Ives 's work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition; other experimentalists such as
Henry Cowell
and
John Cage
created an American approach to classical composition.
Aaron Copland
and
George Gershwin
developed a unique synthesis of popular and classical music.
Choreographers
Isadora Duncan
and
Martha Graham
helped create
modern dance , while
George Balanchine
and
Jerome Robbins
were leaders in 20th century ballet. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of
photography , with major photographers including
Alfred Stieglitz ,
Edward Steichen
and
Ansel Adams . The newspaper
comic strip
and the
comic book
are both U.S. innovations.
Superman , the quintessential comic book
superhero , has become an American icon. Food Mainstream American
culinary arts
are similar to those in other Western countries.
Wheat
is the primary
cereal
grain. Traditional American cuisine uses ingredients such as
turkey ,
white-tailed deer
venison ,
potatoes ,
sweet potatoes ,
corn ,
squash , and
maple syrup , indigenous foods employed by Native Americans and early European settlers. Slow-cooked pork and beef
barbecue ,
crab cakes ,
potato chips , and
chocolate chip cookies
are distinctively American styles.
Soul food , developed by African slaves, is popular around the South and among many African Americans elsewhere.
Syncretic
cuisines such as
Louisiana creole ,
Cajun , and
Tex-Mex
are regionally important. Characteristic dishes such as
apple pie ,
fried chicken ,
pizza ,
hamburgers , and
hot dogs
derive from the recipes of various immigrants.
French fries , Mexican dishes such as
burritos
and
tacos , and
pasta
dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed. [196]
Americans generally prefer coffee to tea. Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages. [197]
During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans' caloric intake rose 24%; [196]
frequent dining at
fast food
outlets is associated with what health officials call the American "obesity epidemic." Highly sweetened
soft drinks
are widely popular; sugared beverages account for 9% of the average American's caloric intake. [198] Sports Since the late 19th century,
baseball
has been regarded as the
national sport ;
American football ,
basketball , and
ice hockey
are the country's three other leading professional team sports.
College football
and
basketball
attract large audiences. Football is now by several measures the most popular
spectator sport . [199]
Boxing
and
horse racing
were once the most watched individual sports, but they have been eclipsed by
golf
and
auto racing , particularly
NASCAR .
Soccer
is played widely at the youth and amateur levels and is growing in popularity as a professional spectator sport.
Tennis
and many outdoor sports are popular as well. While most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball,
volleyball ,
skateboarding , and
snowboarding
are American inventions.
Lacrosse
and
surfing
arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact. Eight
Olympic Games
have
taken place in the United States.
The United States has won 2,301 medals at the
Summer Olympic Games , more than any other country, [200]
and 216 in the
Winter Olympic Games , the second most. [201]
