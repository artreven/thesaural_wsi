Nirvana
in 1994.
Keys made guest appearances on several television series in the following years, beginning with
Charmed . She made her film debut in
Smokin' Aces
and went on to appear in
The Nanny Diaries
in 2007.
Her third studio album,
As I Am ,
was released in the same year and sold six million copies worldwide,
earning Keys an additional three Grammy Awards. The following year, she
appeared in
The Secret Life of Bees ,
which earned her a nomination at the
NAACP Image Awards . She released her fourth album,
The Element of Freedom , in December 2009, which became Keys' first chart-topping album in the United Kingdom. Throughout her career, Keys has won
numerous awards
and has sold over 30 million albums worldwide.
Billboard
magazine named her the top R&B artist of the 2000–2009 decade,
establishing herself as one of the best-selling artists of her time. In
2010, VH1 included Keys on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All
Time.
Life and career 1981–96: Early life Keys was born January 25, 1981 Alicia Augello Cook on January 25, 1981, in the
Hell's Kitchen
area of
Manhattan , in
New York City ,
New York . She is the only child of Teresa Augello, a
paralegal
and part-time actress, and Craig Cook, a
flight attendant . Keys' mother is of
Scottish ,
Irish
and
Italian
descent, and her father is
African American ; Keys has expressed that she was comfortable with her
biracial
heritage because she felt she was able to "relate to different cultures".
Her parents separated when she was two and she was subsequently raised
by her mother during her formative years in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan. In 1985, Keys made an appearance on
The Cosby Show
at the age of four, where she and a group of girls played the parts of
Rudy Huxtable's
sleepover guests in the episode "Slumber Party".
Throughout her childhood, Keys was sent to music and dance classes by her mother. She began playing the
piano
when she was seven and learned
classical music
by composers such as
Beethoven ,
Mozart
and
Chopin . hfr
Keys enrolled in the
Professional Performing Arts School
at the age of 12, where she majored in choir and began writing songs at the age of 14. She graduated in three years as
valedictorian
at the age of 16.
In 1994 Keys met long-term manager Jeff Robinson after she enrolled in his brother's after-school program.
The following year Robinson introduced Keys to her future A&R at
Arista Records, Peter Edge, who later described his first impressions to
HitQuarters :
"I had never met a young R&B artist with that level of
musicianship. So many people were just singing on top of loops and
tracks, but she had the ability, not only to be part of hip-hop, but
also to go way beyond that."
Edge helped Robinson create a showcase for Keys and also got involved
in developing her demo material. He was keen to sign Keys himself but
was unable to do so at that time due to being on the verge of leaving
his present record company. Keys signed to
Columbia Records
soon after.
At the same time as signing a recording contract with Columbia Records, Keys was accepted into
Columbia University . At first, Keys attempted to manage both but after four weeks dropped out of college to pursue her musical career fulltime.
1997–2000: Career beginnings Keys signed a demo deal with
Jermaine Dupri
and
So So Def Recordings ,
where she appeared on the label's Christmas album performing "The
Little Drummer Girl".
She also co-wrote and recorded a song entitled
"Dah Dee Dah (Sexy Thing)" , which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1997
film,
Men in Black .
The song was Keys' first professional recording; however, it was never
released as a single and her record contract with Columbia ended after a
dispute with the label. Keys was unhappy with the label because her
career had stalled during her two years under contract at Columbia due
to executive indecision over her direction and major changes within the
company. Keys called
Clive Davis , who sensed a "special, unique" artist from her performance and signed her to
Arista Records , which later disbanded.
Keys almost chose Wilde as her stage name until her manager suggested
the name Keys after a dream he had. Keys felt that name represented her
both as a performer and person. Following Davis to his newly formed
J Records
label, she recorded the songs "Rock wit U"
and "Rear View Mirror" , which were featured on the soundtracks to the films
Shaft
(2000) and
Dr. Dolittle 2
(2001), respectively.

was reissued as

remixes
and seven unplugged versions of the songs from the original.

2002 Grammy Awards :

Best Female R&B Vocal Performance , and
Best R&B Song
for "Fallin'",
Best New Artist , and
Best R&B Album ; "Fallin'" was also nominated for

Lauryn Hill
at the
41st Grammy Awards . That same year, she collaborated with
Christina Aguilera
for the latter's upcoming album
Stripped
on a song entitled "Impossible" , which Keys wrote, co-produced, and provided with background vocals. During the early 2000s, Keys also made small cameos in television series

a collection of unreleased poems from her journals and lyrics. The
title derived from one of her poems, "Love and Chains" from the line: "I
don't mind drinking my tears for water."
She said the title is the foundation of her writing because "everything
I have ever written has stemmed from my tears of joy, of pain, of
sorrow, of depression, even of question". The book sold over US$500,000 and Keys made
The New York Times
bestseller list in 2005.
The following year, she won a second consecutive award for Best R&B
Video at the MTV Video Music Awards for the video "Karma". Keys performed "If I Ain't Got You" and then joined

mental breakdown . Her grandmother had died and her family was heavily dependent on her. She felt she needed to "escape" and went to
Egypt
for three weeks. She explained: "That trip was definitely the most
crucial thing I've ever done for myself in my life to date. It was a
very difficult time that I was dealing with, and it just came to the
point where I really needed to—basically, I just needed to run away,
honestly. And I needed to get as far away as possible."

Prince ,
Nina Simone ,
Barbra Streisand ,

Quincy Jones ,
Donny Hathaway
and
Stevie Wonder . Keys' style is rooted in gospel and vintage soul music, supplemented by bass and programmed drumbeats. She heavily incorporates classical piano with
R&B ,
soul
and
jazz
into her music. She began experimenting with other genres, including
pop
and
rock , in her third studio album,

neo soul
to a 1980s and 1990s R&B sound with her fourth album,
The Element of Freedom . Patrick Huguenin of the
New York Daily News
stated that her incorporation of classical piano
riffs
contributed to her breakout success.
Jet
magazine states she "thrives" by touching her fans with "piano mastery, words and melodious voice". The Independent
described her style as consisting of "crawling blues coupled with a
hip-hop backbeat", noting that her lyrics "rarely stray from matters of
the heart".
Blender
magazine referred to her as "the first new pop artist of the millennium who was capable of changing music."
Keys playing the piano while performing, surrounded by three backing vocalists
Keys has a
vocal range
of a
contralto , which spans three octaves. Often referred to as the " Princess of Soul ", Keys has been commended as having a strong, raw and impassioned voice; others feel that her voice is "emotionally manufactured" at times and that she pushes her voice out of its natural range.Keys' songwriting is often criticized for lack of depth, which has led to her writing abilities being called limited.Her lyrics have been called generic,
clichéd
and that her songs revolve around generalities. Greg Kot of the
Chicago Tribune
feels that she "[pokes] around for multi-format hits rather than trying to project any sort of artistic vision". Diversely, Jon Pareles of
Blender
magazine stated that the musical composition of her songs makes up for their lyrical weakness, while Gregory Stephen Tate of
The Village Voice
compared Keys'
writing and production to 1970s music.
Joanna Hunkin of
The New Zealand Herald
reviewed one of Keys' performances, where
Kylie Minogue
also attended. She described Minogue's reaction to Keys' performance,
saying "it was obvious she was just as much of a fan as the 10,000 other
people at
Vector Arena ". She went on to say that Minogue was "the original pop princess bowing down to the modern-day queen of soul".
Hunkin characterized Keys' opening performance as a "headbanging,
hip-gyrating performance" and her energy as "high-octane energy most
bands save for their closing finale". At the end of her two-hour
performance, fans "screamed, stomped and begged for a second encore". Hillary Crosley and Mariel Concepcion of
Billboard
magazine noted that her shows are "extremely coordinated" with the audience's
attention span
"consistently maintained". The show ended with a
standing ovation
and Keys "proved that a dynamic performance mixed with superior musicianship always wins". Throughout her career, Keys has won
numerous awards
and is listed on the
Recording Industry Association of America 's
best-selling
artists in the United States, with 15 million
certified
albums. She has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and has established herself as one of the best-selling artists of her time.
