street dance
style that evolved as part of the
hip hop movement
among
African American
and
Puerto Rican
youths in
Manhattan
and the
South Bronx
of
New York City
during the early 1970s. It is normally danced to
electro
or
hip hop music , often
remixed
to prolong the
breaks , and is a well-known
hip hop dance
style. Breakdancing involves the elements of
toprock ,
downrock ,
freezes , and
power moves . A breakdancer, breaker, b-boy or b-girl refers to a person who practices breakdancing. Breakdancing may have begun as a building, productive, and a constructive
youth culture
alternative to the violence of urban street gangs. [1]
Today, breakdancing culture is a remarkable discipline somewhere between those of
dancers
and
athletes . Since acceptance and involvement centers on dance skills, breakdancing culture is often free of the common race and gender boundaries of a
subculture
and has been accepted worldwide. VESTIMENT
