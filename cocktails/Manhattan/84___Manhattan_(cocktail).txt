Merry Christmas!
On Sunday, Kate and Carol had an afternoon Christmas party.
Weenie and I met Bacon and Meredith at the Monkey for a little nourishment before the drinking began.
We arrived at the party around 4:30. As the afternoon turned into night, the dancing began. We hadn't had enough beers, so after we left the party we went to One More for more beers.
And dancing.

The Great Debaters
Monday, we were guests of Jeff Powell at the Memphis premiere of
The Great Debaters . This is the new Denzel Washington movie produced by Oprah. Jeff did the music for the entire movie! The
soundtrack
was released yesterday. When we got into our seats, they served us BBQ! It was awesome. Beer and BBQ at the movies! Here I am with Jeff.
The record was done at
Ardent Records
where Weenie works. Here she is with her boss.
Jeff spoke for a minute and then
Alvin Youngblood Hart
played a song from the movie. Then
Susan Marshall
and Teeny Hodges (Al Green's songwriting partner and guitarist) joined him onstage for another song from the movie. After that song,
Billy Rivers & the Angelic Voices of Faith
joined Susan, Teeny, Alvin and Jackie Johnson. I got chills right away. It was truly a moving experience. The movie was also moving and I cried about 5 times. After the movie, we went to the Blue Monkey to celebrate. Look at the happy couple! Kim Richardson
joined us. Her and Susan had us cracking up. Then, to top it all off,
Paul Mark
showed up! He's one of my favorite people. I don't get to see him often because he lives in New York and only comes to town to do a new record.

Weenie Gets Inked!
Yesterday, Weenie got her first tattoo! She had an appointment with Joe at
No Regrets Tattoo Emporium . She was very nervous and I told her it would be no big deal, it just might hurt a bit. She emerged 2 hours later while I napped in the car. Her Greek Key (symbolizes eternal life) was finished!
Once it's healed, I will post another picture.

39 for Holly!
Thursday, the 6th, was Holly's 39th birthday. We were all gathering at
Dish
for cocktails. Jed, V, Mooey, Weenie and I started at Blue Monkey at 6:00. We went to Dish around 7:15. Everyone was there by 8:00 and the cocktails were flowing. Dish is the only place in town that I know serves Ruby Red Grapefruit. So, Absolut and grapefruit was the poison of the night. Mel with her
Manhattan . Mel is kissing the honoree's boots. We left there late, as usual.
