Ravel - Bolero - Torvill & Dean
I would have loved the orchestral version of Bolero to be posted here.. (I actually had a Karajan version but Youtube deleted it..).. so sad :-((.. but I couldn't resist this Olympic video.. though the audio is a bit bad.. Watch it.. and I believe you will be amazed by the perfection!
