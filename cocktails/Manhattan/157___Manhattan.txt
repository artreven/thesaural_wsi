A place to be - B-C Accel
Kostis Aloizos
One of the most interesting places to visit is
Santa Claus village . This place is in North  Finland  and it stands out because you can see Santa Claus himself, it snows and it's freezing cold!
Tourists can see and visit some very impressive cathedrals, modern cafes and shops and different small houses that aren't real but they are very cozy and beautiful. But the place worth visiting is Santa Claus house. There is a fire place, a beautifully decorated Christmas tree with presents under it and wooden doors and windows.
In this place you can do a lot of things. You can visit stores and buy some souvenirs or you can go skiing.
When you go to Santa Claus house you can make cards to send to your friends. However the most unforgettable experience was the husky sledge ride. These dogs are unbelievably strong!
I think that Lapland is very attractive, with wonderful sights a definite must for everyone who likes Arctic adventures!

One of the most fascinating cities in the world is
Paris . Paris is the capital of France and it is located in the central north part of the country.
The most attractive sight in Paris is the
Eiffel tower
whose height is 325m (300 without the antenna) and it is made of metal. A visit to The Louvre, which is the biggest museum in the world, is a must! If you are travelling with children, you can visit Eurodisney which  is a very entertaining place for kids. Climbing the Eiffel tower is a unique experience. Tourists can go up with the elevator or walk up using the stairs. There is a restaurant at the top level where you can eat and enjoy the impressive view of the city below. A mini cruise along the River Seine is also one of the best things to do while in Paris
Visiting Paris is an unforgettable experience. People who there always return to the city of light.

Genoa
is a wonderful coastal town. Christopher Columbus was born there and it is the sixth biggest town in Italy. Other important ports are   Bari  in the south and  Ancona  in the north east..
Panoramic View of
Piazza De Ferrari
In Genoa you can visit a lot of sights. There is San Lorenzo cathedral which was built in the 12th century, there is an art gallery in the road
Galleria Nazionale di Palazzo Spinola , the
Palazzo Ducale
that was built in the 16th century and the
Palazzo Reale
built in the 17th century. There is a beautiful theatre in the palace that is called Falcone and there are five villages called
Cinque Terre  in the
Liguria
region of Italy.
Genoa can be explored by car or on foot, depending on the weather. There is a wide variety of restaurants - trattorias - where you can enjoy different kinds of fish, and have the chance to taste the amazing genuine pesto a la Genovese. Of course pizzas are on the menu and endless pasta recipes.
Anyone who visits Genoa is amazed by the unique beauty of the city and the surrounding area. It is a place to visit again and again.

New York is in the Unites States of America and it is one of the most attractive cities in the world. The city is characterized by the numerous skyscrapers that make up a unique place to be.
There are many place worth visiting. One of the most interesting sights is the Empire State Building, which is the tallest building in N.Y. Another place worth visiting is the
Statue of Liberty . The city's landmark is on Liberty island in New York Harbour.
The city is definitely not dull. New York boasts for its five hundred art galleries, one hundred and fifty museums and the over one hundred theatres.
Hard Rock cafe
is a legendary place. It is still very popular with tourists. It is famous for its decoration and the people who used go there. New York is full of styilish posh restaurants but it is also full of restaurants that serve food from all over the world.
Families must also visit the New
York City Zoos , starting from
Central Park Zoo
in
Manhattan .
New York is definitely one of the most exciting and worth visiting places in the world!

Hawaii
is in the
Pacific Ocean
and it is one of the most beautiful islands in the world. This island became especially popular last year because of its volcano eruption.
Another attractive place where tourists can go is the forest which are full of colourful flowers and rare birds and animals. Hawaii is also very famous for the beaches! Surfing on the huge waves is really impressive. Of course anyone who tries it has to be very careful and try hard to stay on the surf board.
Visitors can also relax under the hot sun while enjoying some cool mango juice.
Overall a visit to Hawaii is a lot of fun. It is no wonder that it is such a popular tourist attraction. Hawaii is well worth visiting.

Barcelona
is in east Spain. It is one of the most interesting European cities. It is also an important commercial port.
One of the most interesting sights is the Picaso Museum, which was actually the place he lived. Other places to visit are the temple of Sagrada Familia, the Gaudi Museum and
Park Guell  which is the biggest park in Spain.
The most famous place is the Barcelona stadium an impressively huge football stadium, which is the home of one of the best European football teams Barcelona F.C.
If visitors want to relax from the exploration, they can go to one of the many cafes in the city centre and enjoy the view of mountain Tibidabo.
Visiting Barcelona also means enjoying one of the best European recipes offered in the modern or more traditional Spanish restaurants.

Rome
is the capital of Italy and it is really impressive. It is an attractive city with many sights and hotels. It is also the best city to go during the Christmas holidays or summer vacations. Rome is full of places worth visiting.
One of these awesome sights is the Pantheon where the Ancient Romans used to worship the twelve Gods of Olympus. It is very attractive. You must also go to the Colosseum. It is where the gladiators used to fight with wild animals, tigers and lions, or other fighters. Some old castles are still there and they are really worth a visit. There is also a great shopping Mall.
But Rome isn’t only full of sights and castles. Visitors can go on bike rides in the streets of Rome and have a nice time with their friends or family. They can also go to the cozy pizzerias and gelaterias. Something else they can do it to spend Christmas there. Rome has a lovely weather and all the city is lighted up!
In my opinion, Rome is the best city I have ever visited. You will have an unforgettable time there.

Egypt is one of the most impressive countries in North Aftica. It is one of the most ancient and historical countries in the world.
One of the most interesting sights in Egypt is the  Sphinx . Another place worth visiting is the Sahara Desert which is the biggest desert in the world. Tourists can also go on a boat ride on the River Nile, a great tourist attraction.
Tourists must also go on a tour of the Pyramids and explore one of them. But be careful not to get trapped. The Pyramids are full of mysteries. The Pyramids of Giza are incredibly big. They are the biggest pyramids in the world.
Cairo
is the capital of Egypt. Tourists can visit its many museums or go shopping. Also trying the famous arab recipes is an excellent idea.
