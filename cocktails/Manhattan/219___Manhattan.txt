February 4, 2012 News language demianturner
Thanks to reading this
Wikipedia article
I’ve realised I can claim to know 2 versions of English, or at least 2 dialects, I hadn’t realised how many differences there are.  There may be some more recent words which are missing as I left N. America on 1996!
