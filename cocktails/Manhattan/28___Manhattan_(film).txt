When I visited Central Park earlier this year with our guests from out-of-town I could not help but to image this incredible space as an edifice.  Architects have always been fascinated with
towers
and
skyscrapers .
What if we turned Central Park from the horizontal to the vertical.  Of course the image below is very literal, but–
Can we apply some of the theories of  Fredrick Olmsted  to a skyscraper in the city?  Could this be the beginning of the  resurgence of the city ?

A.D.D.
may be over diagnosed these days (especially in schools), but during Architecture School one of
my professors
wanted my friend to see how long I could stay at my drafting table (remember those? I’m dating myself here, although my class may have been one of the last to use them).  After a few minutes I would get restless, now with social media I can work on several things at once which satisfies the A.D.D.
What we discovered ( after several all-nighters)
was a direct link between where I lived and the airplane “noise” I would hear subconsciously (after living under the flight zone my entire life my consciousness had completely tuned it out).  I used the timing of the flights (every 2 to 3 minutes) to help inform my
Architectural design theories .  For example;
New York City Recording Apparatus
Here is a map of where I grew up:
Where I grew up and lived for close to 30-years
A Closer Look
Perhaps this helps shed some light on how I operate!

We all lead busy lives.  As  Hurricane Irene  and  TD TEN  get closer what better time to catch up watching some classic films?  While you are out buying water and batteries be sure to buy some popcorn as well.  Here is a list I compiled for you if you get stuck.  Many are available on  Netflix  or  Hulu .
