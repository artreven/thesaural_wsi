Houstonist Bartender: Make It a Manhattan
The sixth anniversary of 9/11 made this an emotional week for
Gothamist ,
DCist ,
Phillyist
and the rest of America, too.
Houstonist reflected on Tuesday as well.
But, our preferred method of remembering the departed is to raise a glass and say a few words in their honor.
A
Manhattan
is
the perfect cocktail
for this occasion.
Manhattan + 2 oz. Rye
+ 1/2 oz. vermouth
+ Dash Angostura bitters
+ Cherry
+ Orange peel
Pour the vermouth, whiskey and bitters into a mixing glass containing a few cubes of ice. Stir gently to avoid clouding the drink. Put the cherry in a chilled cocktail glass and strain in the mixture. Rub the cut edge of the orange peel over the rim of the glass and twist it over the drink to release the oils but do not add it.
Thanks to Houstonist reader Eric Johnson for suggesting this cocktail.
He likes it because he makes him feel classy at dive bars.
The trick is finding a dive bar that will twist one up for you.
Drop a comment so that EJ, and the rest of us, will know where to get the best in Houston.
Have a drink we should spread to the masses?
Send it along
[jason at houstonist dot com] , and we just may post it after some extensive testing.
Don't be a dumbass. Drink responsibly or
take a cab .
