Reading Wikipedia, I noticed that
Billings
has roughly the same male-to-female ratio for 18+ year-olds as
Manhattan , specifically 9:10. (Links added for your convenience) I can see why this is the case for NYC: it attracts artsy types, writers and fashion designers from across the world, and they tend to be female.
For comparison, in Bozeman, the gender ratio is more like 10:9.
Is this simply some kind of statistical artifact, or is there a reason for this?

The reason you find that ratio in Bozeman is because it is the home of Montana State University,
a strong Engineering, Agriculture, and Science university, where male students out-number female
students, and the outdoor sports of the local area, such as skiing, also are male dominated.
Stats I
could find for the MSU ratio is 57% male to 43% female students.
Billings and Bozeman are very different and very far apart geographically.
Billings is much larger and
has a more diverse economy.
The population of Bozeman is younger because of the university and
because many people into outdoor sports move to or stay in Bozeman.
Hope that helps.

Bozeman has a
fluctuating younger population with median age being 27 years
old, with more men than women moving to new areas.
Billings is more stable at a 37 as median age, with more older people than Bozeman, and older women are much more prevalent than older men due to men dieing at a younger age than women.
With the median age difference, the statistics you mention are normal.

Does that make Billings the 'Cougar' Capitol of Montana?

Manhattan's median age is essentially the same as well (36).
BTW, sorry, the forum replaced my links in the OP. They were to the "Demographics" sections of Billings' and Manhattan's Wikipedia articles.

You're right though. For younger people Billings seems normal:

Now the links are back. When I looked at them 30 minutes ago, they were pointing to city-data instead, with a little "i" (info?) icon next to them.

I get it. When you are logged out, the original links are covered by city-data's self-references.
