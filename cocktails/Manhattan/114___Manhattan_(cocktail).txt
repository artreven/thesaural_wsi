Alcoholics go to meetings...

Drinking Question:
Recently was told to cut out carbonation and juices because of a stomach problem, but the gastroentestinologist said alcohol is still OK.
So what's the best mixed drink you can think of with no bubbles or acidic juices?

Blueberry Tea ? (I like: early grey + Irish whiskey)
Come to think of it,
God's Blessings
- good coffee and Irish whiskey.
Or hell, a nice Irish whiskey like
Bushmills
(1608 - the Black Bush is a little more expensive and a little stronger, tastewise - it may take some growing to love-to).
Good ol' Bloody Mary (tomato juice, vodka, & lemon juice) or the Canadian take on it, the
Caesar
with Clamato (tomato and clams, what's
not
to like?), vodka, and worstershire sauce (celery is fine, but munching on a pickled stringbean/redrunner or asparagus spear is a pleasant departure). I like adding a bit of garlic to mine, and real chopped up chilis over tabasco sauce. On the mundane side, there's the ol' screwdriver; vodka + OJ.
Sex on the Beach
is non-carbonic. As is the
Leprechaun
for that matter.
I'm also fond of the
cosmopolitan
but then again, there's a lot to be said for a nice "drinking man's cocktail" - the
Manhattan . Along the same vein, you have your various
martinis
(I like mine perfect - 1 Stolichnaya, 1 Beefeaters, 1/2 Noilly Prat dry vermouth - save the Martini & Rossi for your Manhattan - and either a couple of capers or a single pickled pearl onion). posted by

Vodka goes with anything, really...like Gatorade, Kool-Aid, or neat (straight up).
Good tequila is great as well, straight up without the lemon.

mint julep (bourbon/rye, mint, sugar)
sazerac (rye, pastis, sugar, peychaud's bitters)

If you can use rose's lime, which bears only the faintest resemblance to actual lime juice, you can make gimlets. posted by

If you're going to make a white russian, you have to serve it as a separator. First you put ice cubes in the highball glass. Then you add the Kahlua.
Second layer is milk, poured onto a spoon held in the glass just above the Kahlua.
Wash off the spoon, then pour the vodka onto the spoon to form the third layer.
Serve with the spoon on the side, so it can be stirred up just before drinking. posted by

Sorry. Not for the OP, but if you're making gimlets, use fresh lime juice... you'll never go back. (I won't even keep Rose's in my home -- nasty stuff!) posted by

I think the weird funkiness of Rose's is acceptable in, and
only
in, gimlets.
3 gin : 1 rose's, it's not so bad. posted by

Eh, too each his own, I guess. Try them side-by-side. Use a little simple syrup if you miss the cloying sweetness of Rose's. In my years as a bartender, I won many a patron over to the bright side. posted by

Serve it in a
martini

Jagermeister
is good for the stomach. Various German herbal schnapps are taken as "digestives" to aid the stomach --
these concoctions
are generally products of southern Germany or Bavaria, and bear no resemblance to the cheap fruit or mint flavored "schnapps" often sold in American liquor stores. Some people who love to eat swear by
Italian grappa
as being just the thing for troubled or abused stomachs. Some
mezcal
(not tequila) is said to be very beneficial for stomach problems. posted by

You specifically mention mixed drinks, so perhaps my suggestions won't work for you. However, a terrific
rum
like
Rhum Barbancourt
[warning: Flash] -- the 8yo is very good, but the 15yo is amazing -- would fit your requirements, but the
range of sipping rums available
is staggering. While they aren't as common as high-end scotch or whisky, they are becoming easier to find, in part because the cost is much more reasonable. You should have no trouble finding something like
Gosling's Black Seal
[warning: Flash site with sound], but don't be fooled into thinking that the name Bacardi indicates a premium rum. (Okay, the Barcardi 8 isn't too bad, and the Anejo is okay. But if it has fruit flavoring, stay away. Assuming you aren't in high school, that is.)
Of course, considering herbal beverages opens up a whole new world.
Chartreuse
-- green or yellow -- is marvelous and complex. And as mentioned, Jagermeister is "good for what ails ya." posted by

Your best bet are going to be martini-style cocktails.
Namely, mostly liquor and liquers.
That's if you are dead set on mixed drinks.
Otherwise I'd take this as golden opportunity to try some quality sipping liquors.
Some that will not let you down:
Vodkas
Grey goose; Hangar One (Hangar one also makes extremely high quality flavored vodkas); Chopin; Belvedere.
Try at room temp or straight out of the freezer
Tequilas
If you are used to scotch, you may wish to try añejos, as it is closer to what you are used to.
Although blancos and resposados are both very tasty.
Brands to try include: Casa Noble (among the finest tequilas around); El Tesoro; Patron.
All these brands are 100% agave, and absolutely delicious for sipping.
Gins
Perfect straight or in a martini.
Try Bombay (regular or sapphire) - which is very complex, or Tanqueray/Tanqueray 10, which is very focused, with regular Tanq having a very strong clean juniper flavor, and Tanq 10 having a more ethereal citrusy note.
Herbal
As several above posters have remarked herbal liquers have been used for centauries as digestion aids.
YMMV as they are usually hard on my stomach, but they are certainly worth a shot.
In addition to the Jaeger and Chartreuse mentioned above, I'd suggest benedictine (I know several who swear by it and it has a very complex and distinctive herbal bite to it, it's almost like a buzzsaw on the tongue).
Cognac
If you have some extra $$$ to spend any name brand XO cognac (e.g. courvoisier, hennessey, remy martin) would be an outstanding choice.
If are like me and only have $ to spend, definatley give Remy Martin VSOP a try.
They add some significantly older cognacs to it than is average for a VSOP, and it shows-beautiful notes of fruits and spices, without
the fire-water burn of cheaper cognac/brandies.
Whisky
I'm glad you are planning on drinking more scotches.
I can suggest some specific bottlings to try if you provide more info, but may I also suggest trying the world outside of scotland?
Jameson and RedBreast (same distiller) make some outstanding irish whiskies, and knob creek and Pappy Van Winkle 15yo bourbons are world class by any measure.
For something a little different Rye is making a comeback, and for good reason.
It's incredibly flavorful and just a little bit different.
If you can find it Pappy van winkle 13yo Rye is a steal at $25 a bottle, but I hear old overholt and jim bean also make passable ryes. posted by

If you order an Old Fashioned (and you should), make sure the bartender doesn't put soda water (!) in it. You might think that none would be so foolish, but you'd be wrong. posted by

They are passable if made with high enough quality ingredients, but in that case seem to be less than the sum of their parts. posted by

Combining several suggestions above, a Rob Roy is a Manhattan made with Scotch instead of bourbon. This is one of my new favorite drinks to order. It's fun to get this mistaken for a Roy Rogers, which is a Shirley Temple with coke instead of 7-up, and have the bartender laugh at you, only to then laugh in his face when you explain how to make it. posted by
