Joseph Haydn
Franz Joseph Haydn [1] [2]
( March 31 ,
1732
–
May 31 ,
1809 ) was one of the
most prominent
composers
of the
classical period , and is called by some the
"Father of the
Symphony " and "Father of the
String
Quartet ".
A life-long resident of
Austria , Haydn
spent most of his career as a
court
musician for the wealthy Hungarian
Esterházy
family on their remote
estate .
Isolated from other composers and trends in music until the later part of his
long life, he was, as he put it, "forced to become original". [3]
Haydn’s Trumpet Concerto
Joseph
Haydn 's
Concerto per il Clarino ,
Hob. : VII e, 1 ( Trumpet Concerto in E flat
major ) was written in 1796, when he was 64 years old, for his long time
friend
Anton Weidinger .
Anton Weidinger reputably had
developed a
keyed trumpet
which could play chromatically
throughout its entire range. Before this, the trumpet was commonly valveless
and could only play a limited range of harmonic notes by altering lip pressure.
These harmonic notes were clustered in the higher registers, so previous
trumpet concertos could only play melodies at very high pitches (e.g., Bach's
Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 ). Haydn's concerto
includes melodies in the lower register, exploiting the capabilities of the new
instrument.
There were attempts all over Europe around the mid-classical era to expand the range
of the trumpet using valves, and Weidinger's idea of drilling holes and
covering them with flute-like keys proved reasonably unpopular, due to their
poorer quality of sound. Thus the natural trumpet still had continual use in
the classical orchestra whilst the keyed trumpet had barely any repetoire. The
valved
trumpets
used today started to appear in the 1830s.
The work is composed in three
movements (typical of a
concerto ), and they are marked as follows:
I. Allegro
II. Andante
III. Finale-Allegro (Rondo)
Charlie Parker
Ornithology
Ornithology" is a
jazz standard
by
Bebop
alto saxophonist
Charlie Parker
and trumpeter
Benny Harris . Its title is a reference to
Parker's nickname, "Bird". The Charlie Parker Septet made the first
recording of the tune on March 28,
1946
on the
Dial
label, and was inducted into the
Grammy Hall of Fame
in
1989 . [1]
"Ornithology" is a
contrafact
- that is, a newly created
melody
written over
the
chord progression
of another song, in this case
the
standard
" How High the Moon ". It remains one of the
most popular and frequently performed
bebop
tunes. Jazz
vocalists
scatting
on "How High the Moon" (notably
Ella
Fitzgerald ) often quote the melody of "Ornithology" (and vice
versa).
Notable recordings include
Bud Powell 's
version. A set of
Vocalese
lyrics was also created by
Babs
Gonzales .
Miles Davis & Charlie Parker
Slow
Boat to China "
is a
popular
song
by
Frank
Loesser , published in
1947 . This song is featured prominently in the
Peter
Greenaway
film
8 1/2 Women .
Everything Happens to Me
This is Parker playing in a more ‘smooth
jazz’ style with a string backing. It’s a Hoagy Carmichael & Johnny Mercer tune.
Dizzy Gillespie
Groovin' High
is an influential 1945 song by
jazz
composer
and
trumpeter
Dizzy
Gillespie . The song was a
bebop
mainstay that became a
jazz
standard , [1]
one of Gillespie's best known hits, [2]
and, according to
Bebop: The Music and Its Players
author Thomas Owens, "the first famous bebop recording". [3]
The song is a complex musical arrangement based on the
chord
structure
of the 1920 standard "Whispering" by John Schonberger. [2]
The biography
Dizzy
characterizes the song as
"a pleasant medium-tempo tune" that
"demonstrates...[Gillespie's] skill in fashioning interesting textures
using only six instruments". [2]
Crazeology
Written by Benny Harris
(April 23, 1919,
New
York City
- May 11, 1975,
San
Francisco ) was an American
bebop
trumpeter and composer.
Harris's first major gig was in
1939 with
Tiny Bradshaw . He played with
Earl Hines
in 1941 and 1943, and worked the
52nd Street
bebop circuit in
New York City
in the 1940s, where he collaborated
with
Benny
Carter ,
John
Kirby ,
Coleman Hawkins ,
Don Byas , and
Thelonious
Monk . He was with
Boyd Raeburn
from 1944-45 and
Clyde Hart
in 1944; he and Byas worked together again in 1945. He played less in the late
1940s, though he appeared with
Dizzy
Gillespie
in 1949 and
Charlie Parker
in 1952; after this he quit music
entirely.
Harris was never a well-known
soloist, and is better known for his compositions, which include " Ornithology " (a signature Charlie
Parker tune), "Crazeology", "Reets and I" (a
Bud Powell
favorite), and "Wahoo".
Chet Baker
Specializing in relaxed, even
melancholy music, Baker rose to prominence as a leading name in
cool jazz
in the 1950s. Baker's good looks and smoldering, intimate singing voice
established him as a promising name in
pop music
as well. But his success was badly hampered by
drug
addiction , particularly in the 1960s, when he was imprisoned.
He mounted a successful comeback
in the '70s, but died in 1988 after falling from a hotel window.

Marilyn Monroe
performing
My Heart Belongs to Daddy
in

Make Love .
The song contains one of Porter's
most obscure lyrics among its several rhymes for "daddy" - in which
the singer talks about her "fine finnan haddie," a Scottish term for
smoked
haddock .
Referring specifically to the
melody,
Oscar
Levant
described it as "one of the most Yiddish tunes ever
written" despite the fact that "Cole Porter's genetic background was
completely alien to any Jewishness." [1]
Louis Armstrong
Louis [1]
Armstrong [2]
( 4 August
1901 [3]
–
July 6 ,
1971 ), nicknamed
Satchmo [4]
and
Pops , was an
American
jazz
trumpeter
and
singer .
Coming to prominence in the 20s
as an innovative
cornet
and
trumpet
virtuoso ,
Armstrong was a foundational influence on
jazz , shifting the
music's focus from collective improvisation to solo performers. With his
distinctive gravelly voice, Armstrong was an influential singer, demonstrating
great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for
expressive purposes. He was also greatly skilled at
scat
singing , or wordless vocalizing.
Renowned for his charismatic
stage presence, Armstrong's influence extended well beyond jazz, and by the end
of his career in the '60s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on
popular
music
in general: critic Steve Leggett describes Armstrong as "perhaps
the most important American musician of the 20th century." [
" Potato Head Blues "
is one of
Louis Armstrong 's finest recordings. It was made by
Louis Armstrong and his Hot Seven
for
Okeh
Records
in Chicago, Illinois on May, 10th in
1927 . It was recorded
during a remarkably productive week in which Armstrong's usual
Hot Five
was
temporarily expanded to seven players by the addition of tuba and drums; over
five sessions the group recorded twelve sides.
Not strictly speaking a " blues ," the
chord structure is a 32-bar form in the same neighborhood as " (Back Home Again in) Indiana ." The
recording features notable clarinet work by
Johnny
Dodds , and the stop-time solo chorus in the last half of the recording is
one of Armstrong's most famous solos. The last, hot " ride out "
chorus is an example of this
New
Orleans jazz
custom brought to the level of genius through Armstong's
inspired melodic playing.
Tallulah
Bankhead
said that she played it in her dressing room every day during
intermission while she appeared on
Broadway
for the invigorating effect it gave her.
In
Woody Allen 's
1979
film,
Manhattan , the Allen character lists
Armstrong's recording of "Potato Head Blues" as one of the reasons
that life is worth living.
Glenn Miller
Alton Glenn Miller
( March 1 ,
1904 – presumably
December
15 ,
1944 ), was
an
American
jazz
musician and
band leader
in the
swing
era. He was one of the best-selling recording
artists from
1939
to
1942 ,
leading one of the best known " Big Bands ".
Miller's signature recordings include, " In the Mood ",
" Tuxedo Junction ", " Chattanooga Choo Choo ", " Moonlight Serenade ", " Little Brown Jug ", and " Pennsylvania 6-5000 " [1] . While
travelling to entertain U.S.
troops in
France
during
World
War II , Miller's plane
disappeared
in bad weather. His body was never
found.
JERRY GRAY
"A String of Pearls"
Arranger - composer - violinist Jerry Gray had a
flair for writing catchy, imaginative charts, and with them he certainly
contributed a lot to the big band era.  In the years which followed, the
music he did under his own name may not have had quite as high a profile, but
nevertheless included some fine works.  As well as A String of Pearls he
wrote Glenn Miller’s catchy hit Pennsylvania
6500.
Dinah Washington
Dinah Washington
( August 29 ,
1924
–
December 14 ,
1963 ) was a
blues ,
R&B
and
jazz
singer. Because of
her strong voice and emotional singing, she is known as the
Queen of the
Blues . [1]
Despite dying at the early age of 39, Washington became
one of the most influential vocalists of the twentieth century, [2]
[3]
credited among others as a major influence on
Aretha
Franklin .
[4]
[5]
She is a 1986 inductee of the
Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame .
Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby
is a
1944
Louis
Jordan
song, released on a single with "G.I. Jive" which reached
#1 on both the
Billboard
pop and
R&B
charts.
It was co-written by Jordan and
Billy Austin. Austin (March 6, 1896 - July 24,
1964) [1]
was a songwriter and author, born in
Denver,
Colorado . The phrase "Is you is or is you ain't" is dialect,
apparently first recorded in a 1921 story by
Octavus
Roy Cohen , a Jewish writer from South
Carolina who wrote humorous black dialect fiction [2] .
In
1946
the song was sung
by Tom in the
Tom and Jerry
cartoon
" Solid
Serenade ", and featured in the first season finale of the
British sitcom
Spaced .
The tune has become something of
a
jazz
standard
with versions recorded by artists including
The Andrews Sisters ,
Bing Crosby ,
Nat "King" Cole ,
Buster Brown ,
Renee
Olstead ,
Dinah Washington ,
Joe Williams ,
B.B. King
and

Eydie Gormé
Eydie Gorme , Alternative spelling
Eydie Gormé [1]
(born
Edith Gormezano ;
August 16 ,
1931 ) is an
American
singer
credited
heavily, along with husband
Steve
Lawrence , with helping to keep the classic
Traditional pop music
repertoire alive and
well. She still continues to entertain and tour with husband Steve.
Throughout her long career she
has been the recipient of numerous awards including the
Grammy
Award, and
an
Emmy
Award . The couple's striking union of broad
ballads
and
breezy
swing
has combined with the endurance of their
marriage and their comic facility to make them American institutions---even
though neither of the couple, as separate performers or together, has put a
single into the American Top 40 since 1963.
