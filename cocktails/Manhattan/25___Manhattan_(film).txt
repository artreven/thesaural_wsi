Butterfly Theatre, 1911-1930

The Butterfly, glowing during one of its first nights in operation.
Despite just nineteen years of operation, the downtown Butterfly Theatre remains today one of the city’s most famous movie houses. The stunning beauty of the theatre brought it national attention when it opened in 1911. Two years prior, the Milwaukee movie business had been put on its ear by the success of Saxe’s Princess, located just around the corner from the Butterfly on Third Street. The elegant, 900-seat Princess, with an ornate 45-foot façade featuring a decorative archway lit by 1,500 bulbs, had made the storefront theatres all but obsolete. By 1911, Otto Meister, owner of the Third Street’s Vaudette Theatre, would go the Saxes one better. The Butterfly opened in June of that year, using the Princess’ model for a tall façade and archway, with a twin-leveled auditorium festooned in velvet and gold. The trademark of the theatre, indeed its namesake, was the twenty-seven foot wide butterfly adorning the building’s apex. The terra-cotta figure was a woman in Grecian dress, with outstretched butterfly wings, trimmed with 1,000 lights. In an era when outdoor electricity was still relatively new, the Butterfly’s façade must have seemed like an artificial sun. Unfortunately, the sun would not shine for long.
The Butterfly would set the standard for elegance in Milwaukee movie houses during the city’s busiest period of theatre building. Meister’s palace featured marble and silver in the lobby, live canaries in golden cages singing the patrons to their seats, and ten-piece orchestra accompanied by a six voice operatic choir. The Alhambra, the Palace, the Wisconsin, the Strand, and the Avalon would all open in the shadow of the Butterfly. But Meister never lost touch with the city’s masses, boasting that his theatre offered “a dollar show for a dime.” With the Princess, the Butterfly, and the host of imitators that would follow, the day of the storefront picture house was over. The new breed would be referred to as “photoplay houses,” reflecting not just the quality of the theatre, but of the product itself. Movie production had evolved along with exhibition and by the 1910s, films were telling more complicated stories and developing into a legitimate art form.
In 1915. The butterfly-woman adornment was ordered ready-made from a specialty exteriors company in Chicago.
In 1916, Meister and his partner had planned another ground-breaking theatre, starting work on the White House. However, cost overruns set both men short of cash and the Butterfly was sold. With the twenties roaring and the movie boom in full swing, the Butterfly was a constant money-maker throughout its life. By the close of decade, however, the Warner Brothers film studio was looking to build a centerpiece theatre in Milwaukee as part of a large-scale office building. The Butterfly, extending just 50 feet into the air, left too much valuable vertical real estate unused and in 1930 the theatre was razed to make way for the 2,400 seat Warner Theatre. Strangely, the Butterfly fell victim not to too little business, but to too much. The new theatre would nearly double the site’s seating capacity and the Warner would prosper there for decades. Although it never would shine quite like the Butterfly.
The theatre's last days in January 1930. The marquee is advertising an everything-must-go auction. The butterfly and building the left would be torn down to make room for the Warner.

Then Playing: June 25th 1979

Welcome to the first installment of THEN PLAYING! Each Friday, the Graveyard will flashback to a random year, to visit the films that you could have seen in Milwaukee on that particular date. Today, we ramp up to 88 miles per hour and set the time circuits for Monday June 25th, 1979!
The big hit of the year is Ridley Scott’s
Alien , showing at the Centre (Warner), along with
Escape from Alcatraz , which has just opened the previous weekend. If you are in the mood for something a bit less “mainstream,” you can head down to third street and check out the Princess’s double feature of
Helena
and
Teenage Massage Parlor . Keep an eye towards the door, however, as the Princess has been the subject of police raids as of late. They say you can’t legislate bad taste, but just try telling that to the vice squad.
With Aliens showing downtown, you have no less than EIGHT Academy Award nominees to choose from. 1978’s Best Picture winner
The Deer Hunter
is playing at the awful little Prospect Mall Cinema on the east side. 1968 Best Picture
Oliver!
is on a revival double-bill with
South Pacific  at the Oriental.
The China Syndrome , released just two weeks before the
Three Mile Island disaster , is still packing them in, showing at the Times and the southside Modjeska.
Manhattan
is showing at the Downer,
Jaws
and
Heaven can Wait  are mall-bound at the northside Capital Court Cinemas.
Although not a nominee,
Up in Smoke
is also showing at the Times, undoubtedly making for some high times in the parking lot before the show. If you’ve still got your buzz afterwards, why head to Bayview and stop at the Avalon for a late-night showing of
101 Dalmatians ? That should be enough to give you nightmares.
So what would you go see? Put down that one-hitter and COMMENT!

The former
Astor Theatre
is in the process of being renovated to make the new home of Glorioso Bros. Italian grocery store. Tom Daykin, at his JSOnline blog has the
details . From 1915-1952, the Astor was a neighborhood movie house. Since running its last picture, the building has been home to a local educational film distributor, and most recently, the Brady Street Pharmacy and Cafe. Glorioso’s hopes to be in operation there by the end of the year.

Welcome to the Graveyard

Hello and welcome to the Milwaukee Cinema Graveyard. This is intented to be a companion to a
site
I created earlier this year, highlighting the classic movie theatres of Milwaukee’s past. The site was created as part of my coursework as I pursue a Master’s of History degree from the University of Milwaukee-Wisconsin.
In pairing this blog with the site, I hope to be able to create a more fluid and ongoing discussion of the Movies in Milwaukee. My own primative web-publishing skills have limited the scope of the original site (I made it in Microsoft Publisher… yeech), but I hope that this forum can bring new developements as well as uncovered tidbits and stories to anyone interested in the way the movies used to be.
First off, what do we cover here at the Graveyard? Well, I am going to focus on threatres build during the single-screen era, roughly through the 1950s. Milwaukee had some 130+ theatres in operation that would fall into this catergory, with the majority opening between 1910 and 1930.
What kind of posts can be expected? On the original site, I wrote ‘biographies’ of twenty-two of the most prominent Milwaukee theatres, which I will be re-posting here (go ahead and spoil them all if you like). I also highlighted the forty-some theatre building that are still standing in the city, which I will also re-post here. New material will be posted as I stumble upon it.
Anyway, that’s why we’re here. Enjoy.
