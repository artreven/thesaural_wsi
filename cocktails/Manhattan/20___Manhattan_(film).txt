Most Costiest Houses in the World
Here’s the list of top 2 most expensive houses around the world, You should be super duper rich to own one of them
. Maybe for now, just enjoy how beautiful is them:
5. Three Ponds : $75,000,000
In Bridgehampton, New York, there sits a $75,000,000 estate that has its
own golf course! Called “Three Ponds” due to the fact that it has, er,
three ponds (each stocks with an ample supply of fish, which are
hopefully included in the home insurance), and the expansive grounds
also house 14 different gardens, each with their own theme!
3 Ponds
4. Donald Trump Palace : $125,000,000
Donald Trump owns this 18-bedroom waterfront palace, which is listed as
costing $125,000,000. Situated in Florida, Trump says it’s location in
Palm Beach is “the richest community in the world” and it doesn’t seem
like he’s joking! We also doubt that he’s one to settle for cheap
building insurance, either.

Alien Film
Alien
is a 1979
science fiction
horror film
directed by
Ridley Scott
and starring
Tom Skerritt ,
Sigourney Weaver ,
Veronica Cartwright ,
Harry Dean Stanton ,
John Hurt ,
Ian Holm
and
Yaphet Kotto . The film's title refers to its primary
antagonist : a highly aggressive extraterrestrial creature that stalks and kills the crew of a
spaceship .
Dan O'Bannon
wrote the
screenplay
from a story by him and
Ronald Shusett , drawing influence from previous works of science fiction and horror. The film was produced through
Brandywine Productions
and distributed by
20th Century Fox , with producers
David Giler
and
Walter Hill
making significant revisions and additions to the script. The titular
Alien
and its accompanying elements were designed by Swiss
surrealist
artist
H. R. Giger , while
concept artists
Ron Cobb
and
Chris Foss
designed the human aspects of the film.
Alien
garnered both critical acclaim and
box office
success, receiving an
Academy Award for Best Visual Effects , [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
Saturn Awards
for
Best Science Fiction Film ,
Best Direction
for Scott, and
Best Supporting Actress
for Cartwright, [ 6 ]
and a
Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , along with numerous other award nominations. [ 7 ]
It has remained highly praised in subsequent decades, being inducted into the
National Film Registry
of the
Library of Congress
in 2002 for historical preservation as a film which is "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
In 2008 it was ranked as the seventh-best film in the science fiction genre by the
American Film Institute , and as the thirty-third greatest movie of all time by
Empire
magazine. [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
The success of
Alien
spawned a
media franchise
of novels, comic books, video games, and toys, as well as three
sequel
and two
prequel
films. It also launched Weaver's acting career by providing her with her first lead role, and the story of her character
Ripley 's encounters with the Alien creatures became the thematic thread that ran through the sequels
Aliens
(1986),
Alien 3
(1992), and
Alien Resurrection
(1997). [ 12 ]
The subsequent prequels
Alien vs. Predator
(2004) and
Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem
(2007) abandoned this theme in favor of a
crossover
with the
Predator
franchise .

Plot The commercial towing spaceship
Nostromo
is on a return trip from Thedus to Earth, hauling a refinery and twenty million tons of mineral
ore , and carrying its seven-member crew in
stasis . Upon receiving a transmission of unknown origin from a nearby
planetoid , the ship's computer awakens the crew. [ 13 ]
Acting on standing orders from their corporate employers, the crew detaches the
Nostromo
from the refinery and lands on the planetoid, resulting in some damage to the ship. Captain Dallas ( Tom Skerritt ), Executive Officer Kane ( John Hurt ), and Navigator Lambert ( Veronica Cartwright ) set out to investigate the signal's source while
Warrant Officer
Ripley
( Sigourney Weaver ), Science Officer Ash ( Ian Holm ), and Engineers Brett ( Harry Dean Stanton ) and Parker ( Yaphet Kotto ) stay behind to monitor their progress and make repairs.
Dallas, Kane, and Lambert discover that the signal is coming from a
derelict alien spacecraft. Inside it they find the remains of a large
alien creature whose ribs appear to have been exploded outward from the
inside. Meanwhile, the
Nostromo 's computer partially deciphers
the signal transmission, which Ripley determines to be some type of
warning. Kane discovers a vast chamber containing numerous eggs, one of
which releases a creature that attaches itself to his face. Dallas and
Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the
Nostromo , where Ash allows them inside against Ripley's orders to follow the ship's
quarantine
protocol. They unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from
Kane's face, discovering that its blood is an extremely corrosive
acid .
Eventually the creature detaches on its own and is found dead. With the
ship repaired, the crew resume their trip back to Earth.
Kane awakens seemingly unharmed, but during a meal before re-entering
stasis he begins to choke and convulse until an alien creature bursts
from his chest, killing him and escaping into the ship. Lacking
conventional weapons, the crew attempt to locate and capture the
creature by fashioning motion trackers,
electric prods , and
flamethrowers . Brett follows the crew's cat into a large room where the now-fully-grown
Alien
attacks him and disappears with his body into the ship's air shafts.
Dallas enters the shafts intending to force the Alien into an
airlock
where it can be expelled into space, but it ambushes him. Lambert
implores the remaining crew members to escape in the ship's shuttle, but
Ripley, now in command, explains that the shuttle will not support four
people.
Accessing the ship's computer, Ripley discovers that Ash has been ordered to return the Alien to the
Nostromo 's
corporate employers even at the expense of the crew's lives. Ash
attacks her, but Parker intervenes and decapitates him with a blow from a
fire extinguisher, revealing Ash to be an
android .
Before Parker incinerates him, Ash predicts that the other crew members
will not survive. The remaining three crew members plan to arm the
Nostromo 's
self-destruct mechanism and escape in the shuttle, but Parker and
Lambert are killed by the Alien while gathering the necessary supplies.
Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence and heads for the shuttle
with the cat, but finds the Alien blocking her way. She unsuccessfully
attempts to abort the self-destruct, then returns to find the Alien gone
and narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the
Nostromo
explodes.
As she prepares to enter stasis, Ripley discovers that the Alien is
aboard the shuttle. She puts on a space suit and opens the hatch,
causing
explosive decompression
which forces the Alien to the open doorway. She shoots it with a
grappling gun
which propels it out, but the gun is yanked from her hands and catches
in the closing door, tethering the Alien to the shuttle. It attempts to
crawl into one of the engines, but Ripley activates them and blasts the
Alien into space. She then puts herself and the cat into stasis for the
return trip to Earth.
Origins
Dan O'Bannon wrote the screenplay for
Alien . While studying cinema at the
University of Southern California ,
Dan O'Bannon
had made a science fiction comedy film with director
John Carpenter
and
concept artist
Ron Cobb
entitled
Dark Star . [ 14 ]
The film included an alien which had been created using a spray-painted
beach ball , and the experience left O'Bannon "really wanting to do an alien that looked
real ." [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
A few years later he began working on a similar story that would focus
more on horror: "I knew I wanted to do a scary movie on a spaceship with
a small number of astronauts", he later recalled, " Dark Star
as a horror movie instead of a comedy." [ 14 ]
Ronald Shusett , meanwhile, was working on an early version of what would eventually become
Total Recall . [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
Impressed by
Dark Star ,
he contacted O'Bannon and the two agreed to collaborate on their
projects, choosing to work on O'Bannon's film first as they believed it
would be less costly to produce. [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
O'Bannon had written twenty-nine pages of a script entitled
Memory
comprising what would become the film's opening scenes: a crew of
astronauts awaken to find that their voyage has been interrupted because
they are receiving a signal from a mysterious planetoid. They
investigate and their ship breaks down on the surface. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]
He did not yet, however, have a clear idea as to what the alien antagonist of the story would be. [ 14 ]
O'Bannon soon accepted an offer to work on a film adaptation of
Dune , a project which took him to
Paris
for six months. [ 14 ] [ 17 ]
Though the project ultimately fell through, it introduced him to
several artists whose works gave him ideas for his science fiction story
including
Chris Foss ,
H. R. Giger , and
Jean "Moebius" Giraud . [ 16 ]
O'Bannon was impressed by Foss' covers for science fiction books, while he found Giger's work "disturbing": [ 14 ]
"His paintings had a profound effect on me. I had never seen anything
that was quite as horrible and at the same time as beautiful as his
work. And so I ended up writing a script about a Giger monster." [ 16 ]
After the
Dune
project collapsed O'Bannon returned to
Los Angeles
to live with Shusett and the two revived his
Memory
script. Shusett suggested that O'Bannon use one of his other film ideas, about
gremlins
infiltrating a
B-17 bomber
during
World War II , and set it on the spaceship as the second half of the story. [ 16 ] [ 17 ]
The
working title
of the project was now
Star Beast , but O'Bannon disliked this and changed it to
Alien
after noting the number of times that the word appeared in the script.
He and Shusett liked the new title's simplicity and its double meaning
as both a
noun
and
adjective . [ 14 ] [ 16 ] [ 18 ]
Shusett came up with the idea that one of the crew members could be
implanted with an alien embryo that would later burst out of him,
feeling that this was an interesting
plot device
by which the alien creature could get aboard the ship. [ 14 ] [ 17 ]
In writing the script, O'Bannon drew inspiration from many previous
works of science fiction and horror. He later stated that "I didn't
steal
Alien
from anybody. I stole it from
everybody !" [ 19 ]
The Thing from Another World
(1951) inspired the idea of professional men being pursued by a deadly alien creature through a claustrophobic environment. [ 19 ]
Forbidden Planet
(1956) gave O'Bannon the idea of a ship being warned not to land, and
then the crew being killed one by one by a mysterious creature when they
defy the warning. [ 19 ]
Planet of the Vampires
(1965) contains a scene in which the heroes discover a giant alien
skeleton ; this influenced the
Nostromo
crew's discovery of the alien creature in the derelict spacecraft. [ 19 ]
O'Bannon has also noted the influence of "Junkyard" (1953), a short story by
Clifford D. Simak
in which a crew lands on an asteroid and discovers a chamber full of eggs. [ 15 ]
He has also cited as influences
Strange Relations
by
Philip José Farmer
(1960), which covers alien reproduction, and various
EC Comics
horror titles carrying stories in which monsters eat their way out of people. [ 15 ]
With roughly eighty-five percent of the plot completed, Shusett and O'Bannon presented their initial script to several studios, [ 14 ]
pitching it as " Jaws
in space." [ 20 ]
They were on the verge of signing a deal with
Roger Corman 's studio when a friend offered to find them a better deal and passed the script on to
Walter Hill ,
David Giler , and Gordon Carroll, who had formed a production company called Brandywine with ties to
20th Century Fox . [ 14 ] [ 21 ]
O'Bannon and Shusett signed a deal with Brandywine, but Hill and Giler
were not satisfied with the script and made numerous rewrites and
revisions to it. [ 14 ] [ 22 ]
This caused tension with O'Bannon and Shusett, since Hill and Giler had
very little experience with science fiction and according to Shusett:
"They weren't good at making it better, or in fact at not making it even
worse." [ 14 ]
O'Bannon believed that they were attempting to justify taking his name off of the script and claiming it as their own. [ 14 ]
Hill and Giler did add some substantial elements to the story, however, including the
android
character Ash which O'Bannon felt was an unnecessary subplot, [ 23 ]
but which Shusett later described as "one of the best things in the movie...That whole idea and scenario was theirs." [ 14 ]
In total Hill and Giler went through eight different drafts of the
script, mostly concentrating on the Ash subplot but also making the
dialogue more natural and trimming some sequences set on the alien
planetoid. [ 24 ]
Despite the multiple rewrites, 20th Century Fox did not express
confidence in financing a science fiction film. However, after the
success of
Star Wars
in 1977 the studio's interest in the genre rose substantially. According to Carroll: "When
Star Wars
came out and was the extraordinary hit that it was, suddenly science
fiction became the hot genre." O'Bannon recalled that "They wanted to
follow through on
Star Wars , and they wanted to follow through fast, and the only spaceship script they had sitting on their desk was
Alien ". [ 14 ]
Alien
was
greenlit
by 20th Century Fox at an initial budget of $4.2 million. [ 14 ] [ 24 ]
Direction and design
H. R. Giger
designed and worked on the Alien and its accompanying elements. O'Bannon had originally assumed that he would direct
Alien , but 20th Century Fox instead asked Hill to direct. [ 24 ] [ 25 ]
Hill declined due to other film commitments as well as not being
comfortable with the level of visual effects that would be required. [ 26 ]
Peter Yates ,
Jack Clayton , and
Robert Aldrich
were considered for the task, but O'Bannon, Shusett, and the Brandywine
team felt that these directors would not take the film seriously and
would instead treat it as a
B monster movie . [ 25 ] [ 27 ]
Giler, Hill, and Carroll had been impressed by
Ridley Scott 's debut feature film
The Duellists
(1977) and made an offer to him to direct
Alien , which Scott quickly accepted. [ 16 ] [ 27 ]
Scott created detailed
storyboards
for the film in
London , which impressed 20th Century Fox enough to double the film's budget from $4.2 million to $8.4 million. [ 25 ] [ 28 ]
His storyboards included designs for the spaceship and
space suits , drawing influences from films such as
2001: A Space Odyssey
and
Star Wars . [ 28 ]
However, he was keen on emphasizing horror in
Alien
rather than fantasy, describing the film as " The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
of science fiction". [ 25 ] [ 27 ]
O'Bannon introduced Scott to the artwork of H. R. Giger; both of them felt that his painting
Necronom IV
was the type of representation they wanted for the film's antagonist and began asking the studio to hire him as a designer. [ 25 ] [ 27 ]
20th Century Fox initially believed Giger's work was too ghastly for
audiences, but the Brandywine team were persistent and eventually won
out. [ 27 ]
According to Gordon Carroll: "The first second that Ridley saw Giger's
work, he knew that the biggest single design problem, maybe the biggest
problem in the film, had been solved." [ 25 ]
Scott flew to
Zürich
to meet Giger and recruited him to work on all aspects of the Alien and
its environment including the surface of the planetoid, the derelict
spacecraft, and all four forms of the Alien from the egg to the adult. [ 25 ] [ 27 ]
I resent films that are so shallow they rely entirely on their visual
effects, and of course science fiction films are notorious for this.
I've always felt that there's another way to do it: a lot of effort
should be expended toward rendering the environment of the spaceship, or
space travel, whatever the fantastic setting of your story should be–as
convincingly as possible, but always in the background. That way the
story and the characters emerge and
they
become more real. [ 16 ]
–Ron Cobb on his designs for
Alien . O'Bannon brought in artists
Ron Cobb
and Chris Foss (with whom he had worked on
Dark Star
and
Dune , respectively) to work on designs for the human aspects of the film such as the spaceship and space suits. [ 25 ] [ 29 ]
Cobb created hundreds of preliminary sketches of the interiors and
exteriors of the ship, which went through many design concepts and
possible names such as
Leviathan
and
Snark
as the script continued to develop. The final name of the ship was derived from the title of
Joseph Conrad 's 1904 novel
Nostromo , while the escape shuttle, called
Narcissus
in the script, was named after Conrad's 1897
novella
The Nigger of the 'Narcissus' . [ 30 ]
The production team particularly praised Cobb's ability to depict the
interior settings of the ship in a realistic and believable manner.
Under Ridley Scott's direction the design of the
Nostromo
shifted towards an 800-foot (240 m)-long tug towing a refining platform 2 miles (3.2 km) long and 1.5 miles (2.4 km) wide. [ 16 ]
Cobb also created some conceptual drawings of the Alien, but these were not used. [ 25 ] [ 29 ]
Moebius was attached to the project for a few days as well, and his
costume renderings served as the basis for the final space suits created
by costume designer John Mollo. [ 16 ] [ 29 ]
Casting For more details on individual characters, see
List of characters in the Alien series . Casting calls
and
auditions
for
Alien
were held in both
New York
and London. [ 28 ]
With only seven human characters in the story, Scott sought to hire
strong actors so he could focus most of his energy on the film's visual
style. [ 28 ]
He employed casting director
Mary Selway , who had worked with him on
The Duellists , to head the casting in the United Kingdom, while Mary Goldberg handled casting in the United States. [ 31 ] [ 32 ]
In developing the story O'Bannon had focused on writing the Alien
first, putting off developing the characters for a later draft. [ 25 ]
He and Shusett had therefore written all of the roles as generic males
with a note in the script explicitly stating "The crew is unisex and all
parts are interchangeable for men or women." [ 31 ] [ 33 ]
This left Scott, Selway, and Goldberg free to interpret the characters as they liked and to cast accordingly. They wanted the
Nostromo ' s crew to resemble working astronauts in a realistic environment, a concept summed up as "truckers in space". [ 28 ] [ 31 ]
According to Scott, this concept was inspired partly by
Star Wars , which deviated from the pristine future often depicted in science fiction films of the time. [ 34 ]
The principal cast members of
Alien . Left to right: Holm, Stanton, Weaver, Kotto, Skerritt, Cartwright, and Hurt. The principal cast members of
Alien
were:
Bolaji Badejo as
The Alien . A
Nigerian
design student, Badejo was discovered in a bar by a member of the casting team, who put him in touch with Ridley Scott. [ 35 ] [ 36 ]
Scott believed that Badejo, at 7 feet 2 inches (218 cm) and with a
slender frame, could portray the Alien and look as if his arms and legs
were too long to be real, creating the illusion that there could not
possibly be a human being inside the costume. [ 16 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ]
Stuntmen
Eddie Powell
and Roy Scammell also portrayed the Alien in some scenes. [ 16 ] [ 37 ]
Veronica Cartwright
as Lambert, the
Nostromo ' s navigator. Cartwright had previous experience in horror and science fiction films, having acted in
The Birds
(1963) and
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
(1978). [ 38 ]
She originally read for the role of Ripley, and was not informed that
she had instead been cast as Lambert until she arrived in London for
wardrobe. [ 31 ] [ 39 ]
She disliked the character's emotional weakness, [ 36 ]
but nevertheless accepted the role: "They convinced me that I was the
audience's fears; I was a reflection of what the audience is feeling." [ 31 ]
Cartwright won a
Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress
for her performance. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
Ian Holm
as
Ash , the ship's Science Officer who is revealed to be an
android
under orders to bring the Alien back to the
Nostromo ' s
corporate employers. Holm, a character actor who by 1979 had already
been in twenty films, was the most experienced actor cast for
Alien . [ 23 ]
John Hurt
as Kane, the
Executive Officer
who becomes the host for the Alien. Hurt was Scott's first choice for
the role but was contracted on a film in South Africa during
Alien ' s filming dates, so
Jon Finch
was cast as Kane instead. [ 36 ]
However, Finch became ill during the first day of shooting and was diagnosed with severe
diabetes , which had also exacerbated a case of
bronchitis . [ 40 ]
Hurt was in London by this time, his South African project having fallen through, and he quickly replaced Finch. [ 31 ] [ 40 ]
His performance earned him a nomination for a
BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role . [ 7 ]
Yaphet Kotto
as Parker, the Chief Engineer. Kotto, an
African American , was chosen partly to add diversity to the cast and give the
Nostromo
crew an international flavor. [ 31 ]
Kotto was sent a script off the back of his recent success with James Bond
Live and Let Die , although it was some time and deliberation between Kotto and his agent before he was offered the part. [ 41 ]
Tom Skerritt
as Dallas, the Captain of the
Nostromo .
Skerritt had been approached early in the film's development but
declined as it did not yet have a director and had a very low budget.
Later, when Scott was attached as director and the budget had been
doubled, Skerritt accepted the role of Dallas. [ 28 ] [ 31 ]
Harry Dean Stanton
as Brett, the Engineering Technician. Stanton's first words to Scott
during his audition were "I don't like sci fi or monster movies." [ 28 ]
Scott was amused and convinced Stanton to take the role after reassuring him that
Alien
would actually be a
thriller
more akin to
Ten Little Indians . [ 28 ]
Sigourney Weaver
as
Ripley , the
Warrant Officer
aboard the
Nostromo . The decision to make the lead character a woman was made by Giler and Hill, who felt this would help
Alien
stand out in the otherwise male-dominated genre of science fiction. [ 31 ]
Weaver, who had Broadway experience but was relatively unknown in film,
impressed Scott, Giler, and Hill with her audition. She was the last
actor to be cast for the film, and performed most of her
screen tests
in-studio as the sets were being built. [ 31 ] [ 36 ]
The role of Ripley was Weaver's first leading role in a motion picture, and earned her nominations for a
Saturn Award for Best Actress
and a
BAFTA
award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Role. [ 7 ]
To assist the actors in preparing for their roles, Ridley Scott wrote
several pages of backstory for each character explaining their
histories. [ 24 ] [ 42 ]
He filmed many of their rehearsals in order to capture spontaneity and
improvisation, and tensions between some of the cast members,
particularly towards the less-experienced Weaver, translated
convincingly on film as tension between their respective characters. [ 42 ]
Film critic
Roger Ebert
notes that the actors in
Alien
were older than was typical in thriller films at the time, which helped make the characters more convincing:
[N]one of them were particularly young. Tom Skerritt, the captain,
was 46, Hurt was 39 but looked older, Holm was 48, Harry Dean Stanton
was 53, Yaphet Kotto was 42, and only Veronica Cartwright at 29 and
Weaver at 30 were in the age range of the usual thriller cast. Many
recent action pictures have improbably young actors cast as key roles or
sidekicks, but by skewing older,
Alien
achieves a certain
texture without even making a point of it: These are not adventurers but
workers, hired by a company to return 20 million tons of ore to Earth. [ 12 ]
David McIntee , author of
Beautiful Monsters: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to the Alien and Predator Films ,
notes that part of the film's effectiveness in frightening viewers
"comes from the fact that the audience can all identify with the
characters...Everyone aboard the
Nostromo
is a normal, everyday, working Joe just like the rest of us. They just happen to live and work in the future." [ 43 ]
Set design and filming Alien
was filmed over fourteen weeks from July 5 to October 21, 1978. Principal photography took place at
Shepperton Studios
in London, while model and miniature filming was done at
Bray Studios
in
Water Oakley . [ 32 ]
Production time was short due to the film's low budget and pressure from 20th Century Fox to finish on schedule. [ 42 ]
A crew of over 200 workmen and technicians constructed the three
principal sets: The surface of the alien planetoid and the interiors of
the
Nostromo
and derelict spacecraft. [ 16 ]
Art Director Les Dilley created 1/24th scale miniatures of the
planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs,
then made
moulds
and
casts
and scaled them up as diagrams for the wood and
fiberglass
forms of the sets. [ 28 ]
Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped into
the studio to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface,
which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes. [ 16 ]
The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with
nylon , had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled
carbon dioxide
to escape. [ 44 ]
Combined with a
heat wave ,
these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out and nurses had to
be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks to help keep them going. [ 42 ] [ 44 ]
For scenes showing the exterior of the
Nostromo
a 58-foot (18 m) landing leg was constructed to give a sense of the
ship's size. Ridley Scott still did not think that it looked large
enough, so he had his two sons and the son of one of the cameramen stand
in for the regular actors, wearing smaller space suits to make the set
pieces seem larger. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]
The same technique was used for the scene in which the crew members
encounter the dead alien creature in the derelict spacecraft. The
children nearly collapsed due to the heat of the suits, and eventually
oxygen systems were added to assist the actors in breathing. [ 42 ] [ 44 ]
The sets of the
Nostromo 's three decks were each created
almost entirely in one piece, with each deck occupying a separate stage
and the various rooms connected via corridors. To move around the sets
the actors had to navigate through the hallways of the ship, adding to
the film's sense of
claustrophobia
and realism. [ 16 ] [ 42 ] [ 46 ]
The sets used large
transistors
and low-resolution computer screens to give the ship a "used",
industrial look and make it appear as though it was constructed of
"retrofitted old technology". [ 45 ]
Ron Cobb created industrial-style symbols and color-coded signs for various areas and aspects of the ship. [ 45 ]
The company that owns the
Nostromo
is not named in the film, and is referred to by the characters as "the
company". However, the name and logo of "Weylan-Yutani" appears on
several set pieces and props such as computer monitors and beer cans. [ 30 ]
Cobb created the name to imply a business alliance between
Britain
and
Japan , deriving "Weylan" from the
British Leyland Motor Corporation
and "Yutani" from the name of his Japanese neighbor. [ 29 ] [ 47 ]
The 1986 sequel
Aliens
named the company as "Weyland-Yutani", [ 29 ] [ 48 ]
and it has remained a central aspect of the film franchise.
Art Director
Roger Christian
used scrap metal and parts to create set pieces and props to save money, a technique he employed while working on
Star Wars . [ 45 ] [ 49 ]
Some of the
Nostromo' s
corridors were created from portions of scrapped bomber aircraft, and a
mirror was used to create the illusion of longer corridors in the
below-deck area. [ 45 ]
Special effects supervisors Brian Johnson and Nick Allder made many of
the set pieces and props function, including moving chairs, computer
monitors, motion trackers, and flamethrowers. [ 16 ] [ 40 ]
Four identical cats were used to portray Jones, the
Nostromo
crew's pet. [ 32 ]
During filming Sigourney Weaver discovered that she was
allergic
to the combination of cat hair and the
glycerin
placed on the actors' skin to make them appear sweaty. By removing the glycerin she was able to continue working with the cats. [ 40 ] [ 42 ]
Giger airbrushed the "space jockey" set by hand. Children stood in for the regular actors to make the set seem larger on screen. [ 45 ] [ 50 ]
It was redressed to double as the egg chamber. [ 16 ] H. R. Giger designed and worked on all of the alien aspects of the film, which he designed to appear organic and
biomechanical
in contrast to the industrial look of the
Nostromo
and its human elements. [ 16 ] [ 45 ]
For the interior of the derelict spacecraft and egg chamber he used dried bones together with
plaster
to sculpt much of the scenery and elements. [ 16 ] [ 45 ]
Veronica Cartwright described Giger's sets as "so erotic...it's big
vaginas
and
penises ...the whole thing is like you're going inside of some sort of
womb
or whatever...it's sort of visceral". [ 45 ]
The set with the deceased alien creature, which the production team
nicknamed the "space jockey", proved problematic as 20th Century Fox did
not want to spend the money for such an expensive set that would only
be used for one scene. Ridley Scott described the set as the
cockpit
or driving deck of the mysterious ship, and the production team was
able to convince the studio that the scene was important to impress the
audience and make them aware that this was not a
B movie . [ 45 ] [ 50 ]
To save money only one wall of the set was created, and the "space
jockey" sat atop a disc that could be rotated to facilitate shots from
different angles in relation to the actors. [ 16 ] [ 50 ]
Giger
airbrushed
the entire set and the "space jockey" by hand. [ 45 ] [ 50 ]
The origin of the jockey creature was not explored in the film, but
Scott later theorized that it might have been the ship's pilot, and that
the ship might have been a weapons carrier capable of dropping Alien
eggs onto a planet so that the Aliens could use the local lifeforms as
hosts. [ 23 ]
In early versions of the script the eggs were to be located in a separate
pyramid
structure which would be found later by the
Nostromo
crew and would contain statues and
hieroglyphs
depicting the Alien reproductive cycle, offering a contrast of the human, Alien, and space jockey cultures. [ 17 ]
Cobb, Foss, and Giger each created concept artwork for these sequences,
but they were eventually discarded due to budgetary concerns and the
need to trim the length of the film. [ 16 ]
Instead the egg chamber was set inside the derelict ship and was filmed
on the same set as the space jockey scene; the entire disc piece
supporting the jockey and its chair were removed and the set was
redressed to create the egg chamber. [ 16 ]
Light effects in the egg chamber were created by lasers borrowed from English rock band
The Who . The band was testing the lasers for use in their stage show in the sound stage next door. [ 51 ]
Alien
originally was to conclude with the destruction of the
Nostromo
while Ripley escapes in the shuttle
Narcissus .
However, Ridley Scott conceived of a "fourth act" to the film in which
the Alien appears on the shuttle and Ripley is forced to confront it. He
pitched the idea to 20th Century Fox and negotiated an increase in the
budget to film the scene over several extra days. [ 23 ] [ 52 ]
Scott had wanted the Alien to bite off Ripley's head and then make the
final log entry in her voice, but the producers vetoed this idea as they
believed that the Alien had to die at the end of the film. [ 52 ]
Special effects and creature design
Spaceships and planets
Ridley Scott filming model shots of the
Nostromo
and its attached ore refinery. He made slow passes filming at 2½ frames per second to give the models the appearance of motion. [ 16 ] The spaceships and planets for the film were shot using models and miniatures. These included models of the
Nostromo , its attached mineral refinery, the escape shuttle
Narcissus ,
the alien planetoid, and the exterior and interior of the derelict
spacecraft. Visual Effects Supervisor Brian Johnson, supervising
modelmaker Martin Bower, and their team worked at Bray Studios, roughly
30 miles (48 km) from Shepperton Studios where principal filming was
taking place. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]
The designs of the
Nostromo
and its attachments were based on combinations of Ridley Scott's storyboards and Ron Cobb's conceptual drawings. [ 53 ]
The basic outlines of the models were made of wood and plastic, and most of the fine details were added from
model kits
of battleships, tanks, and World War II bombers. Three models of the
Nostromo
were made: a 12-inch (30 cm) version for medium and long shots, a
4-foot (1.2 m) version for rear shots, and a 12-foot (3.7 m),
7-short-ton (6.4 t) rig for the undocking and planetoid surface
sequences. [ 16 ] [ 54 ]
Scott insisted on numerous changes to the models even as filming was
taking place, leading to conflicts with the modeling and filming teams.
The
Nostromo
was originally yellow, and the team filmed shots of the models for six weeks before Johnson left to work on
The Empire Strikes Back . Scott then ordered it changed to gray, and the team had to begin shooting again from scratch. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]
He ordered more and more pieces added to the model until the final
large version with the refinery required a metal framework so that it
could be lifted by a
forklift .
He also took a hammer and chisel to sections of the refinery, knocking
off many of its spires which Bower had spent weeks creating. Scott also
had disagreements with lighting technician Denny Ayling over how to
light the models. [ 53 ]
A separate model, approximately 40 feet (12 m) long, was created for the
Nostromo' s underside from which the
Narcissus
would detach and from which Kane's body would be launched during the funeral scene. Bower carved Kane's burial
shroud
out of wood and it was launched through the hatch using a small
catapult
and filmed at high speed, then slowed down in editing. [ 53 ] [ 55 ]
Only one shot was filmed using
blue screen
compositing: that of the shuttle racing past the
Nostromo . The other shots were simply filmed against black backdrops, with stars added via
double exposure . [ 54 ]
Though
motion control photography
technology was available at the time, the film's budget would not allow
for it. The team therefore used a camera with wide-angle lenses mounted
on a drive mechanism to make slow passes over and around the models
filming at 2½ frames per second, [ 16 ]
giving them the appearance of motion. Scott added smoke and wind effects to enhance the illusion. [ 53 ]
For the scene in which the
Nostromo
detaches from the refinery, a 30-foot (9.1 m) docking arm was created using pieces from model railway kits. The
Nostromo
was pushed away from the refinery by the forklift, which was covered in
black velvet, causing the arm to extend out from the refinery. This
created the illusion that the arm was pushing the ship forward. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]
Shots from outside the ship in which the characters are seen through
windows moving around inside were filmed using larger models which
contained projection screens showing pre-recorded footage. [ 53 ]
A separate model was created for the exterior of the derelict alien spacecraft.
Matte paintings
were used to fill in areas of the ship's interior as well as exterior shots of the planetoid's surface. [ 53 ]
The surface as seen from space during the landing sequence was created by painting a
globe
white, then mixing chemicals and dyes onto
transparencies
and projecting them onto it. [ 16 ] [ 54 ]
The planetoid was not named in the film, but some drafts of the script gave it the name
Acheron [ 36 ]
after the river which in
Greek mythology
is described as the "stream of woe", a branch of the river
Styx , and which forms the border of
Hell
in
Dante 's
Inferno . The 1986 sequel
Aliens
named the planetoid as "LV-426", [ 48 ]
and both names have been used for it in subsequent
expanded universe
media such as comic books and video games. In
Alien
the planetoid is said to be located somewhere in the
Zeta 2
Reticuli
system. [ 56 ]
Egg and facehugger
The "facehugger" was the first creature Giger designed for the film, giving it human-like fingers and a long tail. [ 35 ] [ 46 ] The scene of Kane inspecting the egg was shot during post-production. A
fiberglass
egg was used so that actor John Hurt could shine his light on it and
see movement inside, which was provided by Ridley Scott fluttering his
hands inside the egg while wearing rubber gloves. [ 50 ]
The top of the egg opened via hydraulics, and the innards were made of a cow's stomach and
tripe . [ 35 ] [ 50 ]
Initial test shots of the eggs were filmed using hen's eggs, and this
footage was used in early teaser trailers. For this reason a hen's egg
was used as the primary image for the film's advertising poster, and
became a lasting image for the series as a whole rather than the Alien
egg that actually appears in the film. [ 50 ]
The "facehugger" and its
proboscis , which was made of a sheep's
intestine ,
were shot out of the egg using high-pressure air hoses. The shot was
acted out and filmed in reverse, then reversed and slowed down in
editing to prolong the effect and show more detail. [ 35 ] [ 50 ]
The facehugger itself was the first creature that Giger designed for
the film, going through several versions in different sizes before
deciding on a small creature with humanlike fingers and a long tail. [ 35 ] [ 46 ]
Dan O'Bannon drew his own version based on Giger's design, with help from Ron Cobb, which became the final version. [ 23 ] [ 46 ]
Cobb came up with the idea that the creature could have a powerful acid
for blood, a characteristic that would carry over to the adult Alien
and would make it impossible for the crew to kill it by conventional
means such as guns or explosives, since the acid would burn through the
ship's hull. [ 17 ] [ 23 ]
For the scene in which the dead facehugger is examined, Scott used pieces of fish and
shellfish
to create its
viscera . [ 35 ] [ 50 ]
Chestburster
The "chestburster" was shoved up through the table and false torso by a puppeteer. [ 35 ]
The scene has been recognized as one of the film's most memorable. The design of the "chestburster" was inspired by
Francis Bacon 's 1944 painting
Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion . [ 35 ]
Giger's original design resembled a plucked chicken, which was redesigned and refined into the final version seen onscreen. [ 35 ]
For the filming of the chestburster scene the cast members knew that
the creature would be bursting out of Hurt, and had seen the
chestburster puppet, but they had not been told that fake blood would
also be bursting out in every direction from high-pressure pumps and
squibs . [ 40 ] [ 57 ]
The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with
blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath
the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a
puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the
chest a stream of blood shot directly at Veronica Cartwright, shocking
her enough that she fell over and went into hysterics. [ 16 ] [ 35 ] [ 40 ]
According to Tom Skerritt: "What you saw on camera was the real
response. She had no idea what the hell happened. All of a sudden this
thing just came up." [ 35 ]
The creature then runs off-camera, an effect accomplished by cutting a
slit in the table for the puppeteer's stick to go through and passing an
air hose through the puppet's tail to make it whip about. [ 35 ]
The real-life surprise of the actors gave the scene an intense sense
of realism and made it one of the film's most memorable moments. During
preview screenings the crew noticed that some viewers would move towards
the back of the theater so as not to be too close to the screen during
the sequence. [ 58 ]
In subsequent years the chestburster scene has often been voted as one of the most memorable moments in film. [ 59 ]
In 2007, the British film magazine
Empire
named it as the greatest
18-rated
moment in film as part of its "18th birthday" issue, ranking it above the
decapitation
scene in
The Omen
(1976) and the transformation sequence in
An American Werewolf in London
(1981). [ 60 ]
The Alien For more details on the creature, see
Alien (creature in Alien franchise) .
Bolaji Badejo in costume as the Alien. The suit was made of
latex , with the head as a separate piece housing the moving parts which controlled the second mouth. Giger made several conceptual paintings of the adult Alien before
crafting the final version. He sculpted the creature's body using
plasticine , incorporating pieces such as
vertebrae
from
snakes
and cooling tubes from a
Rolls-Royce . [ 35 ] [ 36 ]
The creature's head was manufactured separately by
Carlo Rambaldi , who had worked on the aliens in
Close Encounters of the Third Kind . [ 55 ]
Rambaldi followed Giger's designs closely, making some modifications in
order to incorporate the moving parts which would animate the jaw and
inner mouth. [ 35 ]
A system of hinges and cables was used to operate the creature's rigid
tongue, which protruded from the main mouth and had a second mouth at
the tip of it with its own set of movable teeth. [ 35 ]
The final head had about nine hundred moving parts and points of articulation. [ 35 ]
Part of a
human skull
was used as the "face", and was hidden under the smooth, translucent cover of the head. [ 36 ]
Rambaldi's original Alien jaw is now on display in the
Smithsonian Institution , [ 52 ]
while in April 2007 the original Alien suit was sold at auction. [ 61 ]
Copious amounts of
K-Y Jelly
were used to simulate saliva and to give the Alien an overall slimy appearance. [ 35 ] [ 46 ]
The creature's vocalizations were provided by
Percy Edwards , a
voice artist
famous for providing bird sounds for British television throughout the 1960s and 1970s as well as the whale sounds for
Orca: Killer Whale
(1977). [ 62 ] [ 63 ]
For most of the film's scenes the Alien was portrayed by Bolaji Badejo, a Nigerian design student. A
latex
costume was specifically made to fit Badejo's 7-foot-2-inch (218 cm)
slender frame, made by taking a full-body plaster cast of him. [ 16 ] [ 35 ]
Scott later commented that "It's a man in a suit, but then it would be,
wouldn't it? It takes on elements of the host – in this case, a man." [ 27 ]
Badejo attended
t'ai chi
and
mime
classes in order to create convincing movements for the Alien. [ 35 ] [ 36 ]
For some scenes, such as when the Alien lowers itself from the ceiling
to kill Brett, the creature was portrayed by stuntmen Eddie Powell and
Roy Scammell; [ 16 ] [ 37 ]
in that scene a costumed Powell was suspended on wires and then lowered in an unfurling motion. [ 35 ] [ 50 ]
I've never liked horror films before, because in the end it's always
been a man in a rubber suit. Well, there's one way to deal with that.
The most important thing in a film of this type is not what you see, but
the effect of what you
think
you saw. [ 16 ]
–Ridley Scott Scott chose not to show the Alien in full through most of the film,
showing only pieces of it while keeping most of its body in shadow in
order to heighten the sense of terror and suspense. The audience could
thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the
creature might look like: [ 35 ]
"Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the Alien
will alter shape so you never really know exactly what he looks like." [ 16 ]
The Alien has been referred to as "one of the most iconic movie
monsters in film history" in the decades since the film's release, being
noted for its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones. [ 64 ]
Roger Ebert
has remarked that " Alien
uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It
evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know
quite what it looks like or what it can do...The first time we get a
good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John
Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic in shape, and the critic Tim Dirks
mentions its 'open, dripping vaginal mouth.'" [ 12 ]
Ash For the scene in which Ash is revealed to be an
android
and has his head knocked off, a puppet was created of the character's
torso and upper body which was operated from underneath by a small
puppeteer. [ 42 ]
During a preview screening of the film this scene caused a female usher to faint. [ 58 ] [ 65 ]
In the following scene Ash's head is placed on a table and re-activated; for portions of this scene an
animatronic
head was made using a face cast of actor Ian Holm. [ 52 ]
However the latex of the head shrank while drying and the result was not entirely convincing. [ 42 ]
For the bulk of the scene Holm knelt under the table with his head coming up through a hole and
milk ,
caviar ,
pasta , and glass
marbles
were used to show the android's inner workings and fluids. [ 42 ] [ 52 ]
Music Main article:
Alien (soundtrack)
Jerry Goldsmith composed the music for
Alien . The musical score for
Alien
was composed by
Jerry Goldsmith , conducted by
Lionel Newman , and performed by the
National Philharmonic Orchestra . Ridley Scott had originally wanted the film to be scored by
Isao Tomita , but 20th Century Fox wanted a more familiar composer and Goldsmith was recommended by then-President of Fox
Alan Ladd, Jr. [ 63 ]
Goldsmith wanted to create a sense of romanticism and lyrical mystery
in the film's opening scenes, which would build throughout the film to
suspense and fear. [ 66 ]
Scott did not like Goldsmith's original main title piece, however, so
Goldsmith rewrote it as "the obvious thing: weird and strange, and which
everybody loved." [ 63 ] [ 66 ]
Another source of tension was editor
Terry Rawlings ' choice to use pieces of Goldsmith's music from previous films, including a piece from
Freud: The Secret Passion , and to use an excerpt from
Howard Hanson 's Symphony No.2 ("Romantic") for the end credits. [ 63 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ]
Scott and Rawlings had also become attached to several of the musical
cues they had used for the temporary score while editing the film, and
re-edited some of Goldsmith's cues and re-scored several sequences to
match these cues and even left the temporary score in place in some
parts of the finished film. [ 66 ]
Goldsmith later remarked that "you can see that I was sort of like
going at opposite ends of the pole with the filmmakers of the picture." [ 66 ]
Nevertheless, Scott praised Goldsmith's score as "full of dark beauty" [ 63 ]
and "seriously threatening, but beautiful." [ 66 ]
It was nominated for a
Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score , a
Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album , and a
BAFTA Award for Best Film Music . [ 7 ]
The score has been released as a
soundtrack album
in several versions with different tracks and sequences. [ 69 ]
Editing Editing and post-production work on
Alien
took roughly twenty weeks to complete. [ 66 ]
Terry Rawlings served as Editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for
The Duellists . [ 66 ]
Scott and Rawlings edited much of the film to have a slow pace to build
suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to
Rawlings: "I think the way we did get it right was by keeping it slow,
funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. And
I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to
be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've
sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I
think that's how it worked." [ 66 ]
The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours. [ 58 ] [ 66 ]
One scene that was cut from the film occurred during Ripley's final escape from the
Nostromo : she encounters Dallas and Brett who have been partially
cocooned
by the Alien. O'Bannon had intended the scene to indicate that Brett
was becoming an Alien egg while Dallas was held nearby to be implanted
by the resulting facehugger. [ 21 ]
Production Designer Michael Seymour later suggested that Dallas had "become sort of food for the alien creature", [ 45 ]
while Ivor Powell suggested that "Dallas is found in the ship as an egg, still alive." [ 66 ]
Scott remarked that "they're morphing,
metamorphosing , they are changing into...being consumed, I guess, by whatever the Alien's organism is...into an egg." [ 23 ]
The scene was cut partly because it did not look realistic enough and partly because it slowed the pace of the escape sequence. [ 21 ] [ 52 ]
Tom Skerritt remarked that "The picture had to have that pace. Her
trying to get the hell out of there, we're all rooting for her to get
out of there, and for her to slow up and have a conversation with Dallas
was not appropriate." [ 66 ]
The footage was included amongst other deleted scenes as a special feature on the
Laserdisc
release of
Alien , and a shortened version of it was re-inserted into the 2003 "Director's Cut" which was re-released in theaters and on
DVD . [ 21 ] [ 70 ]
Release and reception
It was the most incredible preview I've ever been in. I mean, people were screaming and running out of the theater. [ 65 ]
–Editor Terry Rawlings describing the film's screening in Dallas. An initial screening of
Alien
for 20th Century Fox representatives in
St. Louis
suffered from poor sound in the theater. A subsequent screening in a newer theater in
Dallas
went significantly better, eliciting genuine fright from the audience. [ 65 ]
Two theatrical
trailers
were shown to the public. The first consisted of rapidly changing still
images set to some of Jerry Goldsmith's electronic music from
Logan's Run . The second used test footage of a hen's egg set to part of Goldsmith's
Alien
score. [ 58 ]
The film was previewed in various American cities in the spring of 1979 [ 58 ]
and was promoted by the
tagline
"In space no one can hear you scream." [ 65 ] [ 71 ]
Alien
opened in theaters on May 25, 1979. [ 71 ]
It was
rated "R"
in the United States, " X " in the United Kingdom, and " M " in Australia. [ 32 ]
The film had no official premier in the United States, yet moviegoers lined up for blocks to see it at
Grauman's Egyptian Theatre
in
Hollywood
where a number of models, sets, and props were displayed outside to promote it during its first run. [ 58 ] [ 65 ]
Religious zealots set fire to the model of the space jockey, believing it to be the work of the
devil . [ 58 ]
Alien
did have a formal premiere in the United Kingdom at the
Odeon Leicester Square
on September 6, 1979, but it did not open widely in Britain until January 13, 1980. [ 58 ]
Critical reaction to the film was initially mixed. Some critics who were not usually favorable towards science fiction, such as
Barry Norman
of the
BBC 's
Film
series, were positive about the film's merits. [ 58 ]
Others, however, were not: Reviews by
Variety ,
Sight and Sound ,
Vincent Canby
and
Leonard Maltin
were mixed or negative. [ 72 ]
A review by
Time Out
said the film was an "empty bag of tricks whose production values and expensive trickery cannot disguise imaginative poverty". [ 73 ]
The film was a commercial success, making $78,900,000 in the United States and
£ 7,886,000 in the United Kingdom during its first run. [ 58 ]
It ultimately grossed $80,931,801 in the United States and $24,000,000
internationally, bringing its total worldwide gross to $104,931,801. [ 3 ]

Sequels For more details on this topic, see
Alien (franchise) .
Sigourney Weaver became the star of the
Alien
films, reprising her role as Ripley in three sequels between 1986 and 1997. She did not appear in either of the
Alien vs. Predator
crossovers of the 2000s, but has expressed interest in doing a fifth
Alien
film. The success of
Alien
led
20th Century Fox
to finance three direct
sequels
over the next eighteen years, each by different writers and directors.
Sigourney Weaver
remained the only recurring actor through all four films, and the story of her character
Ripley 's encounters with the
Aliens
became the thematic thread running through the series. [ 12 ]
James Cameron 's
Aliens
(1986) focused more on action and involved Ripley returning to the planetoid accompanied by
marines
to confront hordes of Aliens. [ 48 ]
David Fincher 's
Alien 3
(1992) had
nihilistic
tones [ 43 ]
and found her on a prison planet battling another Alien, ultimately
sacrificing herself to prevent her employers from acquiring the
creatures. [ 74 ]
Jean-Pierre Jeunet 's
Alien Resurrection
(1997) saw Ripley resurrected through
cloning
to battle more Aliens even further in the future. [ 75 ]
The success of the film series resulted in the creation of a
media franchise
with numerous novels, comic books, video games, toys, and other media
and merchandise appearing over the years. A number of these began
appearing under the
Alien vs. Predator
crossover
imprint, which brought the Alien creatures together with the titular
Predators
of the
Predator
franchise . The film series eventually followed suit, with
Paul W. S. Anderson 's
Alien vs. Predator
(2004) and
Colin and Greg Strause 's
Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem
(2007) abandoning the Ripley character in favor of
prequel
stories set in the 2000s. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]
Despite not appearing in either prequel, Sigourney Weaver has expressed interest in reuniting with
Ridley Scott
to revive her character for another
Alien
film. In the 2003 commentary track for the
Alien
DVD included in the
Alien Quadrilogy
set, she and Scott both speculated on the possibility, with Weaver
stating: "There is an appetite for a fifth one, which is something I
never expected...it's really hard to come up with a fifth story that's
new and fresh...but I have wanted to go back into space...I think outer
space adventure is a good thing for us right now, 'cause Earth is so
grim...so we've been talking about it, but very generally." [ 23 ]
Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the most logical
course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the
Aliens. [ 79 ]
Weaver supported this idea, stating that "I think it would be great to
go back, because I'm asked that question so many times: 'Where did the
Alien come from?' People really want to know in a very visceral way." [ 23 ]
David Giler
stated that he,
Walter Hill ,
and Gordon Carroll, the producers of the first five films in the
series, would not be willing to produce another unless it was about the
Aliens' homeworld and Weaver was on board (although Hill did return to
produce
Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem ). Weaver, in turn, indicated that she would only return to the franchise if either Scott or
James Cameron
were directing. [ 80 ]
Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth
Alien
film which would explore the origins of the creatures, but ceased work on it when he learned that Fox was pursuing
Alien vs. Predator , which he felt would "kill the validity of the franchise". [ 81 ] [ 82 ]
Weaver has continued to express interest in another installment,
stating in 2008 that "I would definitely do another if I had a director
like Ridley Scott and we had a good idea. Ridley is enthusiastic about
it." [ 83 ]
In July 2009 20th Century Fox announced that
Jon Spaihts
had been hired to write a prequel to
Alien , with Scott attached to direct. [ 84 ]
The script was subsequently re-worked by Scott and
Damon Lindelof . Titled
Prometheus , it went into production in May 2011, scheduled for theatrical release in June 2012. Scott released a statement: "While
Alien
was indeed the jumping-off point for this project, out of the creative
process evolved a new, grand mythology and universe in which this
original story takes place. The keen fan will recognize strands of
Alien's
DNA, so to speak, but the ideas tackled in this film are unique, large and provocative." [ 85 ]
Home video releases Alien
has been released in many
home video
formats and packages over the years. The first of these was a seventeen-minute
Super-8
version for home projectionists. [ 56 ]
It was also released on both
VHS
and
Betamax
for
rental , which grossed it an additional
$ 40,300,000 in the United States alone. [ 58 ]
Several VHS releases were subsequently sold both singly and as
boxed sets .
Laserdisc
and
Videodisc
versions followed, including deleted scenes and director commentary as bonus features. [ 56 ] [ 86 ]
A VHS box set containing
Alien
and the sequels
Aliens
and
Alien 3
was released in facehugger-shaped boxes, including some of the deleted scenes from the Laserdisc editions. [ 86 ]
When
Alien Resurrection
premiered in theaters, another set of the first three films was released including a
Making of Alien Resurrection
tape. A few months later the set was re-released with the full version of
Alien Resurrection
taking the place of the making-of video. [ 86 ]
Alien
was released on
DVD
in 1999, both singly and packaged with
Aliens
and
Alien 3
as
The Alien Legacy . [ 56 ] [ 86 ]
This set was also released in a VHS version and included a commentary track by
Ridley Scott . [ 56 ] [ 86 ]
The first three films of the series have also been packaged as the
Alien Triple Pack .
2003 Director's Cut
The traditional definition of the term "Director's Cut" suggests the
restoration of a director's original vision, free of any creative
limitations. It suggests that the filmmaker has finally overcome the
interference of heavy-handed studio executives, and that the film has
been restored to its original, untampered form. Such is not the case
with
Alien : The Director's Cut. It's a completely different beast. [ 87 ]
–Ridley Scott In 2003 20th Century Fox was preparing the
Alien Quadrilogy
DVD box set, which would include
Alien
and its three sequels. In addition, the set would also include
alternate versions of all four films in the form of "special editions"
and " director's cuts ". Fox approached Ridley Scott to digitally restore and
remaster
Alien , and to restore several scenes which had been cut during the editing process for inclusion in an expanded version of the film. [ 87 ]
Upon viewing the expanded version, Scott felt that it was too long and
chose to recut it into a more streamlined alternate version:
Upon viewing the proposed expanded version of the film, I felt that
the cut was simply too long and the pacing completely thrown off. After
all, I cut those scenes out for a reason back in 1979. However, in the
interest of giving the fans a new experience with
Alien , I
figured there had to be an appropriate middle ground. I chose to go in
and recut that proposed long version into a more streamlined and
polished alternate version of the film. For marketing purposes, this
version is being called "The Director's Cut." [ 87 ]
The "Director's Cut" restored roughly four minutes of deleted footage
while cutting about five minutes of other material, leaving it about a
minute shorter than the theatrical cut. [ 58 ]
Many of the changes were minor, such as altered sound effects, while
the restored footage included the scene in which Ripley discovers the
cocooned Dallas and Brett during her escape of the
Nostromo . Fox decided to release the Director's Cut in theaters, and it premiered on October 31, 2003. [ 58 ]
The
Alien Quadrilogy
box set was released December 2, 2003, with both versions of the film
included along with a new commentary track featuring many of the film's
actors, writers, and production staff, as well as other special features
and a documentary entitled
The Beast Within: The Making of Alien .
Each film was also released separately as a DVD with both versions of
the film included. Scott noted that he was very pleased with the
original theatrical cut of
Alien , saying that "For all intents and purposes, I felt that the original cut of
Alien
was perfect. I still feel that way", and that the original 1979 theatrical version "remains my version of choice". [ 87 ]
He has since stated that he considers both versions "director's cuts",
as he feels that the 1979 version was the best he could possibly have
made it at the time. [ 87 ]
The
Alien Quadrilogy
set earned
Alien
a number of new
awards and nominations. It won DVDX Exclusive Awards for Best Audio
Commentary and Best Overall DVD, Classic Movie, and was also nominated
for Best Behind-the-Scenes Program and Best Menu Design. [ 7 ]
It also won a Sierra Award for Best DVD, and was nominated for a
Saturn Award
for Best DVD Collection and Golden
Satellite Awards
for Best DVD Extras and Best Overall DVD. [ 7 ]
In 2010 both the theatrical version and Director's Cut of
Alien
were released on
Blu-ray Disc
as part of the
Alien Anthology
set.
Impact and analysis
Imitations
The 1979
Alien
is a much more cerebral movie than its sequels,
with the characters (and the audience) genuinely engaged in curiosity
about this weirdest of lifeforms...Unfortunately, the films it
influenced studied its thrills but not its thinking. [ 12 ]
–Film critic
Roger Ebert
on
Alien 's cinematic impact. Alien
had both an immediate and long-term impact on the science fiction and horror genres. Shortly after its debut,
Dan O'Bannon
was sued by another writer named Jack Hammer for allegedly plagiarising a script entitled
Black Space . However, O'Bannon was able to prove that he had written his
Alien
script first. [ 88 ]
In the wake of
Alien 's
success a number of other filmmakers imitated or adapted some of its
elements, sometimes by copying its title. One of the first was
The Alien Dead
(1979), which was titled at the last minute to cash in on
Alien 's popularity. [ 89 ]
Contamination
(1980) was initially going to be titled
Alien 2
until 20th Century Fox's lawyers contacted writer/director
Luigi Cozzi
and made him change it, and it built on press coverage of
Alien 's
chestburster scene by having many similar creatures, which originated
from large, slimy eggs, bursting from characters' chests. [ 89 ]
An unauthorized Italian sequel to
Alien , titled
Alien 2 ,
was released in 1980 and included alien creatures which incubate inside
human hosts. Other science fiction films of the time that exploited
elements of
Alien
included
Inseminoid
(1981) and
Xtro
(1982). [ 89 ]
Antecedents In the decades since its original release critics have analyzed and acknowledged
Alien 's
roots in earlier works of fiction. It has been noted as sharing
thematic similarities with earlier science fiction films such as
The Thing from Another World
(1951) [ 12 ] [ 90 ]
and
It! The Terror from Beyond Space
(1958), [ 19 ] [ 64 ]
as well as a kinship with other 1970s horror films such as
Jaws
(1975) and
Halloween
(1978). [ 12 ]
Literary connections have also been suggested, including thematic comparisons to
And Then There Were None
(1939). [ 90 ]
Many critics have also suggested that the film derives in part from
A. E. van Vogt 's
The Voyage of the Space Beagle
(1950), particularly the stories
The Black Destroyer , in which a cat-like alien infiltrates the ship and hunts the crew, and
Discord in Scarlet , in which an alien implants parasitic eggs inside crew members which then hatch and eat their way out. [ 91 ]
O'Bannon, however, denies that this was a source of his inspiration for
Alien 's story. [ 15 ]
Van Vogt actually initiated a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox over the similarities, but Fox settled out of court. [ 92 ]
Rick Sanchez of ign.com noted the "striking resemblance" [ 93 ]
to
Mario Bava 's cult classic
Planet of the Vampires ,
especially in a celebrated sequence in which the crew approaches and
enters an alien ship, astonishingly similar to the derelict spacecraft
in
Alien , and discovers the skeletal remains of long dead giant beings. [ 94 ]
Despite the astounding visual similarities, both O'Bannon and director
Ridley Scott claimed in a 1979 interview that they had not seen
Planet of the Vampires . [ 95 ]
Writer
David McIntee
has also noted similarities to the
Doctor Who
episode " The Ark in Space " (1975), in which an insectoid queen alien lays
larvae
inside humans which later eat their way out, a life cycle inspired by that of the
ichneumons wasp . [ 15 ]
He has also noted similarities between the first half of the film, particularly in early versions of the script, to
H.P. Lovecraft 's
At the Mountains of Madness , "not in storyline, but in dread-building mystery", [ 15 ]
and calls the finished film "the best Lovecraftian movie ever made,
without being a Lovecraft adaptation", due to its similarities in tone
and atmosphere to Lovecraft's works. [ 43 ]
Lasting critical praise Alien
has continued to receive critical praise over the years, particularly for its realism and unique environment. [ 64 ]
It has a 96% approval rating at the online
review aggregator
Rotten Tomatoes
based on 82 reviews, [ 96 ]
while
Metacritic
gives the Director's Cut an 83% approval rating based on 22 reviews. [ 97 ]
Critical interest in the film was re-ignited in part by the theatrical
release of the "Director's Cut" in 2003. In his "Great Movies" column
that year, critic Roger Ebert ranked it among "the most influential of
modern action pictures", praising its pacing, atmosphere, and settings:
One of the great strengths of
Alien
is its pacing. It takes its time. It waits. It allows silences (the majestic opening shots are underscored by
Jerry Goldsmith
with scarcely audible, far-off metallic chatterings). It suggests the
enormity of the crew's discovery by building up to it with small steps:
The interception of a signal (is it a warning or an
SOS ?).
The descent to the extraterrestrial surface. The bitching by Brett and
Parker, who are concerned only about collecting their shares. The
masterstroke of the surface murk through which the crew members move,
their helmet lights hardly penetrating the soup. The shadowy outline of
the alien ship. The sight of the alien pilot, frozen in his command
chair. The enormity of the discovery inside the ship ("It's full of ...
leathery eggs ..."). [ 12 ]
McIntee praises
Alien
as "possibly the definitive combination of horror thriller with [science fiction] trappings." [ 43 ]
He notes, however, that it is a horror film first and a science fiction
film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how
humanity will develop under other circumstances.
Alien , on the
other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster:
"It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying
not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them
trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal." [ 43 ]
Along with
Halloween
and
Friday the 13th
(1980), he describes it as a prototype for the
slasher film
genre: "The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics,
who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is that it
is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies." [ 43 ]
He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: "Fans of
Hitchcockian
thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for
the chest-burster. [Science fiction] fans love the hard [science
fiction] trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival
element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim." [ 98 ]
Almost every horror film since
Alien
has ripped it off in some
way, but most of the imitations have focused on details — a slimy
killing-machine monster that is both vaginal and penile; the dripping,
cavernous interiors of the
Nostromo ; those immensely influential
H. R. Giger
" biomechanical " designs — and missed what you might call the overall
Zeitgeist
of the film. [ 99 ]
–Salon.com critic Andrew O'Hehir Salon.com
critic Andrew O'Hehir notes that
Alien
"has a profoundly
existentialist
undertow that makes it feel like a
film noir " [ 99 ]
and praises it over its "increasingly
baroque " sequels as "a film about human loneliness amid the emptiness and
amorality
of creation. It's a cynical '70s- leftist
vision of the future in which none of the problems plaguing 20th century Earth—class divisions,
capitalist
exploitation, the subjugation of humanity to technology—have been
improved in the slightest by mankind's forays into outer space." [ 99 ]
In 2002,
Alien
was deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" by the
National Film Preservation Board
of the United States, [ 9 ]
and was inducted into the
National Film Registry
of the
Library of Congress
for historical preservation alongside other films of 1979 including
All That Jazz ,
Apocalypse Now ,
The Black Stallion , and
Manhattan . [ 8 ]
In 2008 the
American Film Institute
ranked
Alien
as the seventh-best film in the science fiction genre as part of
AFI's 10 Top 10 , a
CBS
television special ranking the ten greatest movies in ten classic American film genres. The ranks were based on a
poll
of over 1,500 film artists, critics, and historians, with
Alien
ranking just above
Terminator 2: Judgment Day
(1991) and just below Ridley Scott's other science fiction film
Blade Runner
(1982). [ 10 ]
The same year,
Empire
magazine ranked it thirty-third on its list of the five hundred
greatest movies of all time, based on a poll of 10,200 readers, critics,
and members of the film industry. [ 11 ]
Sexual imagery Critics have also analyzed
Alien 's sexual overtones. Adrian Mackinder compares the facehugger's attack on Kane to a male
rape
and the chestburster scene to a form of violent
birth , noting that the Alien's
phallic
head and method of killing the crew members add to the sexual imagery. [ 64 ]
Dan O'Bannon has argued that the scene is a metaphor for the male fear
of penetration, and that the "oral invasion" of Kane by the facehugger
functions as "payback" for the many horror films in which sexually
vulnerable women are attacked by male monsters. [ 100 ]
McIntee claims that " Alien
is a rape movie as much as
Straw Dogs
(1971) or
I Spit on Your Grave
(1978), or
The Accused
(1988). On one level it's about an intriguing alien threat. On one level it's about
parasitism
and disease. And on the level that was most important to the writers
and director, it's about sex, and reproduction by non-consensual means.
And it's about this happening to a man." [ 101 ]
He notes how the film plays on men's fear and misunderstanding of
pregnancy and childbirth, while also giving women a glimpse into these
fears. [ 102 ]
Film analyst Lina Badley has written that the Alien's design, with strong
Freudian
sexual undertones, multiple phallic symbols, and overall feminine figure, provides an
androgynous
image conforming to
archetypal
mappings and imageries in horror films that often redraw gender lines. [ 103 ]
O'Bannon himself later described the sexual imagery in
Alien
as overt and intentional: "One thing that people are all disturbed
about is sex... I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm
going to attack them sexually. And I'm not going to go after the women
in the audience, I'm going to attack the men. I am going to put in every
image I can think of to make the men in the audience cross their legs.
Homosexual oral rape, birth. The thing lays its eggs down your throat,
the whole number. ' " [ 104 ]

In the script and film the computer is referred to by the crew members as "Mother". An October 1979 issue of
Fantastic Films
magazine, as well as the back of the 1980 Fox videodisk of the film,
explain that "Mother" is an abbreviation for "MU/TH/UR 6000", the model
of the computer. The chapter list for
Alien
in the 2003
Alien Quadrilogy
DVD set also lists it as "MU/TH/UR". The 1997 sequel
Alien Resurrection , the fourth film in the series, echoed this element by having the crew of the
Auriga

20th Century Fox
Home Entertainment, Inc.. "It's a tough one, particularly with the
success of four. I think if you close the lid it should be the end of
the first chapter, and I think very simply what no one's done is simply
gone back to re-visit 'what was it?' No one's ever said 'who's the space
jockey?' He wasn't an Alien. What was that battleship? Is it a
battleship? Is it an aircraft carrier? Is it a bio-mechanoid weapon
carrier?...Why did it land? Did it crash-land, or did it settle there
because it had engine trouble?...And how long ago? 'Cause those eggs
would sit there."
