Blasts From The Past
The current quest for
sustainable sources of energy
comes from a critical awareness that the availability of
fossil fuels
is rapidly diminishing. Once used, fossil fuels have no further value. Unlike so many other things from the past, they're gone forever.
While
George Santayana
once claimed that "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,"
William Clay Ford  had a different take on history.
"The further and faster the human race goes, the more difficult it becomes to remember its receding and ever-expanding past. To neglect that
heritage
is to risk a future in which young people find themselves without a means of building on the firm and reassuring foundation of the past."

Had it not been for the zeal with which Ford's grandfather,
Henry Ford , collected traces of America's
Industrial Revolution , there might be little left to remind us of our not too distant history. Their pattern of display at the
Henry Ford Museum
in
Dearborn, Michigan
is vastly different from that seen in most other
science museums . In Dearborn, visitors can observe minute changes in technology and design. The evolution of
dictating equipment
proves fascinating when compared to the technology of today's electronic office.
An indicator of the breadth of Henry Ford's collection is to note that, during the first few years of the museum's life, nearly 80% of its visitors could recognize and identify most of the objects on display from their personal experience. At best, no more than 5% of today's visitors can readily identify the same objects.
The recent news that the wreck of the
SS Gairsoppa
had been discovered by
Odyssey Marine Exploration
(which had an exclusive search-and- salvage
contract with the
British government ) gained international attention this week for one simple reason: The British
merchant ship
was carrying 7 million
ingots
of
silver
(now worth approximately $210 million) when it was
torpedoed
and sunk on February 16, 1941.
Anyone who routinely visits
garage sales ,
flea markets ,
used clothing
stores, or shops on
eBay
knows that there is hidden treasure to be found in
recycling
items that have gone out of fashion. In the following audio clip,
Fanny Brice
sings the "Second Hand Rose," a song she introduced during the
Ziegfield Follies of 1921 .
Whether souvenirs of the past were victims of
planned obsolescence , passing fashions, or a death in the family, many have gained new life in the loving hands of people whose taste might be classified as " vintage " or " retro ." Collectors often develop an insatiable appetite for such items.
An early desk stapler
Originally written by
Lionel Bart
for his musical adaptation of
Oliver Twist , the
Artful Dodger's
lyrics for Act I's " Consider Yourself " take on new meaning with regard to those who have a passion for collecting things. From
trinkets
to  tchotchkes , from the discovery of a
flapper dress
to the purchase of a rare
comic book , one can almost hear the devout collector singing:
"Consider yourself at home
Consider yourself one of the family
We've taken to you so strong
It's clear we're going to get along! Consider yourself well in
Consider yourself part of the furniture
There isn't a lot to spare
Who cares? Whatever we've got we share!
If it should chance to be that we should see
Some harder days, empty larder days
Why grouse?
Always a chance we'll meet somebody to foot the bill,
Then the drinks are on the house!
Consider yourself our mate
We don't want to have no fuss,
For after some consideration, we can state
Consider yourself one of us!" In a city with so much
Victorian architecture , it's no surprise that many San Franciscans have developed an acute desire to become the
curators
of their own lives. Some like to spend their weekends "garage sailing" for items of interest (the fruits of their shopping adventures can often be seen at special costume events like the opening night of the
San Francisco Silent Film Festival ). Others have transformed their homes into miniature museums that cater to a highly specialized sense of style.
* * * * * * * * * A  fascinating video clip
about
Adam Savage
and
Stanley Kubrick
shows how the creative collector's mind can be driven by an artistic vision that others might misdiagnose as
obsessive-compulsive disorder . And although budget problems forced the
Philoctetes Center for The Multidisciplinary Study of Imagination
to close its physical space and discontinue its programs, the organization's
website
and
YouTube channel
(which includes lengthy panel sessions devoted to " The Sensibility of the Collector " and " The Mind of the Collector ") can still be accessed online.
What separates an organized hoarder from a collector with a more curatorial bent? The following video demonstrates how difficult it might be to find the answer.
No matter what a person likes to collect (wedding cake ornaments,
miniature toy trains ,
dinosaur
sculptures), anyone who has amassed a large collection of tchotchkes will instantly fall in love with a Canadian documentary entitled  Unlikely Treasures . Written and directed by
Tally Abecassis , this delightful indie gem (which will be screened at the upcoming  10th San Francisco Documentary Festival ) should not be missed.

It's hard to tell which part of this film is more fun: the collectors or their collections. Each has a story to tell which is more eccentric than the last. Some claim to have been born with "the collecting gene."
As
Marilyn Gelfman-Karp
explains: "I hear the call of objects all the time. They talk to me and say 'take me home!'" Marilyn is certainly no exception. Among the collectors featured in
Unlikely Treasures
are:
Dorothy Globus , a curator at the
New York Museum of Arts & Design , who has amassed all kinds of collections ranging from antique
staplers
to
tea bags .
Billy Mavreas , who owns a store in
Montreal
that displays old
electronics manuals ,
swizzle sticks , and oh so much more.
Kyle Supley , a "collecting
savant " with a specialty in household electronics (ranging from
1960s clocks
to wrist radios) as well as an occasional pair of high fashion
platform shoes .
Viewers of
Antiques Roadshow
will especially like Abecassis's documentary, which includes a visit to a fascinating three-story home/museum in
Greensboro, North Carolina  that recycles collections into unique pieces of art, and the
City Reliquary
in
Brooklyn .
At a mere 52 minutes in length,
Unlikely Treasures
contains more joy, curiosity, and appreciation of the past than you'll find in most films. By the time the final credits roll, many viewers will be grinning from ear to ear. Here's the trailer:
* * * * * * * * * American Conservatory Theatre
just opened its season with a new production of
Once in a Lifetime .
George S. Kaufman
and
Moss Hart's
comedy opened on Broadway on September 24, 1930, nearly a year after the great
Wall Street Crash of 1929 . With the economy in the toilet, and
vaudeville
consistently losing audience share to
silent film , the advent of
talking pictures
sounded the death knell for the careers of many performers who had built their careers on the
Keith ,
Orpheum , and
Albee circuits .
Eight decades following its Broadway premiere (a film version was released in 1932),
Once in a Lifetime
now has the
nostalgic
gloss that applies to an era whose visual images ran the gamut from
Busby Berkeley's   black-and-white
movie musicals to
Dorothea Lange's
portrait of
Florence Owens Thompson
entitled "Migrant Mother."
"Migrant Mother" by Dorothea Lange
Once in a Lifetime
begins as three vaudevillians decide to abandon their search for work in
Manhattan
and head for
Hollywood .
May Daniels
( Julia Coffey ) is obviously the brains of the operation. With talking pictures starting to take hold, May has developed a scheme to open an
acting school
that will teach silent film actors how to speak onscreen.
Jerry Hyland
( John Wernke ) is obviously the muscle of the operation. He's good at networking, making connections and, having sold their vaudeville act for $500, pulling in the dough.
George Lewis
( Patrick Lane ) is, well, um, it's not all that clear just what George is. He's handsome, he's simple-minded, and people like him. In Hollywood, that might be all he needs to get ahead.

As they travel cross country by rail, the trio encounters:
Helen Hobart
( René Augesen ), a Hollywood
gossip columnist
who knew May when they were much younger.
Susan Walker
( Ashley Wickett ), an attractive and severely untalented young woman who wants to become a movie star.
Upon arriving in Hollywood, they have to deal with: Mrs. Walker
( Margo Hall ), Susan's clueless mother.
Lawrence Vail
(Alexander Crowther), a frustrated
playwright
who may be drawing a handsome salary from a movie studio, but has no idea what he's doing in
California .
Phyllis Fontaine
( Marisa Duchowny ) and  Florabel Leigh
( Jessica Kitchens ), two silent screen actresses with a fatal combination of bad diction and even worse accents.
Herman Glogauer
( Will LeBow ), a
studio mogul
who made the mistake of refusing to invest in
Vitaphone .

With his large cast playing multiple roles as they jump in and out of
Alex Jaeger's
stylish costumes,
Mark Rucker
has directed this
farce
with a masterful touch. Not only he is blessed with
Daniel Ostling's  wonderfully evocative sets, with the help of some keen video work by
Alexander V. Nichols , Rucker has managed to hilariously incorporate numerous black-and-white film clips into the production.
If certain actors stand out above the others in this large cast, it is due to their superb comic timing and/or  sharp characterizations. René Augesen's gossip columnist is a deliciously overblown creation while Nick Gabriel triumphs in
drag
as Miss Leighton, a clueless studio
receptionist .

With enough chronological distance from the 1930s, Kaufman & Hart's farce may have lost some of its timeliness, but none of its bite. The passage of time has even made it possible for the San Francisco Silent Film Festival to offer free screenings of silent films prior to each Friday performance of
Once in a Lifetime .
The show itself is a visually grand romp and frolic performed with the gusto of the
Marx Brothers  movie. It brings to the stage the kind of wit that is sorely missed on Broadway. Performances continue through October 16 (you can
order tickets here ). In the meantime, here's the trailer:
