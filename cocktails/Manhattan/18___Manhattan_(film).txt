Design
Woody Allen and the Windsor font
Is this fetish or brand identity?
White Windsor typeface on black
White type on black opening titles rolling on old jazz
or classical music became a part of Woody Allen brand.
In a time when movie titles become more and more of a clueless "me too!" affair 1 , Woody Allen’s unique (and relentless) typographic style is entirely praiseworthy. His white type on black opening titles rolling on old jazz
or classical music became a part of Woody Allen brand, just like his neurotic dialogues and "his black-rimmed glasses" 2
are.
The white type being
EF
Windsor
Elongated
( later edit:
or a heavier weight of
EF
Windsor
Light Condensed , as some of the readers suggested) by
Elsner+Flake
foundry.

Here is how Fonts.com describes "EF
Windsor
family":
Windsor
is an unusual design cut by Stephenson Blake 3
in 1905.
Windsor
is a bold face with heavy rounded serifs and strong diagonal stress. Capitals M and W are widely splayed, P and R have very large upper bowls. The Lowercase a h m and n of the
Windsor
font have angled right hand stems, e has an angled cross-stroke. The overall effect is one of friendliness and warmth. Use the
Windsor
font in advertising, on posters and for general display work.
Ed Benguiat, the "printer"
How did Woody Allen chose this typeface? In a
previous iteration
of this post, the mystery of Woody Allen's typeface of choice was solved by this amazing story posted by
Randy J. Hunt
in the comments (thank you, Randy):
Benguiat had an affinity for Windsor and suggested it to him that morning. He’s used it in every film since.
I'm currently taking a typeface design course with Ed Benguiat, and just last night he described a time when he would have breakfast at the same New Jersey diner every morning. Among the other that would dine there was Woody Allen. On one occasion, referring to Benguiat as a "printer," Allen asked him what a good typeface was. Benguiat had an affinity for
Windsor
and suggested it to him that morning. He's used it in every film since.
This New Jersey breakfast with Ed Benguiat must've happened sometime between '75 and '77, because in
Love and Death
(1975) the titles (although already white type on black background) are set in another serif, while in
Annie Hall
(1977)
Windsor
is there, in the largest size of all his titles.
It is also interesting that after
Annie Hall
(1977) Woody Allen betrays
Windsor — Interiors
(1978) titles are set in a News Gothic-ish sans serif—only to return to it for
Mahattan
in 1979.
Update:
Mr. Benguiat confirmed—thank you, sir—and shed further light on this
in comment № 50
below:
All very nicely worded and all technically correct. Thank you all for the factual feedback on Mr. Allen. One other person needs a little thanks for his opinion on the use of Windsor was Corbet Monica, who was at the dinner every Sat & Sun. He played in the movie "Broadway Danny Rose."
Story confirmed. What a beautiful surprise!

Final
Truth is, I don't know whether this is a Kubrick-eque case of typographic fetish 4
or if Woody Allen built a visual identity in order to brand his products.

Wikipedia
page
on Windsor specifies: "Windsor is an old style serif display typeface created in 1905 by
Eleisha Pechey . Besides the basic font it is also available in two other styles, Light and Roman. Various foundries introduced minor variations so that today there are versions by
Linotype ,
Elsner+Flake ,
URW +++ ,
Mecanorma
and
Stephenson Blake ."

I guess Woody applied the universal rule "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" :). He found one typo recipe that worked well with his movies and stuck to it.
Or maybe he thought that if someone one day will place all his films one next to the other, they should look like books from the same publishing house and author, bearing the same spine layout :)

Speaking of films as books, it's interesting that the poster and the DVD cover are often designed in a way that has nothing to do with the movie's title sequences. Woody Allen's movies can epitomize this school of thought where the two are disjunct.

I believe the title sequence issue is covered in the book "Woody on Woody". It's been awhile since I've read it, but here is what I can remember. 1) He was given a budget of let's say $200,000 for title sequences. So, the less he spends on titles the more he can spend elsewhere or "make up", if he was running over budget. 2) It was also an homage to the late great Ingmar Bergman who also used the same typeface repeatedly. Another homage, to Bergman, was the absence of music in Annie Hall. And remember, Woody wanted Bergman to appear in Annie Hall as the director in the theatre scene. However Bergman refused to leave Faro.

John Coulthart :
Michael Cimino also used white Windsor on black for (IIRC) The Deer Hunter and Heaven's Gate. Don't have copies of his other films to hand to check those.
There's a few other directors who do this with titles but they're rarely so consistent across such a length of time as Woody Allen. Offhand the main one I can think of is John Carpenter. I haven't seen a film of his for years but he used to favour white Albertus on black for his titles.

the cover for "mere anarchy" depends on the edition and publisher; I'm at work at a bookstore and our covers are matte black, with Woody Allen in white, Mere Anarchy in orange (with the Y falling away from the rest of the word), and the whole thing in a lightweight modernist sans serif whose name I can't remember

It's a terrific example of how a film's tone can be set by aspects that are almost universally-overlooked by critics and scholars.
In my perfect world, there'd be an Academy Award for typesetting or type-writing. There was, actually, such an award in the first two years of the Oscars -- but as "talkies" replaced the silent film, the need to recognize those who engineered visual text production faded as well.

I have to second Maza. The font you link to is not the font found in your screen captures of Woody Allen's movies.
Just take Annie Hall and compare the A, the H and the a.
They're all different.
a: Woody has a drop, Elongated doesn't
A: Woody's horizontal bar is quite centered, Elongated has it rather low
H: Woody's horizontal bar is rather high, while Elongated's is centered
The font Woody Allen used does indeed look more like Light Condensed.

There's an old Romanian saying that—loosely translated—goes like this: When a person tells you that you’re drunk, ignore it. When two persons warn you that you’re drunk, you better go to bed.
So Maza, Tom Ross, I guess I have to admit that you may be right. It looks more like Light Condensed, indeed.
Still, some of the titles are set in a visibly heavier weight—just look at
Stardust Memories ,
The Purple Rose of Cairo
or
Hannah and Her Sisters —I doubt it can be an off-the-shelf Light Condensed.

Mark Simonson :
It's definitely Windsor Light Condensed, not Elongated. The variations in weight in the titles are most likely due either to differences in exposure or the use of different versions of Windsor Light Condensed.
Places like Photo-Lettering Inc. in NYC (where Ed Benguiat created hundreds of typeface designs) often offered finely graded weightings of popular designs. So, if you wanted something like Windsor Light Condensed, but a little bolder or a little lighter, you could get it. Even with the tens of thousands of digital fonts available today, there are whole libraries of fonts that have never been digitized. Just because all we have today is a handful of Windsor fonts doesn't mean that's all there has ever been.

First comment: ok, Mighty Aphrodite is set on 2 lines, but Vicky Cristina Barcelona is set on 3. Hence, the sentence "it’s interesting that this one is the only title I found set on two lines (the rest are one-liners)" has to be updated.
Second comment: as said in other comments, it might be interesting to show films that are not compliant. You will find here (http://www.contactsheet.org/articles/woodys_typeface.html) some examples, such as Bananas, Everything..., Sleeper, Love & Death, Interiors.
Third comment: on your IMDB list, you can remove the 36 (The Concert for New York City), which is only the big concert in which can be seen the 35 (Sounds From A Town I Love).
Anyway, thanks for your wonderful post, thanks for the updates you make with each Woody new film.

Yves is right: nos 35 and 36 refer to the same film, which is available here on

A great post on a lovely looking blog. I initially found a post about this issue on
Contact Sheet
(to which you refer), but wanted to find confirm exactly what font it is as I'm thinking of buying it.
The publicity material (poster and website) for
Whatever Works
appears to use the familiar EF Windsor Light Condensed, but the font used in the trailer is a lowercase sans serif.
I always enjoy the familiarity of Woody Allen's title sequences. You kinda know what you're getting. They're more exciting to me than the James Bond pre-title sequences.

* Mighty Aphrodite set on 2 lines.
* Vicky Cristina Barcelona & You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger set on 3.
So you can updates comments of films 28 ("(the rest are one-liners" is no more true), 42 & 46.

Interesting interview in a french paper about the links between Paris and Woody:
http://teleobs.nouvelobs.com/articles/woody-allen-echouer-a-paris-c-est-mieux-que-reussir-ailleurs?page=7
But there is an interesting story about Windsor font.
I translate it:
- You often work with the same people, same music sources, the same characters... Even your credits are written in the same font, Windsor...
- I have my little habits. When I started, it was the fashion of crazy credits, as in "Pink Panther", and it absorbed half of the film budget. So I tried to do the same, but cheaper. For the generic "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex", the art director asked me to shoot a white room with white rabbits, which were sexual symbols. We have therefore hired two hundred. But on arrival, the rabbits were all crowded into a compact pile. We needed one more. We rented two hundred more! Same result! We then rentall white rabbits in Paris, there must be five thousand! And it still was not enough! At this point, I decided to keep it simple. And I have never changed.

Can anyone tell me what fonts are used in Woody Alen's new Midnight in Paris for the previews?
The titles read: Font#1 Paris is in the Morning Font#2 is beautiful.
Font#1 Paris in the afternoon Font#2 is charrming
The title sequence had me running to my Mac to see if I could find something similar to Font#2, which is also beautiful.

For Midnight in Paris.
For the next one, it seems that, for the 4th time (after The Wrong Picture then The Bop Decameron then Nero Fiddled) the title might be To Rome With Love...

Apparently, Woody also did it on the plays he directed in 2003, see this:
http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9C0DE6DB163EF935A25756C0A9659C8B63
"The projected title of each playlet, "Riverside Drive" and "Old Saybrook," is in the white-on-black typeface that Mr. Allen always uses for his film credits. (For the font-savvy, it's Windsor Light Condensed.)"
Woody has written approximately 10 plays, he directed only 3 ("Riverside Drive" and "Old Saybrook" in 2003, and "A Second Hand Memory" in 2004). It would be funny to see some photos of the Windsor part of these plays (for the 2004 play, I even don't know if he did).
Any NY inhabitant who would share that (I did not find anything on the Web so far)?

Once again, the 2013 opus should match, cf. the film poster:
http://news.moviefone.com/2013/05/20/blue-jasmine-poster-debut_n_3306656.html
You can add #47 "Blue Jasmine" (imdb tells us that the film is now completed).

You may have noticed that the unseen Men of crisis (1971) has appeared these last few days on youtube (with italian subtitles !).
It of course has no Windsor font, as this links shows:
http://www.woodyallenpages.com/2014/07/lost-history-men-of-crisis-the-harvey-wallinger-story-the-woody-allen-pages-review/
You can add this fim between Bananas and Play it again, Sam (so between 4 & 5).

At last, Men of crisis can be seen on youtube. You can insert it between Bananas and Everything...
Of course, no Windsor thing in this:
