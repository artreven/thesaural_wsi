Shed some light maybe?
I was coming out of one of the roadside beach parking areas on Waianae side and straight across the road was this little frame house with a laundry line in front of it.
I jokingly told my boys someone left the laundry out too long to dry and snapped this picture.
Of course, when I was able to turn and get closer, I wondered if maybe it was seaweed or something else.
Anyone have any ideas??
Mahalo!!

Looks like Spanish moss / Pele's hair / Tillandsia usneoides.

Not drying it for lei-making.
That's how it grows.
It's a type of air fern, I think.
You string it up on fences, coat hangers, or clotheslines and leave it alone and it grows.
Super nice in haku leis.

Not generally on clotheslines in direct fulltime sunlight, that I've ever seen.

It can handle full sun or shade; it has no roots, and collects nutrients from rainwater & humid air.

Re: Shed some light maybe?
There is (or used to be) an old cottage style house on the mauka side of Dillingham Blvd a few blocks ewa of Waiakamilo that had dozens of these ferns hanging all around it. The home I used to house sit had 4 very large ferns hanging off the lanai. They got full afternoon sun for several hours each day. It's amazing how big and full they get and how fast they grow. If the ends come in contact with anything, they'll attach and wrap around it. I was told to water the tops of the plants 3 times a week and spritz them with water the other days. The owner was a member of the Garden Club!!!

It's odd to realise that such a fluffy plant is a Bromeliad and related to it's
much chunkier relative, the Pineapple.
Time for a Hawaiian pizza!

Will that plant come alive such as in The Little Shop of Horrors?

There was such a plant seen in several episodes of "The Addams Famiy"
as per the early b&w tv renditions.

A lot of local people call it hinahina although it is a spanish moss as Leo stated.

Thanks to all!!!
Google just would not help, lol!
I also had so much fun rediscovering the touch me not grass that I had never seen before until I lived there as a preteen and had not seen since.

Re: Shed some light maybe?
Not certain if it is Spanish moss or a close relative.
We put it on our lower-branched trees (like our magnolia) to enhance the tropical ambiance.

Mimosa .
I found it interesting that the Wikipedia article (linked) mentions Hawaii in particular.
I had no idea it wasn't a weedy presence everywhere.

These plants fold up their leaves when touched.
The species Acacia are littered with alkaloids.
In this case the tryptamines.

I had no idea they were part of the mimosa family. When we were kids, we always called them
sleeping beauties , because when you touched them, they would go to sleep.

Sleeping grass is what everyone I know calls it too.
Don't step on it with bare feet.

Is the plant edible if you go on a field trip with Ewell Gibbons?

I thought I was the only person who remembered him. I once got a book of his from the Waianae library with a recipe for a papaya cut in half, with a link sausage put into the puka, and baked. I guess that was what you got to eat if you had more than a PINE TREE, "most parts are edible, you know".
