Oh Schnapps, that's another fine Mimosa I've gotten myself into
Once in a
Blue Moon , a
Sea Breeze
was blowing through the windows of Bar Acqua.  It was a
Dark and Stormy
night, it was my 40th birthday and
Margarita
the nanny was nowhere to be found.  I rang her and said, “Margarita, where the
Bloody Mary
are you?”
” I
Pina Colada
shopping”, she said
“Are you
Bellini
lying to me?” I asked.  ‘I’m going
Tequila
‘, I thought.
“Don’t be
Angostura Bitter “, she said, “I was buying you a birthday pressie!”
“Oh, don’t mind me”, I said, “my
Bacardi
is worse than my bite, “I’m just having a bit of a
Harvey Wallbanger .”
At that moment, the fire alarm began to
Woo-Woo .  Oh
Schnapps , this was another fine
Mimosa
I’d gotten into….so armed with just a
Rusty Nail
and a
Screwdriver , I fixed it.  Thank the Lord, it was a
Mojito .
The show must go on, thought.
I was having a
Pisco Sour
up for my
B52
and all my
Martini’s
were coming to help me celebrate.
An old flame arrived first, “ Brandy Alexander ?” I asked,
“No, I’m feeling a bit of a
Zombie , can I have a
Long Island Iced Tea
instead?”
“Alex, what’s different about you?”
“Is it
Mai Tai ?”
“No, it’s a bit
Old Fashioned “, I replied, “I think it’s your
Gimlet
eyes”.
“Thanks a lot”, he said, “ No Sex on the Beach
for you tonight.”
“Oh
Singapore Sling
your hook,” I said, “you’re having a
Blue Lagoon .”
Luckily, more guests started arriving, so it didn’t
Snowball .  We all danced the night away. My favourites were Dancing Queen by
Absinthe
and Like a
Virgin Mary
by
Midori .
One of the guests was a
Kir Royale
pain in the
Horse’s Neck , hoovering up all the food and refusing to
Buck’s Fizz
off home until the
Bitter Lemon
end.  What a
Flaming Sambucca .
Still, the party went on until
Tequila Sunrise
and was an
Absolut
sucess.  Can’t wait for the next one…it’s going to be a
Jaeger bomb .

Stayed there a couple of weekends ago had a fab time nothing too much trouble for staff and really helpful its located right on the beach front and far enough away from the live music and clubs for a good nights sleep. I will be going again soon oh and the full English breakfast is lovely.
