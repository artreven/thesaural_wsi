First of all, let me just say,
Dick Fuld
is a pretty intense guy.  I don't see him that often (out of a certain fear for my safety) but,
because of our history , I love that guy like a brother. This morning,
Dick
called me out of the blue and asked if I wanted to play tennis at
The Riviera Country Club .
"Is that the club that doesn't take Jews?"
"No, that's
The Los Angeles Country Club ," he said.  "And I think they take Jews now.
Spielberg's
a member, I think." Now I hadn't played any tennis since
my near-catastrophic ankle injury of a year ago
(when I went to visit that schmuck
Steve Jobs ) - but I told him I would go.  A friendly game of tennis sounded like a nice way to start off the week.  I had not seen him since all
his trouble began
and I wanted to offer my support and see how he was doing (even though I lost a shit-load of money).
His driver picked me up and drove us to the
Club .  He was watching
CNBC
in the car and swearing at the
Street Sweetie Erin Burnett .  "She doesn't know shit about what I've gone through!"  He appeared very tan and extremely well rested.
"What's going on, Dick?", I asked.
"Khan, can you believe it's been a year since
Lehman Brothers
filed for bankruptcy?"
"No shit.  A year sure goes by fast."
"Not really."  He turned back to the television and asked if I wanted a
Mimosa
or a
Bellini ?  I chose
Bellini . "What have you been doing for the past year, Dick?" "Playing a lot of tennis.  Since I left
Lehman , I've had some time to really think about what I want to do next.  The next chapter in the
Story of Fuld ." "And what do you want to do next?" "I think... I just want to play tennis." I nodded and drank my
Bellini .  It was very nice - straight out of
Harry's Bar . We arrived at the club slightly smashed.  I won't go into details about the actual tennis match.  But I will say he destroyed me in three straight sets:  6-0, 6-0, 6-0.  There was only one game that I scored a point.  He hit the ball into the net on a serve that I managed to get in the lines.  I watched in semi-horror as he destroyed his racket over the net post and then threw the remains at my head.
"Fuck you, Khan!", he said. Good old, Dick.  He never changes.  I wish him well. Khan Manka, Jr.

Flud should be indicted by DOJ; there is a good chance that he and his cronies committed fraud.
