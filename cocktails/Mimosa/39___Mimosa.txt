Brachychiton rupestris
The
Queensland Bottle Tree
( Brachychiton rupestris ) originally classified in the family
Sterculiaceae , which is now within
Malvaceae , is native of
Queensland ,
Australia . Its grossly swollen trunk gives it a remarkable appearance and gives rise to the name. As a succulent, drought-deciduous tree, it is tolerant of a range of various soils, and temperatures.
It can grow to 18–20 meters (59–66 ft) in height and its trunk has the unique shape of a bottle. Its swollen trunk is primarily used for water storage. On every tree the leaves are variable from narrow and elliptic to deeply divided. Clusters of yellowy bell shaped flowers are hidden within the foliage, and are followed by woody boat-shaped fruits

Paraserianthes lophantha , commonly called  Albizia ,  Cape Leeuwin  Wattle  or  Crested Wattle , is a fast-growing tree that occurs naturally along the  southwest  coast of  Western Australia , from  Fremantle  to  King George Sound . [1]  It was first spread beyond southwest Australia by Baron  Ferdinand von Mueller , who gave packets of  P. lophantha  seeds to early explorers under the assumption that if they planted the seeds at their campsites, the trees would indicate the routes they travelled. [2]
It is considered a weed in Australia,  South Africa , the  Canary Islands , and  Chile .

Albizzia   Benth.
Albizia  is a  genus  of about 150  species  of mostly fast-growing  subtropical  and  tropical   trees  and  shrubs  in the subfamily  Mimosoideae of the  legume  family,  Fabaceae . The genus is  pantropical , occurring in  Asia ,  Africa ,  Madagascar ,  Central ,  South , and southern  North America  and  Australia , but mostly in the  Old World  tropics. Some species are considered  weedy .
Albizia amara  flowers in  Shamirpet , India .
They are commonly called  silk plant  or  sirises . Peculiarly, the obsolete form of spelling the generic name – with double ‘z’ – has stuck, so that another commonly used term is  albizzias (though the form  albizias  is also found, particularly in species that are not widely known under a common name). The generic name refers to the  Italian  nobleman Filippo degli  Albizzi , who in the mid-18th century introduced siris to  Europe .
These are usually small trees or shrubs with a short lifespan – though the famous  Samán  del Guère  near  Maracay  in  Venezuela  is a huge  Albizia saman  specimen and several hundred years old. The  leaves  are  pinnately  or bipinnately compound. Their small  flowers  are in bundles, with showy  stamens  much longer than the  petals . Confusingly, some species are given the name “mimosa” which correctly belongs to species in the related genus  Mimosa . Unlike those of  Mimosa ,  Albizia  flowers have much more than 10 stamens.  Albizia  can also be told apart from another large related genus,  Acacia , since its flowers have their stamens joined at the base whereas in  Acacia  stamens are free (separated). [1]
Persian Silk Tree or Pink Siris ( Albizia julibrissin ) extends well north into  temperate  regions in  East Asia  and is by far the cold-hardiest species. It tolerates temperatures down to about −30 °C (−22 °F), provided it gets adequate summer heat to ripen the shoots. In  North America  it is commonly grown as an  ornamental tree , but has become  naturalized  in several US  states, and is regarded as an  invasive species .
Albizia  species are used as food plants by the  larvae  of some  moths  of the genus  Endoclita  inclulding  E. damor ,  E. malabaricus  and  E. sericeus .

Albizia procera  pods at Jayanti  in  Buxa Tiger Reserve , India .
Numerous species placed in  Albizia  by early authors were eventually moved to other genera, most notably  Archidendron . Other genera of  Ingeae  ( Abarema ,  Archidendropsis , Balizia [ disambiguation needed ] ,  Blanchetiodendron ,  Calliandra ,  Cathormion ,  Enterolobium ,  Havardia , Hesperalbizia ,  Hydrochorea ,  Pararchidendron ,  Paraserianthes ,  Pseudosamanea  and  Serianthes ) have also received their share of supposed  Albizia  species, as have the  Mimoseae   Newtonia  and Schleinitzia , and  Acacia [ verification needed ]  from the  Acacieae . Some presumed “silk trees” are in fact misidentified members of the not very closely related  Erythrophleum  from the  Caesalpinioideae  and the  Faboideae   Lebeckia . [2]
The delimitation of  Falcataria  and  Pithecellobium , close relatives of  Albizia , is notoriously complex, with species having been moved between the genera time and again, and probably will continue to do so. These include for example  Falcataria moluccana  ( Moluccan Albizia , formerly  Albizia moluccana ), a common shade tree on  tea  plantations. Other closely related genera like  Chloroleucon  and  Samanea  are often merged with Albizia  entirely. [2]
[ edit ]Invasive Species
Molucca albizia ( Falcataria moluccana ) and Chinese albizia ( Albizia chinensis ) are considered invasive species in Hawaii and on many Pacific Islands. [3]  The tree grows very rapidly and can quickly colonize disturbed areas in wet environments. The tree is prone to shedding large branches, which have been responsible for damaging power lines, houses, and other infrastructure in Hawaii.

Mimosa or Silk Tree
Posted on
October 22, 2011
by
ladymaggic
http://www.uah.edu/admin/Fac/grounds/MIMOSA.HTM
Albizzia julibrissin – Mimosa or Silk Tree
Family – Leguminosae
Size  –  25 to 30 feet in height, spread at least equal to or greater than height. Broad spreading with a rounded, mushroomed crown. Growth rate is fast, 3 feet or more per year is not unusual.
Foliage  –  Alternate, bipinnately compound, up to 20″ long with numerous pinnae, each having 40 to 60 small leaflets. Very fine textured and tropical in appearance.
Flower  –  Flowers are unusually attractive and slightly fragrant. They have numerous fiber optics like, 1″ to 1 1/2″ long stamens that merge from white to a violet-pink that make the flower appear brush-like. Flowering is profuse in late May and June and occurs sporadically on various trees throughout July and August.
Pests and Diseases –  A vascular wilt disease has been particularly destructive on many Mimosa throughout the south. This usually ends up killing the tree to the ground and then it resprouts back with numerous suckers. I have seen many trees killed by this disease, while others seem to persist on unaffected.
Landscape Use –  Not a whole lot due to potential disease problems. In the south one shouldn’t have to plant Mimosa, just create a ‘waste area’ in your yard as they seed prolifically and should colonize it in a short time. People have a affinity for this tree..
At Lawn Hill Station the property surrounding the homestead is lined with these huge shady trees that look very beautiful.
Birds love the nectar in the flowers, and honey eaters are always there among the blossoms in Spring.
Performance – 2  It does have a attractive flower and fairly nice foliage, but it just doesn’t have a whole lot of potential for the long term. Hardy in to zone 6, but will likely be killed back or damaged during winters north of this zone.
….but here in North Queensland, the tree grows well, tall, hardy and sturdy.

Notes
A
tree
of widespread distribution in northern Australia, found fringing seasonally dry watercourses, swamps, lakes and low-lying areas subject to temporary inundation. It occurs east from the Ord River in the Kimberley region of Western Australia through the Northern Territory north from about Newcastle Waters and including the Barkley Tableland (but see below), to the Roper River and Macarthur River, extending into the Gulf country of Queensland as far east as western Cape York and as far south as near Mount Isa and Chillagoe. Eucalyptus microtheca
usually has rough
bark
over the whole trunk extending to the branches and a
crown
of dull green, grey-green or sometimes
glaucous
leaves and small fragile
fruit
with
valves
at
rim
level when dehisced.
Eucalyptus microtheca  is most closely related to the widespread
E. coolabah
which is found in similar but drier habitats to the south and south-east, and to
E. victrix
which occurs in still drier habitats from central Australia west to the Pilbara.
E. coolabah
has rough
bark
on part or all of the trunk, having whitish smooth
bark
on the branches, and has conspicuously exserted
valves
in the otherwise shallower hemispherical- obconical   fruit .
E. victrix
has smooth
powdery
white
bark
and similar
fruit
to
E. microtheca
with
valves
at
rim
level or slightly exserted. It is also closely related to
E. tectifica,
both
species
having rough
bark
to the small branches.
E. tectifica
and
E. microtheca
are separated by the shape and dimensions of their
juvenile
leaves,
E. microtheca
usually being narrowly
lanceolate
and
E. tectifica
normally
ovate
to broadly
lanceolate . The
fruit
of
E. tectifica
also tend to be slightly wider than those of
E. microtheca
but some overlap in dimensions does occur. Another closely related member of this group is
E. acroleuca
from Cape York Peninsula. It differs by having basal rough
bark
with a fairly regular “cut-off” about halfway up the trunk and conspicuous smooth
bark
on the upper trunk and branches, and very small
fruit
(0.2–0.3 cm wide only) with enclosed
valves .
Several localized forms of
species
in this group have been described –
E. cyanoclada,
a blue-leaved more or less
glaucous
form occurring around Lake Woods and Newcastle Waters in the Northern Territory;
E. barklyensis
with smooth smaller branches, thicker leaves and more spreading form than
E. microtheca,
restricted to the Barkly Tableland in the Northern Territory; and
E.
helenae,
described from the south-western Barkly Tableland, differing in having marginally larger
fruit
with flared top a broader
disc , smooth branches and thicker and sometimes wider leaves than
E. microtheca.
In EUCLID we take a broader view of
E. microtheca,
including
E. cyanoclada, E. barklyensis,
E. helenae
within it. The taxonomy of the group is complicated by
E. microtheca, E. coolabah
and
E. victrix
having adjoining distributions and showing intergradation in form. To make reliable identification collectors will need to note the extent of rough
bark
and ensure collection of mature
fruit .
Eucalyptus microtheca
and related
species
flower
in late spring and early summer, quickly ripen their
fruit
and shed
seed
over the following few months. The
fruit
are on slender
pedicels
and
peduncles
and are soon lost from the trees. Even with mature
fruit
and the most careful observation of
bark
and leaves there will still be many individuals, especially on the Barkly Tableland, that don’t fit neatly into any particular coolibah
species . Populations of coolibahs may contain individuals all of which display distally contracted
fruit
(like
E. microtheca,
E. barklyensis
and
E. helenae ) but which vary in bark persistence, from having some scrappy basal rough
bark
with the upper trunk and branches being smooth-barked, to being fully rough-barked to the smaller branches, and with all possibilities in between. Because of the variability in bark persistence and the seeming consistency of “ microtheca- like” fruit shape we have chosen to synonymize
E. barklyensis
and
E. helenae
with
E. microtheca
rather than
E. coolabah.
However it would not surprise us if there were coolibah trees in this area that matched
E. coolabah
in
fruit
shape just to complicate the picture.
Eucalyptus microtheca  belongs in
Eucalyptus
subgenus
Symphyomyrtus
section
Adnataria
(the boxes) because the
buds
have two
opercula ,
ovules
are in four rows,
seeds
are flattened- ovoid ,
cotyledons
are
reniform , and
anthers
are rigid on the
staminal
filaments . Within
section
Adnataria, E. microtheca
is part of a subgroup of box
species
with mostly tropical distribution,
series
Aquilonares
subseries
Protrusae,
having
inflorescences
terminal
on the
branchlets ,
adult
leaves very densely
reticulate
and
fruit
that are small, fragile and have exserted
valves .

Flowering Time
Flowering has been recorded in September, November, December and January.

Pith of the Eucalyptus and Brief History
Posted on
October 10, 2011
by
ladymaggic
Pith
http://www.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/cd-keys/euclid3/euclidsample/html/learn.htm#introduction
Once a specimen has been taken, a very handy and accessible feature is the pith of the branchlets. In the southern half of the country about half of the dry country mallees have a line of clear-coloured or
brown oil glands in the pith
usually visible to the naked eye, while the remaining species have a
white or uniformly coloured, undifferentiated pith . This character is easily assessed in the field by
pulling a side branchlet away
from the main axis. Pith glands, if present, will be most conspicuous at the nodes so this is where the character should be sought for its presence or absence. The developmental origin of these discrete rounded pith glands is unknown.
Pith gland absence or presence is a character of moderately high, not absolute, reliability and is a particularly useful character to help identify South Australian and southern Western Australian species.
This, however, is not true in all areas of the country. Many, perhaps all, species of
Corymbia
(bloodwoods and ghost gums) and
Angophora
have obvious short or elongated duct-like spaces in the pith of the branchlets. These are not as easily seen in the field as the discrete round pith glands but can be seen with a 10X lens, especially at or near the leaf bases. These ducts may be filled with a sticky brown substance (?oil or resin) or the contents may be crystalline but they are not round pith oil glands as described above. Only one species of ghost gum,
C. kombolgiensis
has been observed with discrete round brown pith oil glands. In EUCLID we have scored this character when we have seen it in
Corymbia
and
Angophora
species, however when identifying these species it should be used with caution or avoided.
^ TOP
A brief history of
Eucalyptus ,
Angophora
and
Corymbia
Although eucalypts must have been seen by the very early European explorers and collectors, no botanical collections of them are known to have been made until 1770 when Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander arrived at Botany Bay with James Cook. There they collected specimens of
C. gummifera
and later, near the Endeavour River in northern Queensland, they collected
E. platyphylla ; neither of these species was named as such at the time.
In 1777, on Cook’s third expedition, the botanist David Nelson collected a eucalypt on Bruny Island, southern Tasmania. This specimen was taken to the British Museum in London, where it was named
Eucalyptus obliqua
by the French botanist, Charles-Louis L’Héritier de Brutelle, who was working in London at the time. He coined the generic name from the Greek roots
eu
and
calyptos , meaning ‘well’ and ‘covered’, in reference to the operculum of the flower bud. This organ protects the reproductive structures during their development and sheds under pressure from the emerging stamens at flowering. The name
obliqua
was derived from the Latin,
obliquus , meaning ‘oblique’, describing a leaf base where the two sides of the leaf blade are of unequal length and do not meet the petiole at the same point.
In the publication of
Eucalyptus obliqua , L’Héritier recognized in the generic name a feature common to all eucalypts – the operculum. In his choice of specific name, he recognized not only a characteristic feature of
E. obliqua
but one that occurs in most other eucalypts as well.
E. obliqua
was published in 1788 and coincides with the date of the first official settlement of Australia.
Between 1788 and the beginning of the nineteenth century several more species of
Eucalyptus
were named and published. Most of these were by the English botanist James Edward Smith and most were, as might be expected, trees of the Sydney region. They include the economically valuable
E. pilularis ,
E. saligna
and
E. tereticornis , each of which also occurs in Queensland, with the distribution of
E. tereticornis
extending to the island of New Guinea.
Also in this period the genus
Angophora
was published, in 1797, by the Spanish botanist Antonio Jose Cavanilles, based on specimens collected at Port Jackson by Frenchman Luis Née in 1793. Née was botanist with the Alejandro Malaspina expedition. Various authors have considered
Angophora
to be sufficiently distinctive that it should be maintained as a separate genus. Others believe it is a ‘eucalypt’. We recognize both
Eucalyptus
and
Angophora
in EUCLID, reflecting results of recent research and usage by the general community.
The nineteenth century was a period of extensive land exploration. This resulted in the discovery of many new eucalypts and their subsequent naming by several of the great botanists in Australian history, particularly Ferdinand von Mueller, whose work on eucalypts contributed greatly to the first comprehensive account of the genus in George Bentham’s
Flora Australiensis
(1867). Bentham never visited Australia, but his account is the most important early systematic treatment of the genus
Eucalyptus .
Some earlier authors had constructed classifications, but the distinctions they used – for example, shape of the operculum and the juvenile leaf arrangement – were only applicable to far fewer species than were known to Bentham; they were of little use when applied to a much larger number of species. One useful study before that of Bentham, however, was Mueller’s description of different bark types (Mueller, 1858). These still have relevance in distinguishing between, for example, groups that shed or retain dead bark and, in the latter case, between ironbark and other types of rough bark.
Bentham divided the genus into five series whose distinctions were based on characteristics of the stamens, particularly the anthers. Categories within each series were based largely on the leaves, and on bud and fruit shape. He was obviously working with limited botanical specimens, and field characters were not available to him unless communicated by others from Australia.
Mueller, working in Australia, devised another classification based on the anthers (Mueller, 1879-84), while Joseph Henry Maiden (1924) elaborated on the anther system, which was taken even further by William Faris Blakely (1934). By this time, classification based on the anther system had become too complex to be workable.
Other more consistent characters have been sought in recent years to aid in the construction of classifications. Of these, leaf venation, the nature of bristle glands, the morphology of the seeds, nature of the operculum and the structure of the inflorescence are fundamental. More sophisticated equipment has usually enabled the examination of these leaf and floral structures early in and during their development. Similarities thus recognised usually provide the evidence of natural affinity between species and groups of species. In other words, botanists became better equipped to decide whether these similarities noticed in different species and groups were the results of inheritance from a common ancestor or if they had independently evolved, in many cases as an adaptive necessity such as lignotuber formation or salt tolerance.
A comprehensive but informal classification of all known eucalypt species was published in 1971 by the late L.D. Pryor and L.A.S. Johnson. It comprised seven major groups based on the association of many morphological characters and suggested by the breeding incompatibility between them. Their system has been subjected to close scrutiny in the past 30 years. Many improvements to this classification were proposed by Johnson himself and by others, although he never formally published a system of classification.
Briggs and Johnson (1979) contributed a major advance in the botany of the whole family Myrtaceae, in which they outlined for the first time a comprehensive analysis of inflorescence structure in all genera and its indication of evolutionary trend.
In Volume 19 of the ‘Flora of Australia’, all eucalypts published to 1988, were comprehensively treated (Chippendale, 1988). This work includes 513 species of
Eucalyptus
arranged in 92 series, many of which were published formally in this volume. This is not a structured classification as there are no subgenera or sections. The work is of particular value for its typology and erection of many new taxonomic series.
The decade after 1988 saw the application of advanced methodology in the study of the genus
Eucalyptus , especially in phylogenetic analyses of taxonomic series (e.g. Ladiges
et al ., 1987; Hill and Johnson, 1995) and in the use of molecular techniques in the estimation of infra-generic relationships within the genus and between cognate genera (Ladiges
et al ., 1995; Ladiges and Udovicic, 2000).
Most notably in 1995 K.D. Hill & L.A.S. Johnson published a monograph on the bloodwoods and ghost gums in which they described the genus
Corymbia,
with species grouped in seven sections which intentionally follow from the earlier work of Pryor & Johnson (1971). This grouping at section, and at series and subseries rank is, according to the authors, intentionally informal, i.e. outside the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Hill & Johnson, 1995, p. 186)
In 2000, M.I.H. Brooker published a formal classification of the genus, which is a synthesis in the form of an updated taxonomy to accommodate the numerous taxa published since Chippendale’s 1988 treatment. While based conceptually on the work of Pryor & Johnson, it recognizes one genus,
Eucalyptus
and includes
Angophora
and
Corymbia
as 2 of a total of 13 subgenera, and assigns all species known to the year 2000 to a heirarchical system of subgenera, sections, subsections, series, subseries and supraspecies (Brooker 2000).
The 5 years following Brooker’s 2000 classification has seen further systematic and phylogenetic investigations of the eucalypts. Increasingly, molecular data are incorporated into studies of the relationships between the subgenera recognised by Brooker, and this is reflected in ongoing refinements to eucalypt systematics. The various concepts proposed from those studies are discussed in the accompanying section “ Evolutionary Relationships in
Eucalyptus sens. lat. ”.
^ TOP
Evolutionary Relationships in
Eucalyptus sens. lat.
Hybrids
Whilst hybridism has been frequently reported between species in
Corymbia,
and also between species from within the same subgenus of
Eucalyptus,
rarely are hybrids between species from different subgenera of
Eucalyptus
seen in the field. An example of the latter is hybrids between
E. cloeziana
(subgenus
Idiogenes ) and
E. acmenoides
(subgenus
Eucalyptus ) (see Stokoe
et al. , 2001). Manipulated hybrids between species from different subgenera have never been successful.
Hybridism requires genetic compatibility and synchronous flowering times (unless manipulated). Hybrids between species within a subgenus are rare in natural forests or scrubs. They are more likely to be seen as regrowth trees or mallees in disturbed areas where changed environmental conditions may be more amenable to the success of the hybrid combination. Hybrids in stands appear to be selected against in favour of the parent species.
Many reported hybrids are better interpreted as natural intergrades between closely related species. e.g.
E. burgessiana
and
E. stricta
in eastern New South Wales,
E. dalrympleana
subsp . dalrympleana
and
E. viminalis
subsp . viminalis
in Tasmania,
E. angulosa
and
E. incrassata
in coastal South Australia and Western Australia,
E. brownii
and
E. populnea
in Queensland.
Hybrids can complicate the identification of specimens and there are a couple of ways of investigating more closely whether the problem specimen is a hybrid. Firstly, close observation of the features of eucalypts in the stand where you collect the specimen may indicate that some trees appear intermediate in some features such as bark type or crown colour. Secondly if there is seed on your specimen you may be able to raise a moderately large number of seedlings (say 10-20) and look for gross variation in seedling leaf shape and other characteristics, and compare these with similarly grown seedlings raised from individuals of the purported parents. This is of course a lengthy business but can give good information.
There are a few well-known formally named hybrids where both parents have been identified and are seen in the field, e.g.
E. brachyphylla
( E. kruseana
×
E. loxophleba
subsp.
lissophloia )
E. erythrandra
( E. incrassata
or
E. angulosa
×
E. tetraptera )
E. missilis
( E. cornuta
×
E. angulosa )
and possibly
E. balanites
( E. lanepoolei
×
E. decipiens ).
In another example,
E. annuliformis , only one parent is evident,
E. drummondii , the other being a mystery.
Many presumed hybrids have been formally named by botanists of the eucalypts over the last 200 years. The most recent annotated list of many of these names can be found in Chippendale (1988, pp. 428–442). Hill & Johnson (1995) list, in an appendix, hybrids and intergrades they have observed in
Corymbia.

One useful feature that is not immediately available in the field is the seeds. Until the vascular connections between the individual fruits held in the crown and the parent tree are broken, the valves will not open. Otherwise, eucalypt fruit are held on the branchlets often for years. Seed from detached fruits, however, can be ready for inspection after about 24 hours by placing unopened fruits in a paper bag where they dry out quickly and shed
the seeds and the thinner chaff particles . There is a great number of seed forms and these can be seen either with the naked eye or with a lens. Fortunately, related species have identical seeds and the character is therefore one of high reliability. Because words do not adequately convey the actual seed shape for most species, experience is needed to educate the user who will ultimately find the seeds to be an invaluable aid in discriminating species and groups of related species. We suggest the following terms as a guide.
Flattened or saucer-shaped
The seed is somewhat flattened with a distinct upper (dorsal) and lower (ventral) side. The ventral side may be somewhat concave, with the hilum in the centre.
Angophora
and the ghost gums have this type of seed.
Pyramidal or obliquely pyramidal
The seed is pyramid shaped with a relatively smooth or lacunose, flat or rounded dorsal side. The ventral side is usually ribbed, wrinkled or angled and is surmounted by a narrowed face at the summit where the hilum is (e.g.
E. acmenoides ). This is the seed type in most of the monocalypts although there is a great amount of variety in their seed form. Perhaps the most extreme seed shape in the monocalypts is seen in some western endemics, e.g.
E. buprestium
and
E. todtiana , in which the body of the seed is small in comparison to the grossly extended curved lateral wings.
Boat-shaped
The seed is elongated and strongly keeled dorsally with a large, conspicuous hilum in the middle of the flat underside. The edges may be flanged or narrowly winged.
C. gummifera
and
C. calophylla
notably have this type of seed.
Cuboid
The seed is chunky, often with a smooth, shiny or somewhat granular, sometimes slightly rounded, dorsal side. The hilum is situated on a smaller terminal face separated from the dorsal side by the side walls of the seed. These walls are often angular. The chaff is usually similar to the seed, but somewhat smaller and lighter coloured (e.g.
E. seeana ).
Ellipsoidal with terminal wing
The flattened-ellipsoidal body of the seed occurs at the lower end (considering the disposition of the ovule on the placenta in the intact bud), with a transparent wing as long as the body of the seed at the top end. The wings may be seen, just before seed shed, emerging from the top of the ovary. The hilum is usually positioned near one edge not far from the start of the wing. The wing is purely a descriptive morphological term and the structure has no apparent aerial function. Most of the bloodwoods have this type of seed (e.g.
C. chippendalei ).
Pointed at one end
The seed is somewhat flattened, usually rounded at one end and pointed at the other. It may be described as teardrop-shaped (e.g.
E. conica ).
D-shaped
The seed is roughly disc-like with a short straight side and a longer connecting curved side. The hilum is towards the narrowed end (e.g.
E. porosa ).
Spherical
The seed is more or less spherical (e.g.
E. desmondensis ).
Ovoid or depressed-ovoid
The seed is ovoid or elliptical in outline but flattened with the hilum on the more or less concave ventral side (e.g.
E. aggregata ). A large number of species have this type of seed. Examples are the section
Maidenaria , endemic to eastern Australia, in which the dorsal surface is often lacunose, and a large number of mallees occurring across southern Australia. These seeds have very smooth dorsal sides with two or three shallow longitudinal grooves. This is seen particularly in series
Subulatae
and
Calycogonae .
Obliquely elongated
The seed is like a narrowly drawn-out pyramid with the dorsal face curved and prolonged into a thin ‘tongue’. The terminal face is small, flat and oblique on the seed with the hilum in the middle. The sides are ridged (e.g.
E. burracoppinensis ).
Linear
