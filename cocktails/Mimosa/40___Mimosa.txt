The Rosidae
Family Overview - The
Fabales
Mimosaceae - the Mimosa Family
Diversity:   The
Mimosaceae
includes about 80 genera with ca. 3,200 species, both herbaceous and -
mostly - woody.  See
tribal classification .
Distribution:
Worldwide,
but mostly tropical and subtropical with a focus on dry regions, as
indicated
by the large and typical Genus
Acacia .
We have 12 genera and 59 species in
Texas
including the 'mimosa tree' ( Albizia )
that grows on campus and sometimes escapes cultivation, mesquite ( Prosopis ),
plus 'sensitive' herbs (leaves move when touched) of the genera
Mimosa
and
Schrankia .
Floral structure:
Significant features:
Leaves of this family tend to be
bipinnately
compound .
While the
actinomorphic flowers
are
distinctive relative to other beans, they are usually quite
small.
The most distinctive floral feature of the
Mimosaceae
is the
inflorescence,
which is usually a spherical head of these small, regular flowers with
the stamens well exserted from the (often) sympetalous corolla and the
filaments taking on an attractive function.

The local mesquite ( Prosopis glandulosa
-
below )
shows bipinnate leaves but only 1 or rarely two pairs of pinna
(compounded
leaflets) - and a linear (non-spherical) inflorescence - this species,
according to Correll and Johnston is "probably the commonest 'legume'
in
Texas" and, given habitat destruction in the state and concurrent
invasive
advance of this species from the South, this statement is supported as
time passes.
