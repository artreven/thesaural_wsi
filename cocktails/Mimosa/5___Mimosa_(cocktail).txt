Easter Cocktails
Easter means brunch and brunch means drinking before noon.
Count me in. A friend of mine hosted a merry Easter Brunch and egg hunt (we're young at heart) for about a dozen people.
I arrived with a load of ingredients and set up a makeshift bar, prepared to mix a small menu of drinks.
Aside from the mandatory and exceptional
Mimosa , I was offering a few additional stiffer options.
Overall, it was a great success. Chambord & Tonic 1.5 oz Chambord vodka 3 oz tonic water 3 dashes rhubarb bitters Build in a tall glass on ice. Chambord vodka is one of the classier flavored vodkas you'll find, and bearing the name Chambord certainly adds to its pedigree.
The slightly sweet vodka went great with the bitterness of the tonic water and the added sourness from the bitters.
This is a great refreshing drink for a hot day. Rum Alexander 1.5 oz gold rum .5 oz coffee syrup 1 oz cream Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a cocktail glass. I'm at it with the
Alexander
again, which is a great drink for parties due to its simplicity and crowd-pleasing character... a cream and coffee cocktail just seemed like it belonged at a brunch.
The coffee wasn't as prominent in the cocktail as I'd have liked, but instead the light coffee flavor only slightly accented the great Flor de Caña Gold that we used.
