A-10 Refueling From a KC-97L
Two Fairchild Republic A-10As refuel with a Boeing KC-97L Stratotanker (S/N 53-355) of the Texas Air National Guard. (U.S. Air Force photo) Click image to enlarge.
In this picture a pair of
Fairchild A-10A s are being refueled by a
KC-97L . I am unaware of the exact date of this picture, but the A-10 first flew on 10 May 1972 and the KC-97 was retired in 1978 so the picture must have been taken somewhere in that window.
The
Strategic Air Command
took delivery of its first KC-97 on 14 July 1951. The main production version of the KC-97 was the KC-97G of which 592 were built. By 1958 SAC operated 780 KC-97s, but the 1957 introduction of the KC-135 meant that the -97s days were numbered. The piston powered KC-97 was too slow for the new generation of fighters and too small for the newly introduced B-52.  The
KC-135
was an all new design that was more than fast enough to keep up with the fighters and had sufficient offload to support the
B-52 . In 1958 SAC began to decommission its KC-97 fleet.
In April of 1961 the Air National Guard received its first KC-97 from SAC. The mission of the KC-97 under the guard was to refuel the
Tactical Air Command’s
fighters. During refueling with fighters the KC-97 was required to fly as fast as possible while its receiver flew on the edge of a stall. Often times the refueling had to be conducted in a shallow dive (toboggan) so that the tanker could maintain a minimum speed required by the fighter. Surplus
General Electric J47
jet engines were available from decommissioned KB-50 tankers and they were added under the wings of the KC-97E/Fs. The upgraded aircraft was redesigned the KC-97L. Each J47 produced 5,800 lbs of thrust which drastically increased the performance of the KC-97 and gave it enough extra speed to keep up with fighters of the day.
Just as the KC-97 was too slow for fighters of the day, the KC-135 was too fast for the A-10. Refueling between a heavily laden A-10 and KC-135 produced a situation where the A-10 did not have enough thrust to fly at the KC-135’s minimum flying speed. When refueling A-10s, the KC-135 was limited to a maximum gross weight of 250,000 lbs and even then it was often required to lower its flaps to 20º or 30º. The KC-97L and A-10 were a perfect match due to their similar flying speeds.

I was a refueling operator on the KB-50J. From 1960 to 1965 at Biggs AFB Tex. I enjoyed your site. I will be back

Neat photo.
Actually the two probably paired up pretty good.
Drug some home from the UK once, started off dropping flaps, hitting speed brakes, etc for the first refuel just to slow dopwn and stay in the
air and the A-10 was “screaming” to keep up.
Spent 14 actual hours of over the Atlantic with a stop at the Azores for the night, on what should have been about a 8-9 hours flight from Fairford to Altus OK…

A question for the KC-97 folks?
Was it normal to feather a engine during the AR?
I know the A-10’s were slow…..In the picture, it shows the #3 prop feathered…I think…..

I just returned from a San Diego quick Va-Ca too take In the USS MIDWAY before It closed down for seven months of renovations. If you haven’t herd San Diego bought the Big Kiss from New York of Maryln Monroe and there putting it there. On my voyage there on I-215 I came across March A.F.B Air Field Museum. While taking the tour saw my fathers old K-97 that he was boom operator of. It was Awesome to see that there. My pops was in from 1948 thru 1976 In the Fuel Maintenance Squadron his entire career till E-8 retirement. They even have a SR-71 BLACKBIRD In hanger there that could be airborne In 40 hrs notice.! A retired clerk
there on staff turn me on to your Web Page keep up the great work your Involved In doing. Thank You D

I was stationed in Iceland from Feb 77 to March 78.
We sat Air Defense alert there in the mighty F-4C.
We launched from alert one day in fall 77 with directions to look for a KC-97 that was tanking for a four ship of A-10 from Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ, to “Europe”, (yes, the boneyard).
The A-10s were not yet based at Bentwaters.
This was to be their first deployment to evaluate the A-10 in the European environment.
One of the A-10s was single engine due to a malfunction in one of the engine modules for the TF-34 engine, as we learned later.
They (KC-97 and A-10) were at about 10,000 feet and had no idea of exactly where they were because the had no TACAN lockon and were not visible on ground (GCI) radar. The ground radar and the TACAN were not that far apart so it was simply a line of sight issue.
We found them – did I mention that it was a murky day – and were closing.
I commented to my AC that we still had 150 knots of overtake at a mile and a half so out came the speed brakes and then the flaps.
Mr. Haberichter’s comment above was completely correct – those two aircraft were meant for each other.
Unfortunately the KC-97 was retired in 1978 while the A-10 is still a going concern.
No photos from that launch, unfortunately, although I do have an excellent shot of an F-4C formatting with a Bear D at sunset.

Access my entire collection from the Skydrive link below:
I have amassed a very large collection (over 1,000) of air to air refueling pictures and want to share them on this website. My collection includes many rare pictures (ever see an
A-10 refuel from a KC-97 ?) of over 120 different receiver types. Whenever possible I will try to provide a link to the source(s), but I have been collecting the pictures for years on my hard drive and it may be very difficult to track down the original source.
If you find any errors on this site or have additional information about the topic please let me know and I will update the page.
Every great picture has a great story to go along. I have many great pictures, unfortunately I don’t have all of the stories. If anyone has additional information on any of the pictures featured on this site I would love for you to share your story. I am especially interested in documenting the old piston powered tankers, their stories are slowly fading away. This site is all about documenting the nitty-gritty details, so if the more specifics you have the better (quirks, ect…). Likewise, if anybody has unique air refueling pictures I would love to see them. You can send info to the address below:
Please use the comments section below the images as a place to discuss the picture and leave further information for others to read. Your discussion adds greatly to the historic value of this site and to the legacy of air refueling crew members.
Below is a brief list of things I am looking for, but any info is welcomed.
Photographs and information about
Boeing 747 tankers .
I would especially like pictures of the boom operator’s compartment, instruments, and panel. Please get in contact with me via the email address above if you have any information about the 747 tanker.
