The AGM-158 JASSM is a cruise missile developed in the United States.
Overview
The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) project was begun in 1995
after the cancellation of the AGM-137 TSSAM missile. The TSSAM had been
designed as a high precision stealthy missile for use at stand-off ranges,
but poor management of the project had resulted in costs rising to
unacceptable levels. Since the requirement for such weapons still existed,
the military was quick to announce a follow up project with similar goals.
Initial contracts for two competing designs were awarded to McDonnell
Douglas and Lockheed Martin in 1996, and the missile designations AGM-158A
and AGM-159A were allocated to the two weapons. Lockheed Martin's AGM-158A
won out and a further contract for development was granted in 1998.
The AGM-158A is powered by a Teledyne CAE J402 turbojet. Whilst carried the
wings are folded to reduce size, flipping out on launch. There is a single
vertical tail. Guidance is via inertial navigation with updating from a
global positioning system. Target recognition and terminal homing is via an
imaging infrared seeker. A data link allows the missile to transmit its
location and status during flight, allowing improved bomb damage
assessment. Accuracy is extremely good, with a CEP reported at 2.4 metres
(8 feet). The warhead is a WDU-42/B 450 kg (1000 lb) penetrator.
In 1999 powered flight tests of the missile began. These were successful,
and production of the JASSM began in December 2001. The weapon began
operational testing and evaluation in 2002. Late that year two of the units
failed tests, both due to warhead failures, and the project was delayed for
three months before completing development in April 2003. Two more launches
failed, this time as a result of launcher and engine problems.
The JASSM will be carried by a wide range of aircraft - the F-15E, F-16,
F/A-18, F-35, B-1B, B-2 and B-52 are all intended to carry the weapon.
Controversies
Finland planned to purchase JASSM missiles for the Finnish Air Force as
part of modernization plans of its F-18 Hornet fleet. In February 2007 the
United States declined to sell the missiles, while agreeing to proceed as
planned with other modernization efforts (the so-called Mid-Life Update 2,
or MLU2). This episode led to speculation in the Finnish media on the state
of Finnish - American diplomatic relations. [1]
Operators
     The United States Air Force plans to acquire up to 3700 AGM-158
      missiles.
     The United States Navy originally planned to acquire 450 AGM-158
      missiles but pulled out of the program in favor of employing the
      proven SLAM-ER.[2] The "Joint" part of the name of the missile is
      therefore something of a misnomer.
     On 28 Feb 2006, The Australian government announced the selection of
      the Lockheed Martin JASSM to equip the Royal Australian Air Force's
      F/A-18 Hornet fighters.[3]
Improvements
The Air Force is studying various improvements to the AGM-158. Mooted
improvements include a submunition dispenser warhead, new types of homing
head, and a new engine giving ranges in excess of 1,000 km (600 mi).
The JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) received the designation AGM-158B in
2002. Using a more efficient engine and larger fuel volume in an airframe
with the same external dimensions as the JASSM, the JASSM-ER is intended to
have a range of over 500 nautical miles (925 km) as compared to the JASSM's
range of about 200 nautical miles. The first flight test of the JASSM-ER
occurred on May 18, 2006 when a missile was launched from a U.S. Air Force
B-1B bomber at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. As of 2006,
JASSM-ER was scheduled for introduction into the operational inventory in
2009.
