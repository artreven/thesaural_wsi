Glasgow Prestwick International Airport
( IATA :
PIK ,  ICAO :
EGPK ) is situated north of the
town of
Prestwick
in
South Ayrshire ,
Scotland .
Although officially called
Glasgow
Prestwick International
Airport
because the city of
Glasgow
is 46 km (29 miles) north-east of the airport,
most people, particularly locals, refer to it simply as
Prestwick
Airport . According to the airport's new marketing slogan, it's
"Pure Dead Brilliant".
In
physical terms, Prestwick is Scotland's largest commercial airfield,
although in passenger traffic terms it sits in fourth place after Glasgow's
main airport,
Glasgow International ,
Edinburgh Airport , and
Aberdeen Airport
all of which are operated by
BAA .

Main article:
History of Iceland
Iceland
was one of the last large islands uninhabited by humans until it was discovered
and settled by
immigrants
from
Scandinavia
and
Ireland
during the 9th and 10th centuries.
[3]
Íslendingabók
( Latin :
Libellus Islandorum ;
English :
The Book of Icelanders ), written in 1122–33, claims that
Norwegian
Ingólfur Arnarson
was the first man to settle in
Iceland, in 870. The families were accompanied by servants and slaves, some of
whom were
Celts
or
Picts
from
Scotland
and
Ireland
(known as
Westmen
to the
Norse ).
Some literary evidence suggests that
Papar
(Irish monks)
may have been living in Iceland before the arrival of Norse settlers, but no
archaeological evidence has been found.
Erik the
Red , or Eiríkur rauði, was exiled from Iceland for
manslaughter
in 980, and set sail to explore the lands to the west. He established the first
settlements in
Greenland
around this time, naming the land, according to
legend, to attract settlers. Eirikur's son,
Leif
Ericson
(Leifur Eiríksson), finally set foot in the Americas around the
year
1000 . While
some say he was blown off-course, it is most likely that he was deliberately
seeking the land spotted by
Bjarni Herjólfsson
several years earlier. He is
believed to have established a colony at
L'Anse aux Meadows ,
Newfoundland
in what became
Canada ,
which lasted only a few years. Despite the short stay, a sizable colony with at
least eight buildings including a
forge
and various
workshops
was
built. Two further attempts at colonization by his brother ended in failure.
The
Alþingi
( English :
Althing ,
literally
all- thing
(Þing in icelandic means parliament)
or
general assembly) was founded in 930, marking the beginning of the
Icelandic Commonwealth . It was the
predecessor to the modern Icelandic legislature. The Althing is the oldest
still-standing, parliament in the world that has written documents to prove its
age.
Iceland
was a free state without a king, until the end of the
Sturlungaöld
civil war in 1262, when it established a
personal
union
with the
Norwegian king
with
Gamli sáttmáli
( English :
The Old Covenant ). From 1387 on, Iceland was in practice ruled by
Denmark ,
following the union of the two kingdoms. When that union was dissolved in 1814,
through the
Treaty of Kiel , which saw Norway entering a union
with
Sweden ,
Iceland was transferred from the Norwegian throne to the Danish king, and thus
became a dominion (or
colony ) of Denmark.
[3]
Home rule
was granted by the Danish government in 1904,
and independence followed in 1918.
[3]
From 1918 on, Iceland was in a personal union
with the Danish king, with foreign relations being carried out by the king, as
instructed by the Icelandic government until the
World War
II
military occupation of Denmark by
Nazi
Germany
in 1940. Subsequently, Iceland was occupied by the
Allies . The
Danish King
remained the
de jure
sovereign of the nation until 1944, when the current
republic
was
founded after the 1918 treaty had lapsed.
The
new republic became a charter member of
NATO
in 1949 and signed
a treaty with the
United States
in 1951 to take responsibility for the
defense of Iceland. In September
2006 , the U.S. withdrew the
Iceland Defense Force
from the base in
Keflavík
[4] .
The U.S. has, however, pledged to keep defending Iceland with mobile forces
deployed abroad. This has, nonetheless, resulted in a considerable build up and
renovation in the
Icelandic Coast Guard , which has been
neglected since the last
Cod War
in
1976
and preparations to the forming of security reserve forces
under a new Security and Defence authority.
[5] [6] .
The
economy of Iceland remained dependent on fisheries in the post-war decades, and
the country has had several clashes with its neighbours over this vital
resource, most notably the
Cod Wars
with the
British .
The economy has become more diverse recently, owing to large investments in
heavy industry, such as
aluminium
smelting and deregulation and privatization in
the financial sector.
[7]
Iceland is a member of the
Common
market
of the
European Union
through the
EEA agreement
but has never applied for
membership of the EU itself.
[7]
The
Dettifoss
is a
waterfall
located in the
Mývatn
area of northeastern
Iceland . It is situated on the
Jökulsá á Fjöllum
river, which flows from the
Vatnajökull
glacier
and
collects water from a large area in north-east Iceland. It is reputed to be the
most powerful
waterfall in Europe , having a flow variously
estimated at between 200 and 500
cubic
metres
of water per second, depending on the season and the summer ice
melt. The falls are 100
m
wide and have a drop of 44 m down to the Jökulsárgljúfur
canyon. The composition 'Dettifoss' (Op.57) by Jón Leifs is inspired by this
waterfall

Gander
was chosen for
the construction of an
airbase
in 1935 due to its location close to the northeast
tip of the American continent. In 1936 construction of the base began and the
town started to develop. During the
Second
World War
as many as 10,000 people were settled around the airbase. Once
the war was over the air base became a civilian
airport
and the location of the town
was moved a safe distance from the runways. The present municipality was
incorporated in
1958 .
After the Second World War the town grew as the airport was used as a
refuelling stop for transatlantic flights, earning its name "Cross-roads
of the world" as that nearly all overseas flights had to stop before
crossing the Atlantic. Recently efforts have been made to diversify the economy
from being dependent on the airport, particularly as new aircraft designs have
permitted longer-range flights without the need for landing to refuel.
The importance of the Gander airport to world aviation was again recognized
in the immediate hours following the
September 11, 2001 attacks
when all of
North
America 's
airspace
was closed by
NORAD , and 39
trans-Atlantic flights bound for the United States were ordered to land at the
airport—more flights than any other Canadian airport other than
Halifax International . ( Vancouver International
received
the most passengers, at 8,500.) Over 6,600 passengers and airline crew members
unexpectedly found themselves forced to stay in the Gander area for up to three
days until airspace was reopened and flights resumed. Residents of Gander and
surrounding communities volunteered to house, feed, and entertain the
travellers in what became known as
Operation Yellow Ribbon . This was largely
because
Transport Canada
and
NAV CANADA
asked that trans-Atlantic flights avoid the major airports in central Canada,
like
Lester B. Pearson
in
Toronto and
Montréal-Dorval .
Subsequently,
Lufthansa
named one of its
Airbus A340
aircraft
Gander Halifax
to thank both cities for their handling of
rerouted travellers on 9/11. In addition, a book called "The Day The World
Came to Town" was published by Reagan Books and several stories and
segements about Gander's role during 9-11 have been featured on various
educational and news programs.
The Town of Gander continues to plays a very important role in aerospace
today, and to this extend Gander has retained an experienced United States
Representative to attract and retain valid business opportunities in the
aerospace industry.

Bangor International Airport is on the site of the
former Dow Air Force Base. Dow Air Force Base had aircraft operations as early
as 1946, with planes of varying sizes arriving and departing the airport. The
base was known for its 11,439 foot (3,487 m) runway and the
B-52
bombers that were
stationed there from 1960 until 1968, when the base closed and became Bangor
International Airport. The base still has its fair share of internationally
arriving fighter jets and military transport aircraft. The airfield does have a
regular fleet of
Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers
based at Bangor.
Some of the other military aircraft that regularly come to the airport are
McDonnell
Douglas
KC-10 Extender 's and
Boeing C-17 Globemasters .

RIVER VISUAL
Regarded as one of the most interesting approaches
in the U.S., the River Visual Approach was instituted due to safety and noise
abatement concerns. The approach, which follows the course of the Potomac
River, is only possible with a ceiling of at least 3500 feet and visibility of
3 miles or more. There is a light on the Memorial Bridge to aid pilots
following the river. Aircraft using River Visual are easily spotted from the
various parks on the left bank. Passengers on left side of an aircraft get a
fantastic view of downtown Washington. Such passengers can easily see
The Capitol , the
Washington Monument , the
Jefferson Memorial , the
National
Mall , and
The White House . Passengers on the right side get a
view of
Arlington National Cemetery ,
