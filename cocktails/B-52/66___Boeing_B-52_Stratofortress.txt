SBF Glossary: Jo. to J-2
( Click here for bottom )
Jo.
Joel,
Joseph , Joeline, Josephine, and
some other names.
Not
used for John ( Jno. ).
Except in the case of John the Baptist ( Jo.
Bapt. ).
.jo
(Domain code for)
Jo rdan.
jo
A sweetheart.
Specifically, a Scrabble ®
sweetheart.
The
kind of sweetheart that is cherished because it's a
two-letter word
that enables a ``player''
to discard a letter J that is no longer wanted.
It does sound rather
heartless, but it's accepted by
all three
major Scrabble dictionaries.
Interestingly, this kind of jo appears to be a concrete count noun without a
plural form (JOS is not accepted by any of the three major Scrabble
dictionaries).
Maybe it's a lonely instance of the vocative in English.
JOA
Joint Operating Agreement.
JOAD
Junior Olympic Archery Development.
``Our most important asset in archery, just as in life, is our youth.''
Tough
luck for me.
Joad
Surname of the family at the center of John Steinbeck's 1939 novel
The Grapes of Wrath.
The title of the novel is borrowed from the song ``The Battle Hymn of the
Republic.'' (``Oh mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. / He
is tramping out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.
/ He has
loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword. / His truth is
marching on.''
These are not the lyrics exactly as Julia Ward Howe wrote them,
but as I have always heard them.)
The lyrics allude to Rev. 14:19, which
mentions a ``great winepress of the wrath of God'' (in the
KJV ) that yielded blood (Rev. 14:20).
There are
plenty of other Biblical allusions, and the name Joad sounds somewhat Biblical
too, echoing Joab, Moab, Job, Joed, and a very large number of personal and
place names ending in -ad.
job
Here's an unusual use of the English language:
I got a job by accident.
When we were graduate students in physics, and we observed as each student in
turn disappeared beyond the event horizon of the final public oral
( FPO ), to be torn apart by the tidal forces of the
job-market black hole, one of the few triangulation points we learned was the
following datum:
Job offers are
bosons .
That is, they obey Bose-Einstein ( B-E ) statistics:
if you are in a one-job-offer state, your probability of transitioning to
a two-job-offer state is twice the probability that the poor guy with no job
offer will get even one; if you are in a two-job-offer state, your chances of
getting another offer are three times his chance of getting a first job offer.
The injustice of this situation is obvious, since the person with no job offers
needs a job offer much more than the person with two, who is going to turn down
one of the offers anyway.
It is said that the market is cold, and while no
precise temperature measurement has been reported, it appears that we may be
close to the Bose Condensation ( BEC ) regime, where
all the job offers condense on one applicant.
On the basis of this
observation, I think that an effective jobs program would be to give that one
applicant a secretary.
That would not only open up a secretary position, but
the excess job offers could be turned down promptly, creating a population
inversion, etc.
Even I get tired of teeteringly extended metaphors, and I hadn't even discussed
lasing .
It is probably fair to note that early
research on job offer statistics is implied in the classic research of Saint
Matthew ( Matthew Principle )
However, I
first learned about quantum job-offer statistics from Steve, a student of
Arthur S. Wightman, so it may be that the principle has now been placed on a
rigorous axiomatic field-theory foundation.
New research suggests that
MOTAS
statistics are
also bosonic.
For more detail on job stats, try following the link at the
BLS
entry.
Although they're not pronounced identically, it seems appropriate that the
Biblical Job and the quotidian
job
should have the same spelling.
Both
are associated with great suffering.
Incidentally, the English word
job
has been borrowed into German as a masculine noun.
This loan is reputed to
have a German pronunciation simmilar to the English (something like what would
be spelled ``jawp'').
But it's a very common word, and without researching the
matter, I suspect that as usual its pronunciation will go a bit native and
start to resemble that of the name of the Biblical character (also spelled
Job
or almost equivalently
Hiob ).
JÖB

Jo. Bapt.
John the Baptist.
The guy who lost his head two thousand years ago.
Not used as a given name in English, but in some other languages, such as
French
(Jean-Baptiste, abbrev. J.-B.).
Note that normally,
Jo.
abbreviates Joel and some
other names, and John is abbreviated
Jno. .
I've also seen

John
Elton's last name.
He was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight.
JOHNNIAC
JOHN von Neumann Integrator and Automatic Computer.
An early computer
built by the RAND corporation and based on the
IAS
architecture developed by John von Neumann and
named in his honor.
Like all computers of its era, it was a one-of-a-kind
machine that could not exchange programs with other computers
(even other IAS machines).
Then again, the programs were pretty short.
JOHNNIAC operated from 1953 until February 11, 1966, logging over 50,000
operational hours.
The machine currently takes up space at
the Computer History Museum
in
Mountain View, California.
The preceding information, but not the crucially important attitude component,
was cribbed from the
JOHNNIAC
entry
at
Wikipaedia, the
free encyclopaedia , with an extra vowel because this is
SBFary, the free glossary .
According to the
Giant Computers
file , this computer contained about 3000
tubes ,
no
crystals, and about 200 relays, and occupied 250 square feet.
It was
used for scientific calculations for general research.
Johnny Rotten
Gerard is taken with the album title:
Never mind the bollocks.
JR got back together with the rest of the Sex Pistols for a recording session
or concert or something, in 1997, so he could insult them and give a filip to
his sagging solo career.
Johnson
Johnson is the
second
most common surname in the US .
When Gary and Susan married in Scottsdale, one of my tasks, as a local, was to
taxi some of the out-of-town guests, including Gary's sister.
Sitting in the
back seat, she asked about the frilly black garter on the floor of my car.
I
had to explain about how a famed composer of liturgical music, David A.
Johnson, had passed away not long before, and how, as a direct and unavoidable
consequence of the
Law of Unintended Consequences , a letter of
condolence had arrived at
CSSER , where another
David A. Johnson was an
ASU
graduate student in
EE .
It was decided to celebrate David's passing with
a memorial quaff at a nearby bar, within walking distance of EE for the badly
decomposed body himself.
Seeking to show the proper respect, I called a few
funeral homes for information, but they all said it was an east coast thing, or
an
Italian
thing, and they had no idea where I
could get a black armband, so I went out and bought a black garter as the
next-best thing.
Then Gary's sister asked me about the castanets.
One of the problems with having a popular name like David Johnson, in addition
to people mistaking you for another David Johnson, is people mistaking you for
another David Johnson
when it's really you .
This happened to Orioles
manager Davey Johnson, who on the same day at the end of the 1997 season (a)
was fired from his job and (b) won the American League Manager-of-the-Year
honors.
It was
the same guy , but the team owner obviously thought that
the Davey Johnson who did such a good job was a different Davey Johnson than
the one he was firing.
I guess.
Perhaps owner Angelos was confused because
the same Davey Johnson had managed teams in both American and National Leagues
(none of which had ever finished lower than second place).
Perhaps Mr. Angelos
was confused because Davey Johnson had managed the team to a second-place
finish the previous year, but this year the team was in first place from the
first day of the season to the last.
Perhaps Mr. Angelos was just confused.
Maybe Davey Johnson can pretend to be the different DJ who won the award and
get his old job back as a new DJ.
Reminds me of the new
Richard Nixon .
There ought to be some way to take advantage of this kind of thing.
Legally, I mean.

joking
Remember, you can't spell

without
king .
When the king
tells a joke, everybody laughs.
``The Great Race'' (1965) was directed by Blake Edwards and had an all-star
cast (alright, not quite literally) led by Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and
Natalie Wood (not credited in that order).
Jack Lemmon played Professor Fate
-- one of the racers -- and also Crown Prince Frederick Hoepnick of Pottsdorf,
where the movie is temporarily detained on its way from New York to Paris.

Jón Gnarr
This entry is among the j's rather than the g's because it starts with J,
see?
Anyway, in many languages the pronunciations of j and g overlap.
Granted, that's not the case in Icelandic: the initial g in Gnarr is unvoiced.
( I.e. , it's pronounced /k/.
Interestingly, all the stop consonants in
Modern Icelandic are unvoiced, and the distinction between voiced and unvoiced
consonants that is typical in other European languages is replaced by a
phonemic aspirated/unaspirated distinction.)
Nice try, though.
Honestly, I've
put the entry here because I wanted another j entry.
Also, this is the name of
a person whose last name is not Gnarr.
The full name is Jón Gnarr
Kristinsson.
As you may have gathered, it's an Icelandic name, so Kristinsson
is a patronymic and not a family name.
Jón was named Jón
Gunnar
Kristinsson at birth (on January 2, 1967), but in 2005 he had the
middle name legally changed to Gnarr, which is the way his mother pronounced it
when he was kid.
How did she pronounce it later?
I don't know.
For the moment, most of our substantive information about Jón Gnarr is
at
Farting People, The.
Jopará

Joseph
Joseph was a snitch.
It says so at Genesis, ch. 37, verse 2:
he would go
and rat to Dad on his own older brothers.
That's the real reason they hated
him.
It wasn't
the coat .
No one likes a snitch.
His own brothers wouldn't even talk to him (37:3).
God
spake directly to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Joseph?
Let him interpret dreams.
Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat
Joseph's father gave him a garment that was described in Hebrew as
[transliterated; I'll get around to
Unicode
in a
decade or two]
k'tonet passim .
The first word means `garment' of some
sort, but the second word is a mystery, at least as of 1995, which is the most
recent literature I've looked at.
(Of course, some speculations are expressed
confidently.
Shame on me for being taken in.)
The Septuagint ( LXX ) translates the term with
chiton polikilon , `many-colored coat.'
But the Septuagint translation
came many centuries after the text of Genesis was first composed (the Hebrew
continued evolving, though), and it appears that `many-colored' was a guess.
(Most of the relevant Genesis chapter, 37, appears to have been written by the
J
author.
In fact, the sentence that introduces
the famous garment calls Joseph's father ``Israel,'' and that is generally
regarded as a reliable indication that the author was J.
However, the other
two contexts of
k'tonet passim
in this chapter are E, so the clause with
this phrase is considered E.
Textual criticism, ugh.)
Another traditional interpretation is that
passim
here means `with
sleeves,' and that is the translation favored by, for example, the
revised standard version
(``robe with sleeves'').
Yick.
No one ever seems to mention that -im is a plural ending, and for
`sleeves' one might expect the dual ending -ayim.
I mean, to the extent that
the -ayim is possible or probable, its absence counts as weight in the balance
against the sleeve interpretation.
(Ah say, ah say gimme that ollllllld time
relijun!
The
KJV , in His Own English,
says ``coat of many colors.''
Yea and Amen!)
For a word like
passim , it's natural to seek
occurrences elsewhere in the Bible.
In addition to the three occurrences in
the Joseph story (ch. 37, vss. 3, 23, 32),
k'tonet passim
occurs in
II Sam. 23:18, where it describes a garment worn by the daughters of
kings.
That's the uncertain state of affairs as it stood, in limbo for a couple of
millennia.
In the twentieth century, there was some new old information.
Among cuneiform inventories (written in Akkadian, another Semitic language),
one kind of clothing listed is
kitu pishannu
and
kiutinnu
pishannu
[details in
JNES
vol.
8 ,
p. 177 (1949)].
These were ceremonial robes for draping over the statues of
goddesses, and
pishannu
apparently denoted gold appliqué
ornaments.
(The ornaments were sewn on; they would come undone and require
resewing, at which time they would appear in the inventories.)
I'm not sure how firm this Akkadian stuff is, but it's good enough for me.
Anyway, you can see that title ``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor
Dreamcoat,'' for a
musical by Andrew
Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice , takes no unusual liberties in translation.

journalistic balance
In a
1984
conversation with Edna O'Brien,
Philip Roth commented ( Shop Talk ,
p. 109) that she ``write[s] about women without a taint of ideology or, as far
as I can see, any concern with talking a correct position.''
Her reply began
thus:
The correct position is to write the truth, to write what one feels regardless
of any public consideration or any clique.
I think an artist never takes a
position either through expedience or umbrage.
Artists detest and suspect
positions because you know that the minute you take a fixed position you are
something else--you are a journalist or you are a politician.
journalistic instinct
The courage to ask a question which accurately reflects the ignorance
of one's audience, combined with the wisdom to accept an answer only if it
is consonant with one's own sincerest prejudices.
jovial
For thoughts on the common adjective
jovial,
you obviously don't
want the
JOVIAL
entry -- that's about a computer
language.
See the
JPO
entry instead.
JOVIAL, Jovial
Jules's Own Version of
IAL .
IAL was the original
name of
Algol , and Jovial was similar to Algol 60.
I don't know who this fellow Jules is, or perhaps was, but he was apparently
associated with the
US Air Force , since that was
the main customer for Jovial.
And is!
The felicitously named
USAF JOVIAL Program Office,
based at Hill
AFB , has
a
webpage
that was updated as recently as April 2006.
Then again, the
B-52
was last
manufactured in 1962, and the plan is for the Air Force to still be flying it
in 2040, so I suppose this isn't all that surprising.
Jowett
Benjamin Jowett, of course, born in London, 1817.
Often referred to as
``Jowett of Balliol,'' the college at Oxford where he was master from 1870
until his death in 1893.
A Church of England clergyman, he also served as vice
chancellor of Oxford.
The following bit of doggerel, written about him during his early years as a
lecturer, expresses something of his personality and the pronunciation of his
name:
First Come I
My name is Jowett;
It is not knowledge
If I don't know it.
Another instance of poetry used to elucidate the pronunciation of an English
name is given at the
Pepys
entry.
The poems
convey the pronunciation information in rhyme as well as meter.
Of course,
many kinds of poetry do not use rhyme.
That is particularly true of poetry in
Ancient Greek (which will become relevant to this entry later) and
in
Latin
(whose most prestigious poetic forms were
adapted from Greek).
As Dante wrote in
Vita nuova , in his day (around
1300), the ``poet'' word was reserved for writers of Latin verse, and the rest
were mere ``rimatori.''
Japanese poetry also doesn't make much use of rhyme.
(Frankly, with mostly
synthetic verb conjugation and with a verb-last syntax, rhyme might get pretty
boring and even silly, though it seems to work in German despite the
V2
structure.)
So haiku is based on syllable
counts.
For an instance of pronunciation clarified by haiku, see
the
homogeneous
entry.

Joyce ACC
Edmund P. Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center Fieldhouse.
It's located
west of the
Notre Dame
Football stadium.
(At one
time, Juniper Road ran behind the west of where the stadium now, stands.
Then,
to accommodate the expanding campus, Juniper Road was shifted east, and the
parts of it that remained inside the campus were renamed ``Old Juniper Road.''
The stadium was on the west side of the new Juniper Road, and later the
Joyce ACC was built on the east side across from the stadium.
Juniper Road was
normally a two-way street, but for many hours on football Saturdays it was
one-way ``in'' (toward the stadium) or ``out.''
Other buildings continued to
be built east of Juniper, and in 2006 or so, to accommodate the expanding
campus, most of Juniper Road was torn up and grassed over, or otherwise
landscaped or repaved as part of the new parking configuration.
As of 2008,
Joyce ACC is separated from the stadium by a plaza, so it looks like part of a
stadium complex.
Joyce ACC is frequently mis-expanded (or at least
unofficially expanded) as ``Joyce Athletic and Convention Center.''
When
WNDU -TV's first transmission tower was
completed in June 1955, its blinking red beacon was installed eighteen inches
below the apex rather than at top, as is normal.
You might think that this
displacement would have endangered any barnstorming pilots coming in to land
( VFR ) at
South Bend
Regional , but not to worry: at the top was ``a gilded statue of Mary,
mother [an avatar, as I understand it] of God,''
according to
WNDU , which goes on to point out that
The simplicity of the sculpture is overwhelming.
Frankly, if the closest most people will get to see it is 570 feet (the height
of the original broadcast tower) minus eye height, why spend money making a
complex speculative likeness?
Maybe it is the simplicity of the faithful that is overwhelming.
In 1415, as the friar Jan Hus (`John Huss' in English) was being burned alive
at the stake, he remarked, or quipped (with great presence of mind,
IMO ):
O sancta simplicitas!
[`Oh Holy Simplicity!']
This was apparently a reference to a peasant adding a
faggot to stoke the fire.
It was also presumably an allusion to a comment of
Saint Jerome --
Veneratoni mihi semper fuit non verbosa rusticas sed sancta
simplicitas.
[`I have always revered not crude verbosity but holy
simplicity.']
Then again, maybe he was misheard and actually said ``Oh Holy
Shit!''
That hasn't aught to do with this entry, I guess, except that the tower
functions as a lightning arrestor, so the statue is scarred up some after
fifty years.
What does have to do with this entry is that in June 1955, Father
Edmund P. Joyce demonstrated his athleticism by climbing to the top of the
570-foot tower and blessing the statue.
Just how close did he have to get?
Couldn't he bless it from the ground?
In 1970, the statue was lifted to the
top of WNDU's new 1000-foot tower, but it wasn't necessary to rebless it
because it had already been blessed fifteen years earlier.
Why didn't they
think ahead in 1955 and first put it at the top of a two-foot tower so that it
could be blessed at a convenient height?
Then they could transfer it to the
new (570-foot) tower with no need for a rebless climb (just as it wasn't
needed in 1970).
These clerical types just aren't practical.
Father Edmund Joyce, C.S.C., died in Spring 2004.
In a press release dated November 23, 2005, the University of Notre Dame
announced that it had reached an agreement with
Gray Television, Inc. , under which Gray
acquires all of the capital stock of
Michiana
Telecasting Corporation, the university-owned company that operates
WNDU- TV , for $85 million in cash, most of
which will be invested in the university's endowment.
Student internships at
WNDU-TV will continue.
The agreement is subject to certain conditions and
regulatory approval, and is expected to be completed before June 30, 2006.
According to the press release, WNDU-TV ``is the
NBC
affiliate serving the South Bend-Elkhart, Ind., television market, the nation's
87th largest Designated Market Area (DMA).''
Eighty-seventh largest DMA out of roughly two hundred?
A four-syllable rank?
This is humiliating.
No wonder all our local stations are in UHF Siberia
( WNDU
is channel 16,
WNIT
is 34,
WSBT
is 22;
there's at least one other).
Gray previously announced its acquisition of
WSAZ-TV, the NBC affiliate serving Charlestown-Huntington, W.Va.
Where?
Gray Television, headquartered in Atlanta, will own 35 stations when the WNDU
and WSAZ acquisitions are complete, reaching approximately 6 percent of total
U.S. TV households.
This is not making me feel better.
Of these 35, 16 are
CBS
affiliates, 10 are NBC affiliates, and 7 are
ABC
affiliates.
Twenty-five of the stations ranked
No. 1 in local news audience, and 24 are No. 1 in overall audience within their
respective markets.
Is this impressive?
Why sure: the 35 stations serve only
30 TV markets, so at most 30 could be first.
I don't know if any more than six
of these markets are served by a No. 2 TV station.

In addition to this ``Joy's Law,'' he has other,

Errr, what's this business about
`` orders '' and ``conscription''?
The
Air Force
runs this thing!?
It didn't sound so
serious.
It turns out that
Jovial
is a
programming language, so I suppose JPO does sound serious -- compared to JPPO.
They write it `` JOVIAL Program
Office, '' and I suppose they have a point with the all-caps, since it's an
acronym and all, but what I want to talk about is joviality.
I can see in principle how Jove could be what is called jovial.
If I were the
Olympian top
dog , or
pot
god, or some other permutation, I imagine that I could find my way to a
permanent high.
But his reported activities suggest that like JPO, Jove is
basically about target acquisition and force projection.
All you hear is
thundrous lightning thrown and nymphs raped by Jove.
And when a mere man calls
his wife a ``goddess'' (not even a ``domestic goddess'' or a

has in mind.
``Saturnine,'' on the other hand -- that I can see.

JPW
An orgy that begins the Friday following Ash Wednesday of the sophomore
year.
Extra-large sweat-shirts with the letters J - P - W
are on sale at the university book store.
It must have been a long time ago that I wrote the first paragraph of this
entry.
At the University of Notre Dame (in Saint Joseph County, Indiana), JPW
stands for Junior Parents' Weekend.
It sounds a bit like it's promoting
teenage pregnancy, but it's actually a juniors' parents weekend: a weekend when
the parents of juniors enrolled in the university come to visit their kids and
see what their $30,000 or so a year is buying.
I'm not sure how they pick the
weekend.
In 2008 it was the second weekend after Ash Wednesday (Feb. 16-17),
so secular considerations may intrude.
This annual ritual was instituted in 1952 by then-president Father Theodore
Hesburgh.
(For more about names ending in -burgh, see the
Pgh
entry.)
Father Hesburgh (``Father'' is not his
first name, so this isn't an instance of
nomen est omen ) felt that
``parents should become more involved in their students' lives at Notre Dame
before the following year's graduation ceremony,'' according to an article in
the student newspaper in 2008, when about 1750 parents were expected for JPW.
A quick bit of googling suggests that Harvard is the only other school with a
Junior Parents' Weekend.
Harvard is a more demanding school, though: they also
have a Freshman Parents' Weekend.
Saint Mary's College, which neighbors Notre
Dame, has a Sophomore Parents' Weekend on the same weekend that Notre Dame has
its JPW.
Entirely by coincidence (surely they wouldn't do it as a deliberate
provocation!?) the students who do a local performance of ``The Vagina
Chronicles'' have a performance on Sunday during the parents' weekend.
Saint Mary's College also holds an annual event for seventh-grade girls from
the local area ( Michiana ) to, of all things,
``celebrate [the] accomplishments of Saint Mary's students in math.''
They
were expecting 90 students on Saturday, February 23, 2008.
(I didn't follow up
to check how many actually showed up, okay?)
This (2008) is the 18th year they
hold the event, and it's also the first year that I've heard of it.
Of that I
am pretty sure, because a Catholic school celebrating a ``Hypatia Day'' (that's
what the event is called) is immediately arresting and memorable.
Hypatia of Alexandria had other distinctions besides being ``the first female
mathematician'' (whose name we know) and a leading Platonist philosopher.
During the patriarchate of Cyril of Alexandria, a (nonheretical!) Christian mob
kidnapped her to a church, where she was stripped, flayed to death with tiles,
and dismembered.
It's not clear what role Cyril played in this episode, but it
was the same Cyril who some time earlier had led mobs in the destruction of the
Alexandrian synagogues and the expulsion of the Jews.
I'm sorry, that's
Saint
Cyril.
Anyway, for SMC to hold a Hypatia Day displays about as much chutzpah as would
Notre Dame University holding a day to honor Giordano Bruno or Jan Hus or the
Albigensians or Galileo Galilei, although the last was not murdered.
He was
even rehabilitated in a sort of mini-de-Stalinization event a few years back.
I guess I can see where this is leading.
When ND holds its first Galileo
Astronomy Day, I'll try to mention it here.

Jump The Shark .
A television
series is said to jump the shark when it airs a particularly lamentable episode
that heralds the show's decline.
Often this show involves a, ah, let us say,
daring
premise (Josh cloning a thought-to-be-dead Reva, or Reva
time-traveling, on
GL ), and demonstrates final
exhaustion or jettison of the original artistic inspiration.
The term is not applied to the first show or the pilot: there is an underlying
assumption that every show has achieved some sort of level from which it can
decline.
It is fashionable to pretend that each show has only one JTS moment,
but the reality is that if a show declines only as fast as standards generally,
there is nothing to prevent it from gaining a new loyal following during its
post-JTS decline.
These fans will eventually find their own JTS moment, and so
on.
The term was coined in reference to the episode of
Happy Days
in which the Fonz went
water-skiing in
California
and jumped a shark.

Not he nor anybody else seems to have been able to track down

The repeated name is pronounced in an affected way, with both syllables
stressed, and the second syllable sounding a bit like ``day''; this is
sometimes indicated in
eye dialect
by
writing the name ``Juday.''
Locally, the name comes from meandering Juday Creek, north of the
University of Notre Dame .
It's
not clear how
that
name in turn arose.
An 1863 map labels it Sheffield
Creek, and in the late 1880's it was referred to as ``The State Ditch.''

Robert Sweet
Not mentioned there, because it's hard to state precisely and with certainty
some way in which his name turned out to be unusually appropriate, is John
Minor Wisdom.
He's mentioned in the

footnotes.
I guess from the text quoted there that Judge
Wisdom was known by his last two names (Minor Justice), as Judge Learned Hand
was.
The following is from the chapter entitled ``Judicial Levity'' in Arthur
Train's nonfiction
My Day In
Court
(New York and London: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1939), p. 61.
Even the names of the defendants and other trial participants
sometimes had a humorous aspect.
I had a case in the Supreme Court Criminal Trial Term before the
present Chief Judge of the
New York Court of Appeals ,
Cuthbert W. Pound, which no doubt he remembers.
The defendant's name was
Schornstein (chimney), that of his counsel, Firestone, my own, Train (also
suggestive of smoke and cinders), while the judge and clerk rejoiced
respectively in those of Pound and Penny.

Juggalo, Juggalette
Members of the rap group
ICP
(that stands for
Insane Clown Posse, but visit the entry anyway) at some point started to refer
to themselves as Juggalos.
(The plural
is
formed without an e.)
Lyrics
in their
Carnival of Carnage
CD
make
reference to the jugula' (vein, to rhyme approximately with strangle-uh, and
mentioned in the context of neck-breaking), and also to juggling
(metaphorically).
There might be some reference to gigolos too, but probably
not to boogaloo dudes ( vide
Day Tripper
entry).
The next album,
The Great Milenko , included a rap entitled ``What is a
Juggalo?'' that doesn't answer the title question in any essential way.
As the
term is used by ICP fans, a Juggalo is an ICP fan.
(Unless he is an ICP member
who isn't a fan.
I don't know if this second category is, or is conceived to
be, nonempty yet.
Positive enthusiasm isn't very cool, you know, if you're a
Juggalo.)
A Juggalette (or
Lette ) is a female ICP
fan, and the term Juggalo is typically used in the complementary sense of a
male ICP fan.
Juggalettes can be enthusiastic about ICP and some other groups
(but not eminem!) and not suffer any coolness deficit.
(Juggalos should say
that they really like ICP, but that they don't consider themselves Juggalos.)
To signal their coolness and belonging, Juggalos and Juggalettes can use
expressions like ``down wit' de clown'' ( DWTC ) and
MCL , and buy ICP
merchandise .
No secret decoder rings yet, though
they could come in handy.

There's a large Ukrainian community around southern Ontario, extending into the

I don't know how my
homies in ICP happened to chose the name Milenko (probably for scansion,

Milenko sounds like a Ukrainian
surname (a large fraction of Ukrainian surnames end in -ko).
And Mihalenko
(also Mihailenko or Mihajlenko) is a moderately common Ukrainian surname.
But
it turns out that Milenko is mostly a south Slav (Slovenia to Macedonia) man's
given name.
I figured I ought to explain that.

Jumping Frenchmen of Maine Syndrome
This syndrome deserves to be better known, maybe.
It's an exaggerated
startle reflex that was first reported to the medical community by G.M. Beard,
at the 1878 conference of the
American Neurological
Association
[see ``Remarks upon `jumpers or jumping Frenchmen',''
J.
Nerv. Ment. Dis.
vol.
5 , p. 526 (1878)].
The following
description, at least partly a quote of Beard, is in an article at
OMIM
(see
item
244100 ):
In response to sudden sensory input, abnormal reaction occurred.
For example,
if one of them was abruptly asked to strike another, he would do so without
hesitation, even if it was his mother and he had an ax in his hand.
If given a
short, sudden, quick command, the affected person would respond with the
appropriate action, often echoing the words of command. Some, when addressed
quickly in a language foreign to them, would echo the phrase.
Beard found it among French-Canadian lumberjacks in the Moosehead Lake area of
Maine.
Many of the lumbermen had origins in the Beauce region of Quebec, and
the syndrome has been documented there and also reported in five offspring of a
French-Canadian fishing guide in Wedgport, Nova Scotia.
In some cases, there
was a family history of the syndrome.
All this suggests that the condition is
hereditary, but does not exclude a necessary environmental trigger.
A 1986
study (see the OMIM article for reference) concluded that the cases they
studied were related to the specific conditions in lumber camps in the 19th and
early 20th centuries.
They also concluded that `jumping' is not a neurologic
disease but rather can be explained in psychologic terms as operant
conditioning.
Georges Gilles de la Tourette translated Beard's 1880 article on the syndrome,
and this may have stimulated him to study certain patients making peculiar
sounds and movements.
This research led him to describe the disorder that soon
bore his name (see
GTS ).
jumping up and down
When you think about it, there's a lot to ponder in this phrase.
Most
people really just jump up repeatedly and allow
gravity
to complete the cycle.
This seems most efficient.
I'll finish
the entry when I'm ready to make a complete final report.
The only time that anyone can recall George Washington jumping up and/or
down in excitement was when he received word of
French
ship arrivals around Yorktown, which meant that
he had Lord Cornwallis completely surrounded.
Cornwallis's subsequent
surrender marked the end of the military action in the Revolutionary War.
junction isolation
Doping to achieve electronic isolation between devices.
E.g.:
Integrated-circuit BJT's are fabricated as a sequence of successively enclosed
doped regions; an
npn
presents an outer n
(collector) region.
For junction isolation ( JI ),
this is fabricated in an n epi layer on a p substrate, and different
devices are separated by thick p regions that reach down to the substrate.
The substrate and these doped regions constitute a single electrical node which
is connected to the most negative voltage on the chip, so that the electrical
path between any two transistors is collector-to-collector, through a pair of
junctions equivalent to a pair of opposed, reverse-biased diodes.
Cf.
ROx ,
dielectric
isolation ,
LOCOS .
One striking difference
between junction isolation and dielectric isolation is that within the same
technology, JI'd
pnp
transistors have much lower
f T
values than npn transistors,
whereas dielectric isolation tends to give comparable
f T
values.

It gets a lot of
airplay on college stations, if you know what I mean.

Hampshire maple-syrup products.
Just do it.
This was/is a campaign slogan for a sneaker company (oh! I'm sorry,
that should be ``athletic shoe'' company).
I think it's Nike.
I read the following interesting advice in
Some of my best friends are
writers, but I wouldn't want my daughter to marry one!
by Robert Turner ( Los Angeles : Sherbourne Pr., 1970).
It's in the chapter
on getting past initial writer's block -- attacking page 1:
One other warning.
The subconscious is a slippery, sneaky little devil,
too.
At times, it will try to dodge all your attempts to nudge it into
motion by conning you that you are too sick, too hung over, too depressed,
too tired to try to write.
And that if you
do
write, it will be
appallingly bad, not up to your usual standards; so, forget it.
You may
even attempt to do a few pages, then read back over them and decide that
it is true.
What you have just written is sheer tripe, so what's the use
of going on?
Ordinarily, this will just not be true.
Forget it.
Write anyhow.
Unless
you are practically a hospital case or have the shakes so bad that you can't
hit the right typewriter keys, what you write under these conditions will
probably not be any worse than at any other time.
It will just
seem
that way.
If you will just persevere, sometime later, when you reread it,
you will realize the truth.
just don't get it
Just don't agree; labor under a different enlightenment.
Just my personal opinion.
Oh wait, I just remembered: I've got a fully documented analysis here
in my hip pocket.

Righteous, honest, and complete wrapping.
Look, don't be so smug.
Packagers've got to feed their families

juvie
Juvenile detention facility.
No, not room 203 after school.
Prison.
(And
the word is slang.
I'm not going to write ``JUVenIlE'' as if
juvie
were
an acronym; that would be juvenile.)
Stephanie Wilder apparently burned out as an English teacher in juvie and took
a job recruiting deep-foundations and geotechnical professionals.
In
Foundation Drilling
(see
ADCS ) she wrote
that she had found frustrating similarities.
One is that both juvenile
delinquents and geo industry professionals are tight-lipped and suspicious of
outsiders.
Another is that in both the juvenile justice system and the deep
foundations industries, personnel are often needed in a hurry, but when an
appropriate candidate is available the hiring decision often takes too long.

J-walking
Crossing
the street on foot, if the street
is bounded by two regulated intersections.
If you want to get technical, this
is probably vague.
On the other hand, this is probably not a frequently cited
violation.
Also,
that woman you were approaching, who crossed to the other side, that wasn't
J-walking, or jaywalking either.
There's a secret codicil to the law now;
everybody else got the announcement in the mail, but it wasn't broadcast so
you wouldn't find out.
It's now legal to cross the street to avoid you.
JWCI
Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes .
Catalogued by

Sounds like an infomercial cooperative, but it's sponsored by the US
government's National Agricultural Library ( NAL ).
JWI
Jewish Women International .
JWI
Journal of Women's Imaging .
Settle down, settle down.
It's a quarterly that ``focuses [ooh, good word] on
all clinical imaging modalities, as well as on health care policy and economic
issues related to women's imaging.
The Journal is intended to serve not only
radiologists, but [yes? yes?] all the physicians who are an integral part of
the team required to provide health care to women.''
Alright then, I guess
I'll order Playboy instead.
JWI is the official journal of the
AAWR
and has an
association with
SAWI
( qq.v. ).
It would seem
to make more sense the other way around.
JWOD
Javits-Wagner-O'Day .
The JWOD Program,
subsidized by the US government, ``provides a wide array of custom solutions at
a fair market price while creating employment opportunities for people who are
blind or have other severe disabilities.''
The original Wagner-O'Day act
``Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act'' is the popular name
of an act that
became law on June 25, 1938.
`` In 1971, under the
leadership
of Senator Jacob Javits, Congress amended this Act ( 41 U.S.C. 46-48c )
to include people with severe disabilities and allow the Program to also
provide services to the Federal Government.''
(According to 41  U.S.C.  46 nt., it may
be cited as the ``Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act.'')

JYC
Jacques-Yves Cousteau.
His friends actually pronounced this as an acronym.
Transliterated into English, the acronym is something like ``Zheek.''
With various collaborators, he invented relatively lightweight and
self-contained apparatus for breathing underwater
( scuba ).
Almost as important, they invented good
watertight goggles and underwater camera housings, and JYC became world-famous
with films and books about his explorations.
I still remember watching this
stuff on
TV
as a kid.
His ship was called the
Calypso; whether for the Greek legend or the Caribbean music, I don't remember.
He died on June 25, 1997, at the age of 87, and you can find more information
about him in obituaries from then, like
this reverent one
still up at
the
IANTD
website.
A detail about capitalization.
The pronunciation of JYC as an acronym is
mentioned in various French-language articles I can pull up from the 1990's --
mostly obituaries.
For example, the
AFP
announcement commented
en passant , ``JYC, comme tous ses amis
l'appelaient....''
The 26 articles that mentioned the nickname generally wrote
it in all-caps, with the single exception of one article with ``Jyc'' in
Le
Figaro
(out of four).
But here's some really big news: as of 2004,
French-language articles in Lexis-Nexis finally use accented characters!
J-1
Visa type for a `` short-term
scholar '' [clever phrase!].
Also professors and
au pairs
(would
that be
aux
pairs
in
French ?) and a variety of other guests.
Category
includes graduate students, foreign guest lecturers, participants in meetings
(workshops, seminars, conferences,...).
They're permitted to receive direct
compensation as well as payment for travel expenses.
There is
a limit
on
how many hours per week an
au
pair
may be
required to provide child care services, but
professors do
not benefit from this kind of protection .
