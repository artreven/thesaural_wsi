Airbus A330 Tanker Boom
The fly-by-wire boom allows refueling at altitudes up to 35,000 ft and speeds of 180-325 knots, Airbus says, adding that the fuel transfer rate is up to 1,200 US gal/min (4,500 l/min) at 50 psi. Fully extended, the boom measures 17 meters in length.
A F-16 sits in contact behind an Airbus A330 MRTT. The ruddevators appear to form a more acute angle than those of the KC-135. Also to be noted are the fences on the ruddevators and vortex generators on the boom fairing. Otherwise this is a very familiar sight  to KC-135 boom operators.
This image is 1920×1080 pixels and may be an indication of the fidelity that can be expected from the remote viewing system.

The United States Navy purchased one 880
which was modified as an in-flight tanker. Unofficially designated
UC-880 ,
it was assigned to the Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River, and
employed in Tomahawk cruise missile testing and aircraft refueling
procedures. The UC-880 was destroyed in a cargo hold explosion test at NAS Patuxent
River, Maryland in 1995.

KC-135 Boom
A KC-135's boom is lowered and extended for maintenance.
This is a nice picture that shows a closeup of the KC-135’s boom. In this picture the boom is not fully extended and still has approximately 6′ before it reaches full extension. The colorful marking on the boom give the receiver crew a visual indication of the extension of the boom. During night operations the markings are illuminated by ultraviolet lamps that causes them to fluoresce.

Access my entire collection from the Skydrive link below:
I have amassed a very large collection (over 1,000) of air to air refueling pictures and want to share them on this website. My collection includes many rare pictures (ever see an
A-10 refuel from a KC-97 ?) of over 120 different receiver types. Whenever possible I will try to provide a link to the source(s), but I have been collecting the pictures for years on my hard drive and it may be very difficult to track down the original source.
If you find any errors on this site or have additional information about the topic please let me know and I will update the page.
Every great picture has a great story to go along. I have many great pictures, unfortunately I don’t have all of the stories. If anyone has additional information on any of the pictures featured on this site I would love for you to share your story. I am especially interested in documenting the old piston powered tankers, their stories are slowly fading away. This site is all about documenting the nitty-gritty details, so if the more specifics you have the better (quirks, ect…). Likewise, if anybody has unique air refueling pictures I would love to see them. You can send info to the address below:
Please use the comments section below the images as a place to discuss the picture and leave further information for others to read. Your discussion adds greatly to the historic value of this site and to the legacy of air refueling crew members.
Below is a brief list of things I am looking for, but any info is welcomed.
Photographs and information about
Boeing 747 tankers .
I would especially like pictures of the boom operator’s compartment, instruments, and panel. Please get in contact with me via the email address above if you have any information about the 747 tanker.
