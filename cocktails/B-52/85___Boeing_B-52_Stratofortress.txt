Operation Dominic
was a series of 36
nuclear test
explosions conducted in 1962 by the
United States
in the
Pacific . This test series was scheduled quickly, in order to respond in kind to the Soviet resumption of testing after the tacit 1958-1961 test moratorium. Most of these shots were conducted with free-fall bombs dropped from
B-52
bomber aircraft. Twenty of these shots were to test new weapons designs; six to test weapons effects; and several shots to confirm the reliability of existing weapons. The
Thor missile
was also used to lift warheads into near-space to conduct
high altitude nuclear explosion
tests; these shots were collectively called
Operation Fishbowl .
