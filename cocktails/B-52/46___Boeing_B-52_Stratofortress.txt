(You Are) My Special Angel
“The golden moments in the stream of life rush past us and we see nothing
but sand;
the angels come to visit us, and we only know them when they are gone.”
-
George Eliot
(22 Nov 1819 - 22 Dec 1880)
Dear
Friends and Schoolmates,

song
by
Jimmy Duncan , published in

Bobby Helms . "My Special Angel" peaked at number seven on the
Billboard Hot 100

Pennsylvania
who had already scored Top 10 hits in the
U.S.

O'Clock World ". This
cover

From Fred Mays ('60) of VA - 06/16/10
- "Special treat":
Hello, Miss Carol:
Wow, it has been a long
time since I have written to you. I just wanted to report the delightful
time
Patty (Andrews Mays - '61)
and I had last night and today.
Julie Jaffee Nagel
and her husband,
Dr. Louis Nagel
visited
us, all the way from Dexter, Michigan (just outside of Ann Arbor). Patty
and Julie were in the first grade together at new
Magruder
and
then graduated high school together. I went to Magruder the year it
opened in 1948, Patty and Julie started school the following year.
We had dinner at our house
last night and then today, we took a tour of the
East End . Julie wanted to see the
apartment where she grew up ( Stuart
Gardens ) which is 1058 Garden Drive. Patty and I lived at 1111
Garden Drive after we married August 28, 1965 (wow, 45 years ago). We
had such a good time. The Nagels both look great and Patty and Julie had
so much to talk about. Julie and her husband are accomplished concert
pianists. He teaches at the
University
of Michigan
and she is a Psychologist. I will email her
the N.N.H.S. website
as she did not have
this information.....I fully intended to give it to her; however, I
forgot.
There was so much to see
this morning and, of course, it was sad to see the East End. The
apartments do look really good, however. We directed the Nagels to the
temple on Warwick Boulevard as they were to meet with the rabbi and
probably have lunch with him today. What a great time we all had. Julie
and Louie have one daughter and two granddaughters who live near them.
She plans to come back next year for her 50 year reunion. The reason
Julie came in this direction was because she received a special award in
Washington and was honored....she had a presentation to give and all
went really well as she and her husband met with their
congressman....this gave her the opportunity to make a plug for some
special funding and was delighted to be given exactly what she asked
for......after the D.C. time, they headed to Newport News.
Carol, I hope you and
Paul
(Harty -
Bardolph HS, IL - '61 - of IL)
are doing well. Our class ('60) has
our 50 year reunion in August.....
.....it is time to close
this epistle.
Take care great lady, Fred Mays ('60))
Thank
you so very much, Fred, for this happy news!
It came at just the
right time to lift my spirits!
I would be honored and
delighted to include Julie in our list of subscribers; please send her
my email addy -
NNHS65@gmail.com .
I'm glad y'all
were brave enough to take the Stuart Gardens tour.  One of the last
times I tried that - nearly seven years ago - gunfire erupted
(domestic disturbance, police on the scene, sirens blaring - very
exciting...).
One of my chopped,
sliced, and diced "memories" involves
my mother ,
the late Maxine Frix Buckley (John
Marshall HS - '25)
and I
meeting Julie and some other adult woman (but I think
not
her
mother) and riding in the car together.  It was probably in the
summer of 1959 or 60.  I have no clue what the occasion might have
been.  I already knew enough of who Julie was
(top of her class,
brilliant concert pianist,
Julliard
in her future)
to be in complete and total awe of her.  So
rather than take advantage of the opportunity to get to know her, I was
largely silent and/or incoherent - another one of my missed
opportunities in life.  That's why I badger people so often not to
let those moments pass.
Thanks again, Fred!
Tell Julie I look
forward to hearing from her - and I'll try not to babble this time!

Page ":
Hi Carol,
Just thought you should know that the link "Return to NNHS" on the
birthday page is broken, and my birthday is 5/30/48 as well.
Thanks. Hope you are well.
Chuck Jones '66
Why, sho
'nuff - one of the thousands still broken!
I fixed it
now - and added your birthday in the process:

Actually,
Mike Sisk ('63) of CA
sent me
a program several weeks ago
(Thanks, Mike!
)
which will automatically "cure" this problem without my having to
manually locate and repair each on separately.  Now I just have to
"catch and corner" my resident tech-reppie to help me do that.
Meanwhile, whenever you encounter a broken link, just look up at your
URL bar.  Backspace out the offending ".00freehost" characters,
press, "Enter", and voila!  You're back in business - and so am I.
Thanks, Chuck - and Belated
Happy Birthday Wishes!

From Bruce Sims ('56) of VA 06/17/10 - "The Poem":
This one will make everyone
think. Enjoy.
READ ALONE.....ESPECIALLY THE LAST PART
.....This is the
poem:
Around the corner I have a friend,
In this great city that has no end,
Yet the days go by and weeks rush on,
And before I know it, a year is gone.
And I never see my old friend's face,
For life is a swift and terrible race,
He knows I like him just as well,
As in the days when I rang his bell.
And he rang mine if, we were younger then,
And now we are busy, tired men.
Tired of playing a foolish game,
Tired of trying to make a name.
"Tomorrow," I say, "I will call on Jim"
"Just to show that I'm thinking of him."
But tomorrow comes and tomorrow goes,
And distance between us grows and grows.
Around the corner! - yet miles away,
"Here's a telegram, Sir" "Jim died today."
And that's what we get and deserve in the end.
Around the corner, a vanished friend.
Remember to always
say what you mean. If you love someone, tell them. Don't be afraid to
express yourself. Reach out and tell someone what they mean to you.
Because when you decide that it is the right time, it might be too late.
Seize the day. Never have regrets. And most importantly, stay close to
your friends and family, for they have helped make you the person that
you are today.
Thank you so much,
Bruce!
What timely advice!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From Jerry Blanchard ('62) of VA - 06/17/10 - "Woman and a Fork":
Carol,
Please pass this on to TYPHOON
land for me, as we are all friends for life!!!
Jerry Blanchard (Class of 62) of
Va.
Woman and a
Fork
There was a young woman who had been diagnosed with a terminal
illness and had been given three months to live.  So as she was
getting her things 'in order,' she contacted her Pastor and had
him come to her house to discuss certain aspects of her final
wishes.
She told him which songs she wanted sung at the service, what
scriptures she would like read, and what outfit she wanted to be
buried in.
Everything was in order and the Pastor was preparing to leave
when the young woman suddenly remembered something very
important to her.
'There's one more thing,' she said excitedly.
'What's that?' came the Pastor's reply.
'This is very important,' the young woman continued.  'I want to
be buried with a fork in my right hand.'
The Pastor stood looking at the young woman, not knowing quite
what to say.
That surprises you, doesn't it?' the young woman asked.
'Well, to be honest, I'm puzzled by the request,' said the
Pastor.
The young woman explained.  'My grandmother once told me this
story, and from that time on I have always tried to pass along
its message to those I love and those who are in need of
encouragement.  In all my years of attending socials and
dinners, I always remember that when the dishes of the main
course were being cleared, someone would inevitably lean over
and say, 'Keep your fork.'  It was my favorite part because I
knew that something better was coming...like velvety chocolate
cake or deep-dish apple pie.  Something wonderful, and with
substance!'
'So, I just want people to see me there in that casket with a
fork in my hand and I want them to wonder "What's with the
fork?"  Then I want you to tell them: 'Keep your fork - the best
is yet to come.'
The Pastor's eyes welled up with tears of joy as he hugged the
young woman good-bye.  He knew this would be one of the last
times he would see her before her death.  But he also knew that
the young woman had a better grasp of heaven than he did.  She
had a better grasp of what heaven would be like than many people
twice her age, with twice as much experience and knowledge.  She
KNEW that something better was coming.
At the funeral people were walking by the young woman's casket
and they saw the cloak she was wearing and the fork placed in
her right hand.  Over and over, the Pastor heard the question,
'What's with the fork?' And over and over he smiled.
During his message, the Pastor told the people of the
conversation he had with the young woman shortly before she
died.  He also told them about the fork and about what it
symbolized to her.  He told the people how he could not stop
thinking about the fork and told them that they probably would
not be able to stop thinking about it either.
He was right. So the next time you reach down for your fork let
it remind you, ever so gently, that the best is yet to come.
Friends are a very rare jewel, indeed.  They make you smile and
encourage you to succeed Cherish the time you have, and the
memories you share...being friends with someone is not an
opportunity but a sweet responsibility.
Send this to everyone you consider a FRIEND even if it means
sending back to the person who sent it to you.
And keep your fork.
Absolutely! Thanks so much, Jerry; this is one of my faves!

From Richard Dawes (NNHS / HHS - '62) of VA -
06/17/10 - "Leroy":
A preacher said, "Anyone
with 'special needs' who wants to be prayed over, please come forward to
the front by the altar."
With that, Leroy got in line, and when it was his turn, the Preacher
asked, "Leroy, what do you want me to pray about for you?"
Leroy replied, "Preacher, I need you to pray for help with my hearing."
The preacher put one
finger of one hand in Leroy's ear, placed his other hand on top of
Leroy's head, and then prayed and prayed and prayed. He prayed a "blue
streak" for Leroy, and the whole congregation joined in with great
enthusiasm.
After a few minutes, the preacher removed his hands, stood back and
asked, "Leroy, how is your hearing now?"
Leroy answered, "I don't know. It ain't 'til next week.."
Thanks,
Dicky - I needed that laugh!

My Special Angel
Written by
Jimmy Duncan
(b. 25 June 1935)
Recorded by
Bobby
Helms
(15 Aug 1933 - 19 June 1997), 1957
(Angel, angel, whoa-oh-oh-oh, ooh)
(Angel, angel, whoa-oh-oh-oh, ooh)
You are my special angel
Sent from up above
The Lord smiled down on me
And sent an angel to love (to love)
You are my special angel
Right from paradise
I know that you're an angel
Heaven is in your eyes
A smile from your lips
Bring the summer sunshine
The tears from your eyes bring the rain
I feel your touch, your warm embrace
And I'm in heaven again
You are my special angel
Through eternity
I'll have my special angel
Here to watch over me
(A smile from your lips)
(Brings the summer sunshine)
(The tears from your eyes bring the rain)
I feel your touch
Your warm embrace
And I'm in heaven again
You are my special angel
Through eternity
I'll have my special angel
Here to watch over me (watch over me)
Here to watch over me
(Angel, angel)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oooooh)
