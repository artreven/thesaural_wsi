Watching The Glenn Miller Show with Chimmy Shtewart. Jimmy Stewart. He looks great in those glasses. I saw Jimmy Stewart in the play
Harvey
in London when I was 17. He was….OUTSTANDING.
I wanted to go backstage to try to meet him but my brother was uninterested and for some reason I just headed back to our parents at the hotel instead of just saying: See ya.
I later met Jimmy Stewart in person. I had gone to his church in Beverly Hills because I heard that he would be reading “A Christmas Carol” as he did every Christmastime. And…there…he…was…that beautiful and unique voice soaring out to the congregation. I was in the back and I know he was talking directly to me. Everyone felt that way. You could hear a pin drop.
I had to keep pinching myself. Wow. Double wow. Then he stayed after the service and said hello to everyone. His wife was also there and very gracious. Jimmy Stewart was from my home state, Pennsylvania, so a conversation starter? I almost blurted: Can I buy you lunch? – but was pushed aside by the next person before I had a chance to jump on it. Probably a good thing
The Stewarts. Super people.
And, one degree of separation: Jimmy Stewart was a buck sergeant in Gen Yeager’s outfit when the General was a private in World War II.
I heard that Jimmy Stewart valued his time in the military during the war, serving his country, more than any other time.
I read this recently: “Sensing America’s eventual involvement in the war in Europe, Stewart enlisted in the armed forces in March 1941. An avid pilot in civilian life, he was assigned to the Air Corps and logged more than 1,800 hours of flight time in bomber missions. Before he returned to civilian life in 1945, he had risen to the rank of colonel and had been decorated several times. After the war, Stewart served as Air Force Reserve commander of  Dobbins Air Reserve Base
in the early 1950s. In 1966, Brigadier General James Stewart flew as a non-duty observer in a  B-52
on a bombing mission during the  Vietnam War . After 27 years of service, Stewart retired from the Air Force on May 31, 1968. He was promoted to  Major General
by  President
Ronald Reagan . “
OK. Triple wow.
