747 at Dunsfold.
A Boeing 747-200 which served with
British Airways
until 2002 as
City of Birmingham ,
G-BDXJ , was purchased by Aces High Limited, a company specialising in supplying aircraft for television and film work, and transferred to Dunsfold.
It was modified and used for filming for the 2006
James Bond
film
Casino Royale . Some of the scenes set at
Miami International Airport
were filmed at Dunsfold. It has also appeared in the background of numerous
Top Gear
episodes and directly in an episode where it is towed by a
JCB Fastrac
tractor. It was also towed by a
Volkswagen
Touareg
in a 2006
Fifth Gear
episode, the same year that the modified aircraft and Dunsfold Airfield were featured in a television advertisement filmed for the
Volkswagen Touareg , demonstrating the vehicle's towing ability. In 2008 it featured in an episode of
Scrapheap Challenge
in which contestants created machines to tow the aircraft.[ citation needed ]
Modifications to the aircraft include the removal of the existing
Rolls Royce
engines and replacement with twin mount engines, similar to those fitted to aircraft such as the
B-52
Heavy Bomber.
The aircraft was a major feature in
Primeval
on the 18 April 2009, in which it was nearly eaten by a dinosaur.

Correct
A 5th engine can be hung from the Starboard (I think) wing for the purpose of transportation

Only engine designed to run at constant afterburn, and actually gets MORE efficient the faster it goes.
The SR71 standard defence against missiles was to "accelerate"
What do I win?
