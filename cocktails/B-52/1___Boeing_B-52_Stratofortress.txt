Top 50 Fastest Aircraft X-1
The X-15 is based on a concept study from
Walter Dornberger
for the NACA for a hypersonic research aircraft.
[4]
The
requests for proposal
were published on 30 December 1954 for the airframe and on 4 February 1955 for the
rocket engine . The X-15 was built by two manufacturers:
North American Aviation
was contracted for the airframe in November 1955, and
Reaction Motors
was contracted for building the engines in 1956. The first X-15 flight was an unpowered test flight by
Scott Crossfield , on 8 June 1959; he also piloted the first powered flight, on 17 September 1959, with his first XLR-99 flight on 15 November 1960. Like most X-series aircraft, the X-15 was designed to be carried aloft, under the wing of a
B-52
bomber plane. The X-15 fuselage was long and cylindrical, with rear
fairings
that flattened its appearance, and thick, dorsal and ventral wedge-fin stabilizers. Parts of the fuselage were heat-resistant
nickel
alloy
( Inconel -X 750). [4]
The retractable
landing gear
comprised a nose-wheel carriage and two rear skis. The skis did not extend beyond the ventral fin, which required the pilot to jettison the lower fin (fitted with a parachute) just before landing. The two
XLR-11
rocket engines for the initial X-15A model delivered 72kN (16,000 lbft) of total thrust; the main engine (installed later) was a single
XLR-99
rocket engine delivering 254kN (57,000 lbft) at sea level, and 311 kN (70,000 lbft) at peak altitude. Before 1958, USAF and
NACA , (later NASA), officials discussed an orbital X-15 spacecraft — the X-15B — for launching to outer space atop an
SM-64 Navajo missile , that was cancelled when the NACA became the NASA, and
Project Mercury
was approved. By 1959, the
X-20 Dyna-Soar
space-glider program became the USAF's preferred means for launching military manned-spacecraft into orbit; the program was cancelled in the early 1960s.
