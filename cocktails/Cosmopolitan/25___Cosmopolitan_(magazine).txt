I am number four starring Dianna Agron
Nine infant aliens, who closely resemble humans, flee their home
planet, Lorien, to hide on Earth. An invading species, the Mogadorians,
have destroyed their planet, and follow them to Earth to hunt them down.
Each of the nine aliens is given a guardian and will develop superhuman
powers as they become adults. They are each assigned a number. These
last children of Lorien can only be killed in the sequence of their
numbers.
Number Four (Alex Pettyfer), also named John Smith, moves to Paradise, Ohio, disguised as an American high school student.
He makes a friend, Sarah Harte (Dianna Agron),
a sweet Midwestern girl who is a photographer. After being on the run
his whole life, Number Four falls in love and now has something to stand
up and fight for.
