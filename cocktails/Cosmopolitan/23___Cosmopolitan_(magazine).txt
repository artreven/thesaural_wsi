The entertainment world knows her as a
American
singer
and television hostess, best known as a
member of the
pop music
group
Wilson Phillips . The Wilson thedaughter of American 1960s pop icon

when they were in their teens. They
released two albums,
Wilson Phillips
and
Shadows and Light ,

hits before breaking up in 1993.
Carnie & Wendy Wilson continued to record together, releasing the
Christmas album
Hey Santa!
in 1993, and they joined with
their father for a critically successful (yet commercially unsuccessful)
1997 album,
The Wilsons . She also sang
Our Time Has
Come
with
James Ingram
for the 1997 animated film
Cats Don't Dance .
In 2003, Carnie attempted to launch a solo music career with the
album
For the First Time.
The album featured a remake of the
Diane
Warren
penned
Samantha Mumba
ballad " Don't Need You To (Tell
Me I'm Pretty) ," retitled "I Don't Need You To," as its first
single. However, the single failed to gain interest and the album was
ultimately shelved when Carnie regrouped with Wendy and Chynna as
Wilson Phillips
in 2004.
Reunited, the band released a third album, named
California,
which appeared on
Sony Music 's record label.
The album featured cover songs primarily from the 1960s and 1970s, and
specifically highlights the musical glory days of their parents'
California-based musical groups:
The Mamas & the Papas

lullabies,
A Mother's Gift: Lullabies from the Heart , created
shortly after the birth of her daughter Lola.
She released her second solo effort in October 2007, a Christmas
album entitled
Christmas with Carnie
featuring a
song written by her husband, "Warm Lovin' Christmastime."
Television career
From 1995-1996, Carnie hosted her own short-lived
syndicated
television
talk
show
Carnie! . The series was launched during the mid 1990s
wave of popularity in
"tabloid" talk shows , which followed the sudden successes
of
Ricki
Lake
and
Jerry Springer .
She later guest-starred on episodes of
That 70s Show
in 2001 and
Sabrina, the Teenage
Witch
before joining the fourth season of the
VH1
reality show
Celebrity Fit Club
in 2006.
Wilson has also been a correspondent on
Entertainment Tonight

hosted a special on
E!
entitled
101 Celebrity Slimdowns . Wilson became
a cast member of the
CMT
series

Weight problems Wilson has had a lifelong battle fighting
obesity .
During her
Wilson Phillips
fame she reached a lifetime
weight peak of almost 300 pounds [ 3 ]
on her 5'3" frame. Her
weight led her to be parodied on
Saturday Night Live
by
Chris
Farley
and also publicly mocked by
Howard
Stern .
Dieting was ineffective; she lost weight only to regain it later. In
August 1999, she underwent
gastric bypass surgery , which she
felt was a life-saving decision. The
procedure was broadcast live on the
internet . [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
As a result, she went from a size 28 to a size 6 and lost 150 pounds.
In
2003 she posed nude for
Playboy
to display her new body.
Carnie later toured TV
talk shows
and hosted her own
infomercial
to publicize her satisfaction with the procedure. However, she
eventually gained back some weight and ended up as a contestant on the
fourth season of VH1's
Celebrity Fit Club
in 2006. Over the course of the show she lost 22 pounds, which she
eventually gained back. [ 6 ]
In May 2008, she was widely ridiculed for her weight gain [ 7 ]
and vowed to get back in Playboy shape, and hopefully pose nude for
them again. [ 8 ]
In March of 2010, Carnie became the spokesperson for gourmet meal
delivery diet program, The Fresh Diet
http://www.thefreshdiet.com .
She has lost 10 LBS on the plan so far.
Personal life
She has publicly acknowledged having a lesbian experience in her
teens. [ 9 ]

In April 2005, they
welcomed their first daughter, Lola Sofia Bonfiglio. On June 12, 2009,
their second daughter, Luciana "Luci" Bella, was born. [ 10 ] To see more of Who Is

Who is William Sanford Nye?
Who is William Sanford Nye ?The world knows him as
Bill Nye, he is an
American
comedian ,
television host ,
science educator
and
mechanical engineer .
He is best known as the host of the Disney children's science show
Bill Nye the Science Guy
(1993–1997) and for his many subsequent appearances in popular media as a
science educator .
Education and early
career
Nye was born born on November 27, 1955. He started in Washington, D.C. as a fourth-generation
Washingtonian
on his father's side of family. After attending Lafayette Elementary
and Alice Deal Junior High in the city, he was accepted to the private
Sidwell Friends School
on a partial
scholarship, graduating in 1973. He studied
mechanical engineering
at
Cornell University 's Sibley School of Mechanical and
Aerospace Engineering, where one of his professors was
Carl
Sagan ,and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1977.
Nye began his career in
Seattle
at
Boeing
at which point, among other things, he starred in training films and
developed a
hydraulic pressure
resonance suppressor still used in the
747 .
Later, he worked as a
consultant
and in the
aeronautics
industry. Nye told the
St. Petersburg Times
in 1999 that he applied
to be a
NASA
astronaut
every few years but was always rejected.
The Science Guy
Nye began his professional entertainment career as an actor on a
local
sketch comedy
television show in
Seattle ,
Almost Live! ; Nye attempted to correct the host of
Almost
Live!
after the host pronounced " gigawatt " as "jigowatt".
The character name came from the host's comment, "Who do you think you
are? Bill Nye the Science Guy?" and Nye was thereafter known as such on
the program. His other main recurring role on
Almost Live!
was as
Speedwalker, a speedwalking Seattle superhero.
Coincidentally, in 1992–1993, he appeared in the live-action
educational segments of
Back to the Future: The
Animated Series
with a non-speaking role as an assistant to
Dr.
Emmett Brown , played by
Christopher Lloyd , where he would demonstrate science with
Lloyd's voice-over.
This national popularity led to Nye hosting the educational
television program
Bill Nye the
Science Guy
from 1993 to
1997. Each of the 100 episodes aimed to teach a specific topic in
science
to a
preteen
audience, yet it garnered a wide adult
audience as well. The show was somewhat popular as a school resource and
is still used to this day. He has written several books as
The
Science Guy . In addition to hosting the show, he was also a writer
and
producer
for the series, which was
filmed entirely in
Seattle .
When portraying "the Science Guy", Nye wears a light blue
lab coat
and a
bow tie
and takes on
the personality of an excited, jocular science educator.
This popular image of Nye has been parodied by numerous sources,
including the
webcomic
xkcd
and the
satirical news
organization
The
Onion . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
In response to the fake headline "Crack Nearly Killed Me", Nye took the
joke in good humor and sent
The Onion
an email thanking them for
"dealing compassionately with this matter."
His Science Guy persona appeared alongside
Ellen DeGeneres
and
Alex
Trebek
in
Ellen's Energy
Adventure , an attraction that has played since 1996 at the
Universe of Energy
pavilion inside
Epcot
at
Walt Disney World . He also has a
voice-over at the
DINOSAUR
attraction in
Disney's Animal Kingdom
park, where
he tells guests about the dinosaurs while they queue for the ride. In
addition, he appears in the "Design Lab" of CyberSpace Mountain inside
DisneyQuest
at
Walt Disney World
where he refers
to himself as "Bill Nye the Coaster Guy."
Post- Science Guy
career
Nye remained interested in science education through entertainment.
He created a 13-episode
PBS
KCTS-TV
series about science, called
The Eyes of Nye , aimed at an older audience than his
previous show. Airing in 2005, it often featured episodes based on
politically relevant themes such as
genetically modified food ,
global warming , and
race .
He played in Disney's 1998 TV movie
The Principal Takes a Holiday ;
he made a
hovercraft , in order to demonstrate science in an
unusual classroom manner. From 2000 to 2002, Nye was the technical
expert in
BattleBots . In 2004 and 2005, Nye hosted
100
Greatest Discoveries , an award-winning series produced by
THINKFilm
for
Discovery Channel -spinoff
The Science Channel
and in high
definition on the
Discovery HD Theater .
He was also host of an eight-part Discovery Channel series called
Greatest
Inventions with Bill Nye .
Nye has guest starred in several episodes of the crime drama
Numb3rs
as an engineering faculty member. A lecture Nye gave several years ago
on exciting children about math was an inspiration for creating the
Numb3rs
show which he made multiple guest appearances in.
Bill joined the
American Optometric Association
in a
multimedia
advertising campaign
to
educate
parents
on the importance of getting their
children
a comprehensive
eye examination .
He was a regular in
TV Land
discussions. He has also made guest
appearances on the
VH1
reality show
America's Most Smartest Model .
Nye appears in segments of
The Climate Code
on
The
Weather Channel
telling his personal ways of saving energy. He still
makes regular appearances on the show, often asking quiz questions.
As of fall 2008, Nye also appears on the daytime
game
show
Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire , as part of the show's re-introduced "Ask the
Expert"
lifeline .
He currently hosts
Stuff Happens , a show on the new
Planet Green
network .
In November 2008, Nye appeared in an acting role as himself in the
fifth-season episode " Brain Storm " of
Stargate Atlantis
alongside fellow television
personality and
astrophysicist
Neil deGrasse Tyson .
Nye has appeared numerous times on the
talk
show
Larry King Live , speaking about topics
such as
global warming
and
UFOs .
He argued that global warming is an issue that should be
addressed by
governments of the world in part because it could be implicated in the
record-setting
2005 Atlantic hurricane season .
On UFOs he has been skeptical of
extraterrestrial
explanations for
sightings such as those at
Roswell
and
Malmstrom Air Force Base
(1967).
In 2009, portions of Bill Nye's shows were used as lyrics and
portions of the second
Symphony of Science
science education music video by
composer John Boswell.
Nye recorded a short YouTube video (as himself, not his TV persona)
advocating clean energy
climate change legislation on behalf of Al
Gore's
Repower America
campaign
in October 2009.

missions. Known as
MarsDial ,
it included small colored panels to provide a basis for
color calibration
in addition to helping keep track of
time. [ 20 ]

magnifying glass
created by filling a clear plastic bag with
water .

Class of '56 University Professor at
Cornell University .
When
Pluto
was
reclassified
from a
planet
to a
dwarf planet
by the
International Astronomical
Union
in 2006, Nye came out in favor of the change. Nye held a
conference in 2006 discussing his opinion on the issue.
Since 2006, Nye has lived in Los Angeles in a 1930s
stucco
home with ecologically-friendly modifications.
As of July 2007, Nye and environmental activist
Ed Begley, Jr.
are engaging in a friendly competition "to see
who could have the lowest carbon footprint," according to Begley.
In a 2008 interview, Nye joked that he wants to "crush Ed Begley" in
their environmental competition. ]
Nye and Begley are neighbors in Los Angeles, and sometimes dine
together at a local vegetarian restaurant. ]

in
Los
Angeles .

Who is Sarah Michelle Prinze?
Who is Sarah Michelle Prinze?
The entertainment world knows her professionally by her birth name of
Sarah
Michelle Gellar , is an American film and television actress. She
became widely known for her role as the character
Buffy
Summers
in the
television series
Buffy the Vampire Slayer ,
for which she won a total of six
Teen Choice Awards
and the
Saturn
Award
for Best Genre TV Actress and received a
Golden Globe Award
nomination. She won a
Daytime Emmy Award
for her work in
All My Children
as character
Kendall Hart .
Her film work includes starring roles in
I Know What You Did Last Summer
(1997) ,
Cruel Intentions
(1999) ;
Scooby-Doo
(2002) ; the American remake
of Japanese horror film
The
Grudge
(2004) ; and
The Return
(2006) . Gellar also
played an ex-porn star in Richard Kelly's
Southland Tales
(2007)
and was part of an ensemble cast
in
The Air I Breathe
(2008) . Gellar also
stars in
Veronika Decides to Die
(2010).
Early life
Gellar was born in
New
York City , the only child of Rosellen ( née
Greenfield), a nursery school
teacher, and Arthur Gellar, a
garment
worker.
Both of her parents were
Jewish , though Gellar's family had a
Christmas tree
during the holidays while she was growing up.
In 1984, her parents divorced and she was brought up by her mother on
the
Upper East Side . She was estranged from her father from
this time until his death from
liver cancer
on October 9, 2001.
Early career
Sarah was born April 14, 1977. At the age of four, she was spotted by an agent in a restaurant in
Uptown
Manhattan .
Two weeks later, she auditioned for a part in
An Invasion of Privacy ,
a
made-for-television
film starring
Valerie Harper ,
Carol
Kane
and
Jeff Daniels . At the audition, Gellar read both
her own lines and those of Harper, impressing the directors enough to
cast her in the role. She subsequently appeared in a controversial
television commercial
for
Burger King , in which her character criticized
McDonald's
and claimed to eat only at Burger King. This led to a
lawsuit
by McDonald's. As a child, Gellar modeled for magazines.
Gellar appeared in TV series such as
Spenser: For Hire
and
Crossbow , and had minor roles in
the films
Funny Farm
(1988)
and
High
Stakes
(1989).
In 1991, she appeared as a young
Jacqueline Bouvier
in the TV movie
A Woman Named Jackie .
Gellar's first major break came in 1992, when she starred in the
serial
Swans Crossing
and was subsequently cast
in the soap opera
All My Children , playing
Kendall Hart , the long-lost daughter of
character
Erica Kane
( Susan
Lucci ). In 1995, at the age of eighteen, she won a
Daytime Emmy Award
for
Outstanding Younger Leading Actress in a Drama Series
for
the role.
It was on the set of this
soap
opera
that she met
Michelle Trachtenberg , who would later
join the cast of
Buffy the Vampire Slayer . Gellar also met
co-star
Sydney Penny , with whom she remains friends.
Breakthrough
(1997–2003)
Gellar left
All My Children
in 1995. Gellar stated that she
was screen tested eleven times (originally auditioning for the role of
Cordelia ), before she landed the lead in the 1997
TV series
Buffy the Vampire Slayer , playing a
teenager burdened with the responsibility of fighting a number of
mystical foes, mostly vampires. The show was well received by critics
and audiences alike, spawning a spin-off series ( Angel ), which featured three episodes in which she
guest starred. Throughout its seven seasons and a total of 144 episodes,
Buffy , and by extension Gellar, became cult icons in the
United
States ,
Canada , the
UK
and
Australia , particularly as an archetype of an
"empowered" woman. Gellar
sang several of the songs during the
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
musical episode " Once
More, with Feeling ", which spawned an original
cast album .
Gellar has also hosted
Saturday Night Live
a total of three times (1998,
1999, and 2002), appearing in a number of comedy sketches.
In 2000,
Gellar guest appeared as Debbie in the HBO series
Sex and the City
episode "Escape from New York".
Gellar
has lent her voice to animated TV series,
The
Simpsons ,
King of the Hill , and several episodes of
Robot
Chicken .
Gellar built on her television fame with a motion picture career, and
had intermittent commercial success. After roles in the popular
thrillers
I Know What You Did Last Summer
and
Scream
2
(both 1997) , she starred in the 1999 film
Simply Irresistible , a
romantic comedy.
Cruel Intentions
(1999) , a modern-day retelling of
Les Liaisons dangereuses
featured a kiss
between Gellar and co-star
Selma
Blair
that won the two the "Best Kiss" award at the 2000
MTV Movie Awards . This film was a modest hit at the
box
office, grossing over $38 million in the United States and over $75
million worldwide, and earned several
awards and nominations . Critic
Roger
Ebert
stated that Gellar and co-star
Ryan Phillippe
"develop a convincing emotional charge"
and that Gellar is "effective as a bright girl who knows exactly how to
use her act as a tramp".
Gellar’s role showed her versatility as an actress, and many were
surprised to see her playing a brunette cocaine addict with an appetite
for manipulating and using people. Her performance was praised by a
number of critics, including Rob Blackwelder for SPLICEDwire, who wrote
about the “dazzling performance by Sarah Michelle Gellar who plunges
headlong into the lascivious malevolence that makes Kathryn so
delightfully wicked. (Plus she looks great in a corset.)”.
Gellar next played a lead role in
James
Toback 's critically unsuccessful independent
Harvard
Man
(2001),
where she played the daughter of a mobster. The
movie included two sex scenes with Gellar, helping her shed her good
girl image even more after 1999's
Cruel Intentions .
During her growing film career Gellar continued work on the
television series
Buffy the Vampire Slayer , however she decided
to leave the show, after the seventh season. When asked why, she
explained, "This isn't about leaving for a career in movies, or in
theater – it's more of a personal decision. I need a rest."
Shortly after the show's end, Gellar stated that she had no interest in
appearing in a
Buffy
feature film,
although since then she has said she will consider it if the script is
good enough.
She did not appear in the final season of
Angel , causing the intended episode (" You're
Welcome ") to be rewritten for the character of
Cordelia Chase .
Gellar has said that she was willing to appear in the episode, but
scheduling conflicts and family problems prevented it.
Another actress voiced Buffy for an animated series based on the show,
which never aired, and the various
Buffy
video games.
In her feature in
Esquire
magazine Gellar expressed her pride
for her work on
Buffy , "I truly believe that it is one of the
greatest shows of all time and it will go down in history as that. And I
don’t feel that that is a cocky statement. We changed the way that
people looked at television."
Gellar's likeness is used in the
comic continuation
of
the series.
Later
career (2004–present)
Gellar in
Dubai
in December 2004.
After the end of
Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Gellar's next film
was the 2004 horror film
The
Grudge , which was a success at the box office. David
Wirtschafter, the president of the
William Morris Agency
(which
represented Gellar), subsequently told
The New Yorker
that the success of
The Grudge
"takes our client Sarah Michelle Gellar, who now is nothing at all,
and...makes her a star, potentially. Suddenly, the Sarah Michelle Gellar
space is meaningful". The remark led Gellar to terminate her
association with the agency; Gellar is now represented by the
Creative Artists Agency .
Gellar appeared in the sequel
The
Grudge 2 ,
which opened in October 2006; in the film, she has a
minor role reprising her character from the first film. Gellar next
appeared in the thriller
The Return , which was released
the following month. Sarah played a businesswoman haunted by memories of
her childhood and the mysterious death of a young woman. The movie was
marketed as a
horror
movie and many including critics were
surprised to find
The Return
was, as Rafe Telsch said, "just a
murder mystery with a few supernatural elements". The movie pulled in a
disappointing $4,800,000 weekend gross with little promotion.
Gellar then lent her voice to two animated films: the animated fairy
tale
Happily N'Ever After ,
and
Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles . She followed those with a string of films
including
Southland Tales ,
The Air I Breathe ,
Suburban
Girl
(earlier known as
"A Girl's Guide to Hunting and
Fishing" ), and
Possession
(a supernatural
thriller based on the
South Korean
film
Jungdok
known to English language audiences
as
Addicted ).
Southland Tales
opened at the
Cannes Film Festival
in May 2006 and was released in
the US in November 2007.
Suburban Girl
and
The Air I Breathe
were screened at
the 2007
Tribeca Film Festival .
Suburban
Girl
eventually went straight to video in early 2008, much to fans'
disappointment. It was described as "a blend of
Sex and the City
and
The Devil Wears Prada " and a
"pseudo-sophisticated romantic comedy" according to Variety.com.
Her on screen chemistry with Alec Baldwin was either criticised or
praised, with Eye For Film commenting, "The film works best when Baldwin
and Gellar are together – aside from the fact that Gellar seriously
needs to eat a bun or two".
Film website moviepictirefilm.com stated "Gellar and Baldwin both give
wonderful performances and make their chemistry incredibly real and
ultimately, quite heartbreaking. Containing a ton of laughs and killer
fashion that could give "The Devil Wears Prada" a run for its money,
this movie has something uncommon in most romantic comedies, tons of
style and a huge heart."
The Air I Breathe
was released theatrically the same month to
generally poor reviews.
The New York Times
called it a "gangster
movie with delusions of grandeur."
However, Gellar's performance was praised by a number of critics,
DVD
Talk Review
noted that "her character here has the deepest
emotional arc, and she hits all the right notes."
Gellar was offered a role in
Stardust
but turned it down to
spend more time with her husband.
Other roles she turned down include an undisclosed role in
The
Faculty . She was also offered the role of Brittany Foster in
The In Crowd , but turned it down. The part
later went to
Susan Ward .
On June 25, 2008, it was announced she is no longer attached to the
film version of the video game
American McGee's Alice .
It was reported on September 25, 2008 that Gellar would return to
television in the HBO series
The Wonderful Maladys .The show is about three dysfunctional adult siblings living in New York
and struggling to deal with the loss of their parents years ago.
Creator
Charles
Randolph
told
Variety
that he wrote the part with Gellar in
mind,
and described Gellar's character as having "a kind of zealous
immaturity – like a drug addict with a to-do list."
Gellar and Randolph would serve as executive producers.
HBO
shot the
pilot in May 2009.
According to an interview with
Adam Scott
the show was not picked up.
The film
Possession , starring Gellar, has
had a range of release dates – starting with February 2008. The film was
finally set to be released in theatres in January 2009, but due to
financial problems at YARI Film Group,
the release was yet again pushed forward. In March 2009 it was
announced that the film would skip theatrical release altogether, and go
straight to DVD/Blu-Ray. It was set to be released on May 12, 2009.
However, the movie was not released on DVD/Blu-Ray as scheduled.
Possession
was released
straight to DVD
in March 2010.
Upcoming projects
Gellar also stars in
Veronika Decides to Die
(2009).
The film tells the story of a young woman suffering from severe
depression who rediscovers the joy in life when she finds out that she
only has days to live following a suicide attempt. Filming of the movie
began on May 12, 2008, in New York City
and finished in late June.
It was reported that Kate Bosworth was previously attached to the
project.
The film was released in Brazil on August 21, 2009.

Personal life
Gellar and husband
Freddie Prinze, Jr.
at the
Tribeca Film Festival
Gellar met her future husband
Freddie Prinze, Jr. , during filming of the 1997 teen
horror film
I Know What You Did Last Summer
but the two did not begin dating until 2000. They were engaged in April
2001 and married in
Mexico
on September 1, 2002 in a ceremony officiated
by
Adam Shankman , a film director and choreographer with whom
Gellar had worked on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer . Gellar's
bridesmaid was her closest friend of many years,
Lindsay Sloane .
In 2007, Gellar legally changed her name to Sarah Michelle Prinze in
honor of the couple's fifth year of marriage.
In 2004, while filming
The Grudge
in
Japan ,
Gellar visited the famous Japanese swordsmith Shoji Yoshihara (Kuniie
III) and bought a
Katana
from him as a birthday present for her
husband.
Gellar learned that she needed clearance from the Japanese government
to remove the sword from the country and, after eventually succeeding,
stated that it was "incredibly difficult" to do.
Gellar has reflected on her choices as an actress; she frequently
mentions how "proud" she is of
Buffy the Vampire Slayer . She has
also been her own critic, talking about movie roles she has taken,
saying, " Simply Irresistible
was just a bad choice — and for
that, it was a great learning experience. I wasn't ready to make that
movie. I was too young. The script was not ready. I knew in my heart
before I left to make it that I should back out."
During her 2006 interview with
Marie
Claire , Gellar spoke about her thoughts on the movie industry
for women. She spoke about her views on the roles of women in movies
saying, "You realize it's a very tough market for women. For me it's
about getting roles where women get to do something active, not the
girlfriend, not the wife. There are mainly two types of roles for us,
women in-jeopardy films and romantic movies." [ 48 ]
Gellar has been praised by fans and critics alike for being a strong
role model for young girls and women. Gellar went on to speak about how
the business has changed and about magazine-cover
attention-seeking
Hollywood-starlets. Gellar said (when the interviewer said she was
shocked at how many actresses seem to 'need' to be on the cover of a
magazine like
Us Weekly ), "Can I interrupt you? Do you think
those actresses strive to be on those covers? Because I don't, I think
it's people striving to get that celebrity position, but I think you'll
find that most 'actors' don't want that. Because when you know too much
about them, it takes away the illusion that a film creates." [ 48 ]
Gellar is an active advocate for various charities, including
breast
cancer
research,
Project Angel Food ,
Habitat for Humanity
and
CARE , a leading
humanitarian
organization fighting global
poverty ,
all of which she says you get to "physically do something". She says,
"I started because my mother taught me a long time ago that even when
you have nothing, there's ways to give back. And what you get in return
for that is tenfold. But it was always hard because I couldn't do a lot.
I couldn't do much more than just donate money when I was on the show
because there wasn't time. And now that I have the time, it's amazing." [ 49 ]
Gellar has said in interviews that she believes in
God , but does
not belong to an organized religion. [ 4 ]
Gellar has said in interviews that she collects rare editions of
classic children's literature. [ 50 ]
Gellar has four tattoos. She has a symbol for integrity on her lower
back; a heart, a dagger and a cherry blossom on her ankle and two
dragonflies on her back. [ 51 ]
Gellar has revealed that she suffers from a
phobia
of
being buried alive. She has said "I really fear graveyards and I have a
big phobia of being buried alive. It was really hard being an
ass-kicking vampire slayer when you are afraid of graves." [ 52 ]
Gellar and Prinze have a daughter, Charlotte Grace Prinze, born on
September 19, 2009. [ 53 ]
