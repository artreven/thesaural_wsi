The Seventeenth Amendment (Amendment XVII) Will Be the States of the United States undoing...
The
Seventeenth Amendment
( Amendment XVII ) to the
United States Constitution
established direct election of
United States Senators
by popular vote. The amendment supersedes
Article I, § 3 , Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution, under which Senators were elected by
state legislatures .
It also alters the procedure for filling vacancies in the Senate, to be
consistent with the method of election. It was adopted on April 8,
1913.
“
The Senate of the United
States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the
people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote.
The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for
electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures. When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue
writs of election
to fill such vacancies:
Provided ,
That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to
make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by
election as the legislature may direct.
This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or
term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the
Constitution.
”
History Senate election by Constitution Originally, each Senator was elected by his state's legislature to represent that state in the Senate. [ 1 ]
This was intended to protect each state's power within the
federation
established by the Constitution by having its own direct representation
in the Congress. While an unqualified candidate might win a
popular-vote majority through
demagoguery
or superficial qualities, the legislature, which could deliberate on
its choice, and whose members had been selected by their constituents
and had experience in politics, were thought safe from such folly.
Finally, election by the legislature was expected to insulate Senators
from the distraction of public campaigning for election or re-election,
leaving them free to concentrate on the great business of the federal
government. This last purpose was also served by the six-year term for
Senators, compared to the two-year term for
U.S. Representatives .
Senate election in practice Election by legislatures generally occurred without major problems up
to the mid-1850s. There were frequent vacancies of a few days up to
several months, but these nearly always occurred when Congress was not
in session. In the 1850s, the
sectional crisis over slavery
led to increasing partisanship and strife. As a result,
Indiana
failed to elect a Senator from March 1855 to February 1857 [ why? ] , while
California
failed to elect one from March 1855 to January 1857. California had
previously failed to elect from March 1851 through January 1852, missing
two months of the first session of the
32nd Congress , while
Delaware
failed to elect from September 1839 to January 1841, missing the entire first session and half the second session of the
26th Congress .
After the
Civil War , the problems multiplied. In one case in the mid-1860s, the election of Senator
John P. Stockton
from New Jersey was contested on the grounds that he had been elected by a
plurality
rather than a majority in the state legislature. [ 2 ]
Stockton asserted that the exact method for elections was murky and
varied from state to state. To keep this from happening again, Congress
passed a law in 1866 regulating how and when Senators were to be elected
from each state. This was the first change in the process of Senatorial
elections. While the law helped, there were still deadlocks in some
legislatures and accusations of bribery, corruption, and suspicious
dealings in some elections. Nine bribery cases were brought before the
Senate between 1866 and 1906, and 45 deadlocks occurred in 20 states
between 1891 and 1905, resulting in numerous delays in seating Senators.
In the worst case, Delaware failed to elect from March 1899 to March
1903; by the end of this period both of Delaware's seats were vacant for
two years. [ 3 ]
Senate election reform
William Randolph Hearst
Publisher - reformer
Cosmopolitan Magazine
David Graham Phillips
Journalist - muckraker
exposed corruption Reform efforts began as early as 1826, when direct election was first proposed. [ citation needed ]
In the 1870s, citizens petitioned the House of Representatives for direct election. [ citation needed ]
From 1893 to 1902, support for direct election increased considerably.
Each year during that period, a constitutional amendment for direct
election was proposed in Congress, but the Senate rejected it. [ citation needed ]
In the mid-1890s, the
Populist Party
put direct election of Senators in its platform, but neither the
Democrats
nor the
Republicans
paid much notice at the time. [ citation needed ]
Direct election was also part of the
Wisconsin Idea
championed by Republican Senators
Robert M. La Follette, Sr. , a
progressive , and
George W. Norris , a reformer. In the early 1900s,
Oregon
pioneered direct election of Senators. Oregon tried various procedures until success in 1907, and was soon followed by
Nebraska .
Popular support of Senatorial election reform grew rapidly at this time. In 1905,
William Randolph Hearst
acquired
Cosmopolitan
(then a general-interest magazine), and made it an advocate of direct election. In 1906,
Cosmopolitan
published " The Treason of the Senate ", a series of scathing articles by " Muckraking " reporter
David Graham Phillips , which described Senators as corrupt pawns of industrialists and financiers. [ 4 ]
A prime example was Senator
William A. Clark
of Montana. [ 5 ]
Increasingly, Senators were elected based on state referenda, similar
to the means developed by Oregon. By 1912, as many as 29 states elected
Senators either as nominees of party
primaries , or in conjunction with a
general election . These
de facto
directly elected Senators supported legislation to promote direct
election, but to make direct election general, a constitutional
amendment was required.
Senate election amendment The Senate had consistently rejected the proposed amendment, and so
direct election advocates acted through the states. Amendments to the
Constitution are normally proposed by Congress, a two-thirds vote of
both Houses being required. However, under Article V, two-thirds of the
states may apply for the creation of a
convention to propose amendments
and the Congress must then create one. By 1910, almost two-thirds of
the states had called for such a convention, which put pressure on the
Congress to propose the amendment and eliminate the need for the
convention.
Joseph L. Bristow
US Senator (R) Kansas
submitted amendment
William Borah
US Senator (R) Idaho
supported amendment Consequently, in 1911, Senator
Joseph L. Bristow
of
Kansas
submitted an amendment, supported by Senator
William Borah
of
Idaho , himself a product of direct election. Eight
Southern
Senators and all of the Republican Senators from
New England ,
New York
and
Pennsylvania
opposed Bristow's amendment. However, the Senate now included many Senators recently chosen by
de facto
direct election, and they supported the amendment. The Senate passed
the amendment on June 12, 1911. The House debated for almost a year, and
passed the amendment on May 13, 1912.
The campaign for ratification was led by Borah and other directly
elected Senators. Another important figure was Professor George H.
Haynes of
Worcester Polytechnic Institute , a
political scientist
whose scholarly work on the Senate showed the need for direct election.
The amendment was ratified by three states within a month
(Massachusetts, Arizona, and Minnesota). However, there was no further
progress until 1913, when state legislators elected in 1912 took office.
Nine states ratified in January 1913, seventeen in February, four in
March, and three in April. On April 8, 1913, the Seventeenth Amendment
was adopted when
Connecticut
became the 36th state (out of 48) to ratify. Louisiana also ratified
the amendment in June. Utah was the only state to explicitly reject the
amendment. The Seventeenth Amendment took effect a year and a half prior
to the
1914 Senate elections .
Effect The Seventeenth Amendment restates the first paragraph of Article I, §
3 of the Constitution, but replaces the phrase "chosen by the
Legislature thereof" with "elected by the people thereof".
The amendment also supersedes part of the second paragraph of Article
I, § 3. The phrase "and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or
otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the
Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting
of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies" is superseded
by the second paragraph of the amendment.
Under the original language, when a Senate seat fell vacant, the
legislature, which could act immediately, was expected to elect a
replacement immediately. If the legislature was not in session, the
governor could appoint a person to occupy the vacant seat, but that
person would serve only until the legislature next met, when it was
expected to elect a permanent replacement.
However, unlike election by the legislature, election of a
replacement by popular vote takes a fair amount of time and cost, and
may not be realistically possible. For instance, there may be only a few
weeks or months left before the end of the present Senate term.
Therefore, when and how popular elections of replacement Senators are
held is up to the legislature. The replacement Senator appointed by the
governor serves until the election specified by the legislature, if one
is held, or else till the end of the term.
Several states have interpreted this passage as giving the
legislature power to bar appointment by the governor, so that vacancies
may only be filled by election. As of 2010,
Connecticut ,
Oklahoma ,
Oregon , and
Wisconsin
do not permit appointment by the governor.
The Seventeenth Amendment does not affect the restriction in Article
I, § 4, cl. 1, which exempts "the place of Chusing Senators" from the
power of Congress to "make or alter" state election laws. If Congress
could regulate the "place of Chusing Senators" when the state
legislatures chose Senators, then Congress could dictate where a state's
legislature had to meet for that purpose, which would violate state
sovereignty.
Direct elections held in the states The following is a list of all direct elections to the Senate. [ 6 ]
Before ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment:
1906: Oregon
Class 2, Vacancy, term ending 1907
Class 2, Full term, 1907–1913
1908: Nevada
Class 3, Full term, 1909–1915
1911: Arizona (pending statehood)
Class 1, Long term, 1912–1917
Class 3, Short term, 1912–1915
1912: Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Oklahoma
Class 2, Full term, 1913–1919
After ratification of Seventeenth Amendment:
1913: Maryland, Virginia
Class 1, Vacancy, term ending 1917
1914: All 32 Class 3 Senators, term 1915-1921
1916: All 32 Class 1 Senators, term 1917-1923
1918: All 32 Class 2 Senators, term 1919-1925
Oklahoma ,
admitted to statehood in 1907, chose a Senator by legislative election
three times: twice in 1907, when admitted, and once in 1908. In 1912,
Oklahoma re-elected
Robert L. Owen
by advisory popular vote.
New Mexico , admitted to statehood in 1912, chose only its first two Senators legislatively.
Arizona , admitted to statehood in 1912, chose its first two Senators by advisory popular vote.
Alaska , and
Hawaii , admitted to statehood in 1959, have never chosen a U.S. Senator legislatively.
Proposal and ratification Congress proposed the Seventeenth Amendment on May 13, 1912 and the following states ratified the amendment: [ 7 ]
Massachusetts (May 22, 1912)
Arizona (June 3, 1912)
Minnesota (June 10, 1912)
New York (January 15, 1913)
Kansas (January 17, 1913)
Oregon (January 23, 1913)
North Carolina (January 25, 1913)
California (January 28, 1913)
Michigan (January 28, 1913)
Iowa (January 30, 1913)
Montana (January 30, 1913)
Idaho (January 31, 1913)
West Virginia (February 4, 1913)
Colorado (February 5, 1913)
Nevada (February 6, 1913)
Texas (February 7, 1913)
Washington (February 7, 1913)
Wyoming (February 8, 1913)
Arkansas (February 11, 1913)
Maine (February 11, 1913)
Illinois (February 13, 1913)
North Dakota (February 14, 1913)
Wisconsin (February 18, 1913)
Indiana (February 19, 1913)
New Hampshire (February 19, 1913)
Vermont (February 19, 1913)
South Dakota (February 19, 1913)
Oklahoma (February 24, 1913)
Ohio (February 25, 1913)
Missouri (March 7, 1913)
New Mexico (March 13, 1913)
Nebraska (March 14, 1913)
New Jersey (March 17, 1913)
Tennessee (April 1, 1913)
Pennsylvania (April 2, 1913)
Connecticut (April 8, 1913)
With Connecticut's ratification, three-fourths of the states had
ratified and so the amendment was adopted. The amendment was
subsequently ratified by the following states:
Louisiana (June 11, 1913)
Delaware (June 25, 2010) [ 8 ]
The following state rejected the amendment:
Utah (February 26, 1913)
The following states did not ratify the amendment:
Alabama
Kentucky
Mississippi
Virginia
South Carolina
Georgia
Maryland
Rhode Island
Florida
As Alaska and Hawaii were not states when the amendment was adopted,
their admissions to the Union in 1959 simply required their adherence to
the Constitution in its already-amended form.
Advocacy for repeal A movement exists that calls for the repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment, generally opposing it on grounds of
federalism
and taking away too much power from the states. Proponents of repeal
have also accused Senators of being hostage to special interests, the
same charge that helped pass the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. [ 9 ]
Repeal gained renewed interest in 2004, when U.S. Senator
Zell Miller
of
Georgia ,
shortly after announcing his intention to retire from the Senate,
introduced a resolution in the Senate to repeal the Seventeenth
Amendment. Miller said:
Direct elections of Senators ... allowed Washington's special
interests to call the shots, whether it is filling judicial vacancies,
passing laws, or issuing regulations. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Miller's resolution never made it out of committee; it has been noted
that it is unlikely for Senators elected by the popular vote to back a
change to the method that worked for them. [ 12 ]
The movement to repeal gained new prominence in 2010, with many leaders of the
Tea Party movement
advocating its repeal on grounds of restoring power to the states. [ 13 ] [ 14 ]
The issue affected several Republican primaries of 2010; support of the
amendment was portrayed as a "Washington insider" position. [ 15 ]
Tim Bridgewater , one of the candidates who ousted Republican Senator
Bob Bennett
in the
Utah Republican Nominating Convention , advocates repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment. In the
Republican primary of Idaho's first district , both
NRCC -endorsed candidate Vaughn Ward and state representative
Raúl Labrador
initially advocated repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment. Ward later
said that he supported direct election of Senators, and clarified that
his opposition to the Seventeenth Amendment meant that he was in favor
of
term limits for Senators . [ 16 ]
Ward lost the primary to Labrador, who maintained his position in favor of repeal. [ 17 ]
In Ohio's 15th District, Republican candidate
Steve Stivers
initially supported repeal before backing off almost immediately after Representative
Mary Jo Kilroy , his Democratic opponent, attacked him over this position. [ 15 ]
Republican Representative
Louie Gohmert
of
Texas's 1st congressional district
advocated repeal in March 2010. [ 18 ] [ 19 ]
Cleon Skousen 's
The Five Thousand Year Leap
(1981) is a source for many Tea Party supporters and candidates who
have argued for the amendment's repeal. Skousen wrote, “Since
[enactment] there has been no veto power which the states could exercise
against the Congress in those cases where a federal statute was deemed
in violation of states’ rights." The book gained higher prominence in
2009 after
Glenn Beck
recommended it for the
Taxpayer March on Washington -9/12 groups. [ 20 ]
Advocacy for prohibiting gubernatorial appointment to the Senate 2008–2009 Senate vacancies With the commencement of the
Obama administration
in 2009, four sitting Democratic Senators left the Senate for executive branch positions:
Barack Obama
(President),
Joe Biden
(Vice President),
Hillary Rodham Clinton
(Secretary of State), and
Ken Salazar
(Secretary of the Interior). Controversies developed about the successor appointments made by
Illinois Governor
Rod Blagojevich
and
New York Governor
David Paterson . This created interest in abolishing Senate appointment by the governor. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]
Currently, 46 of the 50 states permit appointment by the governor;
only Connecticut, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Wisconsin rely completely on
special election. In eight other states, the governor may fill a vacancy
by appointment, but a special election is to be held as soon as
possible. In the remaining 38 states, the governor may fill a vacancy by
appointment, and the appointed Senator will serve until a replacement
is chosen by election at the time of the next general election.
The state of Massachusetts has seen considerable recent activity on
both sides of this issue. Massachusetts enacted a law requiring a
special election in 2004; the Democratic legislature wanted to prevent
Republican Governor
Mitt Romney
from appointing a Republican replacement if Democratic Senator
John Kerry
had won the 2004 presidential election. After the death of Senator
Ted Kennedy
in 2009, and with Kennedy's encouragement before his death, the state
changed its law to allow the governor to appoint an interim Senator. [ 23 ]
Massachusetts still required a special election to be held; a "caretaker" appointment of
Paul G. Kirk
by Governor
Deval Patrick
to succeed Kennedy [ 23 ]
was followed by a January 2010 special election in which Republican
Scott Brown
won.
It has also been noted that since the passage of the Seventeenth
Amendment, nearly one quarter of all Senators seated (182) first arrived
in the Senate by appointment. [ 24 ] [ 25 ]
Proposed amendment In 2009, Senator
Russ Feingold
of Wisconsin and Representative
David Dreier
of California proposed an amendment to remove the power of governors to appoint Senators. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ]
Senators
John McCain
and
Dick Durbin
became co-sponsors, as did Representative
John Conyers . [ 21 ]
On March 11, 2009, a joint hearing was held between the Senate and
House subcommittees on the Constitution regarding S.J. Res. 7 and H.J.
Res. 21. [ 29 ]
On August 6, 2009, the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution held a separate hearing. [ 30 ]
It was not reported out of committee.

Flags of the Colonial armies
Thus
it was that the earliest Colonial armies served under a variety of differently designed
flags.
On some the stars were displayed in rows of 4-5-4, on others the stars seemed
to be scattered in the field of blue without any sense of order.
The Third Maryland
Regiment was reported to have first used a flag similar to the one here as early as 1777.
We do know that such a flag, with a circle of 12 stars and one star in the center,
was present as early as January 17, 1781 at the Battle of Cowpens, South Carolina.
The original flag from that battle, with the stars arranged as seen here, now hangs in the
Maryland State House.
THE SYMBOLISM OF COLOR
If you
were with us in the Birth of A Nation exhibit, you remember how we learned that the
leaders of the American revolution felt that their actions were somehow predestined by
some higher power, that they not only had the right to declare independence from England
but a destiny to do so.
This thinking led them to represent the 13 colonies by
inserting stars in the field of blue, one star for each of the colonies.
They
considered the union of these 13 individual "states" somewhat like a
constellation in the heavens...several different stars arranged together to create a
picture in the universe.
The picture the stars created in the field of blue was
strictly symbolic, however.
The Congressional resolution establishing a flag of 13
red and white stripes and 13 stars in a field of blue did not establish HOW the stars
should be arranged, or even how many points each star would have.
For this reason
the earliest United States flags had a variety of designs.
On some, the "new
constellation" was represented by 6-pointed stars, others by 5-pointed stars. Most
historians believe that Francis Hopkinson of New Jersey was largely responsible for not
only the earlier Grand Union Flag, but that he was also responsible for the stars in the
new flag.
At the time the resolution was approved for the new flag, Mr. Hopkinson
was Chairman of the Continental Navy Board's Middle Department.
(Mr. Hopkinson was
also instrumental in the design for the seal of our Nation.)
The first Navy Stars
and Stripes flag displayed the 13 stars in alternating rows of three and two.
That
is the flag you see at the top of this page.
The Bennington Flag
While
many historians today believe that the distinctive BENNINGTON FLAG may have been made for
the 50th Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 1826, there is strong evidence
to indicate a flag similar to this was present on August 16, 1777 when General John Stark
and his "Green Mountain Boys" defeated the 600 German mercenaries at Bennington,
Vermont.
(You can see the flag of the Green Mountain Boys in our archives.)
This flag
is sometimes referred to also as the "Fillmore Flag".
Nathan Fillmore took
such a flag home from the battle of Bennington, where it was passed on through several
generations of Fillmore's, including President Millard Fillmore.
The Fillmore flag
is now on display at the Bennington Museum in Vermont.
The Betsy Ross Flag
Of
course, most of us remember the story of Betsy Ross and quickly recognize the "Betsy
Ross Flag" with the stars in a circle.
Betsy Ross made flags for the United
States for 50 years.
During the American Revolution she made flags for the
Pennsylvania State Navy as well as other military units.
The "Betsy Ross
Flag" as seen here, however, did not appear until the early 1790s, and there is no
solid evidence to support claims that Betsy Ross created the first stars and stripes.
