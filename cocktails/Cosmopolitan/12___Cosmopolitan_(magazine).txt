Quotes from the ultimate fun fearless female
Posted on
October 25, 2008

Some quotes from Helen Gurley Brown
Why quote her? well, you may or may not like all her values, but she got balls for sure, more balls than most men i meet, so, salute.
the quotes:
“Beauty can’t amuse you, but brainwork — reading, writing, thinking — can.”
“People think chutzpah is in the genes. It isn’t…it’s in the needing and wanting and being willing to fall on your face. It isn’t fun…who wants all that rejection, but life is sweeter if you make yourself do uncomfortable things.”
“The flirt reacts. She laughs at the jokes, clucks at the sad parts, applauds bravery. I really think it gets easier to flirt as you get older because you learn to listen to any man, employing the same charm and rapt attention you once reserved for seven-year-olds.”
“Money, if it does not bring you happiness, will at least help you be miserable in comfort.”
A bit of profile of Ms. Brown (was
editor-in-chief
of
Cosmopolitan
magazine for 32 years. In 1962, at the age of 40, Brown authored the bestselling book
Sex and the Single Girl . During the decade of the 1960s she was an outspoken advocate of women’s sexual freedom and sought to provide them with role-models and a guide in her magazine. Brown claimed that women could have it all, “love, sex, and money.” Due to her advocacy, the liberated single woman was often referred to generically as the “Cosmo Girl.”)
