The Crime of Partition
(Jun 14, 1919)
A Clipper Ship I Knew
(Oct 27, 1923)
27 June 1908
Founded by the publisher and investigative journalist
Peter Collier
in 1888, the New York magazine
Collier's
quickly became a major rival of
The Saturday Evening Post
and
Leslie's Weekly . Launched as
Collier's Once A Week , it changed its name to
Once a Week, An Illustrated Weekly Newspaper
in 1889,
Collier's Weekly, An Illustrated Journal
in 1895, and finally
Collier's, The National Weekly
in 1905. During the era of
muckraking
journalism,
Collier's
joined
Cosmopolitan ,
McClure's ,
Everybody's , and
Arena
in exposing fraudulent business practices, monopolies, and political graft. Its circulation, which had been 250,000 in the early 1890s, topped half a million under the editorship of
Norman Hapgood
(1902-1913), and a reduction in the cover price from ten to five cents helped push it over the million mark by 1917. Other editors included Mark Sullivan (1914-1917); the famous creator of 'Mr Dooley',
Finley Peter Dunne
(1917-1919); Harford Powel, Jr. (1919-1922); and Richard John Walsh (1922-1924).
Collier's
was an early exponent of the use of
halftones
in news reporting, thanks in part to the pioneering work of its photo-correspondent
James H. Hare
during the
1898 Spanish-American War
and the
1905 Russo-Japanese War . The magazine's high rates of pay attracted the cream of writers and illustrators, among them
Howard Chandler Christy
and
Charles Dana Gibson , while
hefty prize competitions
secured contributions from promising newcomers.
Arthur Conan Doyle 's
'The Return of Sherlock Holmes'
stories were first serialized in
Collier's
in 1903-1904, as were
Henry James 's
'The Turn of the Screw'
in 1898 and
H.G. Wells 's
Mr Britling Sees It Through
in 1916. Other prominent contributors were
H. Rider Haggard ,
Rudyard Kipling ,
O. Henry ,
Frank Norris ,
Edith Wharton ,
Arnold Bennett ,
Edgar Wallace ,
Jack London ,
Winston Churchill ,
Anthony Hope ,
Willa Cather , and
P.G. Wodehouse . Maritime and naval matters, including
submarine warfare , also featured regularly, ranging from Conan Doyle's
'Danger!'
to the winner of the 1914 Fiction Competition, James B. Connolly's
'The Trawler' . Between 1913 and 1949, the magazine published
Sax Rohmer 's famous
Fu Manchu
series.
Conrad's first contribution to
Collier's , 'The Crime of Partition', was intended to mobilize support for
Polish independence
at the upcoming
Versailles Peace Conference . 'It appeared here in the
Fortnightly Review
and was much more noticed generally than anything of the sort I have ever written,' Conrad told
John Quinn
in September 1919, adding: 'I am also very satisfied with its publication in Collier's Weekly' (CL 6:496).
