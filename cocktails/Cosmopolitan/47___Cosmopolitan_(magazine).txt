Caprice Bourret 06
Caprice Valerie Bourret
(born
October 24 ,
1971 ) [1]
is an
American
lingerie model and sometime actress, television personality and businesswoman. Much of her career has been in the
United Kingdom
where she is often known by her first name. Biography
Early life
Bourret (pronounced
Bour-Ray ) was born in
Hacienda Heights, California
to working class parents Dale Bourret and Valerie Pion; her family is
Jewish [2]
and originates from a
French -speaking area of
Canada . After growing up in
Whittier, California
she moved to the
United Kingdom
in 1996 to further her career in modelling. An appearance in a revealing dress at the 1996 British
National Television Awards
ceremony helped gain her public recognition.
Modeling career
Bourret became a cheerleader at age 13. Contrary to a popular trivia item, she never won the title of Miss Teen California, [3]
nor even participated in the pageant. In the years following, Bourret became one of the
UK 's better known models. She has had her
breasts
(now insured for £50,000) augmented, which may have led to her selection as a model for
Wonderbra . She appeared on the covers of
GQ ,
Cosmopolitan ,
Esquire ,
Maxim ,
FHM
and the
1998
Swimsuit Issue of
Sports Illustrated . Bourret also posed nude in the March,

magazine. She was voted
GQ magazine 's Woman of the Year
and
Maxim's International Woman of the Year
in three consecutive years. She has also been featured in television ad campaigns for

and
Pizza Hut .
She continues to be the face of
Paradise Poker.com , and also appears on billboards and advertisements in
London .
Lingerie line
Bourret is becoming known as a business woman, having launched a series of
lingerie , using her image and name. The lingerie is sold by the
UK
department store chain,
Debenhams
and lingerie retailer
figleaves . The line was well received and deemed a success, having sold millions of items, and is now in its sixth season. Consequently, Bourret has decided to expand her designing interest into a larger industry, and is now planning to market her lingerie line in
North America
and
Australia .
Has recently launched her own range of hair straighteners.
Other work
In
1999 , Bourret released her first single as a pop singer, "Oh Yeah" (#22), then follow-up single "Once Around the Sun" (also #22), which was co-written by '90s
one-hit wonder
Chesney Hawkes .
Bourret is also moving into an acting career, having appeared on stage in
London
in

and
Rent . She has also appeared in the low-budget films

and
Dream Team , and the one-off comedy show
Hospital .
In
1998 , Caprice became the host of a
UK
television
series, "Caprice's Travels". The series involves Bourret's tour through several major holiday destinations across the world. Bourret has also hosted
Friday Night's All Wright
as well as several award shows, including the European MTV awards and the Monaco World Music Awards in
1997 , the British National Television Awards in
1996 ,
1997
and
1998 , and several series for the
television
channels
VH1
and E! Entertainment.
In early
2005 , she appeared on

in the
UK , where other contestants implied that she was only taking part in order to boost sales of her products. During a boozy game of 'spin the bottle confessions' on the show, she confessed to thinking about having a lesbian romp.

Personal life
In
August 2006
Caprice, defended by
Nick Freeman , was banned from driving for one year and ordered to pay £2,500 costs when she was found guilty of drunk-driving. It also emerged that she had the previous year deceived her lawyers with a forged letter reported to be written by Nancy Davies. She fooled them into using it to obtain money illegally for her from a newspaper who had said her future mother in law called her a golddigger. Caprice repaid the money and avoided facing a criminal charge. [ citation needed ]
On February 20, 2007 The Sun newspaper reported that Caprice had been admitted to the London rehabilitation clinic,
The Priory , to seek help for depression. The report alleged that Caprice is undergoing addiction
therapy . [5]
However, Caprice's agent, Jonathan Lipman, has dismissed the allegations as untrue. He insisted that Caprice is "very happy", and added that she was holidaying with her boyfriend. [6] Source from :
