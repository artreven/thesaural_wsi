زندگی‌نامه [ ویرایش ]
شرزینگر در شهر هانولولوی هاوایی
آمریکا
از پدری فیلیپینی و مادری دو رگه روسی-هاوایی متولد شد. مادرش «رزمری» در زمان تولد نیکول هجده سال سن داشت و در محله‌ای فقیرنشین زندگی می‌کرد. والدین نیکول زمانی که او هنوز نوزاد بود از یکدیگر جدا شدند. خانواده مادری او، زمانی که نیکول شش سال سن داشت، به همراه خواهرش Ke'ala و پدرخوانده آلمانی - آمریکایی‌اش به لویویل (Louisville) در ایالت کنتاکی آمریکا نقل مکان کردند. به گفته خودش او به صورت کاتولیکی محافظه‌کار تربیت شده‌است، اگرچه که امروز دیگر کاتولیک نیست. او ابتدا در سن نوجوانی به مدرسه راهنمایی «Meyzeek Middle School» رفت. او بیان می‌کند که در دوران بزرگ شدنش پول زیادی نداشته و از مادرش به خاطر تمام پشتیبانی که از او کرده تا به جایی برسد که امروز هست، متشکر است. او اجرا را با شرکت در مدرسه «Youth Performing Arts» در دبیرستان «DuPont Manual High School» و اجرا کردن با «Actors Theatre of Louisville» آغاز نمود. این همزمان با آشنا شدنش با دوست قدیمی و بازیگرش «Liz Davito» بود. در سال ۱۹۹۶ شرزینگر به عنوان یک نوجوان، موفق شد اولین نایب قهرمان در مسابقه کلاسیک استعداد کوکاکولا در نمایشگاه ایالتی کنتاکی باشد.

Early life
Scherzinger was born in
Honolulu , Hawaii, into a
Catholic
family. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
Her father, Alfonso Valiente, [ 11 ]
is of
Filipino
descent, [ 12 ]
and her mother, Rosemary Elikolani, is of
Native Hawaiian [ 13 ]
and
Ukrainian
decent. [ 14 ]
Her mother was eighteen at the time of Scherzinger's birth and lived in an
inner city
neighborhood. [ 15 ]
Scherzinger's parents separated when she was still a baby. When she was six years old, her maternal family moved to
Louisville, Kentucky , [ 16 ]
with her sister, Keala, and her
German American
stepfather, Gary Scherzinger. [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
She took her stepfather's surname after he adopted her. [ 16 ]
She first attended Bowen Elementary, and later attended
Meyzeek Middle School
as an adolescent. Scherzinger states that, growing up, her family did not have a lot of money, and she thanks her mother for all the support she gave her to become what she is today. Scherzinger began performing in Louisville, attending the
Youth Performing Arts School
at
duPont Manual High School , and performing with
Actors Theatre of Louisville . [ 16 ]
As a teenager, Scherzinger was the first runner-up at the 1996
Kentucky State Fair 's Coca-Cola Talent Classic contest. [ 16 ]
In college, Scherzinger majored in musical theatre and minored in dance at
Wright State University , where she had a role in
Chicago
and in
Show Boat . [ 19 ]
She then put her studies in art on hold in 1999 to sing backing vocals for the rock band
Days of the New . [ 20 ]
Band leader
Travis Meeks
claims that after touring for the album, the two grew apart creatively and that despite being an "amazing entertainer," she "just didn't seem to understand music very well … she's just not much of a musician, nor [does she] understand music." [ 20 ]
Career
2001–02: Career beginnings and Eden's Crush
By the start of the
millennium , Scherzinger left Days of the New in the hopes of becoming a solo artist. [ 20 ]
In 2001, Scherzinger went on to audition on
the WB 's television show
Popstars , in which she auditioned with
Whitney Houston 's version of " I Will Always Love You ". [ 21 ]
It aired as part of a reality series until the recording of the group's debut album. [ 22 ]
Warner Bros.
and
Sire Records
signed the group to a
recording contract
before the band was named and had finalized its membership, due to the hours of network television exposure the group would receive. [ 23 ]
Scherzinger won the show as part of the newly established girl group
Eden's Crush , in which she was one of the lead vocalists for the group. [ 21 ]
The group released their first single " Get Over Yourself ", which charted at number 8 on the
Billboard
Hot 100 , [ 21 ]
and number one in physical sales. [ 24 ]
It also reached the top of the charts on the Canadian
Billboard
Hot 100. [ 24 ]
They later went on to tour with
'N Sync
and
Jessica Simpson . [ 21 ]
In 2002, the band's record company,
London-Sire Records , went bankrupt, and the group split. [ 25 ]
With hopes of scoring a solo recording contract, in August 2003 Scherzinger traveled to the
Arista Records
office in New York with a demo CD of her own written material. Her performance was interrupted by a citywide blackout and she was forced to leave. [ 26 ]
Following her short career with Eden's Crush, Scherzinger subsequently made a few promotional solo appearances under the stage name of "Nicole Kea", including
covering
" Breakfast in Bed " for the soundtrack to
50 First Dates
in 2003. [ 27 ]
Scherzinger also worked with
Yoshiki
of Japanese rock band
X Japan
on his
Violet UK
project. She sang the English version of "I'll Be Your Love" live with the Tokyo Symphonic Orchestra. [ 28 ]
Scherzinger met
Nick Hexum
of rock band
311
backstage at a concert. [ 29 ]
They became engaged, but later broke up. [ 29 ]
During this time, Scherzinger was approached to become a member of
the Black Eyed Peas , but she had to refuse because she was "contracted elsewhere." [ 30 ]
2003–10: The Pussycat Dolls
Main article:

In 2003, the creator of the Pussycat Dolls
Robin Antin , along with
A&M Records
former president
Ron Fair , launched an open audition for a separate recording group. Scherzinger and
Melody Thornton
successfully auditioned joining
Carmit Bachar ,
Ashley Roberts ,
Jessica Sutta
and
Kimberly Wyatt
with Scherzinger being cast as the group's lead singer. [ 31 ]
Scherzinger suffered from
bulimia
following her first photo shoot with the group. She was required to wear a bra, underwear and garters; however, Scherzinger wasn't comfortable in her own body. Her struggle with the eating disorder would last for eight years, during which she would keep to herself. [ 32 ]
In 2004, the Pussycat Dolls recorded "We Went as Far as We Felt Like Going" for the
Shark Tale
soundtrack and released " Sway " as their first single for the soundtrack to the film,
Shall We Dance? . [ 33 ]
The following year, the group released " Don't Cha " which became their international breakthrough, peaking at number two on the
Billboard
Hot 100 and is one of the
best-selling singles of all time
at around 6 million copies. The success of "Don't Cha" prompted the group to record their
self-titled debut album
which released in September 2005. Scherzinger assumed the majority of the vocals along with being the only member of the group to have a few songwriting credits on the album. [ 31 ]
The album spawned other number-one hits, " Stickwitu " and " Buttons ", the former of which was nominated for
Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals .
PCD
sold nearly three million copies in the United States. Once finishing recording the group's debut album, Scherzinger began working on her solo album. [ 26 ]
In February 2006, Scherzinger signed a
global publishing agreement
with
Universal Music Publishing Group , which would cover her future songwriting. [ 34 ]
Her work as lead singer furthered Scherzinger's popularity as she continued to work on her own music. Scherzinger's first solo recording was a feature on
Avant 's " Lie About Us " that was released in July 2006 and later collaborated with
Diddy
on " Come to Me " which became Scherzinger's first solo top-ten hit on the US
Billboard
Hot 100. [ 35 ]
In March 2007, Scherzinger announced that her debut studio album would be titled
Her Name is Nicole
and was initially scheduled for a release in late summer. [ 31 ] [ 36 ]
Four singles were released from the project—" Whatever U Like " featuring
T.I. , " Baby Love " featuring
will.i.am , "Supervillain", and "Puakenikeni"— however, all failed to make any significant impact on the
Billboard
charts, [ 31 ]
although "Baby Love" was a moderate success in international territories. After a number of push backs, [ 26 ]
Scherzinger decided not to release any further singles from the album and at her request,
Her Name Is Nicole
was eventually shelved and shifted back her focus on the Doll's second album. [ 37 ] [ 38 ]
The Pussycat Dolls performed for more than 2,000 U.S. and coalition service members during a live concert March 10, 2008 at a U.S. Army camp in the Persian Gulf Region (2008).
In February 2008, Scherzinger along with a variety of other celebrities contributed to
will.i.am 's " Yes We Can ", to support
Barack Obama 's
2008 presidential campaign . [ 39 ]
Following the cancellation of
Her Name is Nicole , Scherzinger focused on the Pussycat Dolls' second and final album,
Doll Domination . [ 40 ]
It was released in the United States on September 23, 2008 and peaked at number four on the
Billboard
200. [ 41 ]
The album included singles " When I Grow Up " and " I Hate This Part " which peaked at number nine and eleven on the
Billboard
Hot 100, respectively. [ 42 ]
Both songs were originally recorded for Scherzinger's solo effort. [ 40 ]
The following year, the Pussycat Dolls embarked on a worldwide concert tour,
Doll Domination Tour
which began on January 18, 2009. [ 43 ]
While on tour, Scherzinger was asked to re-write pop version of " Jai Ho " from the movie
Slumdog Millionaire
(2008). [ 44 ]
The song was entitled " Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny) " crediting
A. R. Rahman
and the Pussycat Dolls while Scherzinger was credited as a featured artist causing an internal strife within the group. [ 45 ]
The song reached number one in 17 countries; in the US, it peaked at number fifteen on the
Billboard
Hot 100, after charging eighty-five places
consequently making the largest weekly leap from number 100 . [ 46 ]
On April 5, 2009, Scherzinger performed the " America the Beautiful " at

which are also backed by "electro beats". [ 110 ]
In August 2010,
RedOne
revealed that he was working on Scherzinger's debut album, stating: "I just finished her album. Her last one never came out because it wasn't consistent. Her new record – it's the real her." [ 111 ]
Scherzinger said a lot of her first studio album was about her split with
Lewis Hamilton
before they reunited. [ 112 ]
Scherzinger said that she wanted to create songs which "lend themselves to live performances". [ 113 ]
She said she likes to record "empowering" ballads. [ 114 ]
Scherzinger's vocals on ballads have been compared to
Kelly Clarkson . [ 99 ]
She said that she wanted her debut album to be "in your face and strong". [ 115 ]
She told
MTV
"I've always said that in the Pussycat Dolls, I kind of feel like Superwoman. But that's just one of my alter egos. I've got the vulnerable, lovesick side of me amongst others which all appear on my record." [ 116 ]
Influences
Whitney Houston
( left ) and
Michael Jackson
( right ) are Scherzinger's two biggest influences.
Scherzinger credits
Whitney Houston
as being her greatest musical influence and idol, saying she wanted to "be Whitney" when she grew up. [ 117 ]
She admired Houston so much that she auditioned with her version of " I Will Always Love You " at her
Popstars
audition. [ 117 ]
When Scherzinger was growing up in her home town of
Louisville , she received a Christmas gift (at the age of six) of a tiny purple boombox and a
cassette
of Whitney Houston's chart-topping 1985
self-titled debut album . "My parents had no money, but they got me this player and Whitney's album, which had " The Greatest Love of All " on it," Scherzinger recalls. "That was it for me. From that moment on I wanted to sing. Her voice was so powerful; every note she sang just felt like the truth." [ 118 ]
Scherzinger also named
Ella Fitzgerald , [ 117 ]
Billie Holiday , [ 117 ]
Roberta Flack , [ 117 ]
Sade Adu , [ 117 ]
Alanis Morissette , [ 117 ]
Toni Braxton [ 117 ]
and
Tina Turner [ 117 ]
as her biggest influences while growing up. [ 117 ]
Scherzinger said that
Beyoncé
also inspired her, stating: "I am inspired by women like Beyoncé who wear costumes that aren't much but they are real artists and they put real artistry into what they do and that is how I pride myself." [ 119 ]
Scherzinger said while she is on stage performing, she borrows
personas
of Tina Turner and
Mick Jagger : "The way he [Mick Jagger] prances around stage and the poise he has on stage. But I love Tina Turner's attitude and sass. I steal from her all the time, especially being the lead singer of this group, the Pussycat Dolls, to be fearless and just have that attitude and that soul behind you." [ 117 ]
Scherzinger also cites
Gwen Stefani
as an influence. [ 116 ]
Janet Jackson
and
MIA
are also influences to her. [ 116 ]
When Scherzinger was older,
Mariah Carey
became a huge influence to her. [ 118 ]
She also wished to work with
the Black Eyed Peas
saying she admired their music. [ 120 ]
Scherzinger is also a fan of
Adele . [ 121 ]
Critically acclaimed, "Pop Prince",
Prince
also became a big influence when she was in her teens. [ 122 ]
Michael Jackson
was one of Scherzinger's biggest influences and idols. [ 122 ]
Paula Abdul , who Scherzinger sat alongside on the judging panel of
The X Factor , was one of her influences. [ 123 ]
When she gained the role on
Men in Black 3 , Scherzinger said that music was a very big part of her inspiration for the character, which she plays for the film. [ 124 ]
She said, "I listened to my heavier music and I listened to
Led Zeppelin
and I kind of got in that frame of mind because music is what inspires me most. I worked with my acting coach a lot and she told me about lots of crazy things to think about while I was in character, but I better not tell you what she said." [ 124 ]
Scherzinger said that the role has inspired her to record differently on her second studio album. [ 124 ]
Public image
Scherzinger is most recognized as the voice behind
the Pussycat Dolls . [ 19 ] [ 125 ]
As a former member of the group, Scherzinger is the most successful as a solo artist, [ 126 ] [ 127 ]
having sold 16 million records, thus far. [ 2 ]
Negative press appeared in which her music, [ 128 ]
music videos, performances [ 129 ]
and her image were unfavorably compared to those of Beyoncé. [ 130 ]
In 2006, while on tour, Scherzinger ran into trouble in
Kuala Lumpur
with the authorities for sexually explicit dancing. [ 131 ]
Her performance, part of the
PCD World Tour , was not well received in the Muslim state which frowned upon the "eye-popping attire" and "sexually suggestive stage routines" and she was fined $3000 for the incident. [ 131 ]
Scherzinger later admitted she cried when she saw the first outfit she would have to wear as a member of the band. [ 132 ]
Scherzinger frequently has appeared in FHM Magazine's 100 Sexiest Women poll. Her History in FHM's 100 Sexiest Women: 2006 #49, 2007 #22, 2008 #49, 2009 #60, 2010 #73, 2011 #9, 2012 #43, 2013 #54, 2014 #9 and 2015 #24. [ 133 ]
Margeaux Watson of
Entertainment Weekly
took a major swipe at Scherzinger for her role as lead singer. Watson said, "there are two kinds of girl groups: those anchored by a superstar ( the Supremes ,
Destiny's Child ), and those made up of charismatic personalities endowed with limited individual gifts ( Spice Girls ,
TLC ). The Pussycat Dolls are neither – they're a brand, not a band. [...] 2005's multi-platinum
PCD
finds lead Doll Nicole Scherzinger in the spotlight, and she's no
Beyoncé ." [ 130 ]
Scherzinger has claimed that she was responsible for both lead and backing vocals on the group's songs, with hardly anything sung by the other members. [ 134 ]
She commented, "...people don't even know the story. I was in the center because I was singing. I was the one singing." [ 135 ]
Scherzinger is also a supporter of gay rights. [ 136 ]
On November 24, 2012, Scherzinger posed for a "Some People Are Gay, Get Over It" T-shirt, part of a campaign from
Stonewall , in support of same-sex marriage. [ 137 ]
Scherzinger's popularity within the gay community increased due to her work with the Pussycat Dolls. [ 96 ]
One of the songs written by Scherzinger, " I Don't Need a Man ", was dedicated to all of her gay fans. [ 96 ]
She explained: "Whoever I could inspire, I wanted to inspire them. It's about the messages of empowerment and loving yourself for who you are." [ 96 ]
Scherzinger is also very vocal when it comes to bullying. [ 138 ]
She believes in acceptance and recalls receiving knock backs and the message of her music releases show how she dealt with them. [ 139 ]
She admits it is "frustrating" to read about the media's portrayal of her as "a
man-eater ". [ 140 ]
Scherzinger has been linked to a number of different men, but insists none of the rumors are true. [ 140 ] [ 140 ]
In July 2013, Scherzinger posed semi-nude for a "Protect the Skin You're In" T-shirt, part of a campaign by fashion designer
Marc Jacobs
to raise awareness and cash for
melanoma
research. [ 141 ]

NYU Cancer Institute and NYU Langone Medical Center . [ 142 ]
The outfits she wore as a Pussycat Doll and sexual dance moves they performed has continued ever since she embarked on her solo career. [ 143 ]

role model
for other girls out there." [ 144 ] [ 145 ]
