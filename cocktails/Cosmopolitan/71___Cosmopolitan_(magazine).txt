توالت به سبک شرقی
توالت فرنگی
توالت
یا
دستشویی
(مستراح، یا تشناب) سازه ساختمانی است که در درون اماکن مسکونی، اداری و غیره به منظور
دفع مدفوع
و
پیشاب
انسان تعبیه می‌شود. هدف اصلی از ساخت دستشویی توسط بشر ایجاد امکان دفع به طور
بهداشتی
بوده‌است.
واژه مستراح از ریشۀ عربیِ «ر. و. ح»، بر وزن مُسْتَفْعَل به‌معنی "محل راحت شدن" گرفته شده‌است که در زبان عامیانۀ فارسی، گاهی بدان «مستراب» نیز می‌گویند. مَبال یا مَوال از دیگر لغات عامیانه‌ای است که درمورد آن به‌کار رفته‌است. "مبال" از ریشۀ "بَول"، که عربی و
اسم مکان
است، آمده‌است و به‌معنی "محل ادرار" است. واژه W.C از عبارت WATER CLOSET منشأ گرفته است که به معنای آبریزگاه می باشد

سابقه [ ویرایش ]
در ایران مستراح را پیشاب و "هواگش" و" خلا" نیز می‌گفته‌اند. تا صد سال قبل، توالت در ایران در داخل اتاق جداگانه در گوشه‌ای از
سرا
و به‌دور از اتاق‌های نشیمن وجود داشت. توالت خانه درواقع بدون چاه بود؛ یعنی فضای نشستن و سنگ توالت در روی بلندی قرار داشت و مدفوع به داخل محوطۀ شیب‌دار و گودالی در همان اتاق هدایت می‌شد و روی محوطۀ گودالی‌شکل خاک می ریختند. بعد از هر چند مدت، مدفوع‌ها را برای مصارف کشاورزی بر بارِ خران حمل می‌کردند و به
مزارع
می‌بردند. با زندگی
شهرنشینی
مدرن و تغییر سبکِ سراها به خانه‌های کوچک و آپارتمان، حفر چاه سرپوشیدۀ توالت در مستراح خانه‌ها مرسوم شد. از سال ۱۳۴۳ خورشیدی و با ایجاد
سپاه بهداشت
و
سپاه دانش ، ایجاد چاه سرپوشیده برای توالت‌ها در روستاها نیز اجباری شد. علمای دینی در ابتدا با تغییر کاربری مستراح‌ها به چاه سرپوشیده و همچنین تغییر حمام‌های
خزانه
به حمام
دوش
گرمابه
مخالفت می‌کردند. این مخالفت‌ها در مناطق سنی‌نشین و روستاها شدیدتر بود، به‌طوری‌که مردان در روستاهای شرق خراسان و هم‌مرز با افغانستان، حاضر به استفاده از توالت‌هایی که زنان از آن استفاده می‌کنند نمی‌شدند. در روستاهای افغانستان هنوز هم توالت‌ها بیشتر حالت سرباز دارد و استفاده از چاه‌های سرپوشیده را مخالف شرع می‌دانند. در ایران، تعداد توالت‌های عمومی کم است؛ به‌ همین دلیل، باوجود مراکز تاریخی و دیدنیِ فراوان در ایران، توریست‌ها برای استفاده از
سرویس بهداشتی
دچار مشکل می‌شوند. ازجمله مشکلاتی که برای استفادۀ مسافران از توالت پیش می‌آید، نبودن آویز مناسب در سرویس‌های بهداشتی است. هرچند اخیراً در بعضی از
پایانه‌های
مسافربری،
فرودگاههاو
یا ایستگاه‌های
راه آهن
نوعی
جالباسی ، که به آن
توشه نگهدار
می‌گویند، دیده‌ می‌شود، امید می‌رود باتوجه‌به نیاز جامعه و همراه با گسترش توالت‌های عمومی، استفاده از
توشه نگهدار
هم فراگیرتر شود. [۱]

بهتر است طوری طراحی شوندکه بتواننداز یک لوله کشی وتاسیسات استفاده کنند. [۲]
استانداردهای
سرویس بهداشتی [ ویرایش ]
فاصلۀ سرویس بهداشتی از محل کار باید 100cm باشد.
اگر تهویه ازطریق
پنجره
و فقط از یک طرف صورت گیرد و مساحتی حدود ۱۷۰۰ سانتیمتر مربع نیاز است. درصورت محدودیت فضا، این مساحت حدود ۱۰۰ سانتیمتر مربع است.
کف نباید لغزنده باشد و باید در برابر
آب
مقاوم باشد و به‌آسانی نیز تمیز شود. همچنین کف باید بدون درز و شکاف و قابل شستشو باشد.
دیوارها حداقل باید تا ارتفاع ۲متری کاشی باشد و نیز قابل شستشو باشد.
دمای
مناسب برای
سرویس‌های بهداشتی
۲۱ درجۀ سانتیگراد است.
برای هر دو
دستشویی ، حداقل یک آینه نصب شود.
حداقل ارتفاع مخصوص توالت با چهار WC یا کمتر می‌تواند ۲۰/۲ متر باشد.
حداقل عرض اتاقک هر
توالت
باید ۸۵ سانتیمتر باشد.
حداقل عرض اتاقک هر توالت باید بیش از ۱۱۰ سانتیمتر باشد.
حداقل طول اتاقک هر توالت باید ۱۵۰ سانتیمتر باشد.
فاصلۀ مرکز دو دستشویی باید ۶۰ سانتیمتر باشد.
فاصلۀ دستشویی از کنار دیوار ۴۵ سانتیمتر باشد.
حمام محیطی مرطوب است؛ به همین دلیل، درصورتی‌که تاریک باشد، محیط مناسبی برای رشد
قارچها
خواهد بود؛بنابراین، بسیار ضروری است که به‌گونه‌ای طراحی شود که حتماً نور طبیعی به داخل آن بتابد.
عرض درِ توالت باید ۶۰ سانتیمتر و حداکثر ۷۵ سانتیمتر باشد. [۳]
اهمیت نورپردازی در
سرویس بهداشتی [ ویرایش ]
نورپردازی
در سرویس‌های بهداشتی نیز مانند سایر مکانها نیز دارای اهمیت است. دراطراف آینه سرویس بهداشتی از جمله قسمت‌هایی است که باید نور کافی برای اصلاح وآرایش صورت وجود دارد بهترین روش نصب نورهای متعدد در اطراف آینه استواگر فضا این اجازه رابه شما نمی‌دهد توصیه می‌شود از یک چراغ بالای آینه استفاده شودو تنها نصب یک چراغ در سرویس بهداشتی مناسب نیست. منطقه‌ای در حمام
که دوش در آن قرار گرفته نیز از جمله قسمت‌هایی است که به یک نور پردازی کافی ومناسب نیاز دارد تا ایمنی فرد بیشتر شود. حتی نیز برحسب سبک
دکوراسیون
سرویس بهداشتی خود، لوستری مناسب نیز می‌توان انتخاب کرد. نصب یک چراغ یا
لوسترسقفی
در مرکز سرویس بهداشتی، نورلازم برای قسمت‌های دیگر سرویس بهداشتی
راتامین می‌کند. [۴]
محل قرار گیری پنجره در سرویس بهداشتی [ ویرایش ]
در طراحی سرویس بهداشتی محل قرار گیری پنجره‌ها اهمیت زیادی دارد زیرا نه تنها در نور پردازی موثر است بلکه در داشتن
تهویه
ی مناسب به دلیل رفع بوی بد و
بخار آب
تاثیر دارد جا دارد که طراح برای کلیهٔ
سرویس‌های بهداشتی
امکان برقراری تماس وای بیرون و حضور پنجرهٔ مناسب را در نظر بگیرد برای حفظ محرمیت در فضا و قطع دید مزاحم به درون طراحی شکستگی مناسب در پلان
و انتخاب
شیشه ]های مات میتواهند کارساز باشد [۵]
نوردر سرویس بهداشتی [ ویرایش ]
علاوه برنصب و استفاده از از
لامپ‌ها
و
چراغ‌های
کافی در قسمت‌های
مختلف
سرویس بهداشتی
موارد ونکات دیگری نیز وجود داردکه با رعایت آنها می‌توانید میزان
نور
موجود دراین فضا را افزایش دهید این نکات عبارتند از:
استفاده نکردن از رنگ‌های
تیره در
سرویس بهداشتی
استفاده از آینه‌های بزرگ در سرویس بهداشتی برای
انعکاس
بیشتر نور
اجتناب از بهم ریختگی وشلوغی در
دکوراسیون
استفاده کردن از انواع شیشه هابرای ظروف وعناصر [۶]
دمای مناسب [ ویرایش ]
برای راحتی دمای حمام بین۲۲تا۲۴درجه سانتیگرادخوب است. دمای ۲۰درجه سانتیگرادبرای
توالت‌های
داخل منازل مناسب است این میزان دما نسبت به دمای توالت‌ها در ساختمان‌های اداری که بین ۱۵تا۱۷درجه سانتیگراد می باشدبسیار بالاتراست. تمام مناطق حمام به دلیل رطوبت بالادر این مناطق باید به خوبی درز گیری شوند. [۷]

This article is about a sanitation fixture used primarily for the disposal of human waste.
For a room containing a toilet, see
Toilet (room) .
For other uses, see
Toilet (disambiguation) .
Toilets come in various shapes and forms around the world: Top:

toilet paper
and a
toilet brush
in its holder; Bottom: Low-cost
dry toilet
( Arborloo
at a school in Zimbabwe)
A
toilet
is a
sanitation
fixture used for the disposal of human
urine
and
feces . They are often found in a small room referred to as a
toilet, bathroom or lavatory . A toilet can be designed for people who prefer to sit (by using a toilet pedestal) or for people who prefer to squat and use a
squat toilet .
Flush toilets , which are common in many parts of the world (particularly in more affluent countries or regions), may be connected to a
septic tank
or - more commonly in urban areas - via a
sewer
to a
sewage treatment plant .
Dry toilets , for example
pit latrines
and
composting toilets , require no or little water. The excreta is removed manually or
composted
in situ.
Chemical toilets
or mobile
dry toilets
can be used in mobile and temporary situations where there is no access to
sewerage .
Ancient civilizations used toilets attached to simple flowing water sewage systems included those of the
Indus Valley Civilization
and also those of the
Romans
and
Egyptians . [ 1 ]
Although a precursor to the flush toilet system which is widely used nowadays was designed in 1596 by
John Harington , [ 2 ]
such systems did not come into widespread use until the late nineteenth century. [ 3 ]
Thomas Crapper
was one of the early makers of flush toilets in England.
Many infectious diseases, including
cholera
and
diarrhoea , can be largely prevented when effective
sanitation
systems are in place. Hygienic toilets are one important piece of the overall sanitation system.

Terminology
Certain basic toilets, such as temporary outdoor
dry toilets
made by the military or campers, are more commonly referred to as a
latrine . The same applies to the term
pit latrine
(or pit toilet).
Types
Flush toilets
Main article:
Flush toilet
Flush toilet bowl (sitting style)
A typical
flush toilet
is a vitreous,
ceramic
bowl containing water plus
plumbing
made to be rapidly filled with more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow
siphon
tube longer than the water in the bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The bottom of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. The water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas entering and as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a vent pipe attached to the sewer line.
When a toilet is flushed, the water should flow into a
septic tank
or into a
sewage
system with a
sewage treatment plant . However, this is often not the case at a global level.
The amount of water used by conventional flush toilets usually make up a significant portion of personal daily water usage. However, modern
low flush toilet
designs allow the use of much less water per flush.
Dual flush toilets
allow the user to select between a flush for urine or feces saving a significant amount of water over conventional units. The flush handle on these toilets is pushed up for one kind of flush and down for the other. [ 4 ]
In some places users are encouraged not to flush after urination. Flush toilets, if plumbed for it, may also use
greywater
(water previously used for washing dishes, laundry and bathing) for flushing rather than
potable water
(drinking water). Some modern toilets pressurize the water in the tank which initiates flushing action with less water usage.
Heads (on ships)
are typically flushed with seawater.
A flush toilet can also be installed without a water cistern and flushed manually with a few liters of water using a small bucket. In this case, the toilet is called a pour flush toilet. [ 5 ]
This type of low-cost toilet is common in many Asian countries.
Pit toilet
Main article:
Pit latrine
A poorly maintained pit latrine in Yaounde,
Cameroon
A
pit toilet, or pit latrine , is a
dry toilet
system which collects
human excrement
and urine in a pit or trench and ranges from a simple slit trench dug in the ground to more elaborate systems with seating or squatting pans and ventilation systems. They are more often used in
emergency ,
rural
and
wilderness
areas as well as in the rural or peri-urban areas of much of the
developing world . The waste pit or trench, in some cases, will be large enough that the reduction in mass of the contained waste products by the ongoing process of
decomposition
allows the pit to be used for many years before it fills up. When the pit becomes too full, it may be emptied or the hole covered with earth. Pit latrines have to be located away from drinking water sources (wells, streams, etc.) to minimize the possibility of disease spread via
groundwater
pollution. Army units typically use a form of pit toilet when they are in the field and away from functional
sewerage
systems. The use of correctly located pit toilets were found to prevent much of the spread of various diseases which used to kill many more soldiers than the
bullets
and
artillery
used in pre-1940 warfare.
Vault toilet
A vault toilet is a non-flush toilet with a sealed container buried in the ground beneath the seat to receive the waste; a small building is usually built over the whole. All waste is contained in the underground vault until it is purposely removed by pumping. A vault toilet is distinguished from a pit toilet in that in the latter the liquid waste seeps down into the underlying soil, while the solid waste remains and accumulates until the pit fills up.
Dry toilets
Main article:
Dry toilet
Pit latrines
are still in use in rural areas ( Herøy , Norway)
Dry toilets
use no water or very little water for flushing. Many different types of dry toilets exist. For example, from simple to more complex: a
bucket toilet ,
tree bog
(a simple system for converting excrement to direct fertiliser for trees),
pit latrine
(mainly consisting of a hole in the ground),
composting toilet
(which mixes excreta with carbon rich materials for faster decomposition),
urine-diverting dry toilet
(which keeps urine separate from feces),
incinerating toilet
(which burns the excreta) and
freezing toilet
(which freezes the excreta).
The
pig toilet
from the Indian state of
Goa
which consists of a toilet linked to a pig enclosure by a chute is still in use to a limited extent but the subsequent use of the pigs for food carries a significant risk for human health. [ 6 ]
Urine diversion toilets
Main articles:
Urine diversion
and
Urine-diverting dry toilet
Urine diversion
(UD) toilets have two compartments. One for urine and one for the feces. A urine diversion toilet flushes one or both compartments with water. A
urine-diverting dry toilet
(UDDT) is a form of
dry toilet . UDDTs can be linked to systems which
reuse excreta
as a
fertilizer
or
biofuel .
Astronauts
use a UDDT to recover
potable
water in the
space station . [ 7 ]
Chemical toilets
Main article:
Chemical toilet
Chemical toilets
which do not require a connection to a water supply are used in a variety of situations. Examples include
passenger train toilets
and
airplane toilets
and also complicated
space toilets
for use in zero-gravity spacecraft.
Others
Flying toilets
Main article:
Flying toilet
The unsanitary " flying toilets " are used in African informal settlements where
plastic shopping bags
are used as a container for excrement and are then simply discarded. They are called flying toilets "because when you have filled them, you throw them as far away as you can." [ 8 ]
This practice, coupled with the solid waste problem of discarded plastic bags, has led to the banning of the manufacture and import of such bags in
Uganda ,
Kenya , and
Tanzania . [ 8 ]
Portable toilets

Main article:
Portable toilet
The
portable toilet
is used on construction sites and at large outdoor gatherings where there are no other facilities. They are typically self-contained units that are made to be easily moved to different locations as needed. Most portable toilets are
unisex
single units with privacy ensured by a simple lock on the door. The units are usually light weight and easily transported by a
flatbed truck
and loaded and unloaded by a small
forklift . Many portable toilets are small molded plastic or
fiberglass
portable rooms with a lockable door and a receptacle to catch waste in a chemically treated container. If used for an extended period of time they have to be cleaned out and new chemicals put in the waste receptacle. For servicing multiple portable toilets tanker trucks ( vacuum trucks ), often called "Honey Trucks", are equipped with lage vacuums to evacuate the waste and replace the chemicals. Portable toilets can also be equipped with urine diversion as in the case of portable
urine-diverting dry toilets .
A
bucket toilet
is a very simple type of portable toilet.
High-tech toilets
"High-tech" toilets include features such as: automatic-flushing mechanisms that flush a toilet or urinal when finished; water jets, or "bottom washers" like a
bidet ; blow dryers; artificial flush sounds to mask noises; and urine and stool analysis for medical monitoring. Matsushita's "Smart Toilet" checks blood pressure, temperature, and blood sugar. Some feature automatic lid operation, heated seats, deodorizing fans or automated paper toilet-seat-cover replacers.
Interactive urinals
have been developed in several countries, allowing users to play
video games
as with the "Toylet", produced by
Sega , that uses pressure sensors to detect the flow of urine and translates it into on-screen action. [ 9 ]
Floating toilets
A
floating toilet
is essentially an toilet on a platform built above or floating on the water. Instead of excreta going into the ground they are collected in a tank or barrel. To reduce the amount of excreta that needs to hauled to shore, many use
urine diversion . The floating toilet was developed for residents without quick access to land or connection to a
sewer
systems. [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
It is also used in areas subjected to prolonged flooding. [ 12 ]
The need for this type of toilet is high in areas like Cambodia. [ 13 ]
Public toilets
Main article:
Public toilet
Public urinal ( Limbourg , Belgium)
A
public toilet , frequently called a restroom, is accessible to the general public. It may be within a building that, while privately owned, allows public access. Access to a public toilet may require a fee, ( pay toilet ), or may be limited to business's customers.
Depending on culture, there may be varying degrees of separation between men and women and different levels of privacy. Typically, the entire room, or a stall or cubicle containing a toilet is lockable.
Urinals , if present in a men's toilet, are typically mounted on wall with or without a divider between them. In the most basic form, a public toilet may be not much more than an open
latrine . Another form is a street urinal known as a
pissoir
after the French term (see
Urinal ).
In more luxurious variations there may be an
attendant , towels, showers, etc. A fairly common feature in more modern toilets is an area to change baby
diapers .
A charge levied in the UK during the mid-20th century was one
British penny , hence the generally adopted term "spend a penny" meaning to use the toilet. [ 14 ]
Squat toilets
Main article:
Squat toilet
A squat toilet (also called “squatting toilet" or "Turkish toilet") is a toilet of any technology type (i.e. pit latrine, urine-diverting dry toilet, flush toilet etc.) which is used in a squatting position rather than sitting. This means that the
defecation posture
used is to place one foot on each side of the toilet drain or hole and to squat over it. Squatting toilets are most commonly found in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East but can also occasionally be found in some European, Mediterranean, and South American countries. They are common in most Muslim countries and can quite easily be used in conjunction with
anal cleansing
with water in accordance with
Islamic toilet etiquette . However, there is a general trend in many countries to move from squatting toilets to sitting toilets (particularly in urban areas) as the latter are often regarded as more modern. [ citation needed ]

Urination
There are cultural differences in socially accepted and preferred voiding positions for
urination
around the world: in the Middle-East and Asia, the squatting position is more prevalent, while in the Western world the standing and sitting position are more common. [ 15 ]

Urinals
Main article:
Urinal
Urinals
are primarily used by males, although some designs also exist for females. They are intended for
urination
only, not for
defecation . Urinals are meant to be used for the convenience of male users in a standing position. They typically have no door or stall enclosure, and thus take up less space. These fixtures are most commonly found in public places, but can occasionally be found in a private home. Urinals are usually water flushed, although
waterless urinals
are also becoming more popular as they save water.
Public urinals are not common in many Muslim countries due to the
Islamic toilet etiquette . [ citation needed ]

Role of toilets and sanitation for public health
Main article:
Sanitation
Toilets are one important element of a
sanitation
system, although other elements are also needed: transport, treatment, disposal or
reuse . [ 5 ]
Diseases, including
cholera , which still affects some 3 million people each year, can be largely prevented when effective
sanitation
and water treatment prevents fecal matter from contaminating
waterways ,
groundwater
and
drinking water
supplies.
Example of cholera in England
There have been five main
cholera outbreaks and pandemics
since 1825. In London alone, the
second
killed 14,137 people in 1849, and the
third
took 10,738 lives in 1853-54. In 1849 the English physician
John Snow
published a paper
On the Mode of Communication of Cholera , in which he suggested that cholera might be waterborne. During the 1854 epidemic, he collected and analyzed data establishing that people who drank water from contaminated sources such as the
Broad Street pump
died of cholera at much higher rates than those who got water elsewhere.
Global situation
To this day, many people in developing countries have no toilets in their homes and are resorting to
open defecation
instead. The
Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation
by WHO and UNICEF is the official United Nations mechanism tasked with monitoring progress towards the
Millennium Development Goal
relating to drinking-water and sanitation (MDG 7, Target 7c). One target of this goal is to: "Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking-water and basic sanitation" and publishes figures on access to sanitation worldwide on a regular basis. [ 16 ]

Toilet
The word
toilet
came to be used in English along with other French fashions. It originally referred to the
toile , French for "cloth", draped over a lady or gentleman's shoulders while their hair was being dressed, and then (in both French and English) by extension to the various elements, and also the whole complex of operations of
hairdressing
and body care that centered at a dressing table, also covered by a cloth, on which stood a
toilet service
of a mirror and various brushes and containers for powder and make-up: this ensemble could also be called a
toilette , as also was the period spent at the table, during which close friends or tradesmen were often received. [ 18 ]
The English poet
Alexander Pope
in
The Rape of the Lock
(1717) described the intricacies of a lady's preparation.
The word comes from the French
toile
meaning cloth, and
toilette
("little cloth") first came to mean the morning routine of washing, tidying hair, and shaving and making up as appropriate, from the cloth often spread on the dressing-table where this was done. This meaning spread into English as "toilet", for the same thing (see
toilet service
for sets of mirror, pots and brushes). Only later did "toilet" became a
euphemism
for lavatory, somewhat in the same way as the expression "powder my nose" for visiting the toilet.
The
Oxford English Dictionary
records "toilet" in English first, from 1540, as a term for a cloth used to wrap clothes in, then from 1662 (by
John Evelyn ) for a gold toilet service, and before 1700 for a range of related meanings (a towel, the cloth on a dressing-table, the act of using a dressing-table, and so on), but not for a lavatory, which did not come into use until the 19th century. During the 20th century, the widespread use in the United States of "toilet" for lavatory reduced usage of the other meanings of the word, which are now largely obsolete. [ 19 ]
The word
toilet
may also be used, especially in
British English
to describe the
room containing the fixture , for which
euphemisms
such as
restroom
or
bathroom
are used in
American English . Prior to the introduction of modern flush toilets, most human waste disposal was done through the use of household
chamber pots , or took place outdoors in
outhouses
or
latrines .
Pail closets
were introduced in England and France in an attempt to reduce sewage problems in rapidly expanding cities.
“
And now, unveil'd, the toilet stands display'd
Each silver vase in mystic order laid.
”
These various senses are first recorded by the
OED
in rapid sequence in the later 17th century: the set of "articles required or used in dressing" 1662, the "action or process of dressing" 1681, the cloth on the table 1682, the cloth round the shoulders 1684, the table itself 1695, and the "reception of visitors by a lady during the concluding stages of her toilet" 1703 (also known as a "toilet-call"), but in the sense of a special room the earliest use is 1819, and this does not seem to include a lavatory. [ 20 ]
Through the 18th century, everywhere in the English-speaking world, these various uses centred around a lady's draped dressing-table remained dominant. In the 19th century, apparently first in the United States, [ 21 ]
the word was adapted as a genteel euphemism for the room and the object as we know them now, perhaps following the French usage
cabinet de toilette , much as
powder-room
may be coyly used today, and this has been linked to the introduction of public toilets, for example on railway
trains , which required a plaque on the door. The original usages have become obsolete, and the table has become a
dressing-table .
Vestiges of the original meaning continue to be reflected in terms such as
toiletries ,
eau de toilette
and
toiletry bag
(to carry flannels, soaps, etc.). This seemingly contradictory terminology has served as the basis for various parodies e.g.
Cosmopolitan
magazine ("If it doesn't say 'eau de toilette' on the label, it most likely doesn't come from the famed region of Eau de Toilette in France and might not even come from toilets at all.").
Lavatory
The term
lavatory , abbreviated in slang to
lav , derives from the
Latin :
lavātōrium , which in turn comes from Latin
lavō
("I wash"). The word was originally used to refer to a vessel for washing, such as a
sink / wash basin , but eventually came to mean a room with such washing vessels, as for example in medieval monasteries, where the
lavatorium
was the monks' communal washing area. [ 22 ]
The toilets in monasteries however were not in the
lavatorium
but in the
reredorter . Nevertheless, the word was later associated with toilets and the meaning evolved into its current one, namely a polite and formal euphemism for a toilet and the room containing it.
Lavatory
is the common
signage
for toilets on commercial airlines around the world, see
Aircraft lavatory .

(August 2015)
The origin of the (chiefly British) term
loo
is unknown. According to the OED, the etymology is obscure, but it might derive from the word Waterloo. The first recorded entry [ citation needed ]
is in fact from
James Joyce 's
Ulysses
(1922) : "O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset".
Other theories are:
That it derives from the term "gardyloo" (a corruption of the French phrase
gardez l'eau!
(or maybe
garde l'eau! ) loosely translated as "watch out for the water!") which was used in
medieval
times when
chamber pots
were emptied from a window onto the street. However the first recorded usage of "loo" comes long after this term became obsolete.
That the word comes from
nautical
terminology, loo being an old-fashioned word for
lee . The standard nautical pronunciation (in
British English ) of
leeward
is
looward . Early ships were not fitted with toilets but the crew would urinate over the side of the vessel. However it was important to use the leeward side. Using the
windward
side would result in the urine blown back on board: hence the phrases 'pissing into the wind' and 'spitting into the wind'. Even now most yachtsmen refer to
the loo
rather than
the
heads .
That the word derives from the 17th century preacher
Louis Bourdaloue . Bourdaloue's sermons at the Saint Paul-Saint Louis Church in Paris lasted at least three hours and myth has it that wealthier ladies took along "travelling"
chamber pots
that could be hidden under their dresses whenever the need arose to avoid the need to leave. Due to the popularity of the myth the bowls became known as Bourdaloues after the preacher and the name became corrupted to portaloos and sometimes just plain loos due to the habit of shortening words in slang. [ citation needed ]
That the word comes from the French word
lieu
(place), as in
lieu d'aisance
(literally: "place of ease", a common euphemism for lavatory) or
lieu à l'anglaise
(literally: "English place"). From around 1770 the term
lieu à l'anglaise
began to appear in France, referring to this English invention which was sometimes installed for the benefit of English visitors. (Ashenburg p. 138)
[ 23 ]
That the term comes from common usage in England resulting from the fact that toilets in hotels or other buildings came to be commonly located in room 100 of the building, and "loo" and "100" look very similar. [ 24 ]
WC
The
WC
refers to the initial letters of
Water Closet , which, despite being an English language abbreviation, is not in common use in English-speaking countries – but is widely used internationally: in France (pronounced "le vay-say" or "le vater"), in Italy (pronounced "vi-ci" or "vater"), Romania (pronounced "veh-cheu"), the Netherlands (pronounced "waysay"), Germany, Switzerland and Hungary (pronounced "ve-tse"), Denmark (pronounced "ve-se"), Norway (pronounced "vay-say"), Poland (pronounced "vu-tse"), Spain (pronounced "uve-cé" or "váter"), China, and others. [ citation needed ]
Other
Lexicographer
Eric Partridge
derives
khazi , also spelt karzy, kharsie or carzey, from a low
Cockney
word
carsey
originating in the late 19th century and meaning a privy. [ 25 ]
Carsey also referred to a den or
brothel . It is presumably derived from the Italian
casa
for house, with the spelling influenced by its similar sound to khaki. Khazi is now most commonly used in the city of
Liverpool
in the UK, away from its cockney slang roots. [ 26 ]
An alternative derivation is from Christopher Chippindale, [ 27 ]
who states that khazi derives from Army slang used by expatriate officers of the British Empire who took a dislike to the habits of, and steaming rain forest inhabited by, the
Khasi people
of the Khasia hills on the northern frontier of India.
The
Dunny
is an Australian expression for an outside toilet or
outhouse . The person who appeared weekly to empty the pan beneath the seat was known as the "dunnyman". The word derives from the British dialect word
dunnekin , meaning "dung-house". [ 28 ]
It is now an informal word used for any lavatory and is most often used referring to drop or pit lavatories in the
Australian bush , which are also called
thunderboxes .
The Privy
is an old fashioned term used more in the North of England and in Scotland; "privy" is an old alternative for "private", as in
Privy council . It is used interchangeably in North America for various terms for the
outhouse .
The netty
is the most common word used in North East England. Many outsiders are often bemused when a
Geordie
or a
Mackem
states they are "gannin te the netty" (going to the bathroom). The etymology of the word is uncertain, but it is believed to be either derived from a corruption of "necessity" or from graffiti scrawled on
Hadrian's Wall . It is linked to the Italian word
gabinetti
meaning "toilets" (singular
gabinetto ).
Latrine
is a term common in the military, specifically for the Army and Air Force for any point of entry facility where human waste is disposed of, which a civilian might call a bathroom or toilet, regardless of how modern or primitive it is. Traditionally the Royal Navy along with the United States Navy and Marine Corps use the nautical term
"Head"
to describe the same type of facility, regardless of whether it is located on a ship or on the land.
The Jacks
is Irish slang for toilet. [ 29 ]
It perhaps derives from "jakes", an old English term. [ 30 ]
The standalone toilet enclosure has been variously known as a "back house", "house of ease", "house of office", "little house", or " outhouse ". [ 31 ]
The
house of office
was a common name for a toilet in seventeenth century England, used by, among others,
Samuel Pepys
on numerous occasions: "October 23, 1660: ...going down into my cellar..., I put my foot into a great heap of turds, by which I find Mr Turner's house of office is full and comes into my cellar." [ 32 ]
In the
Philippines
the abbreviation CR for "Comfort Room" is commonly used.
History

History of water supply and sanitation
Ancient civilizations
Stone toilet found in 8th century BC house in the
City of David ,
Jerusalem .
According to Teresi et al. (2002): [ 33 ]
The third millennium BC was the "Age of Cleanliness." Toilets and sewers were invented in several parts of the world, and
Mohenjo-Daro
(see
sanitation of the Indus Valley Civilization ) circa 2800 BC had some of the most advanced, with lavatories built into the outer walls of houses. These were primitive "Western-style" toilets made from bricks with wooden seats on top. They had vertical chutes, through which waste fell into street drains or cesspits.
Sir Mortimer Wheeler , the director general of archaeology in India from 1944 to 1948, wrote, "The high quality of the sanitary arrangements could well be envied in many parts of the world today."
Roman public toilets,
Ostia Antica .
The toilets at
Mohenjo-Daro , built about 2600 BC and described above, were only used by the affluent classes. Most people would have squatted over old pots set into the ground or used open pits. [ 34 ]
The people of the
Harappan civilization
in Pakistan and northwestern India had primitive water-cleaning toilets that used flowing water in each house that were linked with drains covered with burnt clay bricks. The flowing water removed the
human waste .
Early toilets that used flowing water to remove the waste are also found at
Skara Brae
in
Orkney , Scotland, which was occupied from about 3100 BC until 2500 BC. Some of the houses there have a drain running directly beneath them, and some of these had a cubicle over the drain. Around the 18th century BC, toilets started to appear in
Minoan Crete ,
Egypt
in the time of the
Pharaohs
and ancient
Persia . In
Roman
civilization, toilets using flowing water were sometimes part of public
bath houses .
In 2012, archaeologists founded what is believed to be Southeast Asia's earliest latrine during the excavation of a neolithic village in the
Rạch Núi archaeological site , southern
Viet Nam . The toilet, dating back 1500 BC, yielded important clues about early Southeast Asian society. More than 30 preserved feces from humans and dogs containing fish and shattered animal bones from the site provided a wealth of information on the diet of humans and dogs at Rạch Núi and on the types of parasites each had to contend with. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ]
Model of toilet with pigsty (see
Pig toilet , China, Eastern Han dynasty 25 - 220 AD)
Roman toilets, like the ones pictured here, are commonly thought to have been used in the sitting position. But sitting toilets only came into general use in the mid-19th century in the Western world. [ 38 ]
The Roman toilets were probably elevated to raise them above open sewers which were periodically "flushed" with flowing water, rather than elevated for sitting.
The Romans weren't the first civilisation to adopt a sewer system: The Indus Valley civilisation had a rudimentary network of sewers built under grid pattern streets, and it was the most advanced seen so far. [ 39 ]
Squat toilets
(also known as an Arabic, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Iranian, Indian, Turkish or Natural-Position toilet) are used by squatting rather than sitting and are still used by the majority of the world's population. [ 40 ]
There are several types of squat toilets, but they all consist essentially of a hole in the ground or floor with provisions for human waste.
Garderobes
Main article:
Garderobe
Garderobes were toilets used in the
Middle Ages , most commonly found in upper-class dwellings. Essentially, they were flat pieces of wood or stone spanning from one wall to the other, with one or more holes to sit on. These were above chutes or pipes that discharged outside the
castle
or
manor . [ 41 ]
Garderobes would be placed in areas away from bedrooms to shun the smell [ 42 ]
and also near kitchens or fireplaces to keep the enclosure warm. [ 41 ]

Chamber pots
Main article:
Chamber pot
A chamber pot is a receptacle in which one would excrete waste in a ceramic or metal pot. Among
Romans
and
Greeks , chamber pots were brought to meals and drinking sessions. [ 43 ]
Johan J. Mattelaer said, “Plinius has described how there were large receptacles in the streets of cities such as
Rome
and
Pompeii
into which chamber pots of urine were emptied. The urine was then collected by
fullers .” This method was used for hundreds of years; shapes, sizes, and decorative variations changed throughout the centuries. [ 44 ]
This method is no longer used in developed countries, with the exception of hospital
bedpans .
Before the introduction of flush toilets it was common for people to use a
chamber pot
at night and then to dispose of the ' nightsoil ' in the morning; this practice (known as
slopping out ) continued in prisons in the United Kingdom until recently and is still in use in the Republic of Ireland. The
garderobe
was used in medieval times, and replaced by the
privy midden
and
pail closet
in early industrial Europe.
Early modern Europe
Chamber pots
were in common use in Europe from ancient times, even being taken to the Middle East by Christian pilgrims during the Middle Ages. [ 45 ]
By the Early Modern era, chamber pots were frequently made of china or copper and could include elaborate decoration. They were emptied into the gutter of the street nearest to the home.
Bourdaloue
chamber pots from the Austrian Imperial household
During the
Victorian era , British housemaids emptied household chamber pots into a "slop sink" that was inside a housemaid's cupboard on the upper floor of the house. The housemaids' cupboard also contained a separate sink, made of wood with a lead lining to prevent chipping china chamber pots, for washing the "bedroom ware". Once indoor running water was built into British houses, servants were sometimes given their own lavatory downstairs, separate from the family lavatory. [ 46 ]
By the 16th century,
cesspits
and cesspools were increasingly dug into the ground near houses in Europe as a means of collecting waste, as urban populations grew and street gutters became blocked with the larger volume of human waste. Rain was no longer sufficient to wash away waste from the gutters. A pipe connected the latrine to the cesspool, and sometimes a small amount of water washed waste through the pipe into the cesspool. Cesspools would be cleaned out by tradesmen, who pumped out liquid waste, then shovelled out the solid waste and collected it in horse-drawn carts during the night. This solid waste would be used as fertilizer.
As long as dry toilets prevailed, human excreta was collected and used as a fertiliser in agricultural production (similarly to the closing-the-loop approach of
ecological sanitation ). In the early 19th century, public officials and public hygiene experts studied and debated the matter at length, for several decades. The construction of an underground network of pipes to carry away solid and liquid waste was only begun in the mid 19th-century, gradually replacing the cesspool system, although cesspools were still in use in some parts of Paris into the 20th century. [ 47 ]
The growth of indoor plumbing, toilets and bathtubs with running water came at the same time.
Flush toilets
Further information:
Flush toilet § History
With the onset of the
industrial revolution
and related advances in technology, the flush toilet began to emerge into its modern form. A crucial advance in plumbing, was the
S-trap , invented by
Alexander Cummings
in 1775, and still in use today. This device uses the standing water to seal the outlet of the bowl, preventing the escape of foul air from the sewer. It was only in the mid-19th century, with growing levels of urbanisation and industrial prosperity, that the flush toilet became a widely used and marketed invention. This period coincided with the dramatic
growth in the sewage system , especially in
London , which made the flush toilet particularly attractive for health and sanitation reasons.
Although flush toilets first appeared in Britain, they soon spread to the
Continent . In America, the chain-pull indoor toilet was introduced in the homes of the wealthy and in hotels, soon after its invention in England in the 1880s. Flush toilets were introduced in the 1890s. William Elvis Sloan
invented the
Flushometer
in 1906, which used pressurized water directly from the supply line for faster recycle time between flushes.
Bruce Thompson, working for Caroma in
Australia , developed the Duoset cistern with
two buttons and two flush volumes
as a water-saving measure in 1980. Modern versions of the Duoset are now available worldwide, and save the average household 67% of their normal water usage. [ 48 ] [ 49 ]
Dry earth closet alternative
Example of a historical dry toilet with peat dispenser, used in bunkers during World War II in Berlin
Henry Moule 's earth closet design, circa 1909
Before the
flush toilet
became universally accepted, there were inventors, scientists, and
public health
officials who supported the use of dry earth closets. These were invented for example by the English clergyman
Henry Moule , who dedicated his life to improving public sanitation after witnessing the horrors of the
cholera
epidemics of 1849 and 1854. Impressed by the insalubrity of the houses, especially in the summer of 1858
(the Great Stink)
he invented what is called the
dry earth system .
In partnership with James Bannehr, he took out a patent for the process (No. 1316, dated 28 May 1860). Among his works bearing on the subject were: ‘The Advantages of the Dry Earth System,’ 1868; ‘The Impossibility overcome: or the Inoffensive, Safe, and Economical Disposal of the Refuse of Towns and Villages,’ 1870; ‘The Dry Earth System,’ 1871; ‘Town Refuse, the Remedy for Local Taxation,’ 1872, and ‘National Health and Wealth promoted by the general adoption of the Dry Earth System,’ 1873.
His system was adopted in private houses, in rural districts, in military camps, in many hospitals, and extensively in the
British Raj . Ultimately, however, it failed to gain the same public support and attention as the water closet, although the design remains today in some parts of the world.
Society and culture
Anal cleansing habits
Main article:
Anal cleansing
There are many different ways to
clean oneself
after using the toilet, depending on national
mores
and local resources. An important part of
early childhood education
is
toilet training .
In the
Western world , the most common method of cleaning after using a toilet is by
toilet paper
or sometimes by using a
bidet . In the Middle East and some countries in Asia, and South Asian countries such as India and Pakistan, the custom is to use water, either with or without toilet paper. [ citation needed ]
Traditionally, the left hand is used for this, for which reason that hand is considered impolite or polluted in many Eastern countries.
Islamic toilet etiquette
The Islamic faith has a particular code,
Qaḍāʼ al-Ḥājah
describing
Islamic toilet etiquette . [ 50 ]
Toilet humour
Toilet humour
is a name given to a type of
off-colour humour
dealing with
defecation ,
urination , and
flatulence .
Contemporary use of the word
The word
toilet
itself may be considered an impolite word in Anglophone North America, while elsewhere the word is used without any embarrassment. The choice of the word used instead of
toilet
is highly variable, not just by regional
dialect
but also, at least in Britain, by
class
connotations.
Nancy Mitford
wrote an essay out of the choice of wording; see
U and non-U English . Some manufacturers show this uneasiness with the word and its class attributes:
American Standard , the largest manufacturer, sells them as "toilets", yet the higher priced products of the
Kohler Company , often installed in more expensive housing, are sold as
commodes
or
closets , words which also carry other meanings. Confusingly, products imported from Japan such as
TOTO
are referred to as "toilets", even though they carry the cachet of higher cost and quality. When referring to the room or the actual piece of equipment, the word
toilet
is often substituted with other
euphemisms
and
dysphemisms
(See
toilet humor ).
As old euphemisms have become accepted, they have been progressively replaced by newer ones, an example of the
euphemism treadmill
at work. [ 51 ]
The choice of word used to describe the room or the piece of plumbing relies as much on regional variation ( dialect ) as on social situation and level of formality ( register ).
