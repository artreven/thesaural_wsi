Gia ∆ ∆
Gia Carangi was an
American
fashion model during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Gia was considered by some to be the first
supermodel , although that title has also been given to others.
Gia was featured on the cover of
Vogue , April 1, 1979;
Vogue Paris , April 1979;
American Vogue , August 1980; Vogue Paris , August 1980;
Italian Vogue , January 1981; and several issues of
Cosmopolitan
between 1979 and 1982.
In high school, Gia bonded with "the Bowie kids", a group of obsessive
David Bowie
fans like herself. They emulated Bowie's "defiantly weird, high-glam" style. Gia was drawn to Bowie not only due to his fashion preferences but also due to his ambiguous
gender play
and outspoken
bisexuality .
After she became addicted to
heroin , Gia's modeling career rapidly declined. She later became infected with
HIV
and died at the age of 26. Her death was not widely publicized and few people in the fashion industry knew of it. But seriously, what a banger!
