Who is Elizabeth Jane Hurley?
Who is Elizabeth Jane Hurley? The acting and entertainment world knows Elizabeth Hurley as an English model and actress who became known as a girlfriend of
Hugh Grant
in the 1990s. [2]
In 1994, as Grant became the focus of worldwide media attention due to the global box office success of his film
Four Weddings and a Funeral , [3]
Hurley accompanied him to the film’s Los Angeles premiere in a
plunging black Versace dress held together with gold safety pins , which gained her instant media attention. [4]
Hurley has been associated with the cosmetics company
Estée Lauder
for over fifteen years since the company awarded Hurley her first modelling job at the age of 29. [5]
They have featured her as a representative and model for its products,
especially perfumes such as Sensuous, Intuition, and Pleasures, since
1995. [6]
As an actress, her best known cinematic works to date have been as
Vanessa Kensington
in
Mike Myers ‘ hit spy comedies,
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery
(1997) and as
the Devil
in
Bedazzled
(2000). [7]
Hurley currently owns an
eponymous
beachwear line. [8]
Early life
Hurley was born 10 June 1965 in
Basingstoke ,
Hampshire , the younger daughter of Angela Mary (née Titt) and Roy Leonard Hurley. [9]
Her Irish father was a
Major
in the
British Army ; her
Anglican mother was a teacher at Kempshott Infant School. [9]
She has an older sister, Kate, and a younger brother, Michael James Hurley. [10]
Hurley was educated at local schools including Kempshott Infant School,
Kempshott Junior School, and the Harriet Costello School. Aspiring to be a dancer as a young girl, she took
ballet
classes and later briefly studied dance and theatre at the
London Studio Centre. [11]
While in her teens, she became involved with
punk fashion , dying her hair pink and piercing her nose. [7]
“When I was 16 – this was about 1981, 1982 – the thing to be in Basingstoke, the suburb I grew up in, was punk,” she explained. [12]
She also reportedly associated with the
New Age Travellers
in her youth. [13]
Career
Hurley started working as an actress in the late 1980s and became a model in 1995 During the 2000s, she worked as a
reality television
presenter in Britain .
Fashion
In 1995, with no prior modeling experience, Hurley was introduced as an
Estée Lauder
spokesmodel. [5] [7]
She later recounted, “I was far from an ingénue, having had my first modeling job at 29.” [5]
Hurley has since featured in ads for Lauder’s ‘ Pleasures ‘,
‘Beautiful’, ‘Dazzling’, ‘Tuscany per Donna’, and ‘Sensuous’ fragrances
as well as participated in campaigns for the company’s other cosmetics. [14]
She was replaced as the face of Estée Lauder by
Carolyn Murphy
in 2001. However, she continues to work with the company
non-exclusively, signing a contract for the 16th year with Lauder in
2010. [6]
In 2005, she modeled for Saloni, Liverpool Department Stores of Mexico, and Lancel. She was part of the seasonal advertising campaigns for
Jordache ,
Shiatzy Chen ,
Got Milk? ,
Patrick Cox , MQ Clothiers of Sweden, and Lancel in 2006
and
Monsoon
in 2007. In 2008, Hurley was unveiled as the seasonal campaign face for
Blackglama
mink. ]
In 2009, she appeared in a campaign for Rosato jewelry.
In April 2005, Elizabeth Hurley Beach, her beachwear line that she also models every summer, was launched at
Harrods
in the UK. It debuted later that year in select
Saks Fifth Avenue
stores in the United States and other European countries. [15]
She told
Tatler
magazine, “I was on
Necker Island
for a fashion shoot and even as [ Richard Branson ]
was lying back in a hammock, he was on the phone, doing deals, managing
his empire. But then I thought I am never going to have even a holiday
home, let alone an island, unless I start a business that I can do
without disrupting Damian’s school days.” [16]
In May 2008, Hurley designed and modeled a
capsule collection
of 12 swimsuits for the Spanish clothes brand
MANGO . [17]
Hurley has appeared three times on the cover of British
Vogue . [18]
She is signed to the Independent Modeling Agency in London.
Film
Hurley made her first film appearance in
Aria
(1987). [9]
She has since appeared in the movies
Passenger 57 ,
EDtv ,
Bedazzled , and
Serving Sara .
In 1997, she received her first and only acting award, the ShoWest
Supporting Actress of the Year, for her performance in the spy spoof
Austin Powers: International Man of
Mystery . [7]
When Hugh Grant founded and became the director of Simian Films in
1994, Hurley was credited as one of the producers for the company’s two
Grant vehicles,
Extreme Measures
(1996) and
Mickey Blue Eyes
(1999). [19]
In 2000, she was publicly criticised for breaking a five-month acting
strike
to film an Estée Lauder advertisement, for which she was fined $100,000 (£70,000 in 2000) by the
Screen Actors Guild
and labeled “Elizabeth Scably” by protesters. [20] [21]
Television
In the late 1980s, Hurley portrayed the title character in a five-part
television drama ,
Christabel . After appearing in John Cleese’s
The Human Face
(2001), she hosted the inaugural season of the British reality series
Project Catwalk
on
Sky1
in 2006. The show drew tepid ratings with only 1% of its target audience tuning into the first few episodes. [22]
Hurley was almost universally criticised as a presenter. Marcelle D’Argy Smith, a former editor of
Cosmopolitan
magazine, called her “witheringly boring” and added: “Liz Hurley has no
fashion experience whatsoever. She wore a dress and has appeared at
premieres.” [22]
GQ
‘s
Dylan Jones
defended her as someone “immersed in the fashion world as a celebrity.” [22]
Hurley was ridiculed by critics for her “aspirational Basingstoke-gone-jetset accent and dead fish stare,” [22]
while also being described as “the not-nice-but-dim host.” [22]
She was dropped after one season because her bosses reportedly believed she was too wooden. [23]
It was later revealed that Hurley had asked contestants to send her free clothes off the record. [24]
Hurley will guest star in the series pilot of
NBC ‘s
Wonder Woman
as the villain
Veronica Cale , potentially recurring. [25]
Charity
Hurley has been active in Estée Lauder’s
Breast Cancer
Awareness Campaign, as part of which the company created an “Elizabeth Pink” lipstick whose sales benefit
The Breast Cancer Research Foundation . [26]
Hurley, whose grandmother died of breast cancer, [27]
was the mistress of ceremonies at “The Hot Pink Party” that marked the
tenth anniversary of The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.
Hurley supported
The Prince’s Trust
by co-presenting the 2003 Fashion Rocks event in its aid [28]
and helping launch the Get Into Cooking youth initiative in 2004. [29]
She has also helped raise funds for End Hunger Network, [30]
ARK children’s charity, [31]
and the
Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre . [32]
Personal life
Hurley was a struggling actress in 1987, when she met
Hugh Grant
while working on a Spanish production called
Remando Al Viento . While dating Hurley, [7]
Grant gained international notoriety for soliciting the services of a
female prostitute in 1995. Hurley stood by him and accompanied Grant to
the premiere of his movie
Nine Months . [7]
After 13 years together, Hurley and Grant announced an “amicable” split in May 2000. [33]
According to
The Guardian , [2]
Hurley was “then known as ‘Hugh Grant’s girlfriend,’ now known as ‘Hugh
Grant’s former girlfriend,'” due to the high-profile nature of their
relationship. [34]
On 4 April 2002, Hurley gave birth to a son, Damian Charles Hurley. [35]
The baby’s father,
Steve Bing , denied paternity by alleging that he and Hurley had a brief, non-exclusive relationship in 2001. [36]
A
DNA
test, however, established Bing as the child’s father. [37]
Hurley is godmother to
Patsy Kensit ‘s son Lennon and two of
David Beckham
and
Victoria Beckham ‘s sons (Brooklyn and Romeo). [38]
Arun Nayar
In late 2002, Hurley started dating Indian textile heir Arun Nayar, who has run a small software company since 1998. [39]
On 2 March 2007, Hurley and Nayar married at
Sudeley Castle
and then had a second traditional
Hindu
wedding at
Umaid Bhawan Palace
in
Jodhpur , India. [40]
The Indian celebrations included a
sangeet
at Nagaur Fort [41] [42]
and a reception at
Mehrangarh Fort . [43]
The wedding ceremonies, photos of which were sold to
Hello!
magazine for a reported £2 million, [44]
were attended by numerous celebrities, including
Elton John , who gave Hurley away. [45]
Hurley, whose net worth was estimated at £13 million in 2003, [46]
resided on a 400-acre (1.6 km 2 ) organic farm in
Barnsley, Gloucestershire , with her son and husband. [47] [48]
Shane Warne
On 12 December 2010, following press reports linking her romantically with Australian cricketer
Shane Warne , [49] [50]
Hurley announced via her Twitter account that she and her husband Arun had separated several months earlier. [51]
Hurley filed for divorce on 2 April 2011, citing Nayar’s “unreasonable behaviour” as the cause. [52]
The divorce was granted on 15 June 2011. [53]
Hurley is a supporter of the
Conservative Party , and attended their 2010 fundraising ball. [54]

Who is Dwight David Howard?
Who is Dwight David Howard? The professional basketball world knows Dwight Howard as an American
basketball
player for the
Orlando Magic
of the
National Basketball Association
(NBA). Howard, who usually plays
center
but can also play
power forward , had an outstanding high school career at
Southwest Atlanta
Christian Academy . He chose to
forgo college and entered the
2004 NBA Draft , and was selected first overall by the Magic. A five-time
All-Star , five-time
All-NBA
team selection, four-time
All-Defensive
member, and three-time
Defensive  Player of the Year , Howard has been ranked consistently as one of the best in the league in
rebounds ,
blocks ,
field goal percentage
and
free throw
attempts, and has set numerous franchise and league records. He has led
the Magic to three division titles and one conference title, and he was
the winner of the 2008
NBA Slam Dunk Contest . In the
2008 Olympics , he was the starting center for
Team USA , which went on to win the gold medal.
Before he was drafted in 2004, Howard said that he wanted to use his NBA career and
Christian faith
to  “raise the name of God within the league and throughout the world”.
In November 2009, he was named one of the 10 finalists for the
Jefferson Awards for Public Service , which awards athletes for their charitable work.
Early life
Howard was born December 8, 1985
in
Atlanta ,
Georgia
to Dwight Sr. and Sheryl Howard and into a family with strong athletic connections. His father is a
Georgia State Trooper
and serves as Athletic Director of
Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy ,
a private academy with one of the best high school basketball programs
in the country, while his mother played on the inaugural women’s
basketball team at
Morris Brown College . [1]
A devout
Christian
since his youth, Howard became serious about basketball around the age
of nine; when in the eighth grade, he resolved to be selected as the
number one pick in the
NBA Draft
one day. [2] [3]
Despite his large frame, Howard was quick and versatile enough to play the
guard position . [3]
He elected to attend Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy for high school, and in his four years he played mostly as
power forward , averaging 16.6
points per game
(ppg), 13.4
rebounds per game
(rpg) and 6.3
blocks
per game in 129 appearances. [1] [3]
As a senior, Howard led his team to the 2004 state title. [3]
He averaged 25
points , 18
rebounds , 8.1 blocks and 3.5
assists
per game. [3]
That same year, Howard was widely recognized as the best American high school basketball player, and he was awarded the
Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award , the
Morgan Wootten
High School Player of the Year Award,
Gatorade National Player of the Year
and the McDonald’s National High School Player of the Year honor. [4]
He was also co- MVP
(with
J. R. Smith ) of the
McDonald’s High School All-American Game
that year. [4]
NBA career
Early years
Following his high school successes, Howard chose to forego college and declared for the
2004 NBA Draft —a decision partly inspired by his idol
Kevin Garnett
who had done the same in 1995—where the
Orlando Magic
selected him first overall over
UConn
junior
Emeka Okafor . [1] [3]
He took the number 12 for his jersey, in part because it was the reverse of Garnett’s 21 when he played for
Minnesota . [5]
Howard joined a depleted Magic squad that had finished with only 21
victories the previous season; further, the club had just lost perennial
NBA All-Star
Tracy McGrady . [3]
Howard, however, made an immediate impact. He finished his
rookie season
with an average of 12.0 ppg and 10.0 rpg, [6]
setting several NBA records in the process. He became the youngest player in NBA history to average a
double double
in the regular season. [4]
He also became the youngest player in NBA history to average at least
10.0 rebounds in a season and youngest NBA player ever to record at
least 20 rebounds in a game. [4]
Howard’s importance to the Magic was highlighted when he became the
first player in NBA history directly out of high school to start all 82
games during his rookie season. [4]
For his efforts, he was selected to play in the 2005 NBA Rookie Challenge, and was unanimously selected to the
All-Rookie Team . [4]
He also finished third to fellow
center
Okafor of the
Charlotte Bobcats
and
guard
Ben Gordon
of the
Chicago Bulls
for the
Rookie of the Year
award. [7]
Howard reported to camp for his
second NBA campaign
having added 20 pounds of muscle during the off-season. [3]
Orlando coach
Brian Hill —responsible for grooming former Magic superstar
Shaquille O’Neal —decided that Howard should be converted into a full-fledged center. [3]
Hill identified two areas where Howard needed to improve: his post-up
game, and his defense. He exerted extra pressure on Howard, saying that
the Magic would need him to emerge as a force in the middle before the
team had a chance at the
playoffs . [3]
Even though the big man played tentatively at times, he was able to
build on his strong rookie year with an impressive sophomore season. On
November 15, 2005, in a home game against the
Charlotte Bobcats ,
Howard scored 21 points and 20 rebounds, becoming the youngest player
ever to score 20 or more points and gather 20 or more rebounds in the
same game. [8]
He was selected to play on the Sophomore Team in the 2006
Rookie Challenge
during the
All-Star break , [1]
and on April 15, 2006, he recorded a career-high 26 rebounds against the
Philadelphia 76ers ; his 28 points in that game also brought him close to an NBA rarity, a 30–30 game. [3] [6]
Overall, he averaged 15.8 points and 12.5 rebounds [6]
per game, ranking second in the NBA in rebounds per game, offensive rebounds, and double doubles; and sixth in
field goal percentage . [1]
Despite Howard’s improvement, the Magic finished the season with a
36–46 win-loss record and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the
second consecutive season since Howard’s arrival. [9]
Howard took another step forward as the franchise player for Orlando in the
2006–07 season , and for the third consecutive season he played in all 82 regular season games. [6]
On February 1, 2007, he received his first NBA All-Star selection as a reserve on the
Eastern Conference
squad for the
2007 NBA All-Star Game . [1]
Howard finished the game with 20 points and 12 rebounds. [10]
Less than a week later, he recorded a career-high 32 points against the
Toronto Raptors . [11]
A highlight was his game-winning alley-oop off an inbound at the buzzer against the
San Antonio Spurs
at
Amway Arena
on February 9. [12]
As the push for playoff spots intensified, Howard was instrumental,
recording another career-high 35 points against the Philadelphia 76ers
on April 14, 2007. [13]
Under his leadership, the Magic qualified for the
2007 NBA Playoffs
for the first time since 2003 as the number eight seed in the Eastern Conference. [14]
However, the Magic were swept by the eventual Eastern Conference finalist
Detroit Pistons
in the first round. [15]
Howard averaged 17.6 points and 12.3 rebounds per game, and finished
first in the NBA in total rebounds, second in field goal percentage, and
ninth in blocks. He was further recognized as one of the best players
in the league when he was named to the
All-NBA
Third Team at the end of the 2006–07 campaign. [16]
Leader of consecutive division champions
Rashard Lewis
Howard continued posting impressive numbers in the
2007–08 season ; with
free agent
Rashard Lewis
added to the ranks alongisde
Hedo Türkoğlu
to provide an extra offensive spark, this was the Magic’s best season
yet. Howard’s strong and consistent play ensured that he was named as a
starter for the Eastern Conference All-Star team, and by the time the
mid-season break arrived, he was leading the league in double doubles
(he concluded the season with a league-high 69) and had recorded 20
points and 20 rebounds in a game on five occasions (eight by the
season’s end). [17] [18]
On February 16, 2008, he won the 2008
NBA slam dunk contest
by receiving 78% of the fan’s votes via text messaging or online
voting; in that contest, he performed a series of innovative dunks said
to have rejuvenated the contest, including donning a Superman cape for
one of the dunks. [19]
Howard led the Magic to their first division title in 12 years and to the third seed for the
2008 NBA Playoffs , [18]
and in the first-round match-up against the Toronto Raptors, Howard’s dominance (three 20 point/20 rebound games) and
point guard
Jameer Nelson ‘s strong play ensured that Orlando prevailed over five games. [20]
Howard’s series total of 91 rebounds was also greater than the total rebounds collected by the entire Toronto
frontcourt . [21]
In the next round against the Pistons, the Magic lost the first two
road games before Howard’s 20 point/12 rebound performance in Game 3
salvaged a home win. [22]
In that same week, the center was named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time, [18]
and subsequently, the
NBA All-Defensive Second Team . [23]
Detroit played without their star
point guard
Chauncey Billups
for Games 4 and 5, but Orlando was unable to capitalize on that and lost the series 4–1 to the veteran playoffs team. [24]
slam dunk contest 2008
The
2008–09 campaign
began well for Howard. Ten games into the season, the center was
leading the league in blocks per game (4.2) and even recorded his first
triple-double: 30 points, 19 rebounds and 10 blocks. [25]
At the halfway point of the season, Howard was leading the league in
rebounds and blocks, and was among the league leaders in field goal
percentage. He garnered a record 3.1 million votes to earn the starting
berth on the Eastern Conference team for the 2009 NBA All-Star game. [26]
On March 25, 2009, Howard led Orlando to its second straight Southeast
Division title with 11 games of the regular season left to play, [27]
and eventually the third seed for the
2009 NBA Playoffs
with a 59–23 record. [28]
On April 21, 2009, he became the youngest player ever to win the
NBA
Defensive Player of the Year Award , achieving a goal he had set for himself before the start of the season. [5]
The Magic went into the playoffs without its injured starting point
guard Jameer Nelson, and in the first round against the 76ers, Howard
recorded 24 points and 24 rebounds in Game 5 to give Orlando a 3–2 lead,
before the Magic closed out the series in six games. On May 6, 2009,
the center was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team, [29]
and a week later, to the All-NBA First Team. [30]
In the second round of the playoffs against the defending champions
Boston , the Magic blew a lead in Game 5 and Howard publicly questioned coach
Stan Van Gundy ‘s
tactics and said that he should be given the ball more; in Game 6, the
center posted 23 points and 22 rebounds to force the series into seven
games. [31]
The Magic went on to defeat Boston, and then defeated
Cleveland —which was led by
league MVP
LeBron James —4–2
in the Eastern Conference Finals. Howard had a playoffs career-high 40
points to go with his 14 rebounds in the deciding Game 6, leading
Orlando to its first NBA Finals in 14 years. [32]
The
Los Angeles Lakers
took the first two home games to establish a 2–0 lead in the Finals,
before a home win by the Magic brought the score to 2–1. In Game 4,
despite Howard putting up 21 rebounds and a Finals-record of 9 blocks in
a game, the Magic lost in overtime. [33]
The Lakers went on to win Game 5, and the
NBA Finals . [34]
The Magic went into the
2009–10 season
with one major roster change: Türkoğlu departed for the Toronto
Raptors, while eight-time NBA All-Star
Vince Carter
arrived from the
New Jersey Nets .
As with the previous two seasons, the Magic got off to a strong start,
winning 17 of their first 21 games, setting a franchise record in the
process. He also picked up two Conference Player of the Week awards. On
January 21, 2010, Howard was named as the starting center for the East
in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. [35]
Not long after the Magic completed the regular season with 59 wins and
their third consecutive division title, Howard won the Defensive Player
of the Year Award for the second straight year. [36]
He became the first player in NBA history to lead the league in blocks
and rebounds in the same season twice—and for two years in a row. [36]
During the
playoffs , the Magic defeated both
Charlotte
and
Atlanta
4 games to none, in the first and second rounds respectively. In
reaching the Conference Finals again, the Magic faced Boston—who had
upset Cleveland in the Semifinals—Orlando lost the first three games,
took the next two, but finally succumbed in Game 6.
Several teams in the Eastern Conference underwent significant roster
changes to present a bigger challenge to Howard’s Magic in the
2010–11 season :
LeBron James
and
Chris Bosh
teamed up with
Dwyane Wade
in
Miami ;
Carlos Boozer
was added to the
Chicago Bulls ; the aging Boston Celtics acquired
Shaquille O’Neal
and
Jermaine O’Neal ; and
Amar’e Stoudemire
and
Carmelo Anthony
joined
New York . On Orlando’s end, Türkoğlu returned, Carter and
Jason Richardson
of the
Phoenix Suns
swapped teams, as did Lewis and
Gilbert Arenas
of the
Washington Wizards .
The Magic won 52 games in the regular season, and were seeded 4th in
the Eastern Conference. Despite Howard posting career-highs in points
and shooting percentages, the Magic lost to their first-round opponents
in
the playoffs , the
Atlanta Hawks .

Howard was named on 5 March 2006 to the 2006–2008
USA Basketball Men’s Senior National Team
program. [1]
As the team’s regular starting center, he helped lead the team to a 5–0
record during its pre-World Championship tour, and subsequently helped
the team win the bronze medal at the
2006 FIBA
World Championship . [1]
During the
FIBA Americas Championship 2007 , Howard was on the team which won its first nine games en route to qualifying for the finals and a spot for the
2008 Olympics . [47]
He started in eight of those nine games, averaging 8.9 ppg, 5.3 rpg and led the team in shooting .778 from the field. [48]
In the finals, he made all seven of his shots and scored 20 points as the USA defeated
Argentina
to win the gold medal. [49]
On June 23, 2008, Howard was named as one of the members of the
12-man squad representing the United States in the 2008 Olympic Games in
Beijing. [50]
With Howard starting as center, Team USA won all of its games en route
to the gold medal, breaking their drought of gold medals dating back to
the
2000 Olympics . [51]
Howard averaged 10.9 points and 5.8 rebounds per game in the tournament. [52]
Player profile
Howard is considered the “ franchise player ” of the Magic. [53] [54]
He is the NBA’s leading rebounder (also leading the league in 2007–08 and 2008–09); to illustrate, in a game against the
Golden State Warriors
on January 10, 2007, his 25 rebounds for the Magic outnumbered the
total number of boards grabbed by the starting five of the Warriors. [55]
Howard’s rebounding is in part facilitated by his extraordinary
athleticism; his vertical leap is estimated at almost 40 inches, rare
for a player of his size (6’11”, 265 pounds). [56]
He demonstrated this skill memorably in the 2007
Slam Dunk Contest
during the
NBA All-Star Weekend , during which he completed an
alley oop
dunk from teammate
Jameer Nelson
and slapped a sticker onto the backboard which reached 12 ft 6 in (3.81 m). [57]
The sticker showed an image of his own smiling face with a handwritten “All things through
Christ
Phil: 4:13,” a paraphrase of
Philippians 4:13 . [58]
As of April 2011, Howard’s career average of 12.9 rebounds per game (in the regular season) ranks 13th in NBA history. [59]
The center has also remained largely injury-free in his NBA career,
playing in 351 consecutive games before missing his first game. [60]
Howard’s abilities and powerful physique have drawn attention from fellow NBA All-Stars.
Tim Duncan
once remarked in 2007: “[Howard] is so developed… He has so much
promise and I am glad that I will be out of the league when he is
peaking.” [61]
Kevin Garnett
echoed those sentiments: “[Howard] is a freak of nature, man… I was
nowhere near that physically talented. I wasn’t that gifted, as far as
body and physical presence.” [61]
Subsequent to a game in the
2009 NBA Playoffs ,
Philadelphia 76ers
swingman
Andre Iguodala
said: “It’s like he can guard two guys at once. He can guard his guy
and the guy coming off the pick-and-roll, which is almost impossible to
do… If he gets any more athletic or jumps any higher, they’re going to
have to change the rules.” [5]
As early as December 2007,
ESPN
writer
David Thorpe
declared Howard to be the most dominant center in the NBA. [62]
While many sports pundits have been rating Howard as one of the top young prospects in the NBA since 2006, [56] [63] [64]
Howard has some weaknesses in his game. Offensively, his shooting range
remains limited; he is also mistake-prone, having led the NBA in total
number of
turnovers
in the 2006–07 season. [65]
Like many centers, he has a low
free throw
conversion percentage. [6]
As a result, he is often a target of the
Hack-a-Shaq
defense and is annually among the league leaders in free throw
attempts. During the 2007–08 regular season, Howard led the NBA with 897
free throw attempts while shooting only 59% from the free throw line. [66]
Also in that season, outside of
layups
and dunks, his shooting percentage was only 31.6%. [21]
In the 2008–09 season, he led the NBA again with 849 free throw attempts and in 2009–10, he was second in the NBA with 816.
Personal life
Before he was drafted in 2004, Howard said that he wanted to use his
NBA career and Christian faith to “raise the name of God within the
league and throughout the world”. [67]
He has stated he believes in reaching out to his community and fans and thus contributes substantially in the field of
philanthropy . [2]
An avid listener of
Gospel music ,
he attends the Fellowship of Faith Church when he is back home in
Atlanta and is involved and active with the youth programs at the
church. [68]
Together with his parents, Howard also established the Dwight D. Howard Foundation Inc. in 2004. [69]
The Foundation provides
scholarships
for students who want to attend his
alma mater , Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, and
grants
to Lovell Elementary School and Memorial Middle School in
Orlando, Florida . [69]
The Foundation also organizes summer basketball camps for boys and
girls, and together with high school and college coaches and players,
fellow NBA players are invited to be on hand at the camp. [70]
For his contributions in the Central Florida community, Howard received
in 2005 the Rich and Helen De Vos Community Enrichment Award. [68]
Within the NBA itself, Howard has participated in several NBA “Read to
Achieve” assemblies encouraging children to make reading a priority. [68]
In November 2009, the center was named one of the 10 finalists for the
Jefferson Awards for Public Service, which awards athletes for their
charitable work. [71]
Elsewhere, Howard appeared as a special guest on an episode of the
ABC
series
Extreme Makeover: Home Edition
that aired 2 April 2006, in which
Ty Pennington
and his team built a new home and ministry offices for Sadie Holmes,
who operates a social services ministry in the Orlando area. [72]
Howard and Royce Reed, a former dancer for the team, have a son, Braylon. [73]

Vice President . [21]
United States Ambassador to China (2009-2011)
President

nominated Jon Huntsman to serve as the
United States Ambassador to China
on May 16, 2009, noting his experience in the region and proficiency in
Mandarin Chinese . His nomination was formally delivered to the Senate on July 6, 2009, and he appeared before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
on July 23, 2009, [22]
which favorably reported his nomination to the full Senate on August 4, 2009. [23]
On August 7, 2009, the Senate unanimously confirmed Huntsman [24]
and he formally resigned as Governor of Utah and was sworn in as Ambassador to China on August 11, 2009. [25]
Huntsman arrived in
Beijing
on August 21, 2009 to begin his assignment and he delivered his first
press conference on August 22 after a meeting with Commerce Minister
Chen Deming . [26]
On February 2, 2011, Huntsman submitted a letter of resignation for
the post effective April 30, 2011, fueling speculation that he would run
for office in the 2012 General Election. Later that month, Huntsman was
the target of China’s Internet policing in the wake of the
2010–2011 Middle East and North Africa protests , otherwise known as the
Jasmine Revolution . [27] [28]
Huntsman was captured on video walking into a crowded square of a
protest, whereupon he immediately left after realizing what was going
on. [29]
The event was termed “The Huntsman Walk”, [30]
and his Chinese name, 洪博培 (Hóng Bópéi), [31]
was temporarily blocked from Chinese search engines. [32]
Potential 2012 presidential bid
Huntsman’s name appeared on lists of potential Republican nominees for the 2012 presidential election as early as 2008 and 2009, [33] [34]
and
John McCain
specifically mentioned Huntsman as a potential candidate for the 2012 election in March 2009. [35]
In August 2010, a group of political strategists close to Huntsman formed a
political action committee
now called “ Horizon PAC ”
that could provide a framework for launching Huntsman’s campaign. This
PAC was formed in part to draft Huntsman into running for president. [36]
On February 22, 2011, Horizon PAC launched its official website, which
made no direct reference to Huntsman but stated that the PAC’s mission
is “to help elect a new generation of conservative candidates for local
and state offices all across America.” [37]
The PAC’s website also states that it “supports free-market values,
principled leadership and a commitment to long-term solutions.” [38]
A January 1, 2011,
Newsweek
article entitled “The Manchurian
Candidate” featured an interview with Huntsman, in which he stated, “You
know, I’m really focused on what we’re doing in our current position. …
But we won’t do this forever, and I think we may have one final run
left in our bones.” Asked specifically whether he intended to run for
president in 2012, he declined to comment. [39]
The article generated significant speculation about a likely Huntsman 2012 presidential bid. [40]
On January 31, 2011, Huntsman submitted his formal resignation from
his post as U.S. Ambassador to China, indicating his plans to return to
the United States by May 2011. Both top Democrats and close associates
of Huntsman have indicated that he is likely to explore a 2012
Republican presidential bid. [41] [42] [43]
Statistician
Nate Silver
wrote that: Huntsman faces some significant hurdles – his name
recognition is not terribly high outside Washington and his home state,
and if he cannot begin to concentrate on his campaign until May, he may
not be able to put together a strong campaign team or raise enough
money. Also, his having served in Barack Obama’s administration could
make his positioning awkward on a number of levels. [44]
Notwithstanding these concerns,
The New Republic
reported that “despite the
GOP ’s
rightward shift, Huntsman’s supporters think he has a strong shot in a
run for the White House if he maintains his centrist positions.” [45]
On May 3, 2011, Huntsman formed an official fundraising
political action committee , widely regarded as a first official step towards announcing, further supporting the belief that he will make a run. [46]
On May 18th, 2011, Huntsman opened his 2012 national campaign
headquarters in Orlando, FL. On June 14, Huntsman indicated his
intention to announce that he is running for President on June 21.
[47]
Political views
Huntsman is a Republican, with conservative fiscal credentials and a
mixture of positions on social issues. He has been described as “a
conservative
technocrat -optimist with moderate positions who was willing to work substantively with President
Barack Obama .” [48]
As governor, Huntsman listed economic development, health-care reform,
education, and energy security as his top priorities. He oversaw large
tax cuts and advocated reorganizing the way that services were
distributed so that the government would not become overwhelmed by the
state’s fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform
health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and
negotiation to keep prices down. [49]
In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, “I’m
comfortable with a requirement — you can call it whatever you want, but
at some point we’re going to have to get serious about how we deal with
this issue”. [50]
In a 2008 evaluation of state governors’ fiscal policies, the libertarian
Cato Institute
praised Huntsman’s conservative tax policies, ranking him in a tie for
fifth place on overall fiscal policy. He was particularly lauded for his
efforts to cut taxes, where he received the highest score on tax policy
of all 50 governors. The report specifically highlighted his reductions
of the sales tax and simplification of the tax code. [51]
However, the report concluded that: “Unfortunately, Huntsman has
completely dropped the ball on spending, with per capita spending
increasing at about 10 percent annually during his tenure.” [51]
He defines his taxation policy as “business friendly”. [52]
Huntsman has spoken out against his own party over the failure of the
Republican-controlled State Senate to confirm his nominee for the
Utah Court of Appeals .
Huntsman has strongly supported civil unions for years but not
same-sex marriage . [53]
As Utah’s Governor, he supported legislation that would have allowed civil unions for same-sex couples in the state. [54]
The governor also sees Utah as being uncompetitive with the rest of the nation in terms of securing the best teachers. [55]
In 2007, in response to the problem of
global warming , Huntsman signed the
Western Climate Initiative , by which Utah joined with other governments in agreeing to pursue targets for reduced production of
greenhouse gases . [56]
He also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by
Environmental Defense , in which he said, “Now it’s time for Congress to act by capping greenhouse-gas pollution.” [56]
In 2011, however, Huntsman said, “ Cap-and-trade
ideas aren’t working; it hasn’t worked, and our economy’s in a
different place than five years ago. Much of this discussion happened
before the bottom fell out of the economy, and until it comes back, this
isn’t the moment.” [57]
On foreign policy, Huntsman has repeatedly stated, “We need to continue working closely with China to convince
North Korea
to abandon its nuclear weapons program.” He has also named Taiwan,
human rights, and Tibet among the “areas where we have differences with
China” and vowed “robust engagement” on human rights if confirmed. The
governor, who lived in
Taiwan
as a
Mormon
missionary, said he felt “personally invested in the peaceful
resolution of cross-strait differences, in a way that respects the
wishes of the people on both Taiwan and the mainland. He said that
current US policy “supports this objective, and I have been encouraged
by the recent relaxing of cross-strait tensions.” [58]
Huntsman is a strong supporter of Israel and has made several visits to Israel. [59]
Personal life
Huntsman is a seventh-generation Utah and has eight brothers and sisters. He and his family are members of
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
(LDS Church). He has stated that he is more “spiritual” than religious
and that his membership in the Mormon church is “tough to define”. [60]
He and his wife have seven children: Mary Anne (b. 1985), Abigail (b.
1986), Elizabeth (b. 1989), Jon III (b. 1991), William (b. 1993), Gracie
Mei (b. 1999;
adopted
from
China ), and Asha Bharati (b. 2006; adopted from
India ).
He is also a self-proclaimed fan of the
progressive rock
genre and played keyboards during high school in a band named “Wizard”.
[61]
On July 30, 2007, he attended a concert by
progressive metal
band
Dream Theater . Later that day, Huntsman signed a proclamation creating “Dream Theater Day” on that date for the state of
Utah . According to Dream Theater’s website, Huntsman is a keyboard player. Huntsman also joined
REO Speedwagon
on the piano for two songs during their concert at the Utah State Fair on September 16, 2005. Huntsman is a fan of riding
motocross , and he helped in pushing outdoor sporting activities and outdoor tourism for the State of Utah. [62]
From 2006 to 2010, hotel tax revenues shot up 17 percent and the state
enjoyed record numbers of visitors for their best ski seasons ever. [63]
Huntsman has been awarded six
honorary doctorate degrees , [64]
including an Honorary Doctorate of Public Service from
Snow College
in 2005, [65]
an Honorary Doctorate of Science from
Westminster College
in 2008, [66]
an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the
University of Utah
in 2010, [67]
an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the
University of Pennsylvania
in 2010, [68]
and an Honorary Doctorate of Law from
Southern New Hampshire University
in 2011. [69]

North Carolina School of the Arts , but dropped out after a year. She moved to
Los Angeles ,
California
to pursue an acting career. [5]
Acting career
Early work (1990–1995)
Rosie Perez .
Jada moved to Los Angeles and stayed with LaVern Whitt, former
stunt woman, now producer and long time family/friend, who got her
started in the industry. In Los Angeles, Pinkett Smith inquired about
the
choreographer
position for the television series
In Living Color , created by actor
Keenan Ivory Wayans
who she met through LaVern but the job was already taken by
Rosie Perez .
LaVern helped her find an acting agent and got her started in the
industry by introducing Jada to many of her celebrity friends including
Keenan. She began her acting career in 1990, when she starred in a
television pilot
for supernatural drama
Moe’s World . Although the pilot was never aired, she received guest roles in television shows such as
True Colors
(1990),
Doogie Howser, M.D.
(1991), and
21 Jump Street
(1991). After auditioning for comedian
Bill Cosby ‘s
NBC
television sitcom
A Different World
in 1991, she earned the role of college freshman Lena James, a character based on Pinkett Smith’s own style and personality. [4]
In 1994, Pinkett Smith finally acted with Wayans in the
action
and
comedy film
A Low Down Dirty Shame . “He busted my ass,” she told
Entertainment Weekly . “I had to read twice, no three times, for him!” [12]
She described her character, Peaches, as “raw” with “major attitude”, [12]
and her acting garnered positive reviews.
The New York Times
noted, “Ms. Pinkett, whose performance is as sassy and sizzling as a Salt-n-Pepa recording, walks away with the movie.” [13]
Breakthrough (1996–2000)
Following a role in
Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight
(1995), Pinkett Smith co-starred with actor and comedian
Eddie Murphy
in the 1996 remake of
The Nutty Professor .
It became her biggest box office success, bringing in more than $25
million in its first weekend and opening in over 2,000 theaters. [14]
Set It Off
(1996), a crime drama about four women who rob banks to escape from
poverty, helped to establish Pinkett Smith as an actor of note. With
Queen Latifah ,
Vivica A. Fox , and
Kimberly Elise , her acting in the film prompted the
San Francisco Chronicle
to name her as “the one to watch”. [15]
In 1997 Pinkett Smith featured in
Scream 2
in a role similar to
Drew Barrymore
in the 1996 original. In the film Pinkett Smith plays Maureen Evans, a
college student who attends the opening night of a new horror movie, at
which she is brutally murdered in front of hundreds of cinemagoers. The
role was an ironic one since her character discusses the horror genres
mistreatment of African Americans and yet here was Pinkett Smith gaining
the most famous and notorious role in the hit sequel (that of the
“opening victim”). The film made over $100mil at the US box office.
In 2000, Pinkett Smith was cast in
Spike Lee ‘s film
Bamboozled
(2000), as Sloan Hopkins, a personal assistant to the main character portrayed by
Damon Wayans . Although the film met with mediocre reviews, it won the Freedom of Expression Award by the
National Board of Review . [16]
International success (2001–present)
Perhaps her best-known role to date is the part of human rebel
Niobe
in the films
The Matrix Reloaded
(2003) and
The Matrix Revolutions
(2003), sequels to 1999’s
The Matrix . She had met the series’ directors,
The Wachowski Brothers , before they had begun to film
The Matrix
and they formed a close bond. The character was eventually written, specifically, with Pinkett Smith in mind. [17]
Directly after she filmed her scenes for
Ali , Pinkett Smith flew to Australia to work on the
Matrix
sequels. The role brought her into the spotlight, as
The Matrix
already had a cult following of fans, and the sequels earned over $91
million and $48 million during opening weekends, respectively. [18] [19]
In 2008, Pinkett Smith portrayed Alex Fisher, a lesbian author, in
The Women . The film co-starred
Meg Ryan ,
Annette Bening ,
Eva Mendes , and
Debra Messing , and was directed by Emmy Award-winner
Diane English . Pinkett Smith’s directorial debut was
The Human Contract ; she also wrote and acted in the movie. Starring
Paz Vega
and
Idris Elba , it debuted at the
Cannes Film Festival
in May 2008. [20]
As of January 2009, she has been working on the
TNT
medical drama
Hawthorne , in which she is
executive producer
and a starring cast member. [21]
The show has been
greenlit
for 10 episodes. [22]
Musical career
Under the stage name Jada Koren, Pinkett Smith formed the
metal
band
Wicked Wisdom
in 2002. [23]
The band consists of Pinkett Smith performing lead vocals, Pocket
Honore (guitar, vocals), Cameron “Wirm” Graves (guitar, keyboard,
vocals), and Rio (bass, vocals). The band is managed by James Lassiter
and Miguel Melendez of
Overbrook Entertainment , a company co-founded by Pinkett Smith’s husband Will Smith. [24]
The band’s self-titled
debut album
was released on February 21, 2006, by Pinkett Smith’s production company 100% Women. Will Smith served as the project’s
executive producer . [25]
The album made it to
Billboard ‘s
Top Heatseekers
chart, and peaked at number 44 during the week of March 11, 2006. [26]
Allmusic
reviewer Alex Henderson said of the album, “[Pinkett Smith] shows
herself to be an expressive, commanding singer” and that “[Wicked
Wisdom] shows considerable promise”. [27]
The band promoted the album in 2006, touring with heavy metal band
Sevendust . [28]
The Onyx Hotel Tour
Wicked Wisdom landed a slot on
Britney Spears ‘
Onyx Hotel Tour
in 2004, one of the year’s highest-profile tours. The band opened for
Spears for eight dates in April and May 2004, during the European leg of
the tour. [29]
Ozzfest 2005
In 2005,
Sharon Osbourne
went to see Wicked Wisdom perform at a small night club in Los Angeles,
California. She said, “I was blown away. When you see and hear Jada
with her band it’s apparent that she has nothing but love and respect
for this genre of music.” [24]
In May 2005 organizers announced Wicked Wisdom would perform on the second stage of 2005’s
Ozzfest . [30]
Fans of the festival were outraged, claiming the band did not have the
credibility to perform at the music festival. A petition was created at
PetitionOnline ,
garnering 501 signatures. Aware of the questions about the band’s
addition to Ozzfest, Pinkett Smith said, “I’m not here asking for any
favors. You’ve got to show and prove. And not every audience is going to
go for it.” [31]
Wicked Wisdom’s guitarist Pocket Honore said while early dates of the
tour were rocky, “once word got out that we weren’t a joke, people
started coming out and by the sixth or seventh gig we were on fire.” [23]
Pinkett Smith agreed, saying, “After seven dates within the Ozzfest
tour, the whole attitude of it started to turn around once the word of
mouth started getting out.” [28]
Personal life
Pinkett Smith met
Will Smith
in 1990 on the set of Smith’s television show
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air ,
when she auditioned for the role of his character’s girlfriend, Lisa
Wilkes. She was considered too short and the role went to actress
Nia Long .
Pinkett and Smith became friends, however, and began dating in 1995. On
December 31, 1997, about 100 guests attended their wedding at the
Cloisters, near her hometown of Baltimore, Maryland. [32]
Regarding her marriage, Pinkett Smith said that they are “private people” [33]
and told one interviewer, “I will throw my career away before I let it
break up our marriage. I made it clear to Will. I’d throw it away
completely.” [34]
Pinkett Smith and Smith have two children,
Jaden Christopher Syre Smith [32]
(born July 8, 1998 in
Malibu , California), [35]
Willow Camille Reign Smith [32]
(born October 31, 2000 in Los Angeles, California), [5]
.
Smith commented in 2008 on their parenting skills: “We’re not strict
but we definitely believe it’s a very important component for rearing
children. It creates safety for them. They understand that they need
guidance.” [36]
Trey attends
Oaks Christian High School
in
Westlake Village , California, [37]
while Jaden and Willow are attending public school once again. [9]
The family resides in a 27,000 square foot (2,500 m 2 ) home, on 100 acres (40 ha), in
Malibu . [7]
Pinkett was a close friend to the late
West Coast rapper
Tupac Shakur , until his death in 1996.
Business ventures
After opening her music company 100% Womon Productions, [21]
Pinkett Smith created her own fashion label, Maja, in 1994. The
clothing line features women’s T-shirts and dresses embellished with the
slogan “Sister Power”, sold primarily through small catalogs. [6]
All of Us
In 2003, Pinkett Smith and Smith helped to create the television series
All of Us , which originally aired on
UPN . The sitcom starred
Duane Martin
and
LisaRaye
and revolved around Martin’s character juggling relationships with his ex-wife (LisaRaye), his 5-year-old son ( Khamani Griffin ), and his fiancée ( Elise Neal ).
Pinkett Smith and Smith served as executive producers and guest-starred
in several episodes; they said that the show is “very, very loosely”
based on their life. [38]
Girls Hold Up This World ,
Pinkett Smith published her first children’s book,
Girls Hold Up This World , in 2004. The cover of the book features Pinkett Smith and her daughter, Willow. Pinkett Smith told
USA Today ,
“I wrote the book for Willow and for her friends and for all the little
girls in the world who need affirmation about being female in this
pretty much masculine world. I really tried to capture different sides
of femininity. I want girls in the world to feel powerful, to know they
have the power to change the world in any way they wish.” [39]
In 2005, Pinkett Smith became one of many celebrities to invest a combined total of $10 million in
Carol’s Daughter , a line of beauty products created by Lisa Price. [40]
She became a spokesperson for the beauty line, and said, “To be a part
of another African American woman’s dream was just priceless to me.” [41]
Both Pinkett Smith and Smith had been regular customers of Carol’s Daughter before an investment plan had been made. [42]
Charity work and politics
Together with Smith, Pinkett Smith has created the Will and Jada
Smith Family Foundation in Baltimore, Maryland, a charity which focuses
on youth in urban inner cities and family support. Their family helps to
run the charity; her aunt, Karen Banfield Evans, is the foundation’s
executive director. [43]
The charity was awarded the
David Angell Humanitarian Award
by
The American Screenwriters Association
(ASA) in 2006. John E. Johnson, executive director of the ASA, said,
“Will and Jada exemplify the principles of the David Angell Humanitarian
Award through their support of projects focusing on urban and inner
city youth, family wellbeing, violence prevention and education. Their
philosophy of leading a positive lifestyle and sincere interest in
helping people everywhere is inspirational.” [44]
The Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation has provided grants to
non-profit organizations
such as
YouthBuild , [45]
and Pinkett Smith has made significant personal donations to organizations such as Capital K-9s. [46]
While attending the Baltimore School for the Arts, Pinkett Smith met and became friends with classmate
Tupac Shakur .
They maintained a close friendship until his death in September 1996.
In December 2006, she donated $1 million to the Baltimore School for the
Arts in his memory. Donald Hicken, head of the school’s theater
department and Pinkett Smith’s former teacher, said, “It means a lot
when you’re a teacher and your most famous alumnus comes back to give a
donation. It really says a lot to the community that the school matters
in people’s lives.” [43]
When Pinkett Smith’s aunt, Karen Banfield Evans, was diagnosed with
lupus , [47]
the Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation, in association with the
Lupus Foundation of America
and
Maybelline , held the first annual “Butterflies Over Hollywood” event on September 29, 2007 at the
El Rey Theatre
in Los Angeles. With a list of over 300 celebrities and guests, Pinkett
Smith helped raise funds for LFA public and professional educational
programs. [48]
The Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation was presented with an award
in 2007 at the 4th Annual Lupus Foundation of America Awards. [49]
After meeting famed
Scientologist
Tom Cruise
during the filming of
Collateral
in 2004, Pinkett Smith and Smith donated $20,000 to the Hollywood Education and Literacy Program (HELP),
Scientology ‘s basis for homeschooling. [50]
The couple came under fire in 2008 when they decided to fund
New Village Leadership Academy , a private elementary school located in
Calabasas , California. The school employs teachers dedicated to the Scientology religion and features methodologies like
study technology , created by
Church of Scientology
founder
L. Ron Hubbard . The couple, who are close friends with Cruise and wife
Katie Holmes , [51]
have denied claims that they are themselves Scientologists. Jaqueline
Olivier, an administrator of New Village Leadership Academy, insists
that the school has no religious affiliation. [52] [53]
A supporter of
Barack Obama ‘s
2008 presidential campaign , Pinkett Smith said in an interview, “I love Michelle [and] would play her any day,” when she was asked if she would play
Michelle Obama
in a
biopic .
She added, “I’m voting for Michelle. I’m always telling people I’m
voting for Michelle to get into the White House and Obama is just going
to follow her lead. She is smart and committed, and I just love her.” [54]
December 11, 2009, Pinkett Smith and her husband hosted the
Nobel Peace Prize Concert
in
Oslo , Norway, when Barack Obama had won the prize. [55]

Robert Traylor, American basketball player (Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers, New Orleans Hornets), died from a suspected heart attack he was , 34.
Robert DeShaun “Tractor” Traylor
was an
American
professional
basketball
player died from a suspected heart attack he was , 34.
(February 1, 1977 – May 11, 2011)
High school and college
Traylor was a
McDonald’s All-American
the same year as
Kevin Garnett ,
Vince Carter
and
Paul Pierce . He attended the
University of Michigan . Standing 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m) and weighing in excess of 300 pounds, he joined a front court for the Wolverines that included
Maurice Taylor
and
Maceo Baston . That year he broke a backboard while dunking in a game against
Ball State . [ citation needed ]
Traylor helped lead the Wolverines to the 1997
National Invitation Tournament
title, and was named the tournament’s
most valuable player . His junior year was his best, as he averaged 16.2 points and 10 rebounds while leading his team to the inaugural
Big Ten Tournament
championship and second round of the
NCAA Tournament
as a three seed.
Traylor was one of the former Michigan players whose
ties to booster Ed Martin
roiled the program. During his freshman year, Traylor broke his arm in a car accident while out with teammates and recruiting prospect
Mateen Cleaves
(who ended up going to rival
Michigan State ). That accident triggered a six-year investigation into the Wolverine program. Martin, who died in 2003 at 69, pleaded guilty in 2002 to conspiracy to
launder money
and told federal prosecutors he took gambling money, combined it with other funds and lent $616,000 to Traylor,
Chris Webber
and two other Wolverine players dating to when they were still in high school. [1]
Traylor received three years’ probation. [2]
Due to NCAA violations connected to the case (principally the compromising of the amateur status of Traylor, Webber and Taylor), Michigan withdrew from consideration for the 2003 NCAA tournament, lost scholarships and was placed on probation. The school also vacated the records of every game in which Traylor played from its record book. Traylor also had to surrender his MVP award for the 1997 NIT, as well as his MVP award from the 1998 Big Ten tournament. [ citation needed ]
Murray-Wright High School
in Detroit, where Traylor played high school basketball, voluntarily forfeited its entire 1994–95 season (Traylor’s senior season). [ citation needed ]
NBA career
In the
1998 NBA Draft , Traylor was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks (with the 6th pick), but traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for
Pat Garrity
and
German
prospect
Dirk Nowitzki .
In the 2005 offseason, Traylor had surgery on his
aorta . [3]
He then signed on with the
New Jersey Nets
for the
2005–06 NBA season , but—due to his failing a physical examination—the deal was scrapped. [2] [4]
Traylor battled
obesity
for years.
International career
Traylor played in Turkey for
Antalya Kepez Belediyesi , in Italy with the
Lega Basket Serie A
club
NSB Napoli , [5]
in México for
Halcones UV Xalapa , and in Puerto Rico with the
Cangrejeros de Santurce
and
Bayamon Cowboys . [6]
Traylor was selected as 2010 Defensive Player of the Year of
Baloncesto Superior Nacional . [7]
Traylor’s last game was played on April 26, 2011 against San German, where he tallied five minutes of playing time with no points scored and two personal fouls.
Death
On Wednesday, May 11, 2011 Traylor was found dead at his apartment in
Isla Verde, Puerto Rico . The cause of death was apparently a
heart attack . He was allegedly talking to his wife on the phone at the time. A connection was suddenly lost, at which point his wife alerted team officials to investigate. [8]
Former coach
Paul Silas
commented about Traylor’s death, saying “It’s just a shock and hard to believe”. [9]

Norma Zimmer, American entertainer (The Lawrence Welk Show) died he was , 87
Norma Zimmer
was a vocalist, best remembered for her 22-year tenure as
Lawrence Welk ‘s “Champagne Lady” on
The Lawrence Welk Show .
(July 13, 1923 – May 10, 2011)
Biography
Born as
Norma Larsen
on a
dairy farm
in
Larson, Idaho , she grew up in
Seattle
after her father moved the family west. She was singing in a
church choir
when a guest artist suggested she travel to
Los
Angeles
and audition for a musical group. When she turned 18, she did just that. In 1944 she married Randy Zimmer.
She sang with a succession of top vocal groups — the
Norman Luboff
Choir, the
Pete King Chorale , and the
Ken Darby
Singers among them — and she appeared on most of the popular television variety shows during the 1950s. She landed a small singing part in the
Bing Crosby
movie
Mr. Music
(1950), and provided the singing voice for the White Rose in the Disney film
Alice in Wonderland
(1951). [1] [2]
She also worked as a
studio singer
and performed on Welk’s 1956 Thanksgiving album.
Zimmer sang with a quartet called The Girlfriends along with Betty Allan and others. They sang backup for
Frank Sinatra ,
Dean Martin ,
Perry Como , and others. Their group sang backup for the famous Bing Crosby version of
Irving Berlin ‘s “ White Christmas “.
In 1959, the previous Champagne Lady
Alice Lon
was fired, Welk’s reasoning being that she exposed too much knee on camera. Because of protests, Welk then tried (and failed) to get Lon back. After a year of the show’s trying out several different singers, Zimmer officially joined the
Welk
show as his Champagne Lady on New Year’s Eve, 1960. [3]
Zimmer stayed on the show and traveled with Welk and the band on personal appearances for three years.
As her two sons were growing up, she decided to give it up to raise her children. Welk told her it was all right for her to quit the road tours, but he asked her to stay on the television show until he could find another singer. Each week, a new girl came on as a possible replacement, but Welk kept asking Zimmer to come back the following week. That went on for 20 years. As the show’s Champagne Lady, Zimmer sang one solo and often a duet (usually with
Jimmy Roberts ); she frequently danced with Welk at the end of the show. [4]
She also appeared in a number of the
Billy Graham
evangelical
crusades and wrote a book about her life,
Norma
(1976), published by
Tyndale House . [5]
Last years
Zimmer stopped performing publicly since she was suffering from a
neurological disorder . She died peacefully on May 10, 2011, at her
Brea, California
home, age 87, and was survived by her two sons, Ron and Mark, as well as three grandchildren.
