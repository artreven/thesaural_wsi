Amy Acker
Amy Louise Acker
is best known for her roles on the television series Angel as Winifred Burkle and Illyria, on Alias as Kelly Peyton and on Dollhouse as Dr. Claire Saunders/Whiskey. She currently appears in the ABC series Happy Town.
In her junior year of college, Acker enjoyed a short stint of modeling work for the J. Crew clothing catalog. In 1999, she was nominated for a Leon Rabin award for "Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Lead Role" for her performance in the play Thérèse Raquin. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in the same year. She worked as a stage actress for several seasons, including a stint at American Players Theatre in Spring Green, Wisconsin.
Acker made her major television debut when she starred as Winifred "Fred" Burkle on the second through fifth seasons of Angel and also as the character of Illyria for part of the show's fifth and final season. She won the 2003 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress on Television for her portrayal.
In 2005, she joined the cast of Alias for its final season, playing the fan-favorite villainous character Kelly Peyton. Acker graduated from guest star to fully credited cast member as the show entered the final episodes in April and May 2006.
Acker guest starred on fellow Buffyverse actress Alyson Hannigan's show How I Met Your Mother, in which she was reunited with Angel co-star Alexis Denisof (Hannigan's real-life husband), who had a recurring role on the show. On the DVD commentary for the episode "Come On," Neil Patrick Harris says that he and Acker are close friends and was therefore nervous to kiss her in the episode.
She portrayed Dr. Claire Saunders/Whiskey, a recurring character on Joss Whedon's Dollhouse. Acker guest starred in ten out of the thirteen episodes of the first season, but when her commitment to the new ABC series Happy Town made her only available for three episodes of the show's second and final season Whedon commented that he wished he'd "shelled out the money to make her a series regular."
In 2010, she began to co-star as a series regular in the ABC drama Happy Town, portraying the character Rachel Conroy. She will also co-star in Whedon's upcoming comedy/horror movie The Cabin in the Woods in 2011, which will be her first appearance in a 3-D movie. Also in 2010, she starred in FOX series Human Target Season One Finale as the mysterious Katherine Walters.   (from luna_potterhead post at Live Journal)
Some mention of Amy Acker:
'Human Target' Review: Episode 1.12,
'Christopher Chance' Story:
Ghosts from the past come down on Christopher
Chance ( Mark Valley )
prompting a flood of memories to the days before he became a hero — the
days when the honorable Lavern Winston ( Chi McBride ) was
still a cop, the enigmatic Guerrero ( Jackie Earle
Haley ) was still in shape, and the beautiful Katherine Walters ( Amy Acker ) was still
alive.   qouted from Josh Wigler
post in http://splashpage.mtv.com  MTV assembles Joss Whedon's
'Avengers' using Whedon alum Amy Acker as The Wasp
If Boreanaz played Pym, it would follow
that Sarah Michelle Gellar would portray Janet Van Dyne, the
size-changing Avenger known as The Wasp — but I think the role is
actually better suited for Amy Acker based on the variety of characters
she's played under Whedon's leadership, particularly Whiskey on
"Dollhouse." Acker's character was at once a sympathetic sweetheart, a
battered victim and a thorough badass. If she can conjure up that same
combination for Wasp, she would be a perfect fit for the role.     qouted from

Natalie Portman
Natalie Portman born June 9, 1981 is an Israeli American actress. Her first role came in the 1994 independent film Léon (known in the United States as The Professional). She achieved wider fame after playing Padmé Amidala in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Portman, who has said "I'd rather be smart than a movie star," completed a bachelor's degree in psychology at Harvard College while she was working on the Star Wars
films.
In 2001, Portman opened in New York City's Public Theater production of Chekhov's The Seagull, alongside Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. In 2005, Portman received a Golden Globe Award as Best Supporting Actress in the drama Closer. In May 2008, she served as the youngest member of the 61st Annual Cannes Film Festival jury. Portman's directorial debut, Eve, opened the 65th Venice International Film Festival's shorts competition in 2008.
In 2007, Natalie Portman traveled to Rwanda with Jack Hanna, to film a documentary titled Gorillas on the Brink. Later, at a naming ceremony, Portman named a baby gorilla Gukina, which means "to play." Portman has been an advocate of environmental causes since childhood, when she joined an environmental song and dance troupe known as World Patrol Kids. She is also a member of the One Voice movement.
In 2004 and 2005, she traveled to Uganda, Guatemala, and Ecuador as the Ambassador of Hope for FINCA International, an organization that promotes micro-lending to help finance women-owned businesses in poor countries.  In the "Voices" segment of the April 29, 2007, episode of the ABC Sunday Morning Program This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Portman discussed her work with FINCA and how it can benefit women and children in Third World countries. In fall 2007, Portman visited several university campuses, including Harvard, UCLA, UC Berkeley, Stanford, Princeton, New York University, and Columbia, to inspire students with the power of microfinance and to encourage them to join the Village Banking Campaign to help families and communities lift themselves out of poverty.
Portman, who has been a vegetarian
since childhood and became a vegan in 2009 after reading Jonathan Safran Foer's Eating Animals, is an advocate for animal rights. She does not eat animal products or wear fur, feathers, or leather. "All of my shoes are from Target and Stella McCartney," she has said.
It has been reported that she will appear alongside actress Elissa Sursara in a PETA public service announcement to support the group's anti-fur campaign at some point in 2009.In 2007, she launched her own brand of vegan footwear.
