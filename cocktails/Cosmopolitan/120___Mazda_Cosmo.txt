Evolution IX
Mitsubishi introduced the Lancer Evolution IX in Japan on March 3, 2005, [12]
and exhibited the car at the
Geneva Motor Show
for the European market the same day. [13]
The North American markets saw the model exhibited at the
New York International Auto Show
the following month. [14]
The 2.0 L
4G63
engine has
MIVEC
technology ( variable valve timing ), and a revised turbocharger design boosting official power output at the crankshaft to 291 PS (214 kW; 287 hp) and torque to 392 N·m (289 lb·ft).
The USDM Lancer Evolution IX models: standard (Grand Sport Rally or "GSR" in some markets), RS (Rally Sport), SE (Special Edition) and MR (Mitsubishi Racing) varied slightly in their performance capabilities. Subtleties unique to each model accounted for variations in acceleration, handling and top speed. The RS excluded features standard on the standard, SE and MR models (stereo system, power windows and locks, rear wiper, rear wing, trunk lining and sound insulation). The result is a weight savings of over 60 lb (27 kg). The fuel capacity remains the same as the Evo VIII at 14 USgal (53 L).
Although the RS is the lightest of the group, the RS did not manage to outperform the standard IX and the MR around a road course (even if only by fractions of a second). This was purported to be due to the lack of a rear wing on the RS. In a drag race, the three models are all about even. The RS model was produced for rally and racing teams who wanted a platform to build a race car from. It is stripped of all the creature comforts, and other upgrades that drive the price up for features that the race teams would not require.
The IX MR retained the features of the Evolution VIII MR, like Bilstein shocks, a 6-speed manual transmission, a rooftop vortex generator, BBS forged wheels, HID xenon headlights, foglights, accessory gauge package, "zero lift" kit, special badging and an aluminum roof. All models continued to sport
Recaro
bucket seats,
Brembo
brakes and
Momo
steering wheels. Additional revisions from 2005 included a closer gear ratio for the 5-speed
manual transmission , new lighter Enkei wheels on non-MR models, a redesigned front end with a more efficient air dam (the most noticeable feature are the two small oval ducts to cool the intercooler pipes), and a new rear bumper with a diffuser undersurface to smooth out the airflow coming out of the car for non-US models. In an effort to reduce the price increase on the Evolution IX model, [ citation needed ]
HID headlights were no longer standard equipment on the base IX (nor were they standard on the 2005 VIII), and were available only in the SSL package (Sun, Sound, and Leather), SE (Special Edition) and MR trims.
Three trims were available for Japan, Asia and Europe. Although all models used the same 291 PS (214 kW; 287 hp) engine, the torque differed from one model to another. In Europe, however, the Evolution IX was advertised to have 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp). The GSR produced 400 N·m (295 lb·ft) of torque, while the RS and GT produced 407 N·m (300 lb·ft).
RS
- "rally sport", revised 5-speed, aluminium roof, gauge pack, minimal interior, LSD and a titanium-magnesium turbine, left-hand drive option available.
GT
- revised 5-speed, this is basically the RS mechanically, but with some of the GSR's features (mainly interior pieces).
GSR
- 6-speed,
Bilstein
monotube shocks, aluminium roof, gauge pack, SAYC (Super Active Yaw Control), and double-din radio (this is roughly equivalent to the USDM MR).
MR Ralliart Edition
- Based on Lancer Evolution VI Tommi Makinen Edition, The Japanese Lancer Evolution IX was exclusively tuned by
Mitsubishi Ralliart
features the almost same as the civilian Evo IX except for Carbon Fiber front lip Spoiler, Official Ralliart livery, Ralliart 17-inch Black forged
1-piece
wheels. (Exclusive for Japanese Market only.)
In the United Kingdom, the Evolution IX used a different model scheme based on the car's horsepower. There were initially three models available: the FQ-300, FQ-320 and FQ-340 each with around 300(296/221), 320(316/236) and 340(336/250) PS(BHP/KW) respectively. An FQ-360 model was subsequently released as a successor to the Evolution VIII FQ-400. While the new FQ-360 produced less horsepower than its predecessor, it had more torque at 363 lb·ft (492 N·m) at 3200 rpm. All four models were designed to run on super
unleaded
petrol only. The MR FQ-360 was also released in limited numbers (only 200) in the last year of production.
FQ-300, 320, 340
- 6-speed,
Bilstein
monotube shocks, AYC (Active Yaw Control), super unleaded petrol only
FQ-360
- 6-speed,
Bilstein
monotube shocks, AYC (Active Yaw Control),
Ralliart
Sports Meter Kit, carbon front splitter, Speedline alloy wheels, super unleaded petrol only
MR FQ-360
- New turbo with titanium aluminium alloy turbo fins, Speedline Turini alloy wheels, Privacy Glass, Lowered Eibach Coil springs (10mm at the front/ 5mm at the rear), IX MR interior, super unleaded petrol only
Four models were available in the US. All models used the same 286 hp (213 kW) engine.
Standard
- revised 5-speed, standard model
RS
- ralli sport, revised 5-speed, aluminum roof, gauge pack, minimal interior, also no radio
SE
- Special Edition, aluminum roof/hood, and front fenders, split seven-spoke forged aluminum BBS wheels in "diamond black" finish, HID headlights with integrated fog lights, red-stitched Recaro seats
MR
- 6-speed,
Bilstein
monotube shocks, split seven-spoke forged aluminum BBS wheels, aluminum roof, hood, and front fenders, gauge pack, HID headlights with integrated fog lights, vortex generator, front brake cooling ducts and custom MR badging.
All of the American models are the same in power, but may differ in performance. The only thing that sets them apart is the Evo RS, which is 80 lb (36 kg) lighter than the MR and SE models.
To the standard model, the Sun, Sound and Leather package added a power sunroof, HID xenon headlamps with integrated fog lights, a slightly different stereo headunit (with no integral amplifier), slightly upgraded speakers in the front doors and parcel shelf, a 4.1-channel amplifier under the driver's seat, a powered, trunk-mounted Infinity subwoofer, black leather seating surfaces, leather-trimmed door panels, slightly revised center armrests in the front and rear, and separate rear side headrests. This model deleted the GSR's headliner-mounted sunglass holder to make room for the sunroof.
The Philippines had the Evolution IX until in August 2008, which was offered in two trims, the entry-level RS offering a 5-speed manual transmission,
Brembo
17-in. ventilated discs (4-Pot),
Brembo
16-in ventilated drum-in-disc (2-Pot) and almost the same features as to that of the GSR trim in the international version. Some RS models had the SAYC option, while some did not. The MR was the top-of-the-line segment, which offers almost the same feature as to that of the MR trim in the international verision. All of them are powered by a l4 2.0
4G63
turbocharged
MIVEC
engine.
Evolution IX Wagon A 2,500-piece, limited edition Evolution IX
station wagon
was released in Japan soon after the sedan's debut. It used the back end of the Lancer Sportback wagon grafted onto the sedan. Two trim models were introduced: the
GT
with a six-speed manual transmission and the
GT-A
with a 5-speed automatic. Other than the station wagon rear end, redesigned seats and some chromed trims, the car's interior was the same as the sedan.
Evolution MIEV (2005) It is a version with an electric motor connected to each wheel, which was served as a test bed for the
Mitsubishi In-wheel Electric Vehicle (MIEV) . The in-wheel motors used a hollow doughnut construction to locate the rotor outside the
stator , unlike other electric motors where the rotor turns inside the stator. The result of this was a lighter motor which translated into lower unsprung weight than a system with the motors mounted in the wheels. Each in-wheel motor produced a power output of 68 PS (50 kW; 67 hp), thus giving a combined output of 272 PS (200 kW; 268 hp) and 517 N·m (381 lb·ft), comparable to that of regular, petrol powered Lancer Evolutions. The car competed in the Shikoku EV (Electric Vehicle) Rally 2005

Evolution VIII
The Evolution VIII was modified again in 2003, this time sporting 17" grey Enkei wheels, Brembo Brakes and Bilstein shocks to handle traction and a 5-speed manual gearbox with 280 PS (202 kW; 271 hp). Originally a one off model, sales were so successful in the U.S. that by 2005 it was available in four trims: the standard GSR model in Japan, the RS, with a steel roof, 5-speed gearbox, and standard wheels (lacking excess components, such as interior map lights, power windows/doors, and radio), the SSL (with a sunroof, trunk mounted subwoofer, and leather seats), and the MR, which came with a revised limited-slip front differential, aluminum MR shift knob, handbrake with carbon fiber handle, 17 inch BBS wheels, aluminum roof, and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The new Evolution also sported chrome housing tail lights.
The Lancer Evolution VIII MR uses slick-response Bilstein
shocks
for improved handling. The aluminium roof panel and other reductions in body weight have lowered the centre of gravity to produce more natural roll characteristics. Detail improvements have also been made to Mitsubishi’s own electronic four-wheel drive, to the ACD 5 + Super AYC 6 traction control, and to the Sports ABS systems. The Lancer Evolution VIII displayed at the 2003
Tokyo Motor Show
took the MR designation traditionally reserved for Mitsubishi Motors high-performance models (first used for the Galant GTO). Other parts on the MR include BBS alloy wheels, the aforementioned Bilstein shocks, and an aluminium roof. In the
United Kingdom , many special Evolutions were introduced, including the FQ300, FQ320, FQ340, and FQ400 variants. They came with 305, 325, 345, and 405 hp (227, 239, 254 and 298 kW), respectively. Although Mitsubishi have not confirmed the fact, it is widely rumoured that the FQ stands for "fucking quick". [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
The FQ400, sold through Ralliart UK, produces 411 PS (302 kW; 405 hp) from its 2.0 L 4G63 engine, the result of special modifications by United Kingdom
tuning
firms Rampage Tuning, Owen Developments, and Flow Race Engines. At 202.9 hp (151.3 kW) per litre, it has one of the
highest specific outputs per litre
of any roadcar engine. With a curb weight of 1,450 kg (3,197 lb), it achieves 0-60 mph in 3.5 seconds, 0-100 mph in 9.1 seconds, 1/4 mile in 12.1 seconds at 118 mph (190 km/h), and a top speed of 175 mph (282 km/h) while costing £47,000.
BBC 's
television
series
Top Gear
demonstrated that the stock FQ-400 could surprisingly keep up with a
Lamborghini Murciélago
around a test track.
The Stig
recorded a
Top Gear Power Lap Times
of 1 minute and 24.8 seconds, 1.1 seconds slower than the Murciélago's time of 1 minute 23.7 seconds. [ 9 ]
In a similar test conducted by
Evo
magazine , the Evolution was able to lap the
Bedford Autodrome
faster than an
Audi RS4
and a
Porsche 911 Carrera 4S .
The Lancer Evolution VIII was also the first Evolution to be sold in the
United States , [ 10 ]
spurred by the success of the
Subaru Impreza WRX
which had been released there just three years prior. [ 3 ]
The Evolution VIII found its true competition in the
Subaru Impreza WRX STI
model the same year as the Evolution VIII's US introduction. However, the internal components for the American versions were largely stripped-down versions of the specifications for the
Japanese
Lancer Evolution VIII. No US-spec Evolution model prior to the Evo X has
active yaw control , including the 2006 Evolution IX. The American 2003 and 2004 GSRs are without the helical limited-slip front differential and 6-speed manual transmission. The 2004 US spec RS models, however, do have a front helical limited-slip differential. All 2003, 2004 and 2005 RS and GSR models have the Japanese Evolution VII's 5-speed transmission. The MR edition was introduced to the US in 2005, with ACD and the only model with a 6-speed transmission. The 2005 US spec RS and GSR have the ACD standard, and the front helical limited-slip differential is now standard on all models. The boost, timing, and tuning are also significantly lower than its Japanese counterpart, allowing it to adhere to the strict emissions regulations of the United States. Starting in 2005, the US model Evos were also fitted with a 5000rpm limit on launching in 1st gear to protect the drivetrain.
Most Evolution VIIIs have a
carbon fiber
rear spoiler with matching body-color endplates. Furthermore, the US versions of the Lancer Evolution VIII 2003-2005 were given bulkier rear bumpers than their Japanese counterparts to accommodate US safety laws in the form of the metal rear crash bar. All Evos have lightweight aluminum front fenders and hoods. MR and RS editions have an aluminum roof. Additionally, MR Editions come equipped with a 6-speed transmission, Bilstein shocks, and factory optional BBS wheels.
The basic RS Edition does not come with power windows, locks, or mirrors, an audio system, rear wing, sound deading material, map lamps or an anti-lock braking system. All Evo VIII RS models sold in the US have an air conditioning system. Power windows, locks, and audio systems could be had in the RS model through the addition of the "Urban Jungle" comfort package.

Evolution VII
2001, Mitsubishi was forced by the
FIA
to race in the
WRC
using WRC rules for building a car instead of the Group A class rules, and thus did not need to follow homologation rules. The Evolution VII was based on the larger Lancer Cedia platform and as a result gained more weight over the Evolution VI, but Mitsubishi made up for this with multiple important chassis tweaks. The biggest change was the addition of an active center differential and a more effective limited-slip differential, while a front helical limited-slip differential was added. Torque was increased again to 385 N·m (284 lb·ft) with engine tweaks that allowed greater airflow, and horsepower officially remained at 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp).
The introduction of the Evolution VII also marked the first time an automatic drivetrain was included within the model lineup—the GT-A. Seen as the 'gentleman's express' version of the visually similar VII GSR, the GT-A model was only produced in 2002 and had the following distinguishing interior and exterior specification: GT-A-only diamond cut finish 17-inch (430 mm) alloy wheels, clear rear light lenses and all-in-one style front headlights (later used on the Evolution VIII). The GT-A had the option of either no spoiler, the short spoiler (as later used on the Evolution VIII 260) or the thunderspoiler as used on the standard Evolution VII models. The most distinguishing feature was a smooth bonnet with no air-grills on it at all. Although offering inferior cooling capabilities, the bonnet was designed to give a cleaner line through the air with less air resistance at motorway speeds.
Interior could be specified with factory options of a deluxe velour interior, full leather or the Recaro sports seats. The GT-A interior was different in that it had chromed door handles, a different instrument panel (to show the gear selection) and chrome edged bezels around the speedo and tach. The GT-A also had additional sound deadening installed from the factory and the engine manifold and downpipe had been engineered to be quieter.
The 5-speed automatic gearbox had what Mitsubishi called "fuzzy logic", which meant that the car would learn what the driver's driving characteristics were like and would adapt the gear change timings and kick down reactions accordingly. The gears could be manually selected as with most Tiptronics via steering wheel + and - buttons (a pair both sides) or via selecting the tiptronic gate with the gear lever. Power was down a little from the standard manual cars with 264 PS (194 kW; 260 hp). The GT-A gearbox did not appear again in the Evolution VIII but has been installed in the estate version of the Evolution IX Wagon. It was replaced by the
Twin Clutch SST
gearbox since the introduction of Evolution X.

Evolution VI
The Evolution VI's changes mainly focused on cooling and engine durability. It received a larger intercooler, larger oil cooler, and new pistons, along with a titanium-aluminide turbine wheel for the RS model, which was a first in a production car. also, the Evolution VI received new bodywork yet again, with the most easily spotted change in the front bumper where the huge fog lights were reduced in size and moved to the corners for better airflow. A new model was added to the GSR and RS lineup; known as the RS2, it was an RS with a few of the GSR's options. Another limited-edition RS was known as the RS Sprint, an RS tuned by
Ralliart
in the UK to be lighter and more powerful with 330 hp (246 kW).
Yet another special edition Evolution VI was also released in 1999: the Tommi Mäkinen Edition, named after Finnish rally driver
Tommi Mäkinen
that had won Mitsubishi four WRC drivers championships. It featured a different front bumper, Red/Black Recaro seats (with embossed T. Mäkinen logo), 17" Enkei white wheels, a leather
Momo
steering wheel and shift knob, a titanium turbine that spooled up quicker, front upper strut brace, lowered ride height (with tarmac stages in mind), and a quicker steering ratio. Amongst other colours, the Evo VI came in either red (Tommi Mak only), white, blue, black or silver with optional special decals, replicating Tommi Mäkinen's rally car's colour scheme. This car is also sometimes referred to as an Evolution 6½, Evolution 6.5, or TME for short.

Evolution V
In 1997, the WRC created a new " World Rally Car " class, and while these cars still had to abide by Group A standards, they did not have to meet homologation rules. Mitsubishi redesigned the Evolution IV with this in mind and introduced the Evolution V in January 1998.
Many aspects of the car were changed such as:
The interior was upgraded in the GSR version with a better class of Recaro seat.
The body kit had flared arches at the front and rear and a new aluminium rear spoiler replaced the IV FRP version and gave an adjustable angle of attack to alter rear down force.
The track was widened by 10 mm (0.4 in), the wheel offset changed from ET45 to ET38 along with the wheel diameter which rose from 16" to 17" to accommodate Brembo brakes which were added to enhance braking.
In addition the brake master cylinder bore increased by 0.3 millimetres (0.01 in).
The engine was strengthened in a few areas and the cam duration was increased. The pistons were lighter with a smaller skirt area. 510 cc injectors were replaced with 560 cc injectors for better engine reliability due to more electrical "headroom" and the ECU was changed to include a flash ROM, allowing more boost pressure to the same TD05-HR as the Mitsubishi Evolution III and IV.
Furthermore, the
turbocharger
was again improved. Torque was increased to 373 N·m (275 lb·ft) at 3000 rpm. Power officially stayed the same, at 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp), though some claim horsepower was actually somewhat higher.

Evolution IV
The Lancer platform was completely changed in 1996, and along with it the Evolution, which had become extremely popular throughout the world. The engine and transaxle was rotated 180° to better balance the weight and eliminate torque steer. There were two versions available, The RS and GSR. The RS version was produced as a competition car with a limited-slip front differential and a friction type LSD at the rear. It also came with GLX seats and a choice of either 16" or 17" OZ light weight racing wheels. The RS also had wind up windows, optional air conditioning in some models, and a few extra brace bars to strengthen the chassis, one behind the front grill and the other across the boot floor. The RS also had thinner body panels and glass. The GSR and the RS shared a new twin scroll turbocharger which helped to increase power to 350 PS (257 kW; 345 hp) at 6,500 rpm and 422 N·m (311 lb·ft) of torque at 4,000 rpm. Mitsubishi's new
Active Yaw Control
appeared as a factory option on the GSR model, which used steering, throttle input sensors and
g
sensors to computer-hydraulically control torque split individually to the rear wheels and as a result the 300 Evolution IVs produced all sold quickly. The Evolution IV can be distinguished by its two large fog lights in the front bumper (option on RS version), and the newly designed tail lights on the rear, which became a standard design to Evolution VI, which would become yet another trademark of the Evolution series. This new generation was slightly heavier than previous Evos—the GSR in particular due to the added technology systems—but to counter this the car produced even more power—the weight of the RS being 1,260 kg (2,778 lb) and the GSR being 1,345 kg (2,965 lb).

Evolution III
August 1995 saw the arrival of the Evolution 3, which had several improvements over the previous models. New, more aggressive styling and a new nose moulding improved the air supply to the radiator, intercooler and brakes. New side skirts and rear bumper moldings and a larger rear spoiler were added to reduce lift. Improved engine had higher compression ratio than before, [ 4 ]
and new turbocharger compressor (60 mm to 68 mm [ 5 ] ), which gave power output of 270 bhp (201 kW) at 6250 rpm, 309 N·m (228 lb·ft) at 3000 rpm.

Evolution II
The Evolution I was upgraded in December 1993, and was produced until 1995. It consisted mainly of handling improvements, including minor wheelbase adjustments, larger swaybars, bodywork tweaks including a larger spoiler, and tyres that were 10 mm (0.4 in) wider. This Evolution also has a 50 l (13.2 US gal; 11.0 imp gal) fuel tank. Power output was increased to 256 PS (188 kW; 252 hp) from the same engine and torque was unchanged for both GSR and RS models.

Evolution I
The original Lancer Evolution was to compete in the
World Rally Championship . It used the 2.0 L turbocharged
DOHC
engine and 4WD drivetrain from the original
Galant VR-4
in a Lancer chassis, and was sold in GSR and RS models. The latter was a stripped-down club racing version that lacked power windows and seats,
anti-lock brakes , a rear wiper, and had steel wheels to weigh approximately 70 kg (154 lb) less than the 1,238 kg (2,729 lb) GSR, while the former came with all of the conveniences of a typical street car. It came with Mitsubishi's
4G63
engine producing 247 PS (182 kW; 244 hp) at 6000 rpm and 309 N·m (228 lb·ft) at 3000 rpm. 5,000 of the first generation Evolutions were sold between 1992 and 1993. Top speed is 228 km/hour (142 mph)

Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution
Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution
The
Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution , colloquially known as the
Lancer Evo
or
Evo , [1]
is a high-performance sedan manufactured by Mitsubishi Motors. There have been ten official versions to date, and the designation of each model is most commonly a
roman numeral . All use two litre,
turbocharged
engines and
four-wheel drive
systems. [2]
The Evolution was originally intended only for
Japanese
markets, but demand on the
"grey import" market
led the Evolution series to be offered through
Ralliart
dealer
networks in the
United Kingdom
and in various European markets from around 1998. Mitsubishi decided to export the eighth generation Evolution to the
United States
in 2003 after witnessing the success
Subaru
had in that market with their
Impreza WRX , a direct competitor in other global regions. [3]
Japanese-spec cars were limited by a
gentlemen's agreement
to advertise no more than 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp), a mark already reached by Evolution IV. Therefore, each subsequent version has unofficially evolved above the advertised power figures, with the Japanese-spec Evolution IX reaching an alleged output of around 321 PS (236 kW; 317 hp). Various versions available in other markets, particularly the UK, have official power outputs up to 411 PS (302 kW; 405 hp).
The tenth generation of the Lancer Evolution was launched in Japan 2007, and overseas markets in 2008.

Mazda RX-7
Third generation (FD)
The third generation of the RX-7,
FD
(with FD3S for the JDM and JM1FD for the USA VIN), featured an updated body design. The 13B-REW was the first-ever mass-produced
sequential twin-turbocharger
system to export from Japan, boosting power to 255 PS (188 kW; 252 hp) in 1993 and finally 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp) by the time production ended in Japan in 2002.
Series 6 (1992–1995) was exported throughout the world and had the highest sales. In Japan, Mazda sold the RX-7 through its
Efini
brand as the
Efini RX-7.
Models in Japan included the Type R, the top-of-the-range Type RZ, the Type RB, the A-spec and the Touring X, which only came with a 4-speed automatic reducing power to 255 PS (188 kW; 252 hp), but the others ran on the standard 265 PS (195 kW; 261 hp) engine with a 5-speed manual gearbox. Only the 1993–1995 model years were sold in the
U.S . and
Canada . Series 6 came with 255 PS (188 kW; 252 hp) and 294 N·m (217 ft·lbf). In the UK only 124 examples of this model were sold through the official Mazda network, Only one spec. was available and this included twin oil-coolers, electric sunroof, cruise control and the rear storage bins in place of the back seats.
Series 7 (1996–1998) included minor changes to the car. Updates included a simplified vacuum routing manifold and a 16-bit ECU allowing for increased boost which netted an extra 10 PS (7 kW). In Japan, the Series 7 RX-7 was marketed under the Mazda brand name. The Series 7 was also sold in
Australia ,
New Zealand
and the
UK . Series 7 RX-7s were produced only in right-hand-drive configuration.
Series 8 (January 1999– August 2002) was the final series, and was only available in the Japanese market. More efficient turbochargers were installed, while improved intercooling and radiator cooling was made possible by a revised frontal area. The seats, steering wheel, and front and rear lights were all changed. The rear spoiler was modified and gained adjustability. The top-of-the-line " Type RS " came equipped with a Bilstein suspension and 17" wheels as standard equipment, and reduced weight to 1,280 kg (2,822 lb). Power was 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp) with 313.8 N·m (231 ft·lbf) of torque as per the maximum Japanese limit. The very limited edition
Type RZ
version included all the features of the Type RS, but at a lighter weight (at 1270 kg). It also featured custom gun-metal colored BBS wheels and a custom red racing themed interior. Further upgrades included a new 16-bit ECU and ABS system upgrades. The improved
ABS
system worked by braking differently on each wheel, allowing the car better turning during braking. The effective result made for safer driving for the average buyer. Easily the most collectible of all the RX-7s was the last 1,500 run-out specials. Dubbed the " Spirit R ", they combined all the "extra" features Mazda had used on previous limited-run specials plus new exclusive features. They still command amazing prices on the Japanese used car scene years later. Sticker prices when new were 3,998,000 yen for Type-A and B and 3,398,000 yen for Type-C. Mazda's press release said " The Type-A Spirit R model is the ultimate RX-7, boasting the most outstanding driving performance in its history. "
- There are three kinds of "Spirit R": the "Type A", "Type B", and "Type C". The "Type A" has a 5-speed manual transmission, and is said to have the best performance of the three models. The "Type B" has a 2+2 seat configuration and also sports a 5-speed manual transmission. The "Type C" is also a 2+2, but has a 4-speed automatic transmission. Clarification of the build number breakdown for each type is sought as Mazda hasn't publicly published the production figures.
There is also a "Touring Model" which includes a
sun roof , and Bose stereo system. Compared to the R1 and R2 which both don't have a
moon roof , and they have an extra front oil cooler in the front bumper, and other race modification equipment

Mazda RX-7
Second generation (FC)
The Series 4 (1986–1988) was available with a naturally aspirated, fuel-injected
13B-VDEI
producing 146 hp (108 kW). An optional
turbocharged
model, known as the Turbo II in the American market, had 182 hp / 185 ps (135 kW). The Series 5 (1989–1992) featured updated styling and better engine management, as well as lighter rotors and a higher
compression ratio , 9.7:1 for the naturally aspirated model, and 9.0:1 for the turbo model. The naturally aspirated Series 5 FC made 160  hp
(119  kW ), while the Series 5 Turbo made 200 hp / 205 ps (147 kW).
The second generation RX-7 ("FC", VIN begins JM1FC3 or JMZFC1), still known as the
Savanna RX-7
in Japan, featured a complete restyling reminiscent of the
Porsche 944
or
Porsche 924 . Mazda's stylists, led by Chief Project Engineer Akio Uchiyama, focused on the Porsche 944 for their inspiration in designing the FC because the new car was being styled primarily for the American market, where the majority of first generation RX-7's had been sold. This strategy was chosen after Uchiyama and others on the design team spent time in the United States studying owners of earlier RX-7's and other sports cars popular in the American market. The Porsche 944 was selling particularly well at the time and provided clues as to what sports-car enthusiasts might find compelling in future RX-7 styling and equipment. While the SA22/FB was a purer sports car, the FC tended toward the softer sport-tourer trends of its day. Handling was much improved, with less of the
oversteer
tendencies of the FB. The rear end design was vastly improved from the FB's live rear axle to a more modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear axle). Steering was more precise, with
rack and pinion
steering
replacing the old
recirculating ball
steering of the FB.
Disc brakes
also became standard, with some models (S4: GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. The DTSS worked by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions but induced slight toe-in under heavier cornering loads at around 0.5 G's or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation of the rear, but toe-in allowed for a more stable rear under heavier cornering. Mazda also introduced Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The system changed damping characteristics according to the road and driving conditions. The system compensated for camber changes and provided anti-dive and anti-squat effects. The Turbo 2 uses a turbo charger with a twin scroll design. Engineered to cancel the turbo lag at low engine speeds is the smaller primary chamber. At higher revolutions the secondary chamber is opened pumping out 33% more power then the naturally aspirated counterpart. The Turbo 2 also has an air to air intercooler that has its own intake on the hood.
Though about 80 lb (36 kg) heavier and more isolated than its predecessor, the FC continued to win accolades from the press. The FC RX-7 was
Motor Trend ' s
Import Car of the Year
for 1986, and the Turbo II was on
Car and Driver
magazine's Ten Best list for a second time in 1987.
In the Japanese market, only the turbo engine was available; the naturally-aspirated version was allowed only as an export. This can be attributed to insurance companies penalizing turbo cars (thus restricting potential sales). This emphasis on containing horsepower and placating insurance companies to make RX-7's more affordable seems ironic in retrospect. Shortly after the discontinuance of the second generation RX-7's in 1992, an outright horsepower "arms race" broke out between sports car manufacturers, with higher and higher levels of power required to meet buyer demands. This rising horsepower phenomena arose from the US
CAFE standards
remaining stable while engine technologies marched forward rapidly.
Mazda sold 86,000 RX-7's in the US alone in 1986, its first model year, with sales peaking in 1988.
Australian Motors Mazda released a limited run of 250 'Sports' model Series 4 RX-7's; each with no power steering, power windows or rear wiper as an attempt to reduce the weight of the car. In Japan, there was a special limited release of the FC called, Infini with only 600 made for each year. Some special noted features for all Infini series are: infinity logo on the back, upgraded suspension, upgraded ECU, higher horsepower, lightened weight, 15" BBS aluminum alloy wheels, Infini logo steering wheel, aero bumper kits, bronze colored window glass, floor bar on the passenger side, aluminum bonnet with scoop, flare and holder. The car was thought as the pinnacle of the RX-7 series (until the FD came out). The Infini IV came with other special items such as black bucket seats, 16" BBS wheels, Knee pads, and all the other items mentioned before. There are differing years for the Infini, which noted the series. Series I was introduced in 1987, Series II was introduced in 1988, Series III was introduced in 1990, and Series IV was introduced in 1991. Series I and II came in White or Black, Series III came in Forest Green only, and Series IV came in Forest Green or Noble Green. There are only minor differences between the series, the biggest change which was from the Series II being an S4 (1986-1988) and the Series III and IV being an S5 (1989-1991).
Convertible Mazda introduced a convertible version of the RX-7 in 1988 with a normally aspirated engine — introduced to the US market with ads featuring Hollywood actor
James Garner , at the time featured in many of Mazda's television advertisements.
The convertible featured a removable rigid section over the passengers and a folding textile rear section with heatable rear glass window. Power operated, lowering the top required unlatching two header catches, power lower the top halfway, exiting the car, folding down the rigid section manually, and then further power-lowering the top. Mazda introduced with the convertible the first integral windblocker, a rigid panel that folded up from behind the passenger seats to block unwanted drafts from reaching the passengers — thereby extending the driving season for the car in open mode. The convertible also featured optional headrest mounted audio speakers and a folding vinyl snap-fastened
tonneau cover . The convertible assembly was precisely engineered and manufactured, and dropped into the ready body assembly as a complete unit — a first in convertible production.
Several leading car magazines at the time also selected the convertible as one of the best rag-tops available on the market (see Automobile Magazine/January 1988, Performance Car Magazine/January 1989). Mazda exported approximately five thousand convertibles to the United States in 1988 and fewer in each of the next three model years, although it is difficult to confirm these figures, as Mazda USA did not keep RX-7 import records by model type. Production ceasing in October 1991 after Mazda marketed a limited run of 500 example for 1992 for the domestic market only. In Japan, the United Kingdom, and other regions outside the US, a turbocharged version of the convertible was available.

Mazda RX-7
First generation (SA/FB)
Series 1 (1979–1980) is commonly referred to as the "SA22C" from the first alphanumerics of the
vehicle identification number . This series of RX-7 had exposed steel bumpers and a high-mounted indentation-located license plate, called by Werner Buhrer of
Road & Track
magazine a "Baroque depression."
In 1980 Mazda released 3000 special models known as the LS (Leather Sport). This package added an LS badge, full leather upholstery, sunroof, and gold-colored alloys. This model was only available in three different colors Aura White (1250 made), Brilliant Black (1250 made) and Solar Gold (500 made).
The Series 2 (1981–1983) had integrated plastic-covered bumpers, wide black rubber body side moldings, wraparound taillights and updated engine control components. The GSL package provided optional 4-wheel disc brakes, front ventilated (Australian model) and clutch-type rear
limited slip differential
(LSD). Known as the "FB" in North America after the
US Department of Transportation
mandated 17 digit Vehicle Identification Number changeover. Elsewhere in the world, the 1981-1985 RX-7 retained the 'SA22C' VIN prefix. As a result, enthusiasts outside North America never picked up the "FB" nickname. The license-plate surround looks much like Buhrer's "Styling Impressions." [ citation needed ]
The Series 3 (1984–1985) featured an updated lower front fascia. North American models received a different instrument cluster (the NA S3 RX-7 is the only rotary-engined car to not have a centrally mounted tachometer). GSL package was continued into this series, but Mazda introduced the GSL-SE sub-model. The GSL-SE had a
fuel injected
1.3 L
13B RE-EGI
engine producing 135 hp (101 kW) and 135 lb·ft (183 N·m). GSL-SEs had much the same options as the GSL (clutch-type rear LSD and rear disc brakes), but the brake rotors were larger, allowing Mazda to use the more common lug nuts (versus bolts), and a new bolt pattern of 4x114.3 (4x4.5"). Also, they had upgraded suspension with stiffer springs and shocks. The external air-oil
oil cooler
was reintroduced, after being dropped in the 1983 model-year for the controversial "beehive" water-oil heat exchanger.
The 1984 RX-7 G has an estimated 29 highway miles per gallon (8.11 litres per 100 km) /19 estimated city miles per gallon (12.37 l/100 km). According to Mazda, its rotary engine, licensed by NSU-Wankel allowed the RX-7 G to accelerate from 0 to 50 (80 km/h) in 6.3 seconds.
Kelley Blue Book , in its January-February 1984 issue, noted that a 1981 RX-7 G retained 93.4% of its original sticker price.
The handling and
acceleration
of the car were noted to be of a high caliber for its day. This generation RX-7 had "live axle"
4-link
rear
suspension
with
Watt's linkage , a
50/50 weight ratio , and weighed under 2500
lb
(1100
kg ). It was the lightest generation of RX-7 ever produced.
12A -powered models accelerated from 0–60 mph in 9.2 s, and turned 0.779g (7.64 m/s²) laterally on a skidpad. The
12A
engine produced 100 hp (75 kW) at 6000 rpm, allowing the car to reach speeds of over 120 miles per hour (190 km/h). Because of the smoothness inherent in the
Wankel rotary engine , little vibration or harshness was experienced at high rpm, so a buzzer was fitted to the
tachometer
to warn the driver when the 7000
rpm
redline was approaching [ citation needed ] .
The 12A engine has a long thin shaped combustion chamber, having a large surface area in relation to its volume. Therefore, combustion is cool, giving few oxides of nitrogen. However, the combustion is also incomplete, so there are large amounts of partly burned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The exhaust is hot enough for combustion of these to continue into the exhaust. An engine driven pump supplies air into the exhaust to complete the burn of these chemicals. This is done in the "thermal reactor" chamber where the exhaust manifold would normally be on a conventional engine. Under certain conditions the pump injects air into the thermal reactor and at other times air is pumped through injectors into the exhaust ports. This fresh air is needed for more efficient and cleaner burning of the air/fuel mixture. [ 2 ]
Options and models varied from country to country. The gauge layout and interior styling in the Series 3 was only changed for
North American
versions. Additionally, North America was the only market to have offered the first generation RX-7 with the fuel injected
13B , model GSL-SE. A
turbocharged
(but non- intercooled )
12A
engine was available for the top-end model of Series 3 in Japan.
Sales were strong, with a total of 474,565 first generation cars produced; 377,878 were sold in the United States alone. In 2004,
Sports Car International
named this car #7 on its list of
Top Sports Cars of the 1970s . In 1983, the RX-7 would appear on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for the first time in 20 years From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Mazda RX-7
Mazda RX-7
The
Mazda RX-7
is a
sports car
by the Japanese automaker
Mazda . It was produced from 1978 to 2002. The original RX-7 featured a 1146 cc twin-rotor
Wankel rotary engine
and a sporty
front-midship ,
rear-wheel drive
layout. The RX-7 was a direct replacement for the
RX-3
(both were sold in Japan as the Savanna) and subsequently replaced all other Mazda rotary cars with the exception of the
Cosmo .
The original RX-7 was a
sports coupé . The compact and lightweight
Wankel engine
( rotary engine ) is situated slightly behind the front
axle , a configuration marketed by Mazda as "front mid-engine". It was offered as a two-seat coupé, with optional "occasional" rear seats in
Japan ,
Australia , the
United States , and other parts of the world. These rear seats were initially marketed as a dealer-installed option for the North American markets.

Z350
Background
After the
Nissan 300ZX
was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1996, Nissan initially tried to keep the Z name alive by re-creating the
240Z
the following year. The car was conceived by Nissan's North American design team in their free time, and the concept was introduced in a four state Road Show in July 1998 to various car media, dealers and employees.
Yutaka Katayama , regarded as the "Father of the Z" unveiled the Z concept sketch to the public when he received a motor industry award. The design, representing a modern vision of the 240Z, did not please the original 240Z designer
Yoshihiko Matsuo , who compared it to the
Bluebird
and
Leopard . [1] [2]
The 240Z concept was produced for the
Detroit Motor Show
for the following August and September. Nissan was unhappy with the first design as they felt the original 200 bhp (149 kW; 203 PS) 2.4 L engine known as the
KA24DE
that was going to be assigned made the car feel underpowered, they also felt the car was considered too "retro" or too "backward" resembling a futuristic 240Z; thus, a redesign was commissioned. During a press conference in February 2000, president
Carlos Ghosn
announced plans to produce the car as he felt the new model would help to assist the company's recovery. [1]
Z Concept was unveiled in Detroit Motor Show two years later, which was similar in body shape but with a new front end. The car then underwent a minor redesign and was eventually assigned the
VQ35DE
engine , hence becoming known as the
350Z . [1]

The AE86 in motorsports
During its production life, the AE86 was a popular choice for showroom stock,
Group A , and
Group N
racing, especially in
rallying
and circuit races. Even after production of the car was discontinued, many privateer teams still raced the AE86, and it is still a popular choice for rallying and club races today. Part of the continued appeal of the AE86 for motorsports is its rear-drive configuration, a feature not available in most newer lightweight coupes. In Group A world rally cars (1600 cc class) the
4A-GZE
engine was popular. In Group A
touring car races , the car either dominated the lower category where eligible or fought it out with
Honda Civics
or the later
AE92s
and
AE101s
whilst maintaining its competitiveness. In
Ireland , where rallying is considered one of the most popular forms of motorsport, as organizing regulations are more relaxed compared to that of other countries, the AE86 was popular when new, and is still so popular that teams will purchase cars from the UK due to local shortages. The AE86 is also popular for rally use in Finland, where the cars can be competitive in the F-Cup competition for naturally aspirated 2WD cars.
The semi-factory supported
Kraft
team entered a spaceframe Trueno at the
JGTC
with a
3S-GTE
engine that came from a
SW20 MR-2 Turbo
producing about 300 hp (224 kW) for the
JGTC GT300
regulations in 1998. Despite being popular with the racefans, the car had minor success and was abandoned from use halfway through the 2001 season in favor of a newly delivered
MR-S .
The rear wheel drive configuration, combined with the AE86's light weight (approximately 2300 lb (950–970 kg) curb weight), balance and relatively powerful (and easy to tune)
4A-GEU
engine made it popular among the Japanese
hashiriya
(street racers in Japanese), many of whom raced in
mountain passes
( touge
in Japanese) where the corners suited the AE86 best, especially on the downhill. [ 1 ]
Among those who utilized this car was Japanese racing legend
Keiichi Tsuchiya , also known as the
Dori-Kin
("Drift King" in Japanese). Tsuchiya helped popularize the sport of
drifting , which involves taking a car on a set of controlled slides through corners. [ 1 ]
The AE86's FR configuration made it well suited to this kind of cornering, and currently the car is a mainstay of drift shows and competitions. The main character of the anime and manga
Initial D , Takumi Fujiwara, uses his father's AE86 for racing and making his tofu deliveries.

Models/specifications
In Japan, the DOHC 4A-GEU AE86 was offered in GT, GT-APEX and GTV
trims
as the Corolla Levin or Sprinter Trueno, with the SOHC 3A-U AE85 version sold in a variety of trims including SR, GT, et cetera. In North America, the top-spec DOHC 4A-GEC was sold as the Corolla GT-S AE88, with the SOHC 4A-C AE86 bearing the Corolla SR5 tag. Both versions sold with pop-up headlights only. Euro spec models were sold as the Corolla GT with DOHC engines and fixed Levin-style headlights. The
Middle East
received the same basic model as the North American market, with pop-up headlights and the regulated 5 mph (8 km/h)
bumpers .The lightest AE86 is the Japanese 2 door GT model which weighs 910 kg (2,006 lb). It has the same exterior as the GTV trim, but with the interior of the AE85 with the exception of the gauges, and is equipped with rear drum brakes.

Body styles
Both the Levin and Trueno variants were offered with either a 2-door coupe or 3-door
liftback
(sometimes called hatchback)
body style . The Levin and Trueno were generally identical, apart from fixed, rectangular headlights on the Levin and pop-up headlights on the Trueno. Minor bodywork changes were made in 1986 which resulted in different tail lights for both Levin and Trueno models, along with the coupe and hatchback styles. The models sold between 1983–1985 are sometimes referred to as " zenki " (前期, lit.
early period ), and the models sold from 1986–1987 are referred to as " kouki " (後期, lit.
latter period ). [ 3 ]
The coupe version is considered to be the more rigid and lighter version of the two. [ 1 ]
