Larry Siegfried, American basketball player (Boston Celtics), died from a heart attack. he was , 71
Larry E. Siegfried   was an
American
National Basketball Association
player died from a heart attack. he was , 71.
(May 22, 1939 – October 14, 2010)
Early years
Siegfried led Ohio in scoring as a senior at
Shelby High School . [1]
Siegfried played
college basketball
for
Ohio State University , and his tenure there overlapped with future
Hall-of-Famers
Jerry Lucas
and
John Havlicek . Siegfried, a junior high scoring guard, and
Joe Roberts , a senior forward, were the two holdover starters when three outstanding sophomores, Lucas, Havlicek and guard
Mel Nowell
arrived for the
1959-60 season .
Siegfried adjusted his scoring to allow for Lucas and Nowell while
joining Roberts and Havlicek as a key defender. Siegfried was also an
excellent free throw shooter few risked fouling. The Ohio State
Co-Captain of the 1960 team, Siegfried played a key role in the Buckeyes
run to the
1960 NCAA title .
All five starters from that team later played in the NBA, which then
had just nine teams and eleven players per team. Future coach
Bobby Knight
was a reserve on that team as well.
For the 1960-61 season, Siegfried was team captain outright. The team
went undefeated until the NCAA Final, when they were upset by
Cincinnati. Siegfried was named to the NCAA Final Four All-Tournament
Team. Also named All-Big Ten, Siegfried did not get the All-American
consideration he may have been due because of the star presence of
Lucas. Siegfried did play in the 1960 US Olympic Trials for the Rome
Games. While he outperformed nearly every guard there, politics demanded
several AAU selections that left him off that squad.
Professional playing career
American Basketball League (1961-62)
Cleveland Pipers ABL Champs (1961-62)
At 6’3″ and 190 pounds, Siegfried was considered a prototype guard for the NBA at that time. The
Cincinnati Royals
drafted him with their first pick in 1961 to pair with
Oscar Robertson
in their backcourt. Siegfried would not play in Cincinnati because of
Ohio State’s loss to Cincinnati’s Bearcats that year. Instead, he joined
the Cleveland Pipers of the American Basketball League. The team, owned
by future Yankee boss
George Steinbrenner , and coached by John McLendon and
Bill Sharman , won that pro league’s 1961-62 title.
Dick Barnett
and
Connie Dierking
were among that team’s stars. The highly-drafted Siegfried was just a reserve.
NBA Career
With perennial champion Boston Celtics (1963-70)
When the ABL folded the next year, the
St. Louis Hawks
acquired his rights but then surprisingly cut him. Siegfried considered
retirement, becoming a high school coach and teacher before former
college teammate Havlicek convinced coach
Red Auerbach
to try him out for the
Boston Celtics . Slowly regaining his confidence, Siegfried proved to be a key pickup. He eventually became a starter next to Havlicek or
Sam Jones
in the backcourt. His defense and free throw shooting were key to NBA title wins for Boston in 1968 and 1969. Boston announcer
Johnny Most
often noted his tenacious defense, calling ‘Ziggy’s in his shirt tonight’ to describe Siegfried on many nights.
Siegfried played his first seven professional seasons with the Boston
Celtics, earning five championship rings during that time. He led the
NBA in free throw percentage in both the
1965-66
and
1968-69
seasons. [2]
Later NBA career (1970-72)
Siegfried spent the last season of his career with the
Rockets
and
Hawks
organizations. [2]
Post-NBA life
Following his NBA career, Siegfried counseled prisoners at the
Mansfield Correctional Institution in Ohio and did motivational
speaking. [3]

Belva Plain, American novelist (Evergreen) died she was , 95
Belva Plain ,
née Offenberg [1] , was a
best-selling
American
author
of mainstream women’s fiction died she was , 95. She was born in
New York City . [2]
(October 9, 1915 – October 12, 2010)
Biography
Belva Offenberg was a third-generation Jewish American who was raised in
New York City . [3]
She graduated from
Barnard College
in 1939 with a degree in
history . [3]
Plain lived in the
Short Hills
section of
Millburn, New Jersey . [4]
Before breaking into publishing, Belva Plain wrote short stories for
magazines while raising her three children. She sold her first story to
Cosmopolitan
at age 25 and “contributed several dozen to various women’s magazines until she had three children in rapid succession.” [1]
Her first novel,
Evergreen , was published in
1978 . It topped the
New York Times
bestseller list for 41 weeks and was made into a TV miniseries. [5]
Evergreen
followed the character Anna, “a feisty, redheaded Jewish immigrant girl
from Poland in turn-of-the-century New York, whose family story
continues through several decades and three more books.”. [1]
The
New York Times
summed up her career
Strong-willed women, many of them Jewish and red-haired as well,
appear again and again in Ms. Plain’s fiction. Some of her novels use
historical settings — “Crescent City,” published in 1984, was set in the
Jewish community of Civil War-era New Orleans. Other books tell stories
about contemporary issues, sometimes inspired by the headlines —
divorce (“Promises”), adoption (“Blessings”), child sexual abuse (“The
Carousel”) or babies accidentally switched at birth (“Daybreak”). All of
them are full of passion, but there is very little explicit sex. [1]
At her death, there were over 30 million copies of her twenty-plus novels in print in 22 languages. [1]
Twenty of her novels appeared on the
New York Times
bestseller list. [1]
Plain did not own a computer, and wrote all of her novels long-hand on a yellow pad. [3]
“A disciplined worker, she wrote for several hours in the morning five
days a week. She produced a 500- or 600-page novel every year or so.”
[1]
Personal life
Plain was married to her husband, Irving Plain, for more than forty years. He died in 1982.

Mary Malcolm British BBC announcer and television personality died she was, 92,
Helen Mary Malcolm
, usually known by her middle name, [1]
was one of the first two female announcers on
BBC
Television died she was, 92,.. She became a household name in the UK during the 1950s. [2]
(15 March 1918 – 13 October 2010)
Biographical sketch
http://www.youtube.com/v/lDqXTvZzZiI?fs=1&hl=en_US The granddaughter of
Victorian
actress
Lily Langtry , who was the mistress of
King Edward VII of England , [3]
Mary was brought up in Poltalloch,
Argyll , Scotland. Until the age of 16, she attended the
Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle
in South Kensington, London. She began her television career in 1948, having gained broadcasting experience on the
radio
during the Second World War. As more and more men were called up to
fight, women became increasingly in demand to fill posts at the BBC.
Mary Malcolm was taken on and worked for the
Home Service
as a continuity announcer from March 1942. With the relaunch of the
BBC’s television service after the war she worked alongside
Sylvia Peters
and
McDonald Hobley
with the trio averaging ten days work a month each. [4]
At this time, all television programs were introduced by an in vision
host or hostess and broadcasts were normally live. Malcolm received no
training and became known for her
spoonerisms :
“By the end of the day I was tired, and when I came to the weather
forecast I just read it out without really trying. My biggest fear was
‘drain and rizzle’, which I said more than once.” [2]
With the advent of commercial rival
ITV
in 1955, the BBC’s reliance on announcers diminished. Commercial breaks
quickly became popular such that the BBC decided audiences no longer
needed a hostess to soothe them. [5]
Malcolm left the BBC in 1956 although she continued to appear as a
guest on various programs including an episode of the comedy series
The Goodies . [6]
Her autobiography,
Me , was published in 1956.

Marzieh, Iranian singer, died from cancer she was , 86.
Ashraf o-Sadat Mortezaie , known professionally as
Marzieh   was a
Tehran -born singer of Persian traditional music died from cancer she was , 86.. [1]
(1924 – 13 October 2010)
Marzieh started her career in the 1940s at Radio Tehran and
cooperated with some of the greatest 20th century Persian songwriters
and lyricists like
Ali Tajvidi ,
Parviz Yahaghi ,
Homayoun Khorram ,
Moeini Kermanshahi
and
Bijan Taraghi .
Marzieh also sang with the Farabi Orchestre, conducted by Morteza
Hannaneh, a pioneer of Persian polyphonic music, during the 1960s and
1970s. Her first major public performance was in 1942, when, though
still a teenager, she played the principal role of
Shirin
at the Jame Barbud opera house in the Persian operetta
Shirin and Farhad . [2]
http://www.youtube.com/v/DFcQgBZmDg4?fs=1&hl=en_US
Following the
Islamic Revolution
of 1979 public performances and broadcasts of record albums by solo female singers were banned outright for ten years.
Ayatollah Khomeini
had decreed: “Women’s voices should not be heard by men other than members of their own families.” [2]
http://www.youtube.com/v/6RO2xJ9H2VA?fs=1&hl=en_US
She told the
Daily Telegraph
that in order to continue her vocal practice she used to walk by night from her home in the historic north-Tehran
Niavaran
foothills to her cabin in the mountains, where she would sing next to a
roaring waterfall: “Nobody could hear me. I sang to the stars and the
rocks.” [3]
Upon the death of
Khomeini
the successor mullahs suggested that she could resume singing, provided
that she undertook never to sing for men. She refused, declaring, “I
have always sung only for all Iranians,” and in 1994 she left Iran
forever due to the political repression, making her new home in Paris. [3]
She performed several concerts in
Los Angeles, California
and
Royal Albert Hall
(London) in 1993, 1994 and 1995. The Paris-based composer
Mohammad Shams
and the
Persian tar
soloist
Hamid Reza Taherzadeh
were the main musicians who worked with Marzieh in exile.
France 3 , a regional TV news and entertainment channel, has compared Marzieh’s singing voice to those of legendary songstresses
Édith Piaf
and
Maria Callas . [4]
On the other hand, the European press have also compared her to
Vanessa Redgrave
and
Melina Mercouri
for her willingness to put political and human-rights beliefs ahead of her career, even her own safety. [2]
Death
Marzieh died of
cancer
in
Paris
on 13 October 2010, aged 86. [1] [5]
Maryam Rajavi ,
one of the leaders of an Iranian opposition group, delivered her
eulogy: “Marzieh was the symbol of protest and revolt in Iranian art
against the fascism of
velayat-e faqih
(absolute clerical rule)…. Hail to Marzieh; the great, brave and
pious woman who 16 years ago joined the Iranian Resistance and offered
her complete support and compassion, and, in so doing, blended art with
the love for freedom and the magnum opus of human qualities.” [6]

Every women are not the marrying type
Every women is not the marrying type. I assume that it is quite a surprise to most men that every women does not want to be married. Men are under the notion that women just need to be married. Because of this notion men fear the emotional attachment to women. Therefore as the relationship progress men tend to lie, cheat, break it off and run! Fear of commitment can sometime overshadow the real meaning of love.
Women have come to the point where they have harden their heart towards men, after being hurt time and time again The generation of pain created by men through out their life has enhanced their rational of saying “I don’t want a man, nor do I need one”! “I am content to be alone.”
The independent woman being forced to be both male and female of the family has become an intimidating factor to most men. Unfortunately the truth is what it is, we tend to overlook that men to, have been raised by a women therefore the negative connotation has been passed down from generation to generation. We need to overcome the negativity that we created. When you learn how to love you, then you can learn  out how to love some one else With these  value tools in your belt it helps you to create a road map for the foundation for a successful relationship.
Of course this is not going to make every woman the marrying type, but it is a start to break the cycle.
