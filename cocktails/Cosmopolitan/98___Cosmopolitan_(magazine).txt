Adriana
Lima Wiki
Adriana Francesca Lima
(born June 12, 1981 [ 3 ] )
is a
Brazilian
model , best known as a
Victoria's Secret Angel
since 2000, and
as a spokesmodel for
Maybelline
cosmetics from 2003 to 2009. At age
15, Lima finished first in
Ford's
"Supermodel of Brazil" competition, and took second place the following
year in the Ford " Supermodel
of the World " competition before signing with
Elite Model Management
in
New
York City . Modeling
Lima never thought about being a model, although she had won many
beauty pageants in elementary school. [ 4 ]
However, she had a friend at school who wanted to enter a modeling
contest and didn't want to enter alone, so Lima entered with her. Both
sent in pictures, and the contest sponsor soon asked Lima to come out
for the competition. Soon after, at the age of 15, she entered and
finished in first place in Ford's "Supermodel of Brazil" model search.
She subsequently entered the 1996 Ford "Supermodel of the World" contest
and finished in second place. [ 5 ]
Three years later, Lima moved to
