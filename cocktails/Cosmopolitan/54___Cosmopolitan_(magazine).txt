زندگینامه [ ویرایش ]
ویتنی هیوستن در
نیوآرک ،
نیوجرسی
متولد شد و سالهای اولیه زندگی را در نیوجرسی گذراند نخستین فعالیت‌هایش در عرصه موسیقی را در کودکی و با همکاری با گروه کر کلیسا آغاز کرد و همانجا خوانندگی را فراگرفت.
سپس فعالیت هنری خود را با خوانندگی در کلوپ‌های شبانه نیویورک ادامه داد و قبل از امضای نخستین قرارداد موسیقی‌اش با شرکت آریستا، مدتی نیز به عنوان مدل کار کرد.
هیوستون فعالیت هنری خود را از خوانندگی در سبک‌های کلیسایی و سول آغاز کرد. مادر او،
سیسی هوستون ، خواننده موسیقی کلیسایی بود و
دی دی وارویک
و
دیان وارویک ، خواننده، هنرپیشه و مجری مشهور تلویزیون آمریکا، دختر عمه او بود. خود ویتنی نیز دخترخوانده
آرتا فرانکلین ، از مشاهیر بزرگ آواز و موسیقی معاصر آمریکا بود.
وی پس از آن مدتی به عنوان مدل در عرصه مد فعال بود و برای مدتی نیز به عنوان هم‌خوان به همراه ستارگان موسیقی به روی صحنه رفت.
۳۱ مارس ۱۹۹۱

اما در نهایت صدای قوی و انعطاف‌پذیر او و قابلیت حیرت‌انگیزش در خواندن نت‌های بالای موسیقی او را به خواننده‌ای منحصربه‌فرد و سرشناس تبدیل کرد.
اوج موفقیت هنری ویتنی هیوستون مصادف بود با دهه‌های ۱۹۸۰ و ۱۹۹۰ میلادی. در آن سال‌ها، ترانه‌های او بارها رتبه اول پرفروش‌ترین ترانه‌های بازار را کسب کردند و جوایز زیادی به هیوستون تعلق گرفت. وی در این مدت در سه فیلم
محافظ شخصی ، «در انتظار بازدم» و «همسر کشیش» حضور یافت.
هیوستون با ترانه‌های پرفروشی مانند I Will Always Love You و Saving All My Love For You، از درخشان‌ترین خوانندگان زن جهان به شمار می‌رفت.
اما در سال‌های بعدی، کارنامه هنری‌اش بواسطه اعتیاد به مواد مخدر و زندگی زناشویی پرتنش با خواننده‌ای به نام
بابی براون ، تحت‌الشعاع قرار گرفت.
کلایو دیویس، از مدیران مطرح در صنعت موسیقی آمریکا، بیش از بیست سال پیش، استعداد درخشان ویتنی هیوستن در خوانندگی و قدرت صدای منحصربه‌فرد وی را برای اولین بار در سطح جهانی مطرح کرد.
در این میان ترانه‌های فیلم «بادی گارد» با صدای خانم هیوستن با استقبال جهانی روبرو شد. تا کنون ۴۴ میلیون نسخه از آلبوم ترانه‌های این فیلم و بیش از ۱۷۰ میلیون نسخه از آلبوم‌های وی در سراسر جهان فروش رفته‌است.
هیوستن در دو دهه شهرت و نام‌آوری اش صدها جایزه موسیقی از جمله دو جایزه امی و شش گرمی را از آن خود کرد. [۲] [۳]
اعتیاد به مواد مخدر [ ویرایش ]
در سالهای پایانی عمرش، مصرف مواد مخدر به صدای او که روزی در زمره بهترین‌های موسیقی پاپ به شمار می‌رفت، صدمه جدی زد.
در سال ۲۰۰۲، ویتنی هیوستون در مصاحبه‌ای با داین سویر گفت:
"بزرگترین اهریمن خود منم. من یا بهترین دوست خودم هستم، یا بدترین دشمن خودم."
اعتیاد او به مواد مخدر که روی صدا و قدرت اجرای وی نیز تأثیر منفی گذاشت، موجب رکود هنری او شد. هیوستن که خود به اعتیاد به کوکایین، ماری جوانا و قرص اعتراف کرده بود، دو بار برای ترک اعتیاد به مرکز توانبخشی رفت و سال ۲۰۰۹ اعلام کرد که از هر گونه اعتیادی پاک شده است. [۴] [۵]
زندگی شخصی [ ویرایش ]
ازدواج وی در سال ۱۹۹۲ با بابی براون، خواننده آمریکایی، نیز با اختلاف‌های بسیاری همراه بود. بابی براون در سال‌های زندگی مشترک اش باهیوستن بارها به دلیل خشونت خانگی، تخلفات رانندگی و مسائل دیگر بازداشت شد.

در سپتامبر ۲۰۰۹
ویتنی هیوستن در نهایت در سال ۲۰۰۷ به زندگی مشترک خود با بابی براون خاتمه داد؛ ازدواجی که ثمره آن یک دختر به نام
بابی کریستینا
بود که در ۴ مارس ۱۹۹۳ به دنیا آمد و در ۲۶ ژوئن ۲۰۱۵ در سن ۲۲ سالگی درگذشت.
[۶]
مرگ [ ویرایش ]
به گفته پلیس آمریکا، ساعت ۱۵:۴۳ دقیقه روز شنبه مسئولان هتل هیلتون بورلی هیلز تماسی اضطراری گرفته و نسبت به وضعیت سلامتی ویتنی هیوستن ابراز نگرانی کردند و تا رسیدن پلیس نیز پزشکان حاضر در هتل در تلاش بودند تا وی را نجات دهند، اما در نهایت هیوستن روز شنبه ۱۱ فوریهٔ ۲۰۱۲ و در ساعت ۳:۵۵ بعدازظهر به وقت محلی در اتاق خود در طبقهٔ چهارم هتل هیلتون
بورلی هیلز
در
کالیفرنیا
در سن ۴۸ سالگی درگذشت. [۷] [۸] [۹] [۱۰]
علت مرگ هیوستون هنوز مشخص نیست، اما بنا به گفتهٔ ستوان مارک روزن از پلیس بورلی هیلز، در تحقیقات اولیه نشانی از جنایت پیدا نشد. تحقیقات در این زمینه هنوز ادامه دارد. [۷]
آرتا فرانکلین ، خواننده معروف
سول
و
آراندبی
و مادرخوانده ویتنی هیوستن پس از شنیدن خبر مرگ وی در بیانیه‌ای گفت: «اکنون نمی‌توانم در این مورد صحبت کنم. بسیار تکان دهنده و باورنکردنی است. نمی‌توانم آن‌چه را روی صفحه تلویزیون می‌بینم باور کنم.» [۱۱]

Whitney Elizabeth Houston
(August 9, 1963 – February 11, 2012) was an American
singer ,
actress , producer, and
model . In 2009,
Guinness World Records
cited her as the most awarded female act of all time. [ 1 ]
Houston is one of pop music's
best-selling music artists of all-time , with an estimated 170–200 million records sold worldwide. [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
She released six studio albums, one holiday album and three movie soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, multi-platinum, platinum or gold certification. Houston's crossover appeal on the popular music charts, as well as her prominence on
MTV , starting with her video for " How Will I Know ", [ 4 ]
influenced several
African American
women artists who follow in her footsteps. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
Houston is the only artist to chart seven consecutive No. 1
Billboard
Hot 100
hits. She is the second artist behind
Elton John
and the only woman to have two number-one
Billboard
200
Album awards (formerly "Top Pop Albums") on the
Billboard
magazine year-end
charts. [ 7 ]
Houston's 1985 debut album
Whitney Houston
became the best-selling debut album by a woman in history. [ 8 ]
Rolling Stone
named it the best album of 1986, and ranked it at number 254 on the magazine's list of the
500 Greatest Albums of All Time . [ 8 ]
Her second studio album
Whitney
(1987) became the first album by a woman to debut at number one on the
Billboard
200 albums chart. [ 8 ]
Houston's first acting role was as the star of the feature film
The Bodyguard
(1992). The film's
original soundtrack
won the 1994
Grammy Award for Album of the Year . Its lead single, " I Will Always Love You ", became the
best-selling single
by a woman in music history. With the album, Houston became the first act (solo or group, male or female) to sell more than a million copies of an album within a single week period under
Nielsen SoundScan
system. [ 8 ]
The album makes her the top female act in the top 10
list of the best-selling albums of all time , at number four. Houston continued to star in movies and contribute to their soundtracks, including the films
Waiting to Exhale
(1995) and
The Preacher's Wife
(1996).
The Preacher's Wife
soundtrack
became the best-selling gospel album in history. [ 9 ]
On February 11, 2012, Houston was found dead in her guest room at
the Beverly Hilton , in
Beverly Hills, California . The official coroner's report showed that she had accidentally drowned in the bathtub, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. [ 10 ]

Life and career
1963–84: Early life and career beginnings
New Hope Baptist Church
Whitney Houston was born on August 9, 1963 in what was then a middle-income neighborhood in
Newark, New Jersey . [ 12 ]
She was the daughter of Army serviceman and entertainment executive John Russell Houston, Jr. (September 13, 1920 – February 2, 2003), and gospel singer
Emily "Cissy" (Drinkard) Houston . [ 13 ]
Her elder brother Michael is a singer, and her elder half-brother is former basketball player
Gary Garland . [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
Her parents were both
African American , and she was also said to have
Native American
and
Dutch
ancestry. [ 16 ]
Through her mother, Houston was a first cousin of singers
Dionne Warwick
and
Dee Dee Warwick . Her godmother was
Darlene Love [ 17 ]
and her honorary aunt was
Aretha Franklin , [ 18 ] [ 19 ]
whom she met at age 8 or 9 when her mother took her to a recording studio. [ 20 ]
Houston was raised a
Baptist , but was also exposed to the
Pentecostal
church. After the
1967 Newark riots , the family moved to a middle-class area in
East Orange , New Jersey, when she was four. [ 21 ]
At the age of 11, Houston started performing as a soloist in the junior gospel choir at the
New Hope Baptist Church in Newark , where she also learned to play the piano. [ 22 ]
Her first solo performance in the church was " Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah ". [ 23 ]
When Houston was a teenager, she attended
Mount Saint Dominic Academy , a Catholic girls' high school in
Caldwell , New Jersey, where she met her best friend Robyn Crawford, whom she described as the "sister she never had". [ 24 ]
While Houston was still in school, her mother continued to teach her how to sing. [ 5 ]
Houston was also exposed to the music of
Chaka Khan ,
Gladys Knight , and
Roberta Flack , most of whom would have an influence on her as a singer and performer. [ 25 ]
Houston spent some of her teenage years touring nightclubs where her mother Cissy was performing, and she would occasionally get on stage and perform with her. In 1977, at age 14, she became a backup singer on the
Michael Zager Band 's single "Life's a Party". [ 26 ]
In 1978, at age 15, Houston sang background vocals on
Chaka Khan 's hit single " I'm Every Woman ", a song she would later turn into a larger hit for herself on her monster-selling
The Bodyguard
soundtrack album. [ 27 ] [ 28 ]
She also sang back-up on albums by
Lou Rawls
and
Jermaine Jackson . [ 27 ]
In the early 1980s, Houston started working as a fashion model after a photographer saw her at
Carnegie Hall
singing with her mother. She appeared in
Seventeen [ 29 ]
and became one of the first women of color to grace the cover of the magazine. [ 30 ]
She was also featured in layouts in the pages of
Glamour ,
Cosmopolitan ,
Young Miss , and appeared in a
Canada Dry
soft drink TV commercial. [ 27 ]
Her looks and girl-next-door charm made her one of the most sought after teen models of that time. [ 27 ]
While modeling, she continued her burgeoning recording career by working with producers Michael Beinhorn,
Bill Laswell
and
Martin Bisi
on an album they were spearheading called
One Down , which was credited to the group
Material . For that project, Houston contributed the ballad " Memories ", a cover of a song by
Hugh Hopper
of
Soft Machine . Robert Christgau of
The Village Voice
called her contribution "one of the most gorgeous ballads you've ever heard". [ 31 ]
She also appeared as a lead vocalist on one track on a
Paul Jabara
album, entitled
Paul Jabara and Friends , released by
Columbia Records
in 1983. [ 32 ]
Houston had previously been offered several recording agencies (Michael Zager in 1980, and
Elektra Records
in 1981), but her mother declined the offers stating her daughter must first complete high school. [ 26 ] [ 33 ]
In 1983, Gerry Griffith, an A&R representative from
Arista Records , saw her performing with her mother in a New York City nightclub and was impressed. He convinced Arista's head
Clive Davis
to make time to see Houston perform. Davis too was impressed and offered a worldwide recording contract which Houston signed. Later that year, she made her national televised debut alongside Davis on
The Merv Griffin Show . [ 34 ]
Houston signed with Arista in 1983, but did not begin work on her album immediately. [ 1 ]
The label wanted to make sure no other label signed the singer away. Davis wanted to ensure he had the right material and producers for Houston's debut album. Some producers had to pass on the project because of prior commitments. [ 35 ]
Houston first recorded a duet with
Teddy Pendergrass
entitled " Hold Me " which appeared on his album,
Love Language . [ 36 ]
The single was released in 1984 and gave Houston her first taste of success, becoming a Top 5 R&B hit. [ 37 ]
It would also appear on her debut album in 1985.
1985–86: Rise to international prominence
With production from
Michael Masser ,
Kashif ,
Jermaine Jackson , and
Narada Michael Walden , Houston's debut album
Whitney Houston
was released in February 1985.
Rolling Stone
magazine praised Houston, calling her "one of the most exciting new voices in years" while
The New York Times
called the album "an impressive, musically conservative showcase for an exceptional vocal talent". [ 38 ] [ 39 ]
Arista Records promoted Houston's album with three different singles from the album in the US, UK and other European countries. In the UK, the dance-funk "Someone for Me", which failed to chart in the country, was the first single while " All at Once " was in such European countries as the
Netherlands
and
Belgium , where the song reached the top 5 on the singles charts, respectively. [ 40 ]
In the US, the soulful ballad " You Give Good Love " was chosen as the
lead single
from Houston's debut to establish her in the black marketplace first. [ 41 ]
Outside the US, the song failed to get enough attention to become a hit, but in the US, it gave the album its first major hit as it peaked at No. 3 on the US
Billboard
Hot 100
chart, and No. 1 on the
Hot R&B
chart. [ 35 ]
As a result, the album began to sell strongly, and Houston continued promotion by touring nightclubs in the US. She also began performing on late-night television talk shows, which were not usually accessible to unestablished black acts. The jazzy ballad " Saving All My Love for You " was released next and it would become Houston's first No. 1 single in both the US and the UK. She was then an opening act for singer
Jeffrey Osborne
on his nationwide tour. " Thinking About You " was released as the promo single only to R&B-oriented radio stations, which peaked at number ten on the US R&B Chart. At the time, MTV had received harsh criticism for not playing enough videos by black, Latino, and other racial minorities while favoring white acts. [ 42 ]
The third US single, " How Will I Know ", peaked at No. 1 and introduced Houston to the MTV audience thanks to its video. Houston's subsequent singles from this, and future albums, would make her the first African-American woman to receive consistent heavy rotation on MTV. [ 30 ]
By 1986, a year after its initial release,
Whitney Houston
topped the
Billboard
200
albums chart and stayed there for 14 non-consecutive weeks. [ 43 ]
The final single, " Greatest Love of All ", became Houston's biggest hit at the time after peaking No. 1 and remaining there for three weeks on the Hot 100 chart, which made her debut the first album by a woman to yield three No. 1 hits. Houston was No. 1 artist of the year and
Whitney Houston
was the No. 1 album of the year on the 1986
Billboard
year-end charts, making her the first woman to earn that distinction. [ 43 ]
At the time, Houston released the best-selling debut album by a solo artist. [ 44 ]
Houston then embarked on her world tour,
Greatest Love Tour . The album had become an international success, and was certified 13× platinum (diamond) in the United States alone, and has sold 25 million copies worldwide. [ 45 ]
At the
1986 Grammy Awards , Houston was nominated for three awards including
Album of the Year . [ 46 ]
She was not eligible for the
Best New Artist
category because of her previous hit R&B duet recording with
Teddy Pendergrass
in 1984. [ 47 ]
She won her first
Grammy Award
for
Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female
for "Saving All My Love for You". [ 48 ]
Houston's performance of the song during the Grammy telecast later earned her an
Emmy Award
for
Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program . [ 49 ]
Houston won seven
American Music Awards
in total in 1986 and 1987, and an
MTV Video Music Award . [ 50 ] [ 51 ]
The album's popularity would also carry over to the
1987 Grammy Awards
when "Greatest Love of All" would receive a
Record of the Year
nomination. Houston's debut album is listed as one of
Rolling Stone ‍ '​s
500 Greatest Albums of All Time
and on
The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame 's Definitive 200 list. [ 52 ] [ 53 ]
Houston's grand entrance into the music industry is considered one of the 25 musical milestones of the last 25 years, according to
USA Today . [ 54 ]
Following Houston's breakthrough, doors were opened for other African-American women such as
Janet Jackson
and
Anita Baker
to find notable success in popular music and on MTV. [ 55 ] [ 56 ]
1987–91:
Whitney ,
I'm Your Baby Tonight
and "The Star Spangled Banner"
With many expectations, Houston's second album,
Whitney , was released in June 1987. The album again featured production from Masser, Kashif and Walden as well as
Jellybean Benitez . Many critics complained that the material was too similar to her previous album.
Rolling Stone
said, "the narrow channel through which this talent has been directed is frustrating". [ 57 ]
Still, the album enjoyed commercial success. Houston became the first woman in music history to debut at number one on the
Billboard
200 albums chart, and the first artist to enter the albums chart at number one in both the US and UK, while also hitting number one or top ten in dozens of other countries around the world. The album's first single, " I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me) ", was also a massive hit worldwide, peaking at No. 1 on the
Billboard
Hot 100 chart and topping the singles chart in many countries such as Australia, Germany and the UK. The next three singles, " Didn't We Almost Have It All ", " So Emotional ", and " Where Do Broken Hearts Go " all peaked at number one on the US Hot 100 chart, which gave her a total of seven consecutive number one hits, breaking the record of six previously shared by
The Beatles
and the
Bee Gees . [ 58 ] [ 59 ]
Houston became the first woman to generate four number-one singles from one album.
Whitney
has been certified 9× Platinum in the US for shipments of over 9 million copies, and has sold a total of 20 million copies worldwide. [ 60 ]
At the
30th Grammy Awards
in 1988, Houston was nominated for three awards, including Album of the Year, winning her second Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)". [ 61 ] [ 62 ]
Houston also won two American Music Awards in 1988 and 1989, respectively, and a
Soul Train Music Award . [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ]
Following the release of the album, Houston embarked on the
Moment of Truth World Tour , which was one of the ten highest grossing concert tours of 1987. [ 66 ]
The success of the tours during 1986–87 and her two studio albums ranked Houston No. 8 for the highest earning entertainers list according to
Forbes
magazine. [ 67 ]
She was the highest earning African-American woman overall and the third highest entertainer after
Bill Cosby
and
Eddie Murphy . [ 67 ]
Houston was a supporter of
Nelson Mandela
and the anti-apartheid movement. During her modeling days, the singer refused to work with any agencies who did business with the then-apartheid South Africa. [ 68 ] [ 69 ]
On June 11, 1988, during the European leg of her tour, Houston joined other musicians to perform a set at
Wembley Stadium
in London to celebrate a then-imprisoned
Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday . [ 68 ]
Over 72,000 people attended Wembley Stadium, and over a billion people tuned in worldwide as the rock concert raised over $1 million for charities while bringing awareness to
apartheid . [ 70 ]
Houston then flew back to the US for a concert at
Madison Square Garden
in New York City in August. The show was a benefit concert that raised a quarter of a million dollars for the
United Negro College Fund . [ 71 ]
In the same year, she recorded a song for
NBC 's coverage of the
1988 Summer Olympics , " One Moment in Time ", which became a Top 5 hit in the US, while reaching number one in the UK and Germany. [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ]
With her world tour continuing overseas, Houston was still one of the top 20 highest earning entertainers for 1987–88 according to
Forbes
magazine. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]

In 1989, Houston formed The Whitney Houston Foundation For Children, a non-profit organization that has raised funds for the needs of children around the world. The organization cares for homelessness, children with cancer or AIDS, and other issues of self-empowerment. [ 77 ]
With the success of her first two albums, Houston was undoubtedly an international crossover superstar, the most prominent since
Michael Jackson , appealing to all demographics. However, some black critics believed she was " selling out ". [ 6 ]
They felt her singing on record lacked the soul that was present during her live concerts. [ 29 ]
At the
1989 Soul Train Music Awards , when Houston's name was called out for a nomination, a few in the audience jeered. [ 78 ] [ 79 ]
Houston defended herself against the criticism, stating, "If you're gonna have a long career, there's a certain way to do it, and I did it that way. I'm not ashamed of it." [ 29 ]
Houston took a more urban direction with her third studio album,
I'm Your Baby Tonight , released in November 1990. She produced and chose producers for this album and as a result, it featured production and collaborations with
L.A. Reid
and
Babyface ,
Luther Vandross , and
Stevie Wonder . The album showed Houston's versatility on a new batch of tough rhythmic grooves, soulful ballads and up-tempo dance tracks. Reviews were mixed.
Rolling Stone
felt it was her "best and most integrated album". [ 80 ]
while
Entertainment Weekly , at the time thought Houston's shift towards an urban direction was "superficial". [ 81 ]
The album contained several hits: the first two singles, " I'm Your Baby Tonight " and " All the Man That I Need " peaked at number one on the
Billboard
Hot 100 chart; " Miracle " peaked at number nine; " My Name Is Not Susan " peaked in the top twenty; " I Belong to You " reached the top ten of the US R&B chart and garnered Houston a Grammy nomination; and the sixth single, the Stevie Wonder duet " We Didn't Know ", reached the R&B top twenty. The album peaked at number three on the
Billboard
200 and went on to be certified 4× platinum in the US while selling twelve million total worldwide.
In 1990, Houston was the spokesperson for a youth leadership conference hosted in Washington, D.C. She had a private audience with President George H. W. Bush in the Oval Office to discuss the associated challenges.
During the
Persian Gulf War , Houston performed " The Star Spangled Banner " at
Super Bowl XXV
at
Tampa Stadium
on January 27, 1991. [ 82 ]
This performance was later reported by those involved in the performance to have been
lip synced [ 83 ]
or to have been sung into a dead microphone while a studio recording previously made by Houston was played. Dan Klores, a spokesman for Houston, explained: "This is not a
Milli Vanilli
thing. She sang live, but the microphone was turned off. It was a technical decision, partially based on the noise factor. This is standard procedure at these events." [ 84 ]
(See also
Star Spangled Banner lip sync controversy. ) A commercial single and video of her performance were released, and reached the Top 20 on the US Hot 100, making her the only act to turn the US national anthem into a pop hit of that magnitude ( José Feliciano 's version reached No. 50 in November 1968). [ 85 ] [ 86 ]
Houston donated all her share of the proceeds to the
American Red Cross Gulf Crisis Fund . As a result, the singer was named to the Red Cross Board of Governors. [ 82 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ]
Her rendition was critically acclaimed and is considered the benchmark for singers. [ 83 ] [ 89 ]
Rolling Stone
commented that "her singing stirs such strong patriotism. Unforgettable", and the performance ranked No. 1 on the 25 most memorable music moments in NFL history list. VH1 listed the performance as one of the greatest moments that rocked TV. [ 90 ] [ 91 ]
Following the attacks on 9/11, it was released again by Arista Records, all profits going towards the firefighters and victims of the attacks. This time it peaked at No. 6 in the Hot 100 and was certified platinum by the
Recording Industry Association of America . [ 92 ]
Later in 1991, Houston put together her
Welcome Home Heroes
concert with
HBO
for the soldiers fighting in the Persian Gulf War and their families. The free concert took place at
Naval Station Norfolk
in
Norfolk , Virginia in front of 3,500 servicemen and women. HBO descrambled the concert so that it was free for everyone to watch. [ 93 ]
Houston's concert gave HBO its highest ratings ever. [ 94 ]
She then embarked on the
I'm Your Baby Tonight World Tour .
1992–94: Marriage, motherhood, and
The Bodyguard
Throughout the 1980s, Houston was romantically linked to
American football
star
Randall Cunningham
and actor
Eddie Murphy , whom she dated. [ 95 ]
She then met R&B singer
Bobby Brown
at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards. After a three-year courtship, the two were married on July 18, 1992. [ 96 ]
On March 4, 1993, Houston gave birth to their daughter
Bobbi Kristina , [ 97 ]
the couple's only child. Brown would go on to have several run-ins with the law, including some jail time. [ 96 ]
With the commercial success of her albums, movie offers poured in, including offers to work with
Robert De Niro ,
Quincy Jones , and
Spike Lee ; but Houston felt the time wasn't right. [ 95 ]
Houston's first film role was in
The Bodyguard , released in 1992 and co-starring
Kevin Costner . Houston played Rachel Marron, a star who is stalked by a crazed fan and hires a bodyguard to protect her.
USA Today
listed it as one of the 25 most memorable movie moments of the last 25 years in 2007. [ 98 ]
Houston's mainstream appeal allowed people to look at the movie color-blind. [ 99 ]
Still, controversy arose as some felt the film's advertising intentionally hid Houston's face to hide the film's interracial relationship. In an interview with
Rolling Stone
in 1993, the singer commented that "people know who Whitney Houston is – I'm black. You can't hide that fact." [ 25 ]
Houston received a
Razzie Award
nomination for Worst Actress.
The Washington Post
said Houston is "doing nothing more than playing Houston, comes out largely unscathed if that is possible in so cockamamie an undertaking", [ 100 ]
and
The New York Times
commented that she lacked passion with her co-star. [ 101 ]
Despite the film's mixed reviews, it was hugely successful at the box office, grossing more than $121 million in the U.S. and $410 million worldwide, making it one of the top 100 grossing films in film history at its time of release, though it is no longer in the top 100 because of rising ticket prices since the time the film was released. [ 102 ]
The film's soundtrack also enjoyed big success. Houston executive produced and contributed six songs for the motion picture's
adjoining soundtrack album .
Rolling Stone
said it is "nothing more than pleasant, tasteful and urbane". [ 103 ]
The soundtrack's lead single was " I Will Always Love You ", written and originally recorded by
Dolly Parton
in 1974. Houston's version of the song was acclaimed by many critics, regarding it as her "signature song" or "iconic performance".
Rolling Stone
and
USA Today
called her rendition "the tour-de-force". [ 104 ] [ 105 ]
The single peaked at number one on the
Billboard
Hot 100 for a then-record-breaking 14 weeks, number one on the R&B chart for a then-record-breaking 11 weeks, and number one on the Adult Contemporary charts for five weeks. [ 106 ]
The single was certified 4× platinum by the
RIAA , making Houston the first woman with a single to reach that level in the RIAA history and becoming the best-selling single by a woman in the US. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ]
The song also became a global success, hitting number-one in almost all countries, and
the best-selling single of all time
by a female solo artist with 20 million copies sold. [ 110 ] [ 111 ]
The soundtrack topped the
Billboard
200 chart and remained there for 20 non-consecutive weeks, the longest tenure by any album on the chart in the Nielsen SoundScan era, and became one of the fastest selling albums ever. [ 112 ]
During Christmas week of 1992, the soundtrack sold over a million copies within a week, becoming the first album to achieve that feat under
Nielsen SoundScan
system. [ 113 ] [ 114 ]
With the follow-up singles " I'm Every Woman ", a
Chaka Khan
cover, and " I Have Nothing " both reaching the top five, Houston became the first woman to ever have three singles in the Top 11 simultaneously. [ 115 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ]
The album was certified 17× platinum in the US alone, [ 118 ]
with worldwide sales of 44 million, [ 119 ]
making
The Bodyguard
the biggest-selling album by a female act on the
list of the world's Top 10 best-selling albums , topping
Shania Twain 's 40 million sold for
Come On Over . [ 120 ]
Houston won three Grammys for the album in 1994, including two of the Academy's highest honors,
Album of the Year
and
Record of the Year . In addition, she won a record 8 American Music Awards at that year's ceremony including the Award of Merit, [ 121 ]
11
Billboard Music Awards , 3
Soul Train Music Awards
in 1993–94 including
Sammy Davis, Jr. Award as Entertainer of the Year , [ 122 ]
5
NAACP Image Awards
including
Entertainer of the Year , [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ]
a record 5
World Music Awards , [ 126 ]
and a
BRIT award . [ 127 ]
Following the success of the project, Houston embarked on another expansive global tour,
The Bodyguard World Tour , in 1993–94. Her concerts, movie, and recording grosses made her the third highest earning female entertainer of 1993–94, just behind
Oprah Winfrey
and
Barbra Streisand
according to
Forbes
magazine. [ 128 ]
Houston placed in the top five of
Entertainment Weekly ‍ '​s annual "Entertainer of the Year" ranking [ 129 ]
and was labeled by
Premiere
magazine as one of the 100 most powerful people in Hollywood. [ 130 ]
In October 1994, Houston attended and performed at a state dinner in the
White House
honoring newly elected South African president Nelson Mandela. [ 131 ] [ 132 ]
At the end of her world tour, Houston performed three concerts in South Africa to honor President Mandela, playing to over 200,000 people. This would make the singer the first major musician to visit the newly unified and apartheid free nation following Mandela's winning election. [ 133 ]
The concert was broadcast live on HBO with funds of the concerts being donated to various charities in South Africa. The event was considered the nation's "biggest media event since the inauguration of Nelson Mandela". [ 134 ]
1995–97:
Waiting to Exhale ,
The Preacher's Wife , and
Cinderella
In 1995, Houston starred alongside
Angela Bassett ,
Loretta Devine , and
Lela Rochon
in her second film,
Waiting to Exhale , a motion picture about four African-American women struggling with relationships. Houston played the lead character Savannah Jackson, a TV producer in love with a married man. She chose the role because she saw the film as "a breakthrough for the image of black women because it presents them both as professionals and as caring mothers". [ 135 ]
After opening at number one and grossing $67 million in the US at the box office and $81 million worldwide, [ 136 ]
it proved that a movie primarily targeting a black audience can cross over to success, while paving the way for other all-black movies such as
How Stella Got Her Groove Back
and the
Tyler Perry
movies that became popular in the 2000s. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ]
The film is also notable for its portrayal of black women as strong middle class citizens rather than as stereotypes. [ 140 ]
The reviews were mainly positive for the ensemble cast.
The New York Times
said: "Ms. Houston has shed the defensive hauteur that made her portrayal of a pop star in 'The Bodyguard' seem so distant." [ 141 ]
Houston was nominated for an
NAACP Image Award
for "Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture", but lost to her co-star Bassett. [ 142 ]
The film's accompanying soundtrack,
Waiting to Exhale: Original Soundtrack Album , was produced by Houston and
Babyface . Though Babyface originally wanted Houston to record the entire album, she declined. Instead, she "wanted it to be an album of women with vocal distinction", and thus gathered several African-American female artists for the soundtrack, to go along with the film's message about strong women. [ 135 ]
Consequently, the album featured a range of contemporary R&B female recording artists along with Houston, such as
Mary J. Blige ,
Brandy ,
Toni Braxton ,
Aretha Franklin , and
Patti LaBelle . Houston's " Exhale (Shoop Shoop) " peaked at No. 1, and then spent a record eleven weeks at the No. 2 spot and eight weeks on top of the R&B Charts. "Count On Me", a duet with
CeCe Winans , hit the U.S. Top 10; and Houston's third contribution, " Why Does It Hurt So Bad ", made the Top 30. The album debuted at No. 1, and was
certified
7×
Platinum
in the United States, denoting shipments of seven million copies. [ 60 ]
The soundtrack received strong reviews; as
Entertainment Weekly
stated: "the album goes down easy, just as you'd expect from a package framed by Whitney Houston tracks... the soundtrack waits to exhale, hovering in sensuous suspense" [ 143 ]
and has since ranked it as one of the 100 Best Movie Soundtracks. [ 144 ]
Later that year, Houston's children's charity organization was awarded a VH1 Honor for all the charitable work. [ 145 ]
In 1996, Houston starred in the holiday comedy
The Preacher's Wife , with
Denzel Washington . She plays a gospel-singing wife of a pastor ( Courtney B. Vance ). It was largely an updated remake of the film
The Bishop's Wife
(1948) , which starred
Loretta Young ,
David Niven
and
Cary Grant . Houston earned $10 million for the role, making her one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood at the time and the highest earning African-American actress in Hollywood. [ 146 ]
The movie, with its all African-American cast, was a moderate success, earning approximately $50 million at the U.S. box offices. [ 147 ]
The movie gave Houston her strongest reviews so far.
The San Francisco Chronicle
said Houston "is rather angelic herself, displaying a divine talent for being virtuous and flirtatious at the same time", and she "exudes gentle yet spirited warmth, especially when praising the Lord in her gorgeous singing voice". [ 148 ]
Houston was again nominated for an
NAACP Image Award
and won for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture. [ 149 ]
Houston recorded and co-produced, with
Mervyn Warren , the film's accompanying gospel soundtrack.
The Preacher's Wife: Original Soundtrack Album
included six gospel songs with
Georgia Mass Choir
that were recorded at the Great Star Rising Baptist Church in Atlanta. Houston also duetted with gospel legend
Shirley Caesar . The album sold six million copies worldwide and scored hit singles with " I Believe in You and Me " and " Step by Step ", becoming the largest selling gospel album of all time. [ 150 ]
The album received mainly positive reviews. Some critics, such as that of
USA Today , noted the presence of her emotional depth, [ 151 ]
while
The Times
said, "To hear Houston going at full throttle with the 35 piece Georgia Mass Choir struggling to keep up is to realise what her phenomenal voice was made for". [ 152 ]
In 1997, Houston's production company changed its name to BrownHouse Productions and was joined by
Debra Martin Chase . Their goal was "to show aspects of the lives of African-Americans that have not been brought to the screen before" while improving how African-Americans are portrayed in film and television. [ 153 ]
Their first project was a
made-for-television
remake of
Rodgers & Hammerstein 's
Cinderella . In addition to co-producing, Houston starred in the movie as the
Fairy Godmother
along with
Brandy ,
Jason Alexander ,
Whoopi Goldberg , and
Bernadette Peters . Houston was initially offered the role of Cinderella in 1993, but other projects intervened. [ 154 ]
The film is notable for its multi-racial cast and nonstereotypical message. [ 155 ]
An estimated 60 million viewers tuned into the special giving ABC its highest TV ratings in 16 years. [ 156 ]
The movie received seven
Emmy
nominations including Outstanding Variety, Musical or Comedy, while winning Outstanding Art Direction in a Variety, Musical or Comedy Special. [ 157 ]
Houston and Chase then obtained the rights to the story of
Dorothy Dandridge . Houston was to play Dandridge, the first African American actress to be nominated for an
Academy Award for Best Actress . Houston wanted the story told with dignity and honor. [ 153 ]
However,
Halle Berry
also had rights to the project and got her version going first. [ 158 ]
Later that year, Houston paid tribute to her idols, such as
Aretha Franklin ,
Diana Ross , and
Dionne Warwick , by performing their hits during the three-night HBO Concert
Classic Whitney Live from Washington, D.C. . The special raised over $300,000 for the
Children's Defense Fund . [ 159 ]
Houston received the
Quincy Jones Award
for outstanding career achievements in the field of entertainment at the
12th Soul Train Music Awards . [ 160 ] [ 161 ]
1998–2000:
My Love Is Your Love
and
Whitney: The Greatest Hits
After spending much of the early and mid-1990s working on motion pictures and their soundtrack albums, Houston's first studio album in eight years, the critically acclaimed
My Love Is Your Love , was released in November 1998. Though originally slated to be a greatest hits album with a handful of new songs, recording sessions were so fruitful that a new full-length studio album was released. Recorded and mixed in only six weeks, it featured production from
Rodney Jerkins ,
Wyclef Jean
and
Missy Elliott . The album debuted at number thirteen, its peak position, on the
Billboard
200 chart. [ 162 ]
It had a funkier and edgier sound than past releases and saw Houston handling urban dance,
hip hop , mid-tempo
R&B ,
reggae ,
torch songs , and ballads all with great dexterity. [ 163 ]
From late 1998 to early 2000, the album spawned several hit singles: " When You Believe " (US No. 15, UK No. 4), a duet with
Mariah Carey
for 1998's
The Prince of Egypt
soundtrack , which also became an international hit as it peaked in the Top 10 in several countries and won an
Academy Award for Best Original Song ; [ 164 ]
" Heartbreak Hotel " (US No. 2, UK No. 25) featured
Faith Evans
and
Kelly Price , received a
1999 MTV VMA
nomination for
Best R&B Video , [ 165 ]
and number one on the US R&B chart for seven weeks; " It's Not Right but It's Okay " (US No. 4, UK No. 3) won Houston her sixth
Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance ; [ 166 ]
" My Love Is Your Love " (US No. 4, UK No. 2) with 3 million copies sold worldwide; [ 167 ]
and " I Learned from the Best " (US No. 27, UK No. 19). [ 168 ] [ 169 ]
These singles became international hits as well, and all the singles, except "When You Believe", became number one hits on the
Billboard
Hot Dance/Club Play
chart. The album sold four million copies in America, making it certified 4× platinum, and a total of eleven million copies worldwide. [ 45 ]
The album gave Houston some of her strongest reviews ever.
Rolling Stone
said Houston was singing "with a bite in her voice" [ 170 ]
and
The Village Voice
called it "Whitney's sharpest and most satisfying so far". [ 171 ]
In 1999, Houston participated in
VH-1's Divas Live '99 , alongside
Brandy ,
Mary J. Blige ,
Tina Turner , and
Cher . The same year, Houston hit the road with her 70 date
My Love Is Your Love World Tour . The European leg of the tour was Europe's highest grossing arena tour of the year. [ 172 ]
In November 1999, Houston was named Top-selling R&B Female Artist of the Century with certified US sales of 51 million copies at the time and
The Bodyguard Soundtrack
was named the Top-selling Soundtrack Album of the Century by the
Recording Industry Association of America
(RIAA). [ 173 ]
She also won The Artist of the Decade, Female award for extraordinary artistic contributions during the 1990s at the
14th Soul Train Music Awards , and an
MTV Europe Music Award
for
Best R&B . [ 174 ] [ 175 ] [ 176 ] [ 177 ] [ 178 ]
In May 2000,
Whitney: The Greatest Hits
was released worldwide. The double disc set peaked at number five in the United States, reaching number one in the United Kingdom. [ 169 ] [ 179 ]
In addition, the album reached the Top 10 in many other countries. [ 180 ]
While ballad songs were left unchanged, the album features
house / club
remixes of many of Houston's up-tempo hits. Included on the album were four new songs: " Could I Have This Kiss Forever " (a duet with
Enrique Iglesias ), " Same Script, Different Cast " (a duet with
Deborah Cox ), " If I Told You That " (a duet with
George Michael ), and " Fine ", and three hits that had never appeared on a Houston album: "One Moment in Time", "The Star Spangled Banner", and "If You Say My Eyes Are Beautiful", a duet with Jermaine Jackson from his 1986
Precious Moments
album. [ 181 ]
Along with the album, an accompanying VHS and DVD was released featuring the music videos to Houston's greatest hits, as well as several hard-to-find live performances including her 1983 debut on
The Merv Griffin Show , and interviews. [ 182 ]
The greatest hits album was certified 3× platinum in the US, with worldwide sales of 10 million. [ 183 ] [ 184 ]
2000–05:
Just Whitney
and personal struggles
Though Houston was seen as a "good girl" with a perfect image in the 1980s and early 1990s, by the late 1990s, her behavior changed. She was often hours late for interviews, photo shoots and rehearsals, and canceling concerts and talk-show appearances. [ 185 ] [ 186 ]
With the missed performances and weight loss, rumors about Houston using drugs with her husband circulated. On January 11, 2000, airport security guards discovered marijuana in both Houston's and husband Bobby Brown's luggage at a Hawaii airport, but the two boarded the plane and departed before authorities could arrive. Charges were later dropped against them, [ 187 ]
but rumors of drug usage between the couple would continue to surface. Two months later, Clive Davis was inducted into the
Rock & Roll Hall of Fame . Houston had been scheduled to perform at the event, but failed to show up. [ 188 ]
Shortly thereafter, Houston was scheduled to perform at the Academy Awards but was fired from the event by musical director and longtime friend
Burt Bacharach . Her publicist cited throat problems as the reason for the cancellation. In his book
The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards , author Steve Pond revealed that "Houston's voice was shaky, she seemed distracted and jittery, and her attitude was casual, almost defiant", and that while Houston was to sing " Over the Rainbow ", she would start singing a different song. [ 189 ]
Houston later admitted to having been fired. [ 190 ]
Later that year, Houston's long-time executive assistant and friend, Robyn Crawford, resigned from Houston's management company. [ 188 ]
In August 2001, Houston signed the biggest record deal in music history with Arista/ BMG . She renewed her contract for $100 million to deliver six new albums, on which she would also earn royalties. [ 191 ] [ 192 ] [ 193 ]
She later made an appearance on
Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special . Her extremely thin frame further spurred rumors of drug use. Houston's publicist said, "Whitney has been under stress due to family matters, and when she is under stress she doesn't eat." [ 194 ]
The singer was scheduled for a second performance the following night but canceled. [ 195 ]
Within weeks, Houston's rendition of "The Star Spangled Banner" would be re-released after the
September 11 attacks , with the
proceeds donated
to the
New York Firefighters 9/11 Disaster Relief Fund
and the
New York Fraternal Order of Police . [ 196 ]
The song peaked at No. 6 this time on the US Hot 100, topping its previous position. [ 168 ]
In 2002, Houston became involved in a legal dispute with John Houston Enterprise. Although the company was started by her father to manage her career, it was actually run by company president Kevin Skinner. Skinner filed a
breach-of-contract
lawsuit
and sued for $100 million (but lost), stating that Houston owed the company previously unpaid compensation for helping to negotiate her $100 million contract with Arista Records and for sorting out legal matters. [ 197 ]
Houston stated that her 81-year-old father had nothing to do with the lawsuit. Although Skinner tried to claim otherwise, John Houston never appeared in court. [ 198 ]
Houston's father later died in February 2003. [ 199 ]
The lawsuit was dismissed on April 5, 2004, and Skinner was awarded nothing. [ 200 ]
Also in 2002, Houston did an interview with
Diane Sawyer
to promote her then-upcoming album. During the prime-time special, Houston spoke on topics including rumored drug use and marriage. She was asked about the ongoing drug rumors and replied, "First of all, let's get one thing straight.
Crack
is cheap. I make too much money to ever smoke crack. Let's get that straight. Okay? We don't do crack. We don't do that. Crack is whack." [ 190 ]
The line was from Keith Haring's mural which was painted in 1986 on the handball court at 128th Street and 2nd Avenue. [ 201 ]
Houston did, however, admit to using other substances at times, including cocaine. [ 190 ]
In December 2002, Houston released her fifth studio album,
Just Whitney... . The album included productions from then-husband Bobby Brown, as well as Missy Elliott and Babyface, and marked the first time that Houston did not produce with
Clive Davis
as Davis had been released by top management at BMG. Upon its release,
Just Whitney...
received mixed reviews. [ 202 ]
The album debuted at number 9 on the
Billboard
200
chart and it had the highest first week sales of any album Houston had ever released. [ 203 ]
The four singles released from the album did not fare well on the
Billboard
Hot 100, but became
dance chart
hits.
Just Whitney...
was certified
platinum
in the United States, and sold approximately three million worldwide. [ 204 ]
On a June 2003 trip to
Israel , Houston said of her visit, "I've never felt like this in any other country. I feel at home, I feel wonderful." [ 205 ]
In late 2003, Houston released her first Christmas album
One Wish: The Holiday Album , with a collection of traditional holiday songs. Houston produced the album with
Mervyn Warren
and Gordon Chambers. A single titled " One Wish (for Christmas) " reached the Top 20 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and the album was certified gold in the US. Having always been a touring artist, Houston spent most of 2004 touring and performing in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and
Russia . In September 2004, she gave a surprise performance at the
World Music Awards
in a tribute to long-time friend
Clive Davis . After the show, Davis and Houston announced plans to go into the studio to work on her new album. [ 206 ]
In early 2004, husband Bobby Brown starred in his own reality TV program,
Being Bobby Brown
on the
Bravo network , which provided a view into the domestic goings-on in the Brown household. Though it was Brown's vehicle, Houston was a prominent figure throughout the show, receiving as much screen time as Brown. The series aired in 2005 and featured Houston in, what some would say, not her most flattering moments.
The Hollywood Reporter
said it was "undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television". [ 207 ]
Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot and continued Houston's successful forays into film and television. [ 208 ]
The show was not renewed for a second season after Houston stated that she would no longer appear in it, and Brown and Bravo could not come to an agreement for another season. [ 209 ]
2006–12: Return to music,
I Look to You , tour and film comeback
After years of controversy and turmoil, Houston separated from Bobby Brown in September 2006, filing for divorce the following month. [ 210 ]
On February 1, 2007, Houston asked the court to fast track their divorce. [ 211 ]
The divorce was finalized on April 24, 2007, with Houston granted custody of the couple's daughter. [ 212 ]
On May 4, Houston sold the
suburban Atlanta
home featured in
Being Bobby Brown
for $1.19 million. [ 213 ]
A few days later, Brown sued Houston in
Orange County , California court in an attempt to change the terms of their custody agreement. Brown also sought child and spousal support from Houston. In the lawsuit, Brown claimed that financial and emotional problems prevented him from properly responding to Houston's divorce petition. [ 214 ]
Brown lost at his court hearing as the judge dismissed his appeal to overrule the custody terms, leaving Houston with full custody and Brown with no spousal support. [ 215 ]
In March 2007, Clive Davis of Arista Records announced that Houston would begin recording a new album. [ 216 ]
In October 2007, Arista released another compilation
The Ultimate Collection
outside the United States. [ 217 ]
Houston performing " My Love Is Your Love " with her daughter
Bobbi Kristina Brown
on
Good Morning America , September 1, 2009
Houston gave her first interview in seven years in September 2009, appearing on Oprah Winfrey's season premiere. The interview was billed as "the most anticipated music interview of the decade". [ 218 ]
Whitney admitted on the show to using drugs with former husband Bobby Brown, who "laced marijuana with rock cocaine". [ 219 ]
She told Oprah that before
The Bodyguard
her drug use was light, but after the film's success and the birth of her daughter it got heavier, and by 1996 "[doing drugs] was an everyday thing... I wasn't happy by that point in time. I was losing myself." [ 220 ]
Houston released her new album,
I Look to You , in August 2009. [ 221 ]
The album's first two singles were the title track " I Look to You " and " Million Dollar Bill ". The album entered the
Billboard
200
at No. 1, with Houston's best opening week sales of 305,000 copies, marking Houston's first number one album since
The Bodyguard , and Houston's first studio album to reach number one since 1987's

Wetten, dass..? . Three days later, she performed the worldwide first single from
I Look to You , "Million Dollar Bill", on the French television show
Le Grand Journal . Houston appeared as guest mentor on
The X Factor
in the United Kingdom. She performed "Million Dollar Bill" on the following day's results show, completing the song even as a strap in the back of her dress popped open two seconds into the performance. She later commented that she "sang [herself] out of [her] clothes".
The performance was poorly received by the British media, and was variously described as "weird" and "ungracious", [ 222 ]
"shambolic" [ 223 ]
and a "flop". Despite this reception, "Million Dollar Bill" jumped to its peak from 14 to number 5 (her first UK top 5 for over a decade), and three weeks after release
I Look to You
went gold. Houston appeared on the Italian version of
The X Factor , also performing "Million Dollar Bill", this time to excellent reviews. [ 224 ]
Houston was later awarded a Gold certificate for achieving over 50,000 CD sales of
I Look to You
in Italy. [ 225 ]
In November, Houston performed "I Didn't Know My Own Strength" at the 2009 American Music Awards in Los Angeles, California. Two days later, Houston performed "Million Dollar Bill" and "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)" on the

Nothing but Love World Tour
Houston later embarked on a world tour, entitled the
Nothing but Love World Tour . It was her first world tour in over ten years and was announced as a triumphant comeback. However, some poor reviews and rescheduled concerts brought some negative media attention. [ 228 ] [ 229 ]
Houston canceled some concerts because of illness and received widespread negative reviews from fans who were disappointed in the quality of her voice and performance. Some fans reportedly walked out of her concerts. [ 230 ]
In January 2010, Houston was nominated for two NAACP Image Awards, one for Best Female Artist and one for Best Music Video. She won the award for Best Music Video for her single "I Look to You". On January 16, she received
The BET Honors
Award for Entertainer citing her lifetime achievements spanning over 25 years in the industry. The 2010 BET Honors award was held at the
Warner Theatre
in Washington, D.C. and aired on February 1, 2010.

A representative for Houston said that it was a part of Houston's "longstanding recovery process". [ 232 ]
In September 2011,
The Hollywood Reporter
announced that Houston would produce and star alongside
Jordin Sparks
and
Mike Epps
in the remake of the 1976 film
Sparkle . In the film, Houston portrays Sparks' "not-so encouraging" mother. Houston is also credited as an executive producer of the film. Debra Martin Chase, producer of
Sparkle , stated that Houston deserved the title considering she had been there from the beginning in 2001, when Houston obtained
Sparkle
production rights. R&B singer
Aaliyah  – originally tapped to star as Sparkle – died in a 2001 plane crash. Her death derailed production, which would have begun in 2002. [ 233 ] [ 234 ] [ 235 ]
Houston's
remake of
Sparkle
was filmed in the fall of 2011 over a two-month period, [ 236 ]
and was released by
TriStar Pictures . [ 237 ]
On May 21, 2012, "Celebrate", the last song Houston recorded with Sparks, premiered at RyanSeacrest.com. It was made available for digital download on iTunes on June 5. [ 238 ]

Reaction
Pre-Grammy party
The Clive Davis's pre-Grammy party that Houston was expected to attend, which featured many of the biggest names in music and movies, went on as scheduled although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start: "By now you have all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on." [ 263 ]
Tony Bennett
spoke of Houston's death before performing at Davis's party. He said, "First, it was
Michael Jackson , then
Amy Winehouse , now, the magnificent Whitney Houston." Bennett sang " How Do You Keep the Music Playing? " and said of Houston, "When I first heard her, I called Clive Davis and said, 'You finally found the greatest singer I've ever heard in my life.'" [ 264 ]
Some celebrities opposed Davis' decision to continue on the party while a police investigation was being conducted in Houston's hotel room and her body was still in the building.
Chaka Khan , in an interview with
CNN 's
Piers Morgan
on February 13, 2012, shared that she felt the party should have been canceled, saying: "I thought that was complete insanity. And knowing Whitney I don't believe that she would have said 'the show must go on.' She's the kind of woman that would've said 'Stop everything! Un-unh. I'm not going to be there.' [...] I don't know what could motivate a person to have a party in a building where the person whose life he had influenced so enormously and whose life had been affected by hers. They were like... I don't understand how that party went on." [ 265 ]
Sharon Osbourne
condemned the Davis party, declaring: "I think it was disgraceful that the party went on. I don't want to be in a hotel room when there's someone you admire who's tragically lost their life four floors up. I'm not interested in being in that environment and I think when you grieve someone, you do it privately, you do it with people who understand you. I thought it was so wrong." [ 266 ]
Further reaction and tributes
Many other celebrities released statements responding to Houston's death.
Darlene Love , Houston's godmother, hearing the news of her death, said, "It felt like I had been struck by a lightning bolt in my gut." [ 267 ]
Dolly Parton , whose song " I Will Always Love You " was covered by Houston, said, "I will always be grateful and in awe of the wonderful performance she did on my song, and I can truly say from the bottom of my heart, 'Whitney, I will always love you. You will be missed.'"
Aretha Franklin
said, "It's so stunning and unbelievable. I couldn't believe what I was reading coming across the TV screen." [ 268 ]
Others paying tribute included
Mariah Carey ,
Quincy Jones
and
Oprah Winfrey . [ 269 ] [ 270 ]

MTV and VH-1 interrupted their regularly scheduled programming on Sunday February 12 to air many of Houston's classic videos with MTV often airing news segments in between and featuring various reactions from fans and celebrities.
Houston's former husband,
Bobby Brown , was reported to be "in and out of crying fits" since receiving the news. He did not cancel a scheduled performance and within hours of his ex-wife's sudden death, an audience in Mississippi observed as Brown blew kisses skyward, tearfully saying: "I love you, Whitney." [ 273 ]
Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the
54th Grammy Awards , announced that
Jennifer Hudson
would perform a tribute to Houston at the February 12, 2012 ceremony. He said "event organizers believed Hudson – an Academy Award-winning actress and Grammy Award-winning artist – could perform a respectful musical tribute to Houston". Ehrlich went on to say: "It's too fresh in everyone's memory to do more at this time, but we would be remiss if we didn't recognize Whitney's remarkable contribution to music fans in general, and in particular her close ties with the Grammy telecast and her Grammy wins and nominations over the years". [ 274 ]
At the start of the awards ceremony, footage of Houston performing "I Will Always Love You" from the 1994 Grammys was shown following a prayer read by host
LL Cool J . Later in the program, following a montage of photos of musicians who died in 2011 with Houston singing "Saving All My Love for You" at the 1986 Grammys, Hudson paid tribute to Houston and the other artists by performing "I Will Always Love You". [ 275 ] [ 276 ]

Houston was a
mezzo-soprano , [ 283 ] [ 284 ]
and was commonly referred to as "The Voice" in reference to her exceptional vocal talent. [ 285 ]
She was third in MTV's list of 22 Greatest Voices, [ 286 ]
and sixth on
Online Magazine COVE ‍ '​s list of the 100 Best Pop Vocalists with a score of 48.5/50. [ 287 ]
Jon Pareles
of
The New York Times
stated she "always had a great big voice, a technical marvel from its velvety depths to its ballistic middle register to its ringing and airy heights". [ 288 ]
In 2008,
Rolling Stone
listed Houston as the thirty-fourth of the 100 greatest singers of all time, stating, "Her voice is a mammoth, coruscating cry: Few vocalists could get away with opening a song with 45 unaccompanied seconds of singing, but Houston's powerhouse version of Dolly Parton's 'I Will Always Love You' is a tour de force." [ 104 ]
Matthew Perpetua from
Rolling Stone
also eulogized Houston's vocal, enumerating ten performances, including "How Will I Know" from the 1986 MTV VMAs and "The Star Spangled Banner" at the 1991 Super Bowl. "Whitney Houston was blessed with an astonishing vocal range and extraordinary technical skill, but what truly made her a great singer was her ability to connect with a song and drive home its drama and emotion with incredible precision", he stated. "She was a brilliant performer, and her live shows often eclipsed her studio recordings." [ 289 ]
Jon Caramanica of
The New York Times
commented, "Her voice was clean and strong, with barely any grit, well suited to the songs of love and aspiration. [...] Hers was a voice of triumph and achievement, and it made for any number of stunning, time-stopping vocal performances." [ 290 ]
Mariah Carey
stated, "She [Whitney] has a really rich, strong mid-belt that very few people have. She sounds really good, really strong." [ 291 ]
While in her review of
I Look to You , music critic Ann Powers of the
Los Angeles Times
writes, "[Houston's voice] stands like monuments upon the landscape of 20th century pop, defining the architecture of their times, sheltering the dreams of millions and inspiring the climbing careers of countless imitators", adding "When she was at her best, nothing could match her huge, clean, cool mezzo-soprano." [ 284 ]
Lauren Everitt from
BBC News Magazine
commented on
melisma
used in Houston's recording and its influence. "An early 'I' in Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' takes nearly six seconds to sing. In those seconds the former gospel singer-turned-pop star packs a series of different notes into the single syllable", stated Everitt. "The technique is repeated throughout the song, most pronouncedly on every 'I' and 'you'. The vocal technique is called melisma, and it has inspired a host of imitators. Other artists may have used it before Houston, but it was her rendition of Dolly Parton's love song that pushed the technique into the mainstream in the 90s. [...] But perhaps what Houston nailed best was moderation." Everitt said that "[i]n a climate of reality shows ripe with 'oversinging,' it's easy to appreciate Houston's ability to save melisma for just the right moment." [ 292 ]
Houston's vocal stylings have had a significant impact on the music industry. According to Linda Lister in
Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars , she has been called the " Queen of Pop " for her influence during the 1990s, commercially rivaling Mariah Carey and
Celine Dion . [ 293 ]
Stephen Holden
from
The New York Times , in his review of Houston's
Radio City Music Hall
concert on July 20, 1993, praised her attitude as a singer, writing, "Whitney Houston is one of the few contemporary pop stars of whom it might be said: the voice suffices. While almost every performer whose albums sell in the millions calls upon an entertainer's bag of tricks, from telling jokes to dancing to circus pyrotechnics, Ms. Houston would rather just stand there and sing." With regard to her singing style, he added: "Her [Houston's] stylistic trademarks – shivery melismas that ripple up in the middle of a song, twirling embellishments at the ends of phrases that suggest an almost breathless exhilaration – infuse her interpretations with flashes of musical and emotional lightning." [ 294 ]
Elysa Gardner of the
Los Angeles Times
in her review for
The Preacher's Wife Soundtrack
praised Houston's vocal ability highly, commenting, "She is first and foremost a pop diva – at that, the best one we have. No other female pop star – not Mariah Carey, not Celine Dion, not
Barbra Streisand  – quite rivals Houston in her exquisite vocal fluidity and purity of tone, and her ability to infuse a lyric with mesmerizing melodrama." [ 295 ]
Influence
During the 1980s, MTV was coming into its own and received criticism for not playing enough videos by black artists. With
Michael Jackson
breaking down the color barrier for black men, Houston did the same for black women. She became the first black woman to receive heavy rotation on the network following the success of the "How Will I Know" video. [ 296 ]
Following Houston's breakthrough, other African-American women, such as
Janet Jackson
and
Anita Baker , were successful in popular music. [ 55 ] [ 56 ]
Baker commented that "Because of what Whitney and
Sade
did, there was an opening for me... For radio stations, black women singers aren't taboo anymore." [ 297 ]
AllMusic
noted her contribution to the success of black artists on the pop scene, commenting, "Houston was able to handle big adult contemporary ballads, effervescent, stylish dance-pop, and slick urban contemporary soul with equal dexterity" and that "the result was an across-the-board appeal that was matched by scant few artists of her era, and helped her become one of the first black artists to find success on MTV in Michael Jackson's wake". [ 298 ]
The New York Times
stated that "Houston was a major catalyst for a movement within black music that recognized the continuity of soul, pop, jazz and gospel vocal traditions". [ 299 ]
Richard Corliss
of
Time
magazine commented on her initial success breaking various barriers:
Of her first album's ten cuts, six were ballads. This chanteuse [Houston] had to fight for air play with hard rockers. The young lady had to stand uncowed in the locker room of macho rock. The soul strutter had to seduce a music audience that anointed few black artists with superstardom. [...] She was a phenomenon waiting to happen, a canny tapping of the listener's yen for a return to the musical middle. And because every new star creates her own genre, her success has helped other blacks, other women, other smooth singers find an avid reception in the pop marketplace. [ 300 ]
Stephen Holden of
The New York Times
said that Houston "revitalized the tradition of strong gospel-oriented pop-soul singing". [ 301 ]
Ann Powers of the
Los Angeles Times
referred to the singer as a "national treasure". [ 284 ]
Jon Caramanica, other music critic of
The New York Times , called Houston "R&B's great modernizer", adding "slowly but surely reconciling the ambition and praise of the church with the movements and needs of the body and the glow of the mainstream". [ 290 ]
He also drew comparisons between Houston's influence and other big names' on 1980s pop:
She was, alongside Michael Jackson and Madonna, one of the crucial figures to hybridize pop in the 1980s, though her strategy was far less radical than that of her peers. Jackson and Madonna were by turns lascivious and brutish and, crucially, willing to let their production speak more loudly than their voices, an option Ms. Houston never went for. Also, she was less prolific than either of them, achieving most of her renown on the strength of her first three solo albums and one soundtrack, released from 1985 to 1992. If she was less influential than they were in the years since, it was only because her gift was so rare, so impossible to mimic. Jackson and Madonna built worldviews around their voices; Ms. Houston’s voice was the worldview. She was someone more to be admired, like a museum piece, than to be emulated. [ 290 ]
The Independent ‍ '​s music critic Andy Gill also wrote about Houston's influence on modern R&B and singing competitions, comparing it to Michael Jackson's. "Because Whitney, more than any other single artist ― Michael Jackson included ― effectively mapped out the course of modern R&B, setting the bar for standards of soul vocalese, and creating the original template for what we now routinely refer to as the 'soul diva' ", stated Gill. "Jackson was a hugely talented icon, certainly, but he will be as well remembered (probably more so) for his presentational skills, his dazzling dance moves, as for his musical innovations. Whitney, on the other hand, just sang, and the ripples from her voice continue to dominate the pop landscape." Gill said that there "are few, if any, Jackson imitators on today's TV talent shows, but every other contestant is a Whitney wannabe, desperately attempting to emulate that wondrous combination of vocal effects – the flowing melisma, the soaring mezzo-soprano confidence, the tremulous fluttering that carried the ends of lines into realms of higher yearning". [ 302 ]
Houston was considered by many to be a "singer's singer", who had an influence on countless other vocalists, both female and male. [ 104 ] [ 303 ]
Similarly, Steve Huey from Allmusic wrote that the shadow of Houston's prodigious technique still looms large over nearly every pop diva and smooth urban soul singer – male or female – in her wake, and spawned a legion of imitators. [ 298 ]
Rolling Stone , on her biography, stated that Houston "redefined the image of a female soul icon and inspired singers ranging from Mariah Carey to
Rihanna ". [ 304 ]
Essence
ranked Houston sixth on their list of 50 Most Influential R&B Stars of all time, calling her "the diva to end all divas". [ 305 ]

Celine Dion , [ 306 ]

Mariah Carey, who was often compared to Houston, said, "She [Houston] has been a big influence on me." [ 320 ]
She later told
USA Today
that "none of us would sound the same if Aretha Franklin hadn't ever put out a record, or Whitney Houston hadn't." [ 321 ]
Celine Dion who was the third member of the troika that dominated female pop singing in the 1990s, did a telephone interview with
Good Morning America
on February 13, 2012, telling "Whitney's been an amazing inspiration for me. I've been singing with her my whole career, actually. I wanted to have a career like hers, sing like her, look beautiful like her." [ 322 ]
Beyoncé
told the
Globe and Mail
that Houston "inspired [her] to get up there and do what [she] did". [ 323 ]
She also wrote on her website on the day after Houston's death, "I, like every singer, always wanted to be just like [Houston]. Her voice was perfect. Strong but soothing. Soulful and classic. Her vibrato, her cadence, her control. So many of my life's memories are attached to a Whitney Houston song. She is our queen and she opened doors and provided a blueprint for all of us." [ 324 ]
Mary J. Blige
said that Houston inviting her onstage during
VH1 's
Divas Live
show in 1999 "opened doors for [her] all over the world". [ 325 ]
Brandy
stated, "The first Whitney Houston CD was genius. That CD introduced the world to her angelic yet powerful voice. Without Whitney, half of this generation of singers wouldn't be singing." [ 326 ]
Kelly Rowland , in an
Ebony ‍‍ '​‍s feature article celebrating black music in June 2006, recalled that "[I] wanted to be a singer after I saw Whitney Houston on TV singing 'Greatest Love of All'. I wanted to sing like Whitney Houston in that red dress." She added that "And I have never, ever forgotten that song [Greatest Love of All]. I learned it backward, forward, sideways. The video still brings chills to me. When you wish and pray for something as a kid, you never know what blessings God will give you." [ 327 ]
Alicia Keys
said "Whitney is an artist who inspired me from [the time I was] a little girl." [ 328 ]
Oscar winner
Jennifer Hudson
cites Houston as her biggest musical influence. She told
Newsday
that she learned from Houston the "difference between being able to sing and knowing how to sing". [ 329 ]
Leona Lewis , who has been called "the new Whitney Houston", also cites her as an influence. Lewis stated that she idolized her as a little girl. [ 330 ] [ 331 ]

"If Ella Fitzgerald is the queen of jazz, Billie Holiday first lady of the blues, and Aretha Franklin the queen of soul, then who is the queen of pop? In the 1990s, it would seem to be a three-way tie between Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Celine Dion. Certainly all three have their devotees and detractors, but their presence has been inescapable." in
