Victoria Secret Models
We all know that almost all of the
Victoria Secret
models are really hot these days on blogs and magazines, and that is no big secret either. But guess who has a secret….
Well if
Victoria
has one, then
Karolina Kurkova
has a secret too. Something she shouldn’t have revealed in the way she did… which is with her bikinis.
Well the photo above may seem just like most of the other photos that V Secret models usually have, meaning they are all hot photos, but if we take a really close look at it here’s (below) what you’ll see… or in this case what you wouldn’t see….. A belly button.
Look at this:
Is it just another photo anomaly? Is there something there that needed to be taken out? Is this a stomach dimple?,  or Is this really  what her belly button looks like? (which I don’t mind really, as long as she has one).
I guess this is why they say that not all secrets need to be revealed.
3 Critical :
Where Is It? –
I swear to God it’s not here… so where is it?
Not Miranda –
good thing
Miranda Kerr
has one, it would have been heartbreaking for me.
Photo Editor Fired –
if this was in some ways edited, then I someone might just be seeking for another job right now.

A lot of attention have been given to
Rhonda Byrne’s
“ The Secret “ , a book
(and documentary)
that talks about life’s secret
“the law of attraction” , and how to use it to take control of your life.  It  was read by millions of people, and download by thousands.
Pretty much attention for a secret if you think of it.
But from another part of the world comes another secret. One of whom millions have also seen, and will want to see some more. One that beholds the “law of attraction” upon us, while she slowly reveals herself as one of the secrets we should have known.
She is Victoria’s Secret,
Miranda May Kerr .  An angel by all means.
Miranda May Kerr
is an Australian model who made a name in the fashion industry after winning a 1997
Australian
nation-wide model search hosted by
Dolly Magazine . From then on, it was all endorsements for this “dimpled” Australian beauty.
Kerr broke the US market when she signed a lucrative cosmetics contract with Maybelline New York, the campaign running in a series of internationally sold
women’s beauty magazines
including
Cosmopolitan ,
CLEO
and
ELLE
and was eventually featured in
Victoria’s Secret
catalogues. From then on, she became one of the faces best to represent Victoria Secret, and was worthy of being the first Australian to be a part of
Victoria’s Secret Angels .
Now her photo’s can be seen a lot in the internet, and let me tell you a secret….
“… most of it are photos of her in her underwear”
3 Critical :
Nobody’s Perfect –
this phrase goes all around, but I guess only Victoria knows the real secret. That maybe, just maybe…. some girls are perfect, and she calls them angels.
Who is Victoria?
–
Who is Victoria?, most of us don’t really know. All we know is that she’s the one keeping those clothes off those angels, coz what they wear under it, is more of the show.
Dimples Cripples –
normal people walk normally…. but seeing an angels dimple like what Miranda Kerr possess simply makes us walk slowly, perhaps crookedly, and  just a little bit  out of the normal.
