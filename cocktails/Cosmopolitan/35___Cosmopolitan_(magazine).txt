Jake Gyllenhaal Gets All Brokeback In New Interview Pics!
No Lance, but strong arms! Stroke, stroke, stroke!
Did he leave Heath back in the tent?
Hard wood! The coming out rumors fell flat, as expected. But seriously, who cares? Just because someone is gay friendly doesn't mean we have to convert him. We can still ogle though! Here are some new photos from the upcoming issue of
Interview
magazine. On the down side, he's not naked. On the upside, he's still adorkably hot!

Denial Is A River In Iran
...or at least in the head of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As everyone has heard, he said yesterday at Columbia University that Iran has no gay people. These were his exact words: "In Iran, we don’t have homosexuals like in your country. We don’t have that in our country. In
Iran , we do not have this phenomenon. I do not know who has told you that we have it." How does he explain the existence of the
Iranian Queer Organization , PGLO, then? Oh, yeah, he says they don't exist. According to the PGLO's Web site, "The year of 2006 has been named the Year of Social Awareness." Oh, that explains it! 2007 is the Year of Social Ignorance! Good times! Oh well. Who am I to poke fun? George Bush probably tells people in other countries the same thing about America, after he tells them the streets are actually paved with gold and the rivers are filled with dirty-money oil. Instead of blood, which is painted all over the countries he leaves in his wake. Seriously. Oops. We just got political.

Birthday Suit: Hal Sparks
Queer-as-eff Hal Sparks turns 36 today, and still maintains that charm. Actually, is it just me, or is he starting to look like a young Evel Dick Donato from the last, sucky season of
Big Brother ??

Speaking Of Hot Naked Mormons: Patrick Wilson!
Since we're thinking about hot Mormons, we couldn't forget this scene from
Angels in America : Did you know Patrick Wilson was the guy in this GAP ad with Claire Danes? He can be our boyfriend anytime! And, finally, Patrick gives

Missionary Position: Mormon Men Expose Skin (Really!)
OK, the
Mormons
are weirder than we thought.
We've always seen those Mormon missionary guys and thought, oooh, how fun it would be to corrupt them!
They don't have much in the way of style, what with the black pants/white shirt/black tie uniform, but it's a timeless look that makes you wonder what's under there.
Plus, they're selling God, and that's so crazy that you know they're probably wild in bed! But...WTF?!
Now the Mormons have literally become Calendar Boys with "Men on a Mission: Mormons Exposed," a calendar featuring 12 cute missionaries without their shirts.
Isn't tempting people to be lusty the job of the
DEVIL ? Good thing we like the devil!
Big Love indeed! Here are a few of the guys, plus a bonus video advertising the goods. And the world just got a little bit weirder.

Zac Efron's Pervy Pics!
Today's Zac news is big news: Zac and Vanessa break up!
(Who dumped who?) The
National Ledger
says Zac may have taken those pervy pictures of Vanessa! New photos of V
have surfaced that are, arguably, even pervier!! She's watching Bill O'Reilly in the new slut-tastic pics!
Good to know she's got strong values, right Bill? Will this ruin her?
Will Zac take the fame and run? Who cares?
All we want to know is...what kind of pictures of HIM does she have??

Birthday Suits: Matthew Rush
Happy Birthday, Mr. Rush!
We'd say it's a BIG ONE, but every day is a big one for you! :) If you don't know who Matthew Rush is, Google image him, but be ready to have your eye sockets popped. Hmm...if you don't know who he is, come to think of it, you must be here by accident. Anyhoo, with this hot multihyphenate (actor-model-director, etc.) a happy birthday on his
MySpace profile !

Esquire: Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt On Parade
Ryan Phillippe as hot as ever...but...couldn't they have at least tailored the suit a bit? Channing "Watch Out Wentworth Miller" Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt JG-L and CT again Joseph Gordon-Levitt with...a young Uma Thurman? No, that's Mamie Gummer...Meryl Streep's daughter! (Speaking of Meryl and Uma, I just saw
Out of Africa
on HBO and kept thinking to myself, "damn, Young Meryl sure looked a lot like Uma!") DAYUMM!! ESQUIRE pulls all stops in this new photo essay of stars from the new movie
Stop-Loss , which deals with the Iraq war. Is Ryan Phillippe ageless?
Is Channing Tatum flawless?
Is Joseph Gordon-Levitt really the dorky kid from "Third Rock From The Sun?"
He's holding his own next to two of the most beautiful guys in the world. Hotness!
And awesome duds.
We love you, Esquire!

John Mayer Got Hot
We've never
ever
understood the John Mayer thing.
He just got a new haircut, put on a purple satin tie, and totally changed out minds. Men and women take note: The white Gericurl didn't work for Marcia Clark circa OJ's first trial, and it didn't work for John Mayer circa the first half of this decade.
This
does work.
Even if it's sort of a lesbian 'do.

Daily Dose Of Beckham: Spicy David B!
This guy does it all: Football, modeling, selling phones for Motorola, more modeling, um, being pretty, being nice, running some kind of school for disadvantaged kids, more modeling.
OK, that's probably all. But wait!
There's more! According to
The Times of India , Becks is in training with wifey Posh to...wait for it...tour with the Spice Girls!
Seriously. He's training.
That doesn't mean he'll show up to spice up the tour.
But you know Vic will threaten divorce if he doesn't!
He could seriously quadruple the turnout at the reunion concerts! What do you think?
Do you want to see David Beckham shakin' his money maker while singing "Spice up your life!"??
