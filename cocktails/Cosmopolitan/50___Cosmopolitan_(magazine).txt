پوستر تبلیغاتی
عنوان سریال به تناسب نام این شخصیت انتخاب شده، اگر چه شباهت ظریفی با عنوان کتاب
آناتومی گری
نوشتهٔ
هنری گری
(منبع مشهور علم
آناتومی ) دارد. پس از شروع پخش این سریال، اعلام شد که نام اصلی آن تغییر خواهد کرد، ولی این اتفاق تاکنون رخ نداده‌است. [۱]
در سه فصل اول مجموعه تلویزیونی، رابطه‌های عاطفی مختلفی بین شخصیت‌های سریال و به طور خاص بین استادها و دانشجویان پیش آمد. در پایان فصل سوم،
مردیت گری
و دوستانش در امتحان جامع پایان دوره
انترنی
(کارورزی) شرکت کردند تا در صورت قبولی
رزیدنت
(دستیار) جراحی عمومی بشوند. در فصل چهارم این مجموعه به دلیل
اعتصاب فیلم نامه نویسان
در میانه نیمه کاره رها شد؛ این فصل به نوعی بدترین فصل این سریال از نظر تعداد بینندگان با ۱۵٫۹ میلیون نفر بیننده در رده هشتم است.
در نظر سنجی که مؤسسه «نلسون مدیا ریسرچ» در سال ۲۰۱۰ انجام داد این سریال به عنوان پربیننده‌ترین سریال تلویزیونی آمریکا انتخاب شد. [۲]
درمانگاه خصوصی [ ویرایش ]
نوشتار اصلی:
درمانگاه خصوصی (مجموعه تلویزیونی)
در سپتامبر ۲۰۰۷ پخش مجموعه تلویزیونی مرتبط دیگری به نام
درمانگاه خصوصی
(به
انگلیسی :
Private Practice ) که توسط تیم مشترکی ساخته می‌شود آغاز شد. داستان این مجموعه تلویزیونی در واقع دنباله یکی از چند داستانی است که در مجموعه تلویزیونی آناتومی گری به آن پرداخته شده بود. بخشی از شخصیت‌های مجموعه تلویزیونی درمانگاه خصوصی، قبلاً در مجموعه تلویزیونی آناتومی گری معرفی شده بودند. شخصیت اصلی این مجموعه تلویزیونی، خانم دکتر آدیسون مونتگمری است که متخصص زنان و زایمان است. این شخصیت (و بازیگر آن) در سه فصل اول آناتومی گری نقشی با اهمیت داشتند، اما در پایان فصل سوم آناتومی گری، به واسطه اتفاق‌هایی آدیسون مونتگمری تصمیم می‌گیرد از سیاتل به
لس‌آنجلس
برود و در یک درمانگاه خصوصی که توسط دوستانش اداره می‌شود کار کند؛ همین موضوع آغازگر مجموعه تلویزیونی
درمانگاه خصوصی
می‌شود.
بازیگران و فصل‌ها [ ویرایش ]
این سریال بر روی زندگی کارآموزان پزشکی، رزیدنت‌های جراحی و پزشکان مختلف تمرکز دارد. تولیدکنندگان این سریال سعی کرده‌اند که بازیگران از نظر نژادی مختلف باشند و تلاش کردند تا هیچ‌کدام از نظر نژادی برتر نشان داده نشوند. پنج شخصیتی که ابتدا به عنوان انترن معرفی می‌شوند عبارتند از:
مردیت گری
( الن پامپئو )،
الکس کارو
( جاستین چمبرز )،
جورج اومالی
( تی آر نایت )،
ایزی استیونس
( کاترین هیگل ) و
کریستینا یانگ
( ساندرا اوه ). ابتدا
میراندا بیلی
( چاندرا ویلسون ) که یک
جراح
عمومی است سرپرست آن‌هاست. سرپرست کل بخش جراجی
ریچارد وبر
( جیمز پیکنز جی آر ) است که زمانی که مردیت خردسال بوده با مادرش رابطه داشته‌است. به همین دلیل مشکلاتی با مردیت دارد.
درک شپرد
( پاتریک دمپسی ) و
پرستون برک
( ایسایا واشنگتن ) نیز جراحان تخصصی این بخش هستند. دکتر شپرد در جراحی مغز و اعصاب تخصص دارد و دکتر برک در جراحی قلب. همچنین شپرد روابط عاشقانه‌ای با مردیت دارد و دکتر برک نیز با کریستینا رابطه دارد.
فصل اول [ ویرایش ]
فصل اول این سریال حول ورود انترنها به بیمارستان و آشنایی آنان با یکدیگر و قوانین بیمارستان است.
فصل دوم [ ویرایش ]
در ابتدای فصل دوم سریال،
آدیسون مونتگمری
( کیت والش )،
مارک اسلون
( اریک دانی ) و
کالی تورس
( سارا رامیرز ) که به ترتیب پزشک زنان و زایمان، جراح پلاستیک و جراح ارتوپد هستند به این تیم اضافه می‌شوند. بعدها آدیسون مونتگومری این بیمارستان را ترک می‌کند که خود سرآغاز سریال
درمانگاه خصوصی
می‌باشد.
فصل سوم [ ویرایش ]
در فصل سوم، مادر مردیت به صورت ناگهانی فوت می‌کند و پرستون برک نیز کریستینا را ترک می‌کند. درادامه جورج وکارلی تورس باهم ازدواج می‌کنند اماپس از مدتی جورج به سبب خوردن مشروب بیش از اندازه با ایزی به کارلی خیانت کرده وبا ایزی رابطهٔ جنسی برقرار می‌کند و وارد رابطه‌ای عاطفی با ایزابل استیونس می‌شود.
فصل چهارم [ ویرایش ]
در فصل چهارم
لکسی گری
( چیلر لای ) به عنوان خواهر ناتنی و کوچک‌تر مردیت که رزیدنت جراحی نیز هست، معرفی می‌شود.
اریکا هان
( بروک اسمیت ) که یک جراح قلب است به این بیمارستان می‌آید و روابط عاشقانه‌ای با کالی تورس برقرار می‌کند. او در پایان فصل چهارم از این بیمارستان می‌رود. در فصل پنجم
اوون هانت
( کوین مک‌کید ) و
آریزونا رابینس
( جسیکا کاپشو ) که به بیمارستان می‌آیند.
فصل پنجم [ ویرایش ]
جورج اومالی
در پایان فصل پنجم می‌میرد و
ایزی استیونس
به تومور مغزی مبتلا می‌شود. از این رو
تدی آلتمن
( کیم راور ) به عنوان جراح قلب به تیم اضافه می‌شود.
فصل ششم [ ویرایش ]
در این فصل جورج اومالی حضور ندارد و رزیدنت‌های بیشتری به مجموعه به علت ادغام بیمارستانشان با بیمارستان مرسی وست افزوده می‌شوند.
این فصل بیشتر بر مرگ جورج اومالی، ترقی تورس و بیلی در میان جراحان، اعتیاد به الکل وبر، ادغام با بیمارستان مرسی وست، برهم خوردن ازدواج آلکس و ایزی و خروج
ایزی
از سریال و ریاست موقت دکتر شپرد تمرکز دارد. فصل زمانی بسته می‌شود که همسر عزادار یکی از بیماران اقدام به شلیک گلوله به دکترها هنگامی که دنبال اهداف خود یعنی لکسی، شپرد و وبر می‌گردد، می‌کند. پایان فصل با ستیز شپرد و آلکس برای زندگیشان بعد از شلیک می‌باشد.
فصل هفتم [ ویرایش ]
نوشتار اصلی:
آناتومی گری (فصل ۷)
شروع فصل هفتم به شدت تحت تأثیر حادثه تیر اندازی است. کریستینا تصمیم می‌گیرد دکتری را کنار بگذارد زیرا از آن حادثه صدمات روحی شدیدی خورده. در این فصل کریستینا و اون باهم عروسی می‌کنند. مردیت با دستکاری در تحقیقات دکتر شپرد زمینه را برای دستیابی همسر دکتر وبر به داروی آزمایشی درمان آلزایمر فراهم می‌کند. اما الکس کارو یک شب که مست است همه چیز را لو می‌دهد. نام شپرد به لیست سیاه اف دی ای می‌رود. در این فصل آریزونا رابینز و کالی تورس باهم عروسی می‌کنند. در این فصل کالی تورس صاحب یک دختر به نام سوفیا می‌شود؛ و همچنین درک و مردیت یک کودک آفریقایی بنام زولا را به فرزند خواندگی قبول می‌کنند. گفتنی است که در این فصل ریاست بیمارستان سیاتل گریز مرسی وست به دلیل استعفای دکتر شپرد از ریاست، به دکتر ریچارد وبر بازمی‌گردد.
فصل هشتم [ ویرایش ]
فصل هشتم حول رابطه بد مردیت و شپرد به دلیل دستکاری مردیت در تحقیقات دکتر شپرد آغاز می‌شود. ابتدا مردیت توسط دکتر وبر اخراج می‌شود اما بعدها دوباره بازمیگردد. در این فصل دکتر وبر از ریاست کناره گیری می‌کند و ریاست به دکتر آون هانت می‌رسد. در طول این فصل رابطه مردیت و شپرد عادی می‌شود. در انتهای این فصل مشخص می‌شود که آون هانت به همسرش کریستینا خیانت کرده و یک رابطه پنهانی داشته است بنابر این کریستینا از او بیزار می‌شود. در قسمتهای پایانی این فصل امتحان بورد تخصصی دکترها انجام می‌شود که تمامی دکترهای بیمارستان سیاتل گریز مرسی وست قبول می‌شوند به جز دکتر آوریل کپنر. در قسمت پایانی این فصل یک حادثه سقوط هواپیمای دکترها رخ می‌دهد که در طی آن دکتر لکسی گری کشته می‌شود و دکتر مارک اسلون به شدت زخمی می‌شود.
فصل نهم [ ویرایش ]
کریستینا که از آون هانت جدا شده در این فصل به بیمارستانی دیگر رفته است ولی هنوز هم با مردیت از طریق اینترنت رابطه دارد. شپرد در حادثه هواپیما از ناحیه دست صدمه دیده و موقتاً نمی‌تواند عمل کند. مارک اسلون که در حادثه سقوط هواپیما بسیار آسیب دیده بود سرانجام پس از مدتها بیهوشی روی تخت بیمارستان می‌میرد. همچنین دکتر آریزونا رابنیز یک پای خود را در این حادثه از دست داده است. به مرور زمان و البته با سختی‌های زیاد تمام این بدبختی‌ها فراموش می‌شود به طوری که در قسمتهای پایانی روابط به حالت اول خود بازمیگردد. در پایان فصل دکتر ریچارد وبر دچار حادثه برقگرفتگی می‌شود.
فصل دهم [ ویرایش ]
فصل دهم این سریال در دست تهیه و تولید است و قرار است روز ۲۶ سپتامبر سال ۲۰۱۳ مطابق با ۴ مهر ماه سال ۱۳۹۲ از شبکه‌ای بی سی آمریکا پخش شود. در تاریخ سوم مهرماه ۹۲ صفحه فیسبوک اصلی این سریال اقدام به پخش تیزر فصل دهم نمود.
تصویری از ابتدای هر قسمت سریال
فصل یازدهم [ ویرایش ]
فصل یازدهم همانند سایر فصلها پیرامون مشکلات زندگی و کار و روابط و غیره می‌پردازد. نکته بسیار قابل توجه در این فصل مرگ دکتر شپرد می‌باشد. اگرچه که در قسمتی که درک شپرد دار فانی را وداع می‌گوید از او یک قهرمان همیشگی در ذهن‌ها باقی می‌ماند که بخاطر نجات جان مردم زندگی اش را فدا کرد ولی مسلماً نمی‌تواند رضایت علاقمندان به این سریال را همراه داشته باشد. بعد از قطعی شدن ترک پاتریک دمپسی (درک شپرد) هوادارن این سریال بسیار نا امید شدند و مراتب نا امیدی خود از شوندا ریمز و سایر عوامل سریال شدیداً اعلام کردند. تا آنجا که شبکه‌ای بی سی از احتمال کنسل شدن همیشگی سریال گریز آناتومی به دلیل مرگ دکتر شپرد سخن گفت. اما در ۸ می سال ۲۰۱۵ کوین مک کید (ایفاگر نقش دکتر هانت و کارگردان بسیاری از قسمتهای سریال) خبر از آماده شدن برای تولید فصل ۱۲ سریال داد. همچنین اکنون سخنانی مبنی بر اینکه احتمال دارد به دلیل واکنش منفی بی‌سابقه طرفداران سریال شاهد این باشیم که درک شپرد به مجموعه بازمیگردد. در حقیقت شوندا ریمز در برابر فشارها اعلام کرد که درک را کشته است تا در قسمتها آینده نحوه کنار آمدن مردیت با آن را به تصویر بکشد و می‌خواهد سریالی نو و جاری داشته باشد تا یک سریال کلیشه‌ای.
فصل دوازدهم [ ویرایش ]
طبق وعده شبکه‌ای بی سی و همچنین اعلام رسمی وبسایت و فیسبوک این سریال، قرار است در ماه سپتامبر فصل دوازدهم این سریال پخش شود. وبسایت‌های مرتبط با این سریال از احتمال بازگشت دکتر یانگ با بازی ساندرا اوه به سریال خبر داده‌اند.
شاندا ریمز
اشاره کرده که تعداد بازیگران این مجموعه بسیار زیاد شده و فعلاً بازیگر جدیدی به مجموعه اضافه نخواهد شد. [۳]

بازیگرانی که مجموعه را ترک کردند [ ویرایش ]
ایسایا واشنگتن [ ویرایش ]
در اکتبر ۲۰۰۶، بر سر صحنهٔ فیلم‌برداری واشنگتن به خاطر همجنسگرا بودن
تی آر نایت
به او توهین کرد. بعد نایت همجنسگرا بودنش را در رسانه‌ها فاش کرد. سپس
اتحادیه جلوگیری از توهین به همجنسگرایان
از واشنگتن خواست تا عذرخواهی کند. [۴]
در ۷ جون ۲۰۰۷، شبکه
ای‌بی‌سی
اعلام کرد که تصمیم گرفته تا قرارداد واشنگتن را تمدید نکند. [۵]
واشنگتن اعلام کرد که از این تصمیم شبکه «متأسف» شده‌است. او گفت اگر از او می‌خواستند تا نقش کوچکی در سریال ایفا کند، او این کار را می‌کرد. [۶]
در قسمتی از این سریال که در تاریخ ۹ می ۲۰۰۸ پخش شد، از عکس وی استفاده شد. بعد از روی آنتن رفتن این قسمت، پیتر نلسون وکیل مدافع واشنگتن به
ای‌بی‌سی
و
اس‌ای‌جی
اعلام کرد که این کار آن‌ها غیرقانونی بوده‌است. هاوارد براگمن، ناشر وی به خبرنگاران گفت: «آن‌ها حق داشتند تا از نام و یاد این شخصیت در سریال استفاده کنند، ولی نمی‌توانستند عکس او را نشان بدهند» و ادامه داد که این مسئله، به صورت مالی حل خواهد شد. [۷]
بروک اسمیت [ ویرایش ]
در ۳ نوامبر ۲۰۰۸ اعلام شد که وی این مجموعه را ترک خواهد کرد. شاندا ریمز بعداً توضیح داد که "متأسفانه ما تا همین الآن هم با سحر و جادو برای نقش او نوشتیم و این شخصیت زیاد نمی‌تواند در آناتومی گری بماند". برخی گمانه‌زنی‌ها مبنی بر این بود که به‌خاطر همجنسگرا بودن شخصیت اریکا هان، او این مجموعه را ترک کرده، ولی او خودش بعداً توضیح داد که "اتفاقاً از این که او هم‌جنسگرا بوده خیلی خوشحال شده و از این که از مجموعه کنار گذاشته شده، خیلی شوکه شده‌است." [۸]
تی آر نایت [ ویرایش ]
در ۲۷ می ۲۰۰۹
ای! آنلاین
اعلام کرد که
تی آر نایت
دیگر در فصل ششم آناتومی گری بازی نمی‌کند. نایت به خاطر عدم پیشرفت شخصیتش و این که در سریال کم‌تر به کار گرفته می‌شد، ناراحت شده و قراردادش را با شبکه فسخ کرده‌است. [۹]
هواداران حدس می‌زدند که به خاطر آسیب شدیدی که در پایان فصل به صورت وی وارد شد، بازیگر دیگری جایگزین وی خواهد شد؛ ولی پتی لی سردبیر روزنامه
نیویورک تایمز
اعلام کرد که دکتر جرج اومالی مرده‌است. بعد از آن در ۱۷ جون ۲۰۰۹ این خبر به طور رسمی تأیید شد. [۱۰]
کاترین هیگل [ ویرایش ]
در ۱۱ مارس ۲۰۱۰ گزارش شد که کاترین هیگل دیگر به آناتومی گری بازنمی‌گردد. قسمتی که در ۲۱ ژانویه ۲۰۱۰ پخش شد، آخرین حضور شخصیت ایزی در این سریال بود. سپس او در ۲۴ مارس ۲۰۱۰ به طور رسمی از این مجموعه خارج شد. او دلیل این تصمیمش را «تمرکز روی خانواده و فرزندش» اعلام کرد. [۱۱]

Production and development
Conception
Shonda Rhimes , the series' creator, wanted to make a show that she would enjoy watching, [ 2 ]
and thought it would be interesting to create a show about "smart women competing against one another". [ 3 ]
When asked how she decided to develop a
medical drama , Rhimes responded:
“
I was obsessed with the surgery channels. [...] My sisters and I would call each other up and talk about operations we'd seen on the Discovery Channel. There's something fascinating about the medical world—you see things you'd never imagine, like the fact that doctors talk about their boyfriends or their day while they're cutting somebody open. So when ABC asked me to write another pilot, the [operating room] seemed like the natural setting. [ 4 ]
”
The series was pitched to the ABC, who gave the
green light , and the show was picked up as a
mid-season replacement
for
Boston Legal
in the
2005 television season . [ 5 ]
Francie Calfo , executive vice president of development at ABC Entertainment, commented that ABC was looking for a medical show that was unlike the others airing at the time. She pointed out that “[m]edical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, [Rhimes] found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it." [ 3 ]
" ER
is high-speed medicine. The camera flies around, adrenaline is rushing. My show is more personal. The idea for the series began when a doctor told me it was incredibly hard to shave her legs in the hospital shower. At first that seemed like a silly detail. But then I thought about the fact that it was the only time and place this woman might have to shave her legs. That's how hard the work is."
— Rhimes on the creation of
Grey's Anatomy [ 4 ]
Rhimes initially conceived
Grey's Anatomy
as a statement against racism. She endeavored to create a show that featured a racially diverse cast that allowed viewers to relate to characters regardless of race. [ 6 ]
While creating characters, as well as writing the first script, the series' writers had no character descriptions in mind, and hoped to cast the best actor available for each part. Rhimes has explained that if the network did not allow her to create characters this way, she would have been hesitant about moving forward with the series. [ 4 ]
Female roles in particular were developed as multi-faceted characters. Rhimes offered her insight on this: "I wanted to create a world in which you felt as if you were watching very real women. Most of the women I saw on TV didn't seem like people I actually knew. They felt like ideas of what women are. They never got to be nasty or competitive or hungry or angry. They were often just the loving wife or the nice friend. But who gets to be the bitch? Who gets to be the three-dimensional woman?" [ 4 ]
Before the series debuted on March 27, 2005, there were a few early releases to close friends and family of the producers and actors. The show was scheduled to run in the
Boston Legal
time slot for four weeks. However, high ratings and viewership led to it holding onto the slot for the remainder of the season. [ 3 ]
ABC Entertainment President, Steve McPherson, commented on the scheduling change: "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let [ Grey's Anatomy ] build on its tremendous momentum through May." [ 7 ]
The show's title,
Grey's Anatomy , was devised as a play on words: a reference to both
Henry Gray 's medical textbook,
Gray's Anatomy , and the title character
Dr. Meredith Grey
( Ellen Pompeo ). [ 8 ]
Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from
Grey's Anatomy
to
Complications , although ultimately this did not come to pass. [ 9 ]
Production team

List of Grey's Anatomy cast members
"She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say."
— Rhimes on Oh's audition [ 20 ]
Grey's Anatomy
uses a
color-blind casting
technique, resulting in a racially diverse ensemble. Each role is cast without the character's races being pre-determined, in keeping with Rhimes' vision of diversity. [ 21 ]
The production staff began casting with the program's titular character, Meredith Grey, [ 4 ]
which Rhimes stated was a difficult role to cast. [ 22 ]
"I kept saying we need a girl like that girl from
Moonlight Mile [a] ," said Rhimes, "and after a while, they were like, 'We think we can get that girl from
Moonlight Mile ." [ 22 ]
The next to be cast,
Sandra Oh
( Dr. Cristina Yang ), was initially invited to audition for the character of Bailey, but pressed to read for the role of Cristina instead. [ 23 ]
Many actors read for the role of
Dr. Derek Shepherd , but when
Patrick Dempsey
read for the part, "he was just perfect", according to Rhimes. [ 22 ]
The only character developed with a racial description in mind was
Dr. Miranda Bailey , who is portrayed by Chandra Wilson. The character was written as a tiny blonde with curly hair, but when Wilson began speaking, Rhimes reported: "[Wilson] is exactly who Miranda is." [ 4 ]
James Pickens Jr.
was selected to appear as
Dr. Richard Webber
in the series'
pilot
and
first season . [ 24 ]
Katherine Heigl
wanted to portray
Dr. Izzie Stevens
as a brunette, but was requested to retain her natural blonde for the part. [ 25 ]
Isaiah Washington , who portrayed
Dr. Preston Burke , initially read for the role of Shepherd, but was cast as Burke, because the original actor to play Burke had to withdraw. [ 21 ]
T. R. Knight
signed on for the pilot as
Dr. George O'Malley , expecting that the role might be short-lived, because he liked that the character was multi-faceted. [ 26 ]
Rounding out the season one cast was
Justin Chambers
as
Dr. Alex Karev . [ 27 ]
Eric Dane
originally auditioned for the
pilot episode
of
Grey's Anatomy , but did not receive a role.
The second season marked the introduction of
Eric Dane
( Dr. Mark Sloan ) and
Sara Ramirez
( Dr. Callie Torres ). They were initially cast as recurring characters, but both were given star billing at the opening of the
third season . [ 28 ] [ 29 ]
Ramirez was cast after ABC executives offered her a role in the network show of her choice, [ 30 ]
Dane had previously auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in the pilot episode. [ 29 ]
Kate Walsh
( Dr. Addison Montgomery ) also joined the show in season two, after making a guest appearance in season one. [ 31 ]
In October 2006, Washington allegedly insulted Knight with a homophobic slur, during an on-set altercation with Dempsey, and ABC terminated Washington's contract at the end of the third season. [ 32 ]
Washington also made a guest appearance in season 10. At the conclusion of the third season, Walsh also departed the show to pursue the
Grey's Anatomy
spin-off,
Private Practice , but continues to make guest appearances. [ 33 ]
Chyler Leigh
joined the cast as a main character in the
fourth season
as ( Dr. Lexie Grey ); Lexie had appeared as a guest star in the final two episodes of the third season. [ 34 ]
On the selection of Leigh for the role of Lexie, Rhimes said: "Chyler stood out...It felt like she could be Meredith's sister, but she had a depth that was very interesting." [ 35 ]
Brooke Smith
( Dr. Erica Hahn ), who first appeared on
Grey's Anatomy
in the second season, became a series regular in the fourth. [ 36 ]
Shortly after the announcement that Smith would be a regular member of the cast,
Entertainment Weekly ‍‍ '​‍s
Michael Ausiello , reported that her character, Hahn, would depart from
Grey's Anatomy
on November 6, 2008. [ 37 ]
E! Online ‍‍ '​‍s
Kristin Dos Santos
asserted that Smith's dismissal from the show had been forced by the ABC network, as part of an attempt to "de-gay"
Grey's Anatomy , [ 38 ]
but Rhimes countered these claims, saying that "we did not find that the magic and chemistry with Brooke's character would sustain in the long run". [ 37 ]
Season five
introduced actor
Kevin McKidd
( Dr. Owen Hunt ), who was signed as a series regular after originally being cast for a specific story arc. [ 39 ]
In addition,
Jessica Capshaw
( Dr. Arizona Robbins ) was originally introduced for a three episode arc, but received a contract extension until the end of the season and then became a series regular in the
sixth season . [ 40 ]
Knight departed the show at the conclusion of season five, citing an unhappiness with the development and lack of screen time for his character. [ 41 ]
Directly following Knight's departure, it was reported by
Entertainment Weekly
that Heigl had not returned to the set as scheduled after her maternity leave, [ 42 ]
and it was later confirmed that Heigl would not return to the show at all. [ 43 ]
Kim Raver , who was cast as recurring character
Dr. Teddy Altman
in the sixth season, was given star billing later in the season. [ 44 ]
Sarah Drew
( Dr. April Kepner ) and
Jesse Williams
( Dr. Jackson Avery ), who both made their series debuts as recurring characters in the sixth season, received star billing in the
seventh . [ 45 ] [ 46 ]
The six original actors' contracts expired after season eight, but in May 2012, Pompeo, Oh, Dempsey, Chambers, Wilson, and Pickens renewed their contracts with the show for another two years. [ 47 ]
At the conclusion of the eighth season, Leigh's character departed from the show at Leigh's request, and with Rhimes' agreement. [ 48 ] [ 49 ]
Raver's character was also written out of the show during the season eight finale, and Rhimes stated that Raver was offered a contract renewal, but declined. [ 50 ]
In July 2012, Dane confirmed that he was departing the show to pursue other projects; he made his final appearances in the first two episodes of the
ninth season . [ 51 ]
With the start of season 10, Camilla Luddington, Jerrika Hinton, Gaius Charles & Tessa Ferrer were introduced to the show as series regulars. They were first introduced to the show in season 9 as new interns. On August 13, 2013, Oh announced that the show's tenth season would be her final season. [ 52 ] [ 53 ]
On March 2014 it was announced that Isaiah Washington, who portrayed Preston Burke in the first three seasons of the show, would make a guest appearance to coincide with the departure of series regular Sandra Oh, his former on-screen love interest. [ 54 ]
As of March 25, 2014, both Charles and Ferrer's contracts were not renewed for season 11. [ 55 ]
On May 2, 2014 it was announced that, in addition to Pompeo and Dempsey, all original remaining cast members — aside from Sandra Oh — signed two years deals, extending their contracts through seasons 11 and 12. Despite joining the series in its second season, Sara Ramirez is on the same negotiation schedule as the first season cast and has also inked a new two-year deal.
Filming locations and technique
The Space Needle, in Seattle, is the background to many exterior shots.
Rhimes considered setting the medical drama in her hometown,
Chicago , but eventually decided to go with Seattle, to distinguish
Grey's Anatomy
from the Chicago–based
ER . [ 22 ]
Fisher Plaza, which is the headquarters building of
Fisher Communications
and Fisher's ABC affiliated
KOMO
radio and television stations in
Seattle , is used for some exterior shots of Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital. In particular,
air ambulances
land on the
KOMO-TV
newscopter's helipad. This suggests the hospital is close to the
Space Needle
(which is directly across the street from Fisher Plaza), the
Seattle Monorail , and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and a few interior shots is not in Seattle; these scenes are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in
North Hills , California. [ 56 ]
Most scenes are taped at Prospect Studios in
Los Feliz , just east of
Hollywood , where the
Grey's Anatomy
set occupies six sound stages. Some outside scenes are shot at the
Warren G. Magnuson Park
in Seattle. Several props used are working medical equipment, including the
MRI machine . [ 57 ]
When asked about operating room scenes, Sarah Drew offered this:
We work with Bovine organs, which is cow's organs. The smell is repulsive and makes us all gag. And we use an actual soldering tool to solder the organs. It smells like burning flesh. There's also a lot of silicone and blood matter, red jello mixed with blood and chicken fat. It's pretty gross. [ 58 ]
Costumes are used to differentiate between
attending surgeons , who wear navy blue
scrubs , and
residents , who wear light blue scrubs. [ 59 ]
The series is filmed with a
single-camera setup , as are many dramas. [ 60 ]
Grey's Anatomy
is often filmed using the " walk and talk " filming technique, [ 61 ]
popularized on television by series such as
St. Elsewhere ,
ER , and
The West Wing . [ 62 ]
Series synopsis
Overview
Title screen
Grey‍ '​s Anatomy
follows the lives of
surgical interns
and residents at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (formerly Seattle Grace Hospital, Season 1–6, Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Season 6–9, and then Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital, Season 9–present), as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, with the help of their competent mentors. Every installment, typically, commences with a voice-over narrative from Meredith Grey or a season regular, foreshadowing the
theme
of the episode. [ 63 ] [ unreliable source? ]
Each season tends to represent the physicians' academic year, with each completed year qualifying the residents at a level higher in the surgical field. [ 64 ]
The season will always end with a finale, typically involving a tragic event such as a death or character departure. [ 65 ]
Most installments revolve around the doctors' everyday lives as surgeons, but the show puts an emphasis on their personal, rather than professional, lives. [ 63 ]
The series sets aside medical ethics concerns to focus on character development and relationships. Although the physicians treat the illnesses of their patients, often through complex surgeries, their primary motivation is customarily praise and competition. [ 66 ]
The residents initially arrive at the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient. [ 67 ]
A hospital superior is in charge of assigning cases, often traversing to tense feelings between the residents and superiors. [ 68 ]
Episodes migrate back and forth from the doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor
diagnoses
the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. [ 69 ]
The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. [ 70 ]
The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an
indie rock
background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. [ 71 ]
At the conclusion of each episode, Meredith delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on her initial one. [ 63 ] [ unreliable source? ]

The five characters who are first introduced in the series premiere, as surgical interns, are Grey, Karev, O'Malley, Stevens, and Yang. [ 73 ]
They are initially mentored by Bailey, a senior resident who becomes the hospital's Chief Resident, [ 74 ]
and later an attending
general surgeon , in season six. [ 75 ]
The surgical program is initially headed by the Chief of Surgery, Webber, who has a preexisting personal relationship with Meredith, having had an affair with her mother when she was a child. In Webber's employ are attending neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd, dubbed 'McDreamy' by the residents, and attending cardiothoracic surgeon Preston Burke. Shepherd is introduced as Meredith's love interest, while Burke begins a relationship with Yang. [ 76 ]
Introduced in the show's second season are
obstetrician-gynecologist
and
neonatal surgeon , Montgomery, [ 77 ]
plastic surgeon
Sloan (nicknamed 'McSteamy' by the interns), from New York, [ 78 ]
and
orthopedic surgeon
Torres. [ 79 ]
Montgomery is Shepherd's wife who arrives in Seattle seeking reconciliation with him, [ 80 ]
Sloan is Shepherd's former best friend, who aided the breakdown of his marriage by having an affair with Montgomery, [ 81 ]
while Torres is introduced as a love-interest, and eventual wife for O'Malley. The penultimate episode of season three introduces Lexie, Meredith's half-sister who unexpectedly decides to pursue her internship at Seattle Grace Hospital after her mother's sudden death, and begins an on-again, off-again relationship with Sloan. [ 82 ]
Burke and Yang, having been engaged, [ 83 ]
endeavor to plan their wedding, while Montgomery departs the show at the conclusion of the third season, relocating to California, seeking a new life. The season three finale sees Burke's exit from the show, after leaving Yang at the altar on their wedding day. [ 84 ]
The original lead characters of
Grey's Anatomy
Grey, Yang, Karev, and Stevens are all promoted to residents, in the season four premiere, [ 85 ]
while O'Malley is forced to repeat his internship year, following his failing of the intern exam. [ 84 ]
Subsequently, Torres and O'Malley divorce one another, due to him having a sexual affair with Stevens, initially concealing it from Torres. [ 86 ] [ 87 ]
Early in the fourth season, cardiothoracic surgeon Hahn becomes Torres' love interest. [ 88 ]
During the fifth season, Hahn departs from the series, [ 89 ]
and O'Malley retakes his intern exam, passing, joining his fellow physicians as a resident. [ 90 ]
Two new characters are introduced: former United States Army
trauma surgeon
Owen Hunt, [ 91 ]
and
pediatric surgeon
Arizona Robbins. [ 92 ]
Hunt becomes a love-interest for Yang, [ 93 ]
while Robbins becomes a love-interest for Torres. [ 94 ]
When Stevens is diagnosed with stage four
metastatic
melanoma , [ 95 ]
she and Karev wed one another at the conclusion of the fifth season. [ 96 ]
In addition, Meredith and Shepherd marry, with their vows written on a post-it note. [ 97 ]
O'Malley dies in the premiere of the sixth season, due to injuries sustained by being hit by a bus, [ 75 ]
and Stevens later departs Seattle after being diagnosed with cancer and following a lack of communication between her then husband Alex Karev following the Seattle Grace merger with Mercy West. [ 70 ]
Several new characters are introduced as Seattle Grace Hospital merges with Mercy West. [ 98 ]
Residents April Kepner and Jackson Avery both transfer to Seattle Grace Hospital from Mercy West, and the latter entertains a brief relationship with Lexie Grey, until she reunites with Mark Sloan. [ 99 ]
Subsequently, Teddy Altman is introduced as the new Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery. [ 100 ]
In the
season six finale , a deceased patient's grieving husband embarks on a shooting spree at the hospital, injuring Karev, Shepherd, and Hunt, and killing residents Charles Percy and Reed Adamson. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]
In the shooting's emotional reverberations, Hunt and Yang abruptly marry, not wanting to risk separation. [ 103 ]
Torres and Robbins eventually wed, officiated by Bailey. [ 104 ]
In season eight, Webber steps down and allocates his job to Hunt. [ 105 ]
As the final year of residency for Meredith, Yang, Karev, Avery, and Kepner is coming to a close, the doctors are all planning to relocate to different hospitals to pursue their specialty careers. [ 106 ]
However, all plans are put on hold when several doctors from Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital are engaged in a plane crash, which kills Lexie and endangers Meredith, Shepherd, Yang, Robbins, and Sloan. [ 65 ]
At the conclusion of the eighth season, Altman is courteously fired by Hunt as she struggles to decide whether or not to take the job as Chief at
United States Army Medical Command
(MEDCOM). [ 65 ]
In the season nine premiere, Sloan dies due to sustained injuries from the plane crash following a brief relapse of temporary health (the surge). And the remaining characters work through their post traumatic stress and Arizona Robbins' loss of limb by way of suing Seattle Grace Mercy West as the hospital was responsible for putting the surgeons on the plane. The season continues with the struggle of the lawsuit and the animosity that creates within the hospital in addition to relationship strains focusing on the Robbins/Torres and Yang/Hunt situations.

Reception
Critical response
Grey's Anatomy
has been well received among critics. The show holds a average of 74% positive score on
Rotten Tomatoes
and 7.7/10 score at
IMDB
site. [ 163 ]
The A.V. Club
gave an insight on both the overwhelming success and lows in the quality of the hit medical drama saying, "The quality arc for the show is all over the place, starting with a steady build in the
first season , then skyrocketing into phenomenon in
season two , then leveling off and dipping in
season three , before having some seriously bumpy moments in
seasons four
(interrupted by the writers’ strike) and
five . The climb begins again in
season six " [ 164 ]
Samantha Highfill of
Entertainment Weekly
in a review wrote, " I believe the show’s best season to date is
season 2 . Let me make it clear that I’m not saying seasons 3 through 9 were bad. In my opinion, there have only been a few lulls in the show’s history, and most of them didn’t last a full season." adding, "I still enjoy the show, and I’ll honestly never stop watching. By any standards,
Grey’s Anatomy
has been successful television, ranking highly in the ratings for nine seasons and entering the cultural lexicon via phrases as cloying yet catchy as “McDreamy.”, the show has had its periods of being intensely irritating, and it has had its periods when it seems as if
Shonda Rhimes
has taken leave of her faculties, but it’s also got an amazingly high batting average, particularly with every solid season that passes along in this second act of its run." The site lauded the show saying, "On average, it’s been very good TV, filled with interesting, driven characters who run the gamut of professions within the show’s hospital setting. It’s been, by turns, a good
soap , a good
romantic comedy , a good
medical drama , and a good interpersonal show about an unexpected workplace family." [ 165 ]
"Grey’s Anatomy offers a different and perhaps more valuable idea of what it means to be strong: the capacity to suffer terribly, break down completely, and then get up again, confident that you’re bigger than the sum of the tragedies you’ve suffered—because everyone else is, too. The layers of history have grown pretty dense and rich, and the friendships that form around them as the characters suffer and survive is the glue of the series, and what—despite a few inevitable hit-or-miss patches—elevates it to something special."- Laura Hudson of
Wired [ 166 ]
The first season received positive reviews which steadily built up, with Gary Levin of
USA Today
calling
Grey's Anatomy
one of the top shows on television. [ 167 ]
New York Daily News
named Grey's Anatomy a "winner", whereas
Newsday
expressed a positive opinion by stating "You simply can't stop watching."
The Washington Post ‍‍ '​‍s Tom Shales was critical of season one, finding it reminiscent of
ER
and commenting that: "The show is much more a matter of commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different." [ 168 ]
Shortly after its initial airing, the
Chicago Tribune ‍‍ '​‍s Maureen Ryan called
Grey's Anatomy
the new
Friends ; a concluded
National Broadcasting Company
(NBC) sitcom following the lives of a group of young adults, that all of its ten-year run in the top-five for viewer ratings. [ 2 ]
The second season received critical acclaim, top critics like Todd VanDerWerff of
The A.V. Club
called the show a "phenomenon" not just TV adding the show was, "one of the best TV shows around", Samantha Highfill of
Entertainment Weekly
later during the tenth season called the second "the show’s best season to date" however, Kevin Carr of
7M Pictures
opined that
Grey's Anatomy
is a mere combination of
Scrubs ,
ER ,
Sex and the City , and
The Love Boat . [ 169 ]
It further garnered positive reviews, Christopher Monfette of
IGN Entertainment
added: "The second season of this medical drama expertly wove its signature elements of complex relationships, whimsical banter and challenging life-lessons; all to a montage-fetish, indie-rock soundtrack." [ 170 ]
Todd Gilchrist also from
IGN
called the season "terrific" adding, "Indeed, one of the best currently on television. While it remains to be seen what the creators do with it, now that it's become an outright event program, the season demonstrates that Rhimes and co. know what to do with the opportunities presented them. whether you're male or female, this is the kind of entertainment that small-screen devotees and folks fed up with television need to see." [ 171 ]
Ellen Pompeo 's failure to garner a nomination at the
Emmy Awards
has been referred to as a snub on multiple occasions. [ 172 ]
The titular character of
Grey's Anatomy , Meredith, has received both overwhelmingly positive and weary feedback by critics along the course of the show, with the development of the character garnering praise from majority critics. Alessandra Stanley of
The New York Times
referring to her as "the heroine of
Grey's Anatomy ". [ 173 ]
BuddyTV
praised the distinct uniqueness in the character calling Meredith an "unconventional heroine" adding, "From the very beginning Meredith Grey has been an unconventional heroine. Neither black nor white but always...wait for it...many shades of grey, she has always been, even in her lighter moments, dark and twisty." [ 174 ]
When Pompeo did not receive an
Emmy
nomination for her work as Meredith, Mary McNamara of the
Los Angeles Times
suggested that Pompeo, "who has worked very hard and against all narrative odds to make Meredith Grey an interesting character", should have received a nomination at the
61st Primetime Emmy Awards , in 2009. [ 175 ]
IGN ‍‍ '​‍s Monfette, less impressed, criticized her storyline as "some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do." [ 170 ]
Robert Rorke of the
New York Post
was also critical of Meredith's role in the show, writing: "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, she's been a little dopey, what with the endless 'McDreamy' soliloquies." [ 176 ]
Glenn Diaz of
BuddyTV
commented that "You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy." The development of the character has received praise from critics. Reviewing the first part of the eighth season, TV Fanatic wrote: "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the
heart and soul
of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman. Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season." Rick Porter reviewing the episode
How to Save a Life
from the
eleventh season
for
Zap2it
wrote, "Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, "How to Save a Life" would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode, the likes of which the show has done several times before. He added. "How to Save a Life" may not be the ideal
Emmy-submission
episode for Ellen Pompeo, considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it. But it's among the best work she's ever done on the show." [ 177 ]
Janalen Samson of
BuddyTV
lauded the Meredith's development throughout the series saying, "When one considers how this character has grown over eleven seasons, it really is amazing. Kudos to Ellen Pompeo for her fine work. She's actually done the impossible, because I actually care what happens to Meredith Grey." [ 174 ]
Reviewing the season 12 premiere
Sledgehammer
critics including Alex Hawkins of the
Western Gazette
again highlighted Pompeo's due for an
Emmy Award .
The majority of the supporting cast of
Grey's Anatomy
have been well received as well, with the
New York Post ‍‍ '​‍s Rorke deeming Stevens to be "the heart and soul" of
Grey's Anatomy , whereas Eyder Peralta of the
Houston Chronicle
was critical of her character development, stating: "[She's] the reason I don't watch
Grey's Anatomy
anymore." [ 178 ]
Kelli Catana of
The Huffington Post
named Yang "the best damn character" and deemed "the Meredith/Yang relationship the most true friendship on network television." [ 179 ]
Television Without Pity
writer Lauren Shotwell claimed Yang is "the only one of these five [residents] that regularly acts like an actual doctor". [ 180 ]
Analyzing
Alex Karev
Rachel Simon called him 'Underrated', she pointed out that Alex’s personal growth never seems to get acknowledged as "Alex has evolved, slowly and realistically, into a genuinely good person whose faults don’t miraculously disappear, but take a backseat to much better qualities." [ 181 ]
Robert Bianco of
USA Today
said Dempsey has a "seemingly effortless way of humanizing Derek's 'dreamy' appeal with ego and vanity". [ 182 ]
and his friendship with
Mark Sloan
has been well received Victor Balta said "they’ve demonstrated an easy chemistry that makes for some of the great comic relief around Seattle Grace Hospital." [ 183 ]
While
Addison Montgomery
was deemed "sassy and bright and interesting." [ 184 ]
TV Guide
said of Walsh's stint on
Grey's Anatomy : "She [Walsh] adds spice to an already hot show." [ 185 ]
ortho surgeon
Callie Torres
after receiving mixed views earlier was praised for her
Bisexual
storyline and critics further added that the character was anchored by stellar performance by
Sara Ramirez ..
Lexie Grey
initially being criticized became a critics a favorite in the series Keen of
The Trades
wrote, " Chyler Leigh , does a fantastic job of making the progression feel seamless. Lexie steals the show as one of the best characters on the series." [ 186 ]
With the departure of several cast members throughout the seasons, many new characters were added to the drama's ensemble. McKidd and Capshaw were referred to as "fresh additions" to the series, by Monfette of
IGN . [ 187 ]
In addition, Matt Roush of
TV Guide
commented: "Hunt/McKidd is the most encouraging thing to happen to
Grey's Anatomy
in quite a while." [ 188 ]
Matt Mitovich of
TV Guide
noted that Robbins "quickly established herself as a fan favorite", [ 189 ]
describing her as: "a breath of fresh air in the often angsty halls of Seattle Grace. [ 190 ]
On
April Kepner
and
Jackson Avery
Courtney Morrison of
TVFanatic
wrote "April has grown since her character was introduced. She’s no longer much less annoying than she used to be, and she’s honest. A girl with principles is a girl you want to do well." and described her and Avery as "a couple for whom viewers can root". Speaking of the new cast members, in addition to the remaining original, Robert Bianco from
USA Today
called them the show's "best ensemble in years". [ 191 ]
Regarding season three, Bill Carter of
The New York Times
called
Grey's Anatomy
"television's hottest show", adding: "[No show] is expected to challenge
Grey's Anatomy
for prime-time pre-eminence." [ 192 ]
Contrasting with Carter's view, Monfette of
IGN
said that it speedily found itself "mired in the annoying and absurd", adding: "This third season may very well represent a case of over-writing a concept that has, perhaps tragically, run bone-dry on narrative fuel." [ 170 ]
At the conclusion of season three,
Entertainment Weekly ‍‍ '​‍s Gregory Kirschling said "the show lacked a defining happy, warm-gooseflesh moment", adding that the season "didn't leave you dying for the [next] season premiere". [ 193 ]
Speaking of the fourth season, Laura Burrows of
IGN
said the series became "a little more than mediocre, but less than fantastic", adding: "This season proved that even strong chemistry and good acting cannot save a show that suffers from the inevitable recycled plot." [ 194 ]
In contrast to the moderately negative feedback the third and fourth seasons received,
Alan Sepinwall
of
The Star-Ledger
said of the fifth season: "Overall, it feels more like the good old days than
Grey's Anatomy
has in a long time." Misha Davenport from the
Chicago Sun-Times
said season five "hits on all the things the show does so well", adding: "There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears." [ 195 ]
Brian Lowry of
Variety , less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines. [ 196 ]
Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of
USA Today
wrote: " Grey's
has always loved grand gestures. You like them or you don't; the only real question is whether the show pulls them off or it doesn't. This year, it did." [ 197 ]
The series has a score of 66 out of 100 on
Metacritic , based on five reviews for season seven. [ 198 ]
In response to the season, Bianco from
USA Today
commented: "Happily, it now seems to have landed on solid ground." Also of the seventh season,
Entertainment Weekly ‍ '​s Jennifer Armstrong said: "It's in the shooting's emotional reverberations that the show is regenerating after the past few hit-and-miss seasons," whereas Verne Gay of
Newsday
commented: "Unfortunately, they've settled on far-too-easy and facile answers for the most part." [ 199 ]
HitFix
gave a positive review saying that, "season 7 overall has been one of the show's strongest ever." and added, "There was a time when
Grey's Anatomy
was this show where I suffered through a lot of stuff that made me cringe to get to those genius melodrama moments it could do so well. Over the last couple of years, it's evolved into a show that's much more consistent in tone, where it may not move me as often as it did in the early years but also very rarely makes me question my reasons for watching."
[ 200 ]
Speaking of season eight,
Entertainment Weekly ‍‍ '​‍s Mandi Bierly called it a "so-so season", [ 201 ]
and Lesley Goldberg of
The Hollywood Reporter
called it "emotional". [ 202 ]
Also acknowledging the fan base Verne Gay of
Newsday
wrote "Grey's has had a good season and has an intensely loyal fan base to prove it." regarding the 8th season. [ 203 ]
The ninth season received more positive reviews, Rob Salem of
Toronto Star
called it "a solid return to form." [ 204 ]
Brad Williams writing for
What Culture
praised the show's development over the season saying, "Grey's Anatomy has developed into a fine example of how a TV show can mature beyond its initial purpose." calling it "something almost anyone can watch and enjoy." [ 205 ]
Praising the friendship between Cristina and Meredith of
Entertainment Weekly
wrote, "There's still one good reason to keep watching: Where else can you find such deep friendships between female co-workers". [ 206 ]
The tenth season was also marked with praise, Annie Barrett for
Entertainment Weekly
wrote "There's true sorrow here along with the passion, which keeps their dynamic so intriguing to me." [ 207 ]
Caroline Siede from
The A.V. Club
wrote in her review for the 10th season "At its best, Grey's Anatomy is about everyday bravery, sacrifice, and courage. At its worst, it's a melodramatic, moralizing soap opera. Both sides are on display as the show heads confidently into its 10th season." [ 208 ]
Many sources, including Rachel Simon of
Bustle
and Nicole Pomarico of
Wetpaint , claimed that
Sandra Oh 's performance during her final season on Grey's Anatomy is worthy of an
Emmy nomination . [ 209 ] [ 210 ]

Impact
" Grey's Anatomy
makes an impact on how people's perception of the world is created."
— Brian Quick,
University of Illinois [ 215 ]
Grey‍‍ '​‍s Anatomy
has been considered an impact on culture by
Entertainment Weekly ‍‍ '​‍s executive editor,
Lori Majewski , with her writing: " Grey's Anatomy
isn't just a show, it's a phenomenon. When [the] final shows air, every place in New York City is empty. You could get a table at the best restaurants." [ 216 ]
The Daily Beast ‍‍ '​‍s Jace Lacob also considered the show an impact, comparing its success to that of
Friends , and calling it a "cultural phenomenon". [ 217 ]
Steve Sternberg, a media analyst with Magna Global USA explained that the show appeals to a broad audience, writing: "Roughly 80 percent of households during prime time only have one TV set on. People are looking for shows they can watch with other household members." [ 3 ]
Grey's Anatomy
introduced a "mc-labeling" surge, ever since it dubbed Dempsey's character "McDreamy". Canadian newspaper the
National Post
considers this trend a "phenomenon". [ 218 ]
Analyzing the show's impact on culture, Dessylyn Arnold of
Yahoo! Voices
noted that the "mc-labeling" trend has been parodied on other shows including
ER
and
Degrassi: The Next Generation . [ 219 ] [ unreliable source? ]
Mark Lawson
of
The Guardian
has credited
Grey's Anatomy
with popularizing the "songtage", or musical montage segments. [ 71 ]
Parodying this,
MADtv
created a spoof on the show in 2006, making fun of the series' emotional scenes including those accompanied by a musical montage. [ 220 ]
The show's premise inspired the creation of
A Corazón Abierto , a Colombian adaptation of
Grey's Anatomy , [ 221 ]
which in turn spawned a
Mexican version of the same name . [ 222 ]
A study conducted by the
University of Western Sydney
revealed that 94% of 400 polled medical students are regular viewers of
Grey's Anatomy . [ 223 ]
An additional study conducted by Brian Quick of the
University of Illinois
indicated that the show's portrayal of doctors being "smart, good looking, capable, and interesting", leads viewers to associating real-world doctors to be that way. [ 215 ]
Grey's has also been credited to have changed the perception on how good and bad television can be defined,
The A.V. Club
write, "Since
The Sopranos
burst onto the scene, we’ve too often classified a show as “good” based on how closely it adhered to the dark, violent, male-centric template set out by that particular show. It’s time for that to end. At its best, Grey’s has been among the very best shows on TV, and at its worst, it’s been at least fascinating to watch. To write it off is to unnecessarily narrow the definition of what good TV can be, to limit what the medium is capable of. TV is at its best when it emotionally connects, and even when it seems to be otherwise merrily hurtling off a cliff, Grey’s Anatomy is nothing but emotional connection, which is more than other, more consistently better shows can say." [ 164 ]
In 2011, a woman residing in
Sheboygan, Wisconsin
became unresponsive due to an
asthma attack . Unable to wait for an ambulance, her daughter and a friend performed
cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) on her, which they learned from
Grey's Anatomy . [ 224 ]
Despite this, Resident Karen Zink, M.D., deemed the show's portrayal of interns inaccurate, adding: "None of [the characters] have bags under their eyes. They all leave the hospital dressed cute, with their hair done and makeup on. That is so far away from the reality of interns. You are just dragging your butt, trying to stay alive. You don't have time to do your hair. You don't have time to put on makeup. Every surgical intern has bags under their eyes." [ 225 ]
The series placed at No. 66 on
Entertainment Weekly ‍‍ '​‍s "New TV Classics" list, [ 226 ]
and was declared the third highest rated show for the first ten years of the
Internet Movie Database
(2002–2012). [ 227 ]
U.S. television ratings
Grey‍ '​s Anatomy

Private Practice
Main article:
Private Practice (TV series)
The cast of
Grey's Anatomy
was displeased with the network's decision to center the spin-off on
Kate Walsh 's character.
On February 21, 2007,
The Wall Street Journal
reported that ABC was pursuing a spin-off medical drama television series for
Grey's Anatomy
featuring Walsh's character, Montgomery. [ 33 ]
Subsequent reports confirmed the decision, stating that an expanded two-hour broadcast of
Grey's Anatomy
would serve as a
backdoor pilot
for the proposed spin-off. The cast of
Grey's Anatomy
was reportedly unhappy about the decision, as all hoped the spin-off would have been given to them. Pompeo commented that she felt, as the star, she should have been consulted, [ 317 ]
and Heigl disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Stevens. [ 318 ]
The backdoor pilot that aired on May 3, 2007 sees Montgomery take a leave of absence from Seattle Grace Hospital, to visit her best friend from Los Angeles,
Naomi Bennett
( Merrin Dungey , later
Audra McDonald ), a
reproductive endocrinology and infertility
specialist. While in Los Angeles, she meets Bennett's colleagues at the Oceanside Wellness Center. [ 110 ]
The two-hour broadcast entitled " The Other Side of This Life " served as the twenty-second and twenty-third episodes of the third season, and was directed by
Michael Grossman , according to
Variety . [ 319 ]
The cast included
Amy Brenneman ,
Paul Adelstein ,
Tim Daly ,
Taye Diggs ,
Chris Lowell , and
Merrin Dungey . [ 320 ]
KaDee Strickland 's character,
Charlotte King , who would be introduced in the spin-off's first season premiere, did not appear in the backdoor pilot. Her addition to the main cast was announced on July 11, 2007, prior to the commencement of the first season. [ 321 ]
She did not have to audition for the role, but was cast after a meeting with Rhimes. [ 322 ]
Also not present in the backdoor pilot was McDonald, due to her character, Naomi Bennett, being portrayed by a different actress,
Merrin Dungey . However, on June 29, 2007, ABC announced that Dungey would be replaced, with no reason given for the change. [ 323 ]
The drama was titled
Private Practice , and its premiere episode followed the second part of the season debut of
Dancing with the Stars , and provided a lead-in to fellow freshman series
Dirty Sexy Money .
Pushing Daisies , a third new series for the evening, rounded out the lineup as a lead-in to
Private Practice . [ 299 ]
The series ended its run in January 2013 after six seasons. [ 324 ] [ 325 ]

had three crossover storylines with
Private Practice .
