sekilas biography Career miranda yang saya lihat dari Wikipedia :
1997–2006
At age 13, Kerr entered and won the 1997 annual  Dolly  Magazine/Impulse Model Competition. She was flown to Sydney a week before her 14th birthday to shoot for the magazine. Upon Kerr's win, local media expressed "concerned outrage" at her young age. The controversy raised concerns about the glorification of young girls within the fashion, beauty, and entertainment industries. [7]  Some media outlets claimed her  Dolly  shoot (including images of a 14-year-old Kerr in bathing suits) constituted a form of  paedophilia . Of the press, Kerr said: "In the media at the time they were trying to cling on to anything remotely to do with paedophilia. Dolly is a magazine for teenage girls, not for old men. And I was fully clothed! Doing a winter shoot! They just made something out of nothing." [3]
Kerr signed to Chic Management's Sydney division. She received considerable commercial exposure after a series of beachwear ads predominantly for Australian surf chain  Billabong , in which Kerr modeled surf brands  Tigerlily ,  Roxy ,  Billabong Girls , and One Teaspoon. This increased her profile in the Australian and Asian markets, after which Kerr relocated to New York where she became co-owner of the Bowery Ballroom. [3] [7]
In early 2006, Kerr appeared in the finale episode of the TV show  Project Runway , modeling clothes for contestant  Daniel Vosovic 's final collection. She was the first woman to walk down the catwalk. She debuted with the United States market when she signed a lucrative cosmetics contract with  Maybelline New York . The campaign ran in a series of internationally sold women's beauty magazines, including  Cosmopolitan ,  CLEO , and  Elle , and was eventually featured in  Victoria's Secret  catalogues. [7]  She (along with several other Victoria's Secret and Next agency models) was also featured in a music video for the American  hip-hop  single " Number One " by artists  Kanye West  and  Pharrell . [3] In New York, Kerr had a multitude of  runway  appearances and then signed with  NEXT Model Management  in early 2004. From there, she was booked for runway and print campaigns for major labels, including  Alex Perry , Baby Phat ,  Lisa Ho ,  Voodoo Dolls ,  Levi's ,  Bettina Liano ,  Nicola Finetti ,  L.A.M.B. ,  Heatherette ,  Betsey Johnson , Trelise Cooper , Jets,  John Richmond ,  Blumarine  Swimwear,  Neiman Marcus ,  Seafolly Swimwear ,  Anna Molinari , Rock and Republic ,  Roberto Cavalli , and  Ober Jeans . [2]  Kerr was also booked for print in magazines such as  Elle , Australian  Vogue  and  Harper's Bazaar , and was featured in television advertisements for brands like  Portmans ,  Bonds , and  Veet . [3] [7]
2007–present
Following her success with Maybelline, [7]  Kerr became the first Australian model to be offered a contract with  Victoria's Secret  in 2007, replacing  Gisele Bündchen . Upon her acceptance, she became the first ever Australian  Victoria's Secret Angel [10]  joining the stable of models already signed to the lingerie giant, including  Alessandra Ambrosio , Karolína Kurková ,  Adriana Lima ,  Selita Ebanks ,  Izabel Goulart , and  Heidi Klum . Before becoming an Angel in 2007, Kerr was already picked to become the successor of Alessandra Ambrosio as the face of PINK in 2006. Kerr's popularity continued to increase as one of the globally recognized Angels when she appeared in the Victoria's Secret 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 televised runway shows, which aired on four continents. [7]

[3]  Following her modeling success with Victoria's Secret, Kerr made a small guest appearance in the CBS sitcom  How I Met Your Mother  alongside fellow Angels:  Adriana Lima ,  Marisa Miller ,  Alessandra Ambrosio ,  Heidi Klum , and  Selita Ebanks . [3]  She also became the new face of  Clinique  Happy and signed a lucrative six-figure deal to be the new face of Australian department store  David Jones , replacing model  Megan Gale . [11]  In 2008, having earned an estimated $3.5 million in the past 12 months,  Forbes  placed Kerr tenth in the list of the world's top-earning models. [12]
Since 2009, Kerr was in the spring/summer ad campaign for XOXO. [13]  She was in  Forbes  2009 list of the world's highest-paid models, ranking 9th with estimated earnings of $3 million.

She appeared in the 2010  Pirelli Calendar  photographed by  Terry Richardson  in  Bahia, Brazil . [19]  Previously better known for her Victoria's Secret status rather than her  high fashion  work,  Balenciaga  is credited for launching her high fashion modeling career when casting directors Ashley Brokaw and  Nicolas Ghesquière  chose her to walk  exclusively  for the brand's spring 2010 runway show. [20]  It was her first designer fashion show, aside from  Victoria's Secret , since 2007. [2]  A season later she walked for design company  Prada  for their Fall 2010 collection in  Milan  alongside fellow Angels  Doutzen Kroes  and Alessandra Ambrosio . [21]  Kerr then modeled for campaigns for  Prada  and  Jil Sander , and was shot by  Steven Meisel  for the cover of  Italian Vogue  for September. [20]
In January 2011, Kerr became the first pregnant model for  Vogue  when featured in  Vogue  Australia, being six months pregnant at the time of the shoot. [22]  In March she hit the catwalk for  Balenciaga 's Fall 2011 Ready-to-Wear collection as part of  Paris Fashion Week , two months after giving birth.
