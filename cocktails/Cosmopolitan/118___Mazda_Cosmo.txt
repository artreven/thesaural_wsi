Rotary Power
Bob Mears' triple-rotor Mazda
20B-powered Supermarine Spitfire

Ive studied article after article about putting rotary
engines in airplanes. They usually starts with something
like, Why I chose a rotary engine to put in my plane. With
me it was a bit different; my situation was more like, What
plane will I choose to put a rotary engine in?
Ive messed with rotary engines for 30 years. I raced
them in dirt cars, drag cars, SCCA cars, model airplanes,
and go-karts. I was a hard-core Chevy guy when I was young
and doing some drag racing. Then I went to work for the
local Mazda dealer. The first time I disassembled a rotor
motor I was in love. I wondered why in the world I had been
messing with all those parts. My brother and I immediately
built an RX-2 for the drag strip. We wowed everyone with its
wheel-standing launches, unbelievable noise, and low engine
temperatures. Later we built a
Cosmo
for the dirt track. We won so many races the
tracks banned rotaries from racing. So we built SCCA cars,
RX-3, RX-4, and a rotary truck. (Its amazing how you can
make a truck handle). Later it was back to the drag strip
with another RX-3, an RX-7, and a dragster, all
supercharged.
All that time I wondered why no one had put these engines
in airplanes. As I got older and gave up the racing scene, I
always thought I would build an airplane with a Mazda rotary
and wow the world with this new innovative idea. Mind you
Im not a pilot, and I dont hang around with the airplane
crowd. So about four years ago I decided to enlighten the
world with my fantastic idea. I hit the Internet for some
research about experimental aircraft.
Holy Wankel,
Batman!
These rotor motors are being used all over the
place! Who knew? Then I find
Tracy Crooks website
(noted rotary guru) and discovered
he manufactures most of the parts I needed for my venture. I
got really excited.
During all those years of racing I tried and tried to get
Mazda to help me get a three-rotor engine here in the United
States to race with (the engine is popular in Japan and
Europe, but was never installed in a car destined for the
U.S.). It never happened. Now I go to eBay, and there they
are! Lets find a plane! Being that Im determined to have
something different, I found a
Supermarine Spitfire . All metal, 80 percent scale, and
perfect for a 20B. The kit was delivered, and at that time
it was only one of two here in the States, and I got started
on it.
The fuselage freshly uncrated, as shipped from
Queensland, Australia.
I purchased a 20B on eBay and was anxious to begin
dismantling it; years of anticipation came to a head the day
I took delivery of ita dream realized from those racing
years, and now it was in my garage. It was a lot of fun to
overhaul the 20B since I hadnt even looked inside a rotor
motor in 15 years. I was worried about splitting the shaft,
but it was a nonevent. The engine was so nice inside that I
almost hated to take it apart.
The Wankel engine is elegant in its simplicity.
Who would suspect that 280 hp could be derived
dependably from such a compact box with so few moving parts?
I debated over the
porting
options I was going to choose since I tried so
many different ones over the years, with varying results.
One of my favorites was a P-port with working side ports,
but the intake manifold is a real bugger to make. Since the
Spitfire was designed for the eight-cylinder 5,100 cc
Jabiru
engine, rated at 180 hp, I decided to go with
just a mild street port designed for a naturally aspirated
induction system, and shooting for about 280 hp should be
ample.
Custom aluminum intake runners and plenum for the
three-rotor 20B.
Progress has been steady on both the airframe and engine.
The
first start
of the engine was on February 1, 2008.
Initial run-ups have been pleasing and satisfying, but not
without some minor hiccups. Im certainly worried about
noise as I had to replace the floor in our RX-3, three times
a year; the exhaust noise would sonically destroy the floor
boards. I sure hope it dont destroy my aluminum airplane!
Tracy Crook and the gang at the FlyRotary e-mail group ( www.FlyRotary.com
and
http://Mail.LancairOnline.net:81/Lists/flyrotary/List.html )
have been very supportive and helpful. Its fantastic having
the Internet for information. Ive read every rotary site I
can find.
John Slades
site (also see
CONTACT!
Magazines
issue #87) really got me
excited. And I really liked how John wrote his experiences
in a blow-by-blow story. So I did my
web page
the same way.
Ive since joined EAA and have been to Sun n Fun and the
Rotary Roundup in Texas. My excitement level is still high,
but my time schedule is just as tight, so Im not moving at
the pace I would like to. And somewhere I must find the time
to take flying lessons.
