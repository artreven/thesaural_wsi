What is a
Soul Tie?
What a soul tie is The Bible speaks of what is today known as soul ties. In the Bible,
it doesn't use the word soul tie, but it speaks of them when it talks
about souls being knit together, becoming one flesh, etc. A soul tie can
serve many functions, but in it's simplest form, it ties two souls
together in the spiritual realm. Soul ties between married couples draw
them together like magnets, while soul ties between fornicators can draw
a beaten and abused woman to the man which in the natural realm she
would hate and run from, but instead she runs to him even though he
doesn't love her, and treats her like dirt. In the demonic world, unholy
soul ties can serve as bridges between two people to pass demonic
garbage through. I helped a young man not too long ago break free from
downright awful visitations from demons, all due to an ungodly soul tie
he had with a witch. The man was a Christian, and the only thing that
allowed her to send demonic torment his way, is through the soul tie.
Other soul ties can do things such as allow one person to manipulate and
control another person, and the other person is unaware to what is
going on or knows what is going on, but for no real reason, allows it to
continue.
How soul ties are formed I believe there are other ways which soul ties are formed, but here are some that I am aware of.
Sexual relations:
Godly soul ties are formed when a couple are
married (Ephesians 5:31, "For this cause shall a man leave his father
and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one
flesh."), and the Godly soul tie between a husband and the wife that
God intended him to have is unbreakable by man (Mark 10:7-9). However,
when a person has ungodly sexual relations with another person, an
ungodly soul tie is then formed (1 Corinthians 6:16, "What? know ye not
that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he,
shall be one flesh."). This soul tie fragments the soul, and is
destructive. People who have many past relationships find it very
difficult to 'bond' or be joined to anybody, because their soul is
fragmented.
Close relationships:
King David and Jonathan had a good soul
tie as a result of a good friendship (1 Samuel 18:1, "And it came to
pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of
Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his
own soul."), but bad soul ties can form from bad relationships as well.
Idolizing somebody can cause a bad soul tie.
I have heard too that you can create a soul tie with a rock group by
becoming obsessed with their music. Which explains the strong pull
towards certain music that seems almost irresistible.
Vows, commitments and agreements:
Vows are known to bind the
soul (Numbers 30:2), marriage itself consists of vows and binds the two
people together (Ephesians 5:31), therefore I have little reason to
overlook the concept of vows or commitments as being a means to create a
soul tie.
How to break a soul tie 1. If any sins were committed to cause this soul tie, repent of them!
Fornication is perhaps one of the most common ways to create nasty soul
ties.
2. If gifts were given to you by the other person in connection with
the sin or unholy relationship, such as rings, flowers, cards, bras,
etc. I would get rid of them! Such things symbolize the ungodly
relationship, and can hold a soul tie in place. If you are still friends
or in a relationship (just now it's no longer an ungodly relationship),
like say a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, except you've repented of
and forsaken the unholy practices you used to do in your relationship,
then I don't feel it is necessary to destroy all the gifts and things
that you have been given. I would still encourage you to get rid of
anything that symbolizes the ungodly practices in the relationship
though, such as if a guy gives a girl a bra and panties with his
initials on them during fornication. I wouldn't encourage you to hang on
to such things that symbolize sin or that are wrong to give each other
before marriage. Things such as flowers and love letters given during an
adultery should be destroyed.
3. Any rash vows or commitments made that played a part in forming
the soul tie should be renounced and repented of, and broken in Jesus'
name. Even things like "I will love you forever", or "I could never love
another man!" need to be renounced. They are spoken commitments that
need to be undone verbally. As Proverbs 21:23 tells us, "Whoso keepeth
his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles." The tongue has
the ability to bring the soul great troubles and bondage.
4. Forgive that person if you have anything against them.
5. Renounce the soul tie. Do this verbally, and in Jesus' name.
Example, "In Jesus' name, I now renounce any ungodly soul ties formed
between myself and ______ as a result of _______________ (fornication,
etc.)."
6. Break the soul tie in Jesus' name! Do this verbally using your
authority in Jesus. Example, "I now break and sever any ungodly soul
ties formed between myself and _________ as a result of ______________
(fornication, etc.) in Jesus' name."
Additional recommended reading Seductions Exposed - The spiritual dynamics of relationships (Dr. Gary L. Greenwald)
AWESOME book that takes you behind the scenes of soul ties,
transferring of spirits, and how the enemy can use various things to
gain a 'bridge' into our souls.

Daily Bread: The Core Of The Problem
One of my favorite television cartoons as a boy was
Tom Terrific.
When
Tom faced a challenge, he would put on his thinking cap and work
through the matter with his faithful sidekick Mighty Manfred, the Wonder
Dog. Usually, those problems found their source in Tom’s arch-enemy,
Crabby Appleton. To this day, I remember how this villain was described
on the show. He was “Crabby Appleton—rotten to the core.”
The fact is that all of us share Crabby Appleton’s primary
problem—apart from Christ, we’re all rotten to the core. The apostle
Paul described us this way: “There is none righteous, no, not one; there
is none who understands; there is none who seeks after God” ( Rom. 3:10-11 ).
None of us are capable of living up to God’s perfect standard of
holiness. Because of our condition of being separated from a holy God,
He sent His Son Jesus to give Himself to die on the cross for the
punishment we deserve, and then rise again. Now we can be “justified
freely by His grace” through faith in Him (v.24).
Jesus Christ has come to people “rotten to the core,” and makes us “a new creation” by faith in Him ( 2 Cor. 5:17 ). In His goodness, He has fixed our problem completely—all the way down to our core.
I know I’m a sinner and Christ is my need;
His death is my ransom, no merit I plead.
His work is sufficient, on Him I believe;
I have life eternal when Him I receive. —Anon.
We need more than a new start— we need a new heart.

Black History Month: Carole Gist
Carole Gist of Detroit made history in 1990 when she became the first black woman ever to capture the title of Miss USA, an honor which brought her over $200,000 in
cash
and prizes, and the opportunity to represent the United States in the Miss Universe pageant. The former Miss Michigan and student of marketing and management--who stated a life ambition of establishing a performing arts foundation for disadvantaged children--beat out 50 other contestants for the prestigious honor. Two months later, the six-foot beauty came very close to yet another milestone , when she finished as first runner-up in the Miss Universe pageant.
Gist's Miss USA pageant victory marked a life achievement of rising above obstacles. As she described herself in
Jet,
Gist was not a "stereotypical all-American winner." Raised in a single-parent home, Gist often relocated with her mother and siblings, and lived in some of the roughest neighborhoods of inner-city Detroit. "My home was broken into a lot," she said. Money
was scarce
in her family, and Carole's early ambitions towards the arts were affected: "I wanted to dance and I wanted to learn to play the piano and violin. But ... my mother couldn't afford all those things," she told Ardis Carthane in
Jet.
Despite such difficulties, however, Gist--who was an honors student in high school--maintained a confident outlook, and today looks at her past as important in building strength. "I do believe that some of the negative things in my childhood are positive for me now. They made me what I am today," she told
Jet,
adding, "I had not the happiest of upbringings, but you don't have to become a statistic just because you grew up in a broken home."
After becoming the first black Miss USA, Gist had these words of advice for other ground-breakers: "It's nice to be the first at something.... You know you don't have to wait around and wait for someone else to do it. Go for it. Just because someone else hasn't done it before you ... you never know, you might have what it takes to be the first." Gist sees her winning the title as another important step in black achievement. As quoted by Carthane, Gist said: "It's all a part of taking pride in our [people's] heritage and culture.... We are people destined for greatness. We have it in our blood, we have the knowledge and the knack ." Gist is a reminder, according to Carthane, that "though a person doesn't grow up with a silver spoon
in her mouth, she can still taste the good things in life."

Christian Joke of the Day
"Jealous Eve"
Sometimes women are overly suspicious of their husbands. When Adam stayed out very late for a few nights, Eve became upset. "You're running around with other women," she charged.
"You're being unreasonable," Adam responded. "You're the only woman on earth." The quarrel continued until Adam fell asleep,
only to be awakened by someone poking him in the chest.
It was Eve. "What do you think you're doing?" Adam demanded.
"Counting your ribs," said Eve.

Discipline or Public Humiliation.......Has Child Abuse Gone Too Far?
Is broadcasted discipline child abuse?
We've all heard the saying "It takes a village to raise a child", or what about "spare the rod spoil the child"? Now back in the day, Big Momma had no problems with either of these. But in todays society, how we choose to discipline or reprimand our children in public or from the comforts of our own homes could have a negative effect on us as parents in the long run. Please view the first video on parents who had enough of their childrens behavior and how they chose to deal with it. Then, watch the second video on how a psychologist feels we should handle our children when we've had enough. Let me know what you think....post your comments.

Black History Month: Reginald F. Lewis
Lawyer, Entreprenuer, Family Man, Philantropist
Reginald F. Lewis was born on December 7, 1942, in a Baltimore, Maryland, neighborhood he later described as “semi-tough.” Strongly influenced by his family, he began his career at the age of ten by delivering the local Afro-American newspaper. Fortune Magazine reported that “as a child, Lewis kept his earnings in a tin can known as ‘Reggie’s Hidden Treasure.’” The tin can had been given to him by his grandmother, who taught him the importance of saving some of everything he earned. Reginald later sold his newspaper business at a profit. During his high school years at Dunbar, Reginald excelled in both his studies and sports. In addition, Reginald worked nights and weekends at jobs with his grandfather, a head waiter and maitre d’. Lewis won a football scholarship to Virginia State College (now Virginia State University), graduating with a degree in economics in 1965. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1968. After working at several law firms, Lewis opened TLC Group, a venture capital firm. In 1987 Lewis bought Beatrice International Foods for $985 million, and created TLC Beatrice, a snack food, beverage, and grocery store conglomerate that was the largest black-owned and black-managed business in the U.S. At its peak in 1996, TLC Beatrice had sales of $2.2 billion and was number 512 on
Fortune
magazine's list of 1,000 largest companies. Lewis was also a prominent philanthropist. His 1992 gift to Harvard Law School was the largest single donation the school had received and created the Reginald F. Lewis Fund for International Study and Research. Even after his death at age 50 due to brain cancer, Reginald's philanthropic endeavors continue. During his illness, he made known his desire to support a museum of African American culture. In 2002, the Vice President of the foundation read an article in the Baltimore Sun describing a museum of Maryland African American History and Culture slated to be built near Baltimore's Inner Harbor. After further research and discussion, especially relative to the partnership between the museum and the Maryland State Department of Education to develop an African American curriculum to be taught in all public schools in the state of Maryland, the foundation made its largest grant to date to the proposed museum; $5 million dollars. The money is an endowment with the interest to be used for educational purposes. Lawyer, entrepreneur, philanthropist, Chairman, CEO, husband, father, son, brother, nephew, cousin, friend—Reginald F. Lewis lived his life according to the words he often quoted to audiences around the country: “Keep going, no matter what.”

Christian Joke of the Day
"Willing to Take a Bullet for Jesus"
T he two thousand member Baptist church was filled to overflowing capacity one Sunday morning. The preacher was ready to start the sermon when two men, dressed in long black coats and black hats entered through the rear of the church.
One of the two men walked to the middle of the church while the other stayed at the back of the church. They both then reached under their coats and withdrew automatic weapons.
The one in the middle announced, "Everyone willing to take a bullet for Jesus stay in your seats!"
Naturally, the pews emptied, followed by the choir. The deacons ran out the door, followed by the choir director and the assistant pastor.
After a few moments, there were about twenty people left sitting in the church. The preacher was holding steady in the pulpit.
The men put their weapons away and said, gently, to the preacher, "All right, pastor, the hypocrites are gone now. You may begin the service."

Black History Month: Edward Alexander Bouchet
Edward Alexander Bouchet was the first African American to graduate from Yale and also the first to earn a doctorate degree (Ph.D.) from an American university.
Edward Alexander Bouchet was born in 1852 in New Haven, Connecticut.
His father, William Bouchet, had come to New Haven in 1824 as the valet of his former slave owner, who had freed him.
Edward Bouchet's father worked at Yale College for a time, as a janitor, and was prominent in the African American community, serving as a deacon at the Temple Street Church, the oldest African American church in New Haven.
Edward Bouchet's mother was Susan Cooley Bouchet.
Edward Bouchet attended The New Haven High School from 1866 until 1868 and graduated from the Hopkins Grammar School in 1870.
He was the valedictorian of his graduating class.
In the fall of 1870, Bouchet entered Yale College along with the son of his father's former employer. At Yale, he studied mathematics, physics, astronomy, mechanics, five languages including Greek and Latin, as well as Logic and Rhetoric; he graduated summa cum laude in 1874, ranked sixth in his class, and
was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.
Bouchet continued his graduate studies at Yale, and earned his Ph.D., in Physics in 1876.
His dissertation was on
Measuring Refractive Indices .
He was the first African American to earn a doctorate in any subject at any university in the United States.
After graduation, Dr. Bouchet's demonstrated brilliance and credentials did not afford him the opportunities (such as positions in research, or at top universities) typically available to people of his unusually high level of education.
He spent the rest of his life as a well-respected teacher.
He taught chemistry and physics for many years at the Institute for Colored Youth, a Quaker institution in Philadelphia.
Later on, Dr. Bouchet taught at St. Paul's Normal and Industrial School in Virginia, served as principal of Lincoln High School in Galipolis, Ohio, and was a professor at Bishop College in Marshall, Texas.
He also held the position of business manager for a hospital in St. Louis and worked for a short time as a U.S. Customs Service inspector.
He retired from college teaching
in 1916 and lived in New Haven for the last two years of his life.
A former student of Dr. Bouchet's described him this way:
" ...He was a fine Christian gentleman , a consummate scholar, one who seemed very knowledgeable in all areas and yet was extremely modest and a person who set a wonderful example of politeness and graciousness for the community. ...Certainly it is impossible to assess the far reaching influence of Dr. Bouchet upon the hundreds of persons whose lives he touched ."

"Facebook Firing" Seen Aiding Worker Free Speech
Woman Axed for Bashing Boss on Facebook Sued; Settlement Reached; It May Be Precedent-Setter for All Workers
(AP / CBS)
(CBS) With more than 600 million users, Facebook has become an almost expected way to stay connected -- users log on to reveal details of and news about their lives. But one user, a paramedic from Connecticut, unexpectedly found herself at the center of what may turn out to have been a precedent-setting legal battle -- by writing about her job - specifically - criticizing her boss. Dawnmarie Soouza wrote, "Love how the company allows a 17 to be a supervisor." 17 is code for a psychiatric patient. And after colleagues joined in the discussion, Souza twice referred to her supervisor in more derogatory terms. That led to her being terminated, and her lawsuit, the
settlement
of which one law professor tells CBS News "really has expanded the free speech rights of American workers//If they are communicating about the workplace, and they're talking about their supervisors, then it's a protected activity." "Early Sow" co-anchor Erica Hill interviewed Souza and told her story:

Michael Jordan
Michael Jeffrey Jordan born February 17, 1963
Legacy
Jordan's basketball talent was clear from his rookie season.
In his first game in
Madison Square Garden
against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a prolonged standing ovation,
a rarity for an opposing player. After Jordan scored a playoff record 63 points against the
Boston Celtics
in 1986.
Celtics star
Larry Bird
described him as "God disguised as Michael Jordan."
"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."
—Introductory line of Jordan's NBA Encyclopedia biography Jordan led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied
Wilt Chamberlain 's record of seven consecutive scoring titles. He was also a fixture on the NBA All-Defensive First Team, making the roster nine times (NBA record shared with
Gary Payton ). Jordan also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 points per game, [ respectively. By 1998, the season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a
clutch performer . In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs, Jordan would always demand the ball at crunch time.
Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the highest in NBA history.
He retired with 32,292 points in regular season play,
placing him third on the NBA's all time scoring list behind
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
and
Karl Malone .
With five regular-season MVPs (tied for second place with
Bill Russell ; only
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
has won more, six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three All-Star MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated player ever to play in the NBA. Jordan finished among the top three in regular-season MVP voting a record 10 times, and was named one of the
50 Greatest Players in NBA History
in 1996.
"There's Michael Jordan and then there is the rest of us."
— Magic Johnson Many of Jordan's contemporaries label Jordan as the greatest basketball player of all time.
An
ESPN
survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century, above icons such as
Babe Ruth
and
Muhammad Ali .
Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the
Associated Press 's list of 20th century athletes.
In addition, the Associated Press voted him as the basketball player of the 20th century.
Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of
Sports Illustrated
a record 49 times.
In the September 1996 issue of
Sport , which was the publication's 50th anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.
Jordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back
slam dunk contest
championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many with having influenced a generation of young players.
Several current NBA All-Stars have stated that they considered Jordan their role model while growing up, including
LeBron James
and
Dwyane Wade .
In addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players "the next Michael Jordan" upon their entry to the NBA, including
Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway ,
Grant Hill ,
Kobe Bryant , LeBron James,
Vince Carter , and Dwyane Wade.
Although Jordan was a well-rounded player, his "Air Jordan" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players,
a fact which Jordan himself has lamented.
I think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized. Although Jordan has done much to increase the status of the game, some of his impact on the game's popularity in America appears to be fleeting.
Television ratings in particular increased only during his time in the league and have subsequently lowered each time he left the game.
Jordan was a
shooting guard
who was also capable of playing
small forward
(the position he would primarily play during his second comeback with the
Washington Wizards ). Jordan was known throughout his career for being a strong clutch performer. He decided numerous games with last-second plays (e.g.,
The Shot ) and performed at a high level even under adverse circumstances (e.g.,
Flu Game ). His competitiveness was visible in his prolific
trash-talk
and well-known work ethic. Jordan had a versatile offensive game. He was capable of aggressively
driving
to the basket and drawing
fouls
from his opponents at a high rate; his 8,772
free throw
attempts are the ninth highest total of all time.
As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to
post up
his opponents and score with his trademark
fadeaway
jumpshot , using his leaping ability to "fade away" from block attempts. According to
Hubie Brown , this move alone made him nearly unstopple.
Despite media criticism as a "selfish" player early in his career, Jordan's 5.3 assists per game
also indicate his willingness to defer to his teammates. In later years, the NBA shortened its
three-point
line to 22 feet (from 23 feet, 9 inches), which coupled with Jordan's extended shooting range to make him a long-range threat as well—his 3-point stroke developed from a low 9 / 52 rate (.173) in his rookie year into a stellar 111 / 260 (.427) shooter in the 1995–96 season.
For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder (6.2 per game).
In 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year Award and became the first NBA player to win both the Defensive Player of the Year and MVP awards in a career (since equaled by
Hakeem Olajuwon ,
David Robinson , and
Kevin Garnett ; Olajuwon is the only player other than Jordan to win both during the same season). In addition he set records for
blocked shots
by a guard,
and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. His 2,514
steals
are the second highest total of all-time behind
John Stockton , while his steals per game average is third all-time.
Jerry West
often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive ones.
In August 2009, the
Basketball Hall of Fame
in
Springfield, Massachusetts , opened a Michael Jordan exhibit containing items from his college and NBA careers, as well as from the 1992 "Dream Team". The exhibit also has a
batting glove
to signify Jordan's short career in baseball.
He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in September 2009, with former Bulls teammates
Scottie Pippen ,
Dennis Rodman ,
Charles Oakley ,
Ron Harper ,
Steve Kerr , and
Toni Kukoc
in attendance
In February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats.
As February wore on, it emerged that the leading contenders for the team were Jordan and former
Houston Rockets
president George Postolos. On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team pending NBA approval.
March 17, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase, making him the first former NBA player ever to become the majority owner of a league franchise.

Do Police Abuse Their Authority as Officers of the Law?
Today, Fox News reported that yet again the officers of the law here in Baltimore, MD are charged with abusing their authority as Policemen. Unfortunately, we hear of these "bad apples" in such a large bunch all over the country. Many have horror stories of experiences that "never happened" when being stopped or confronted by the police. You see the YouTube clips of officers doing things that they assume no one is recording, and it makes you sad to think they are dishonest. We want to believe that they all are looking out for our best interests, but some may not. Take a look at the article below and leave your posts. We want to hear what you have to say.
17 Baltimore officers charged in extortion scheme: Published February 23, 2011 | Associated Press BALTIMORE –
Seventeen Baltimore police officers were charged Wednesday with taking kickbacks for diverting drivers at accident scenes to an unauthorized towing company and repair shop. A criminal complaint charges the officers and the owners of Majestic Auto Repair Shop in Rosedale with conspiracy to commit extortion in the course of their official duties. Brothers Edwin Javier Mejia and Hernan Alexis Moreno Mejia paid officers to arrange for their company, which wasn't a city-authorized shop, to tow vehicles from accident scenes and make repairs, according to the criminal complaint. Officers are supposed to allow the owner to arrange for a tow on their own, or if the owner declines, to use police communication channels to contact only an authorized towing company. The officers charged in this scheme would state in reports that the owners arranged for their own tow or would leave that portion of the form blank, according to the complaint. They would tell owners that Majestic could help with the insurance claim and waive the deductible, advising them not to call the insurance company before talking with the repair shop owner, the complaint alleges. A claim would be submitted to the insurance company for repairs made by Majestic to the towed vehicle. Officers received $300 for each vehicle they steered to Majestic and one officer received more than $14,400 over two years, according to the complaint. Fifteen officers were told to report to the police academy Wednesday morning for an equipment check, but instead they were met by FBI Special Agent in Charge Richard McFeely and Commissioner Frederick Bealefeld, who collected their badges before they were arrested.
"I personally took the badges from every one of those men who were arrested today," Bealefeld said at a news conference Wednesday. "I did that as the representative of all those dedicated, honorable men and women who serve and have worn this uniform. I did it for them." Two officers charged Wednesday were on leave and were not arrested, but will be soon, according to department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. The 17 officers are suspended without pay, he said. The department learned of the allegations against the officers and later turned to the FBI for help with the probe, Bealefeld said. The investigation, which involved wiretaps and surveillance, has been extremely difficult, according to U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein. He said there may be more arrests. Each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. No one answered at Majestic on Wednesday evening, and an outgoing message said the shop is closed until further notice for a business emergency. Rosenstein called the charges a double-edged sword. He said people might think that there is corruption inside the department, but they should also realize that the department is aggressively investigating it to stamp it out. "Police officers are supposed to be working the police department, not the highest bidder," Rosenstein said.

Should Marijuana be a Medical Option for a 2 year old?
Medical Marijuana for children???
No one wants to imagine their young child sick with cancer. But, could you imagine having something to make them feel better and not giving it to them? Recently, the news reported the youngest child in the United States to receive medical Marijuana to subside the cancer tormenting his little body.
Two-year-old boy prescribed medical cannabis in battle against brain tumour
By
Daily Mail Reporter
Two-year-old Cash Hyde was given the drug to help ease debilitating symptoms as he battled a brain tumour and, according to his dad, it worked
A two-year-old boy is one of over 50 under-18s being prescribed medical cannabis in one U.S. state alone.
Toddler Cash Hyde, who lives in Montana, was given the drug to help ease debilitating symptoms as he battled a brain tumour and, according to his dad, it worked.
'I believe that you know Cashy's with us for a lot of reasons, one of them I would have to say is the power of prayer, one he's a walking miracle and the other one is he is a patient of medical cannabis, which has I think greatly benefited his battle,' Mr Hyde told KPAX News.
The young boy, who is now in remission, struggled to cope with the side-effects of chemotherapy but his parents say cannabis helped improve his appetite and made him sleep better.
'I watched Cashy not be able to eat for over 40 days, live off nothing but fluid intravenously to the point where he couldn't lift his head up off his pillow,' his father said.
Montana has a total of 51 medical cannabis card holders under the age of 18 - a much more modest number than it at first appears, argues the Missoula Chapter Director of Montana Medical Growers Association, Tayln Lang.
'When I see the number 51 and we're in a state of a million people that's a fraction of a percentage and even with the 28,000 people that are on the program, it's still a fraction not even 1 per cent, so the number is really really small,' he said.

The toddler's father, Michael Hyde, said medical cannabis 'greatly benefited' his son's battle against illness
The prescription of cannabis, which some believe can affect brain development, to minors has caused concern, but Mr Hyde believes the benefits outweigh the negative effects.
'If you or someone you know has battled cancer I don't have to tell you how devastating it is to watch chemo and cancer consume your loved one and when you can actually watch something that you're doing for them actually benefit them in a way that nobody else can do, you feel empowered you feel like you can make a difference,' he said.
Supporters of the scheme are also quick to point out that, in many cases, children who are prescribed cannabis will not smoke it, but rather will ingest it in the form of cakes and muffins.

In 1972, the US Congress placed marijuana in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act because they considered it to have "no accepted medical use." Since then, 15 of 50 US states and DC have legalized the medical use of marijuana.
Proponents of medical marijuana argue that it can be a safe and effective treatment for the symptoms of cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, pain, glaucoma, epilepsy, and other conditions. They cite dozens of peer-reviewed studies, prominent medical organizations, major government reports, and the use of marijuana as medicine throughout world history.
Opponents of medical marijuana argue that it is too dangerous to use, lacks FDA-approval, and that various legal drugs make marijuana use unnecessary. They say marijuana is addictive, leads to harder drug use, interferes with fertility, impairs driving ability, and injures the lungs, immune system, and brain. They say that medical marijuana is a front for drug legalization and recreational use.

Black History Month: Baltimore's Boxing Champion
"B aby Joe" Gans
Joseph Gans Was One Of The First
very popular black sports heroes in
Baltimore . He was an exceptionally talented and well respected boxing champion during the first decade of the twentieth century. Boxing experts of his time referred to him as "the greatest boxer who has ever lived." Later writers argued he was "the best fighter, pound for pound, that ever laced on a glove." He held the lightweight championship for seven years between 1901 and 1908 and fought opponents from a wide range of class weights, something permissible at that time.
Gans was born in Baltimore on November 25, 1874, and given the name "Joseph Saifuss Butts," after his baseball-playing father. Adopted as a toddler he became "Joseph Gaines." His last name was changed again to "Gans" by boxing writers. He started boxing as a teenager, winning his first bout in 1890 and collecting a purse of $4 for his efforts, and turned professional in Baltimore in 1891. Gans faced the many hurdles that all "colored fighters" of his time encountered, but the openly racist opponents, fans, media, and promoters did not keep him from winning most of his fights.
Standing five feet six inches and weighing a mere 133 pounds, Gans won the lightweight world championship from Frank Erne, at Fort Erie stadium in Ontario, Canada, on May 12, 1902. During Gans's career, he fought one hundred and fifty-five opponents, winning 147 times and losing only eight fights. His biggest single earning was $11,000 for a 42-round match in 1906 in Nevada. His greatest opponent was "Battling" Nelson whom Gans fought three times as champion, losing his last fight to Nelson on July 4, 1908, at the San Mateo Hills arena, near San Francisco, California.
Gans's ability in the ring, as well as his charm and professionalism, won him a cross-section of fans in Baltimore and around the country. He used his boxing earnings to improve the welfare of his extended family, at the same time living in "fine style." Gans owned and operated the Goldfield Hotel in downtown Baltimore that housed his residence, plus a gymnasium, saloon, and nightclub. He entertained famous world class sports figures such as "Battling"Nelson and Jack Johnson at the Goldfield,
Eubie Blake
played piano there, and George M. Cohan and Edie Foy came to hear him. Gans is reported to have been the first African American in Baltimore to have purchased an automobile.
Gans's death from tuberculosis on August 19, 1910, in Baltimore, just two years after he lost his boxing championship, shocked his fans. They gave him a hero's funeral as thousands attended the service and lined Baltimore's streets to witness the colorful funeral procession taking his casket to Mount Auburn Cemetery . In recognition of his outstanding boxing career, he was posthumously inducted into the
Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame
in 1973.

Black History Month: Tyra Banks
Tyra Banks was born in
Inglewood ,
California , the daughter of Carolyn ( née
London), a fashion manager and NASA photographer, and Donald Banks, a computer consultant. [3] [6]
The couple divorced in 1980, when Banks was 6 years old. However, the relationship between her parents, and between her and her brother Devin Banks (born 1968), stayed friendly. Later, Carolyn married Clifford Johnson; she now goes by Carolyn London-Johnson. Banks attended
John Burroughs Middle School
and graduated in 1991 from
Immaculate Heart High School
in
Los Angeles . She was accepted by
colleges
such as
USC
and
UCLA
for television producing.
Banks began modeling in the 11th grade. She later went to Paris, France to do some
runway modeling . Within Banks' first week in Paris, designers were so entranced by her presence on the runway that she was booked for an unprecedented twenty-five shows – a record in the business for a newcomer. She has done extensive print and/or runway work for fashion/advertising giants, such as
Anna Sui ,
Coors Light ,
CoverGirl ,
Badgley Mischka ,
Bill Blass ,
Cynthia Rowley ,
Chanel ,
Christian Dior ,
Victoria's Secret , and
Yves Saint Laurent . She has appeared on the covers of high-fashion magazines such as
Vogue ,
Harper's Bazaar ,
Cosmopolitan , and
Elle .
Banks was the first
African American
woman on the covers of
GQ
and the
Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue . In 1997, she received the
VH1
award for Supermodel of the Year. That same year, she became the first-ever African American chosen for the cover of the Victoria's Secret catalog. In 1998, Banks authored a book entitled
Tyra's Beauty, Inside and Out . The book was advertised as a resource for helping women to make the most out of their natural beauty.
Banks retired from modeling in May 2005 to concentrate on her television career. She walked the runway for the final time at the 2005
Victoria's Secret Fashion Show .
Tyra Banks has also started her own production company
Bankable Productions , which produced
The Tyra Banks Show ,
America's Next Top Model , and the 2008 movie
The Clique .
Currently, Banks can be seen on television as the hostess, judge and executive producer of
The CW Television Network
show
America's Next Top Model . In addition, she hosts
The Tyra Banks Show , a daytime
talk show
aimed at younger women, which premiered on September 12, 2005. The show features stories about everyday people mixed in with celebrity interviews. Under the slogan "Every woman has a story...and it happened to Tyra too," Banks promotes her show using emotional flashbacks to her own childhood and adolescence. Many of the episodes deal with issues facing women today. Banks and other experts give women advice on fashion, relationships and more. The first two seasons of the show were recorded in Banks' hometown of
Los Angeles
but, beginning with the fall 2007 season, the show moved to
New York City .
In 2008, Banks won the
Daytime Emmy Award
for her work and production on
The Tyra Banks Show .
In late-January 2008, Banks got the go-ahead from The CW Television Network to start work on a new reality television series based on fashion magazines called
Stylista . The show premiered on October 22, 2008.
In 2010, Banks re-signed with her former modeling agency
IMG Models .
