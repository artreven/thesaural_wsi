Don't Just Play Barbie, Be Barbie!: Real-Life Barbie: Cindy Crawford

Welcome to my World
What in the world is a grown woman doing collecting Barbie dolls, let alone blogging about it? It mean,
really ?! What is the world coming to? LOL I've heard those sentiments so many times and guess what? I
don't
care. I love my Barbies! The name of this blog came from my brother. He would look at the Barbies in my bedroom and the dolls that came in when I ordered, shake his head and say
"Vanessa, Don't just play Barbie, be Barbie!"
Thus the title of this blog. If he had any idea that he would contribute to this I'm sure he would have kept that comment to himself. Anyhoo, I'm just doing this to have fun and relieve a bit of stress. I'm also incorporating my love for fashion and accessories into this blog. Stay tuned and feel free to join in. :)

Real-Life Barbie: Cindy Crawford
From Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Crawford Cynthia Ann "Cindy" Crawford
(born February 20, 1966) is a former
American
model . Known for her trademark
mole
just above her lip, Crawford has adorned hundreds of magazine covers throughout her career. She was named #3 on
VH1 's 40 Hottest Hotties of the 90s. Her success at modeling made her a celebrity that has led to roles in television and film, and to work as a spokesperson. Early life Crawford was born in
DeKalb, Illinois , the daughter of Jennifer Sue Crawford-Moluf (née Walker) and John Crawford. [1] [2]
She was discovered at the age of 16 by a newspaper photographer. He noticed Cindy at work during her summer job of
detasseling
corn and took a picture of her. The photo and positive feedback she received were enough to convince her to take up modeling. She entered the Elite Model Management's Look of the Year contest at 17 and was the runner-up. The
Elite modeling agency
in Chicago then started representing her. Crawford graduated from
DeKalb High School
in 1984, as
valedictorian . [3]
She won an academic
scholarship
to study
chemical engineering
at
Northwestern University , which she attended for only
one quarter . She
dropped out
in order to pursue a full-time modeling career. After working for photographer
Victor Skrebneski
in
Chicago , Cindy moved to
Manhattan
in 1986; she was signed with the Elite New York modeling agency. In 1987, she briefly appeared during the opening credits of the
Michael J. Fox
film
The Secret of My Succe$s . Career During the 1980s and 1990s, Cindy Crawford was among the most popular
supermodels , and a ubiquitous presence on magazine covers,
runways , and in fashion campaigns. She was repeatedly and frequently featured on the cover of many magazines, including:
Vogue ,
W ,
People ,
Harper's Bazaar ,
Elle ,
Cosmopolitan , and
Allure . A partial count in 1998 totalled over 400 appearances. [4]
Crawford also appeared in many fashion campaigns during her career, including those for
Gianni Versace ,
Escada ,
Revlon ,
Ink . She has also worked for
Omega ,
Maybelline , and
Clairol . Fashion designer
Michael Kors
summed up her impact: "Cindy changed the perception of the ‘sexy American girl’ from classic blue eyed blonde to a more sultry brunette with brains, charm, and professionalism to spare." [11] After modeling Crawford quit modeling in 2000. She continues to provide
celebrity endorsement
for a variety of projects. In 2005, Crawford created a line of beauty products with Dr. Jean-Louis Sebagh called Meaningful Beauty for
Guthy-Renker . Crawford has admitted to regularly receiving certain cosmetic procedures, including
Botox ,
collagen , and vitamin injections. She first saw a
plastic surgeon
at the age of 29. [12] In 2005, Crawford launched a new line of furniture under the "Cindy Crawford Home Collection" name. This collection is manufactured by
HM Richards Inc. , and is sold through many retailers including
Art Van Furniture
and
Rooms To Go . She assisted in the creation of the line by directing the designers to include certain features, colors, or styles that fit the needs of families or reflected her own tastes. [13]
She also has a furniture line with
Raymour & Flanigan
and will launch another home goods line with
J. C. Penney
in late 2009. [14]
This one-of-a-kind Cindy Crawford Barbie was designed by Robert Best for a charity auction. The winning bidder paid $33,000 for this doll.
I think this Chocolate Obsession Barbie doll looks like Cindy Crawford! Cindy Crawford’s Official Website:
