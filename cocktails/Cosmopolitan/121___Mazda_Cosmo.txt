ABOUT VEILSIDE:
The VeilSide philosophy encompasses the total
dedication to design, development, commitment, and engineering. VeilSide
designs have claimed numerous awards at the coveted Tokyo Auto Salon
and continue to be the inspirational leader for designs amongst the
automotive performance industry. Our research and development has
VeilSide to achieve record-breaking race results. Our commitment to
quality has set standards amongst the top tuners in Japan, and only a
few tuning companies in the world can compare to our engineering.
The VeilSide
showroom sits nearby the Tskuba Circuit on the outskirts of Tokyo.
VeilSide. Co., Ltd. was established in September 1990 by Yokomaku
Hiranao. The name is derived from Yokomaku's name, "maku" meaning veil,
"yoko" meaning side.
In the period directly following VeilSide's
establishment, the company's focus directed towards performance tuning.
At the 1991 Tokyo Auto Salon's custom car contest, VeilSide won Grand
Prize in the Tuned Car Category despite that it was the first time the
company had ever participated in the event. Soon after, Yokomaku's firm
won trophies in the Dressed Up Car and Complete Car Categories as well.
Soon after, Veilside originated the combat series, which sparked many
other companies into a new era of aero-styling. At an exhibition
in Los Angeles, Yokomaku saw the "Batmobile" from the '60s series
"Batman". According to Yokomaku, "In Japan, people think that
superheroes are something for kids, but in the States I saw adults
looking at the Batmobile with keen interest." As Yokomaku courageously
experimented with new ideas influenced by old favorites, the creation of
the striking Combat model came to be. At first, even the VeilSide staff
was surprised. "But they just stared without backing off, and the more
they looked, the more they liked it," says Yokomaku. The Supra Combat
was exhibited at the TAS '94 and was the object of much discussion
during the deliberations for the custom car contest. In the end the
judges awarded it for the Grand Prize in the Complete Car Category.
After
the Supra Combat was displayed at the TAS, VeilSide received a mountain
of letters from visitors who said they had been inspired by the car.
The Supra Combat was so successful that people started purchasing Supras
just so that they could transform them to Combat mode, and the number
of models in the Combat series thus started to grow. In July of 1995,
VeilSide received Ministry of Transportation authorization for all the
Combat's aero parts, so the car could then pass official inspection.
This was a first in the aftermarket performance industry. At this point
the customizing industry as a whole shifted towards the legal turning
point that Yokomaku had aimed for.
Today, VeilSide's dedication
to precision and detail still prevails above all industry standards.
Whatever it may be, from aesthetics to performance, we assure you that
our products are created with uncompromising research and last but not
least, endless passion.

The
Mazda RX-7
is a
sports
car
produced by the Japanese automaker
Mazda
from
1978 to 2002. The original RX-7 featured a 1146 cc twin-rotor
Wankel
rotary engine
and a
front-midship ,
rear-wheel drive
layout. The RX-7
replaced the
RX-3
(both were sold in Japan as the Savanna) and
later replaced all other Mazda rotary-engine cars except the
Cosmo .
The original RX-7 was a sports car. The compact and lightweight
Wankel
engine
( rotary engine ) is situated slightly
behind the front axle, a configuration marketed by Mazda as "front
mid-engine". It was offered as a two-seat coupé, with optional
"occasional" rear seats in Japan, Australia, the United States, and
other parts of the world. These rear seats were initially marketed as a
dealer-installed option for the North American markets.
The RX-7 made

Series 1 (1978–1980) is commonly referred to as the "SA22C" from the
first alphanumerics of the
vehicle
identification number . This series of RX-7 had exposed steel bumpers
and a high-mounted indentation-located license plate, called by Werner
Buhrer of
Road & Track
magazine a "Baroque
depression." In Japan it was introduced in March 1978, replacing the
Savanna
RX-3 .
In 1980 Mazda released 2500 special North American models known as
the LS (Leather Sport). This package was essentially an uprated "GS"
model with added LS badges on each B-pillar, unequal width dual gold
pinstripe detail, full special brown leather upholstery, sunroof, AM/FM
stereo radio, and LS-only gold center colored alloys. Two GS package
options were also available; three-speed automatic transmission and air
conditioning. This model was only available in four different colors:
Aurora White (1000 made), Brilliant Black (1000 made), Solar Gold (500
made) and sonic bronze (250 made) . Production estimates in parenthesis
are widely accepted estimations per color, though no official production
records are known to exist or to have been released, aside from the
total combined production figure of 2500 units.
Mazda RX-7 Series 2 (US)
The Series 2 (1981–1983) had integrated plastic-covered bumpers, wide
black rubber body side moldings, wraparound taillights and updated
engine control components. The GSL package provided optional 4-wheel
disc brakes, front ventilated (Australian model) and clutch-type rear
limited slip
differential
(LSD). Known as the "FB" in North America after the
US Department of
Transportation
mandated 17 digit Vehicle Identification Number
changeover. For various other markets worldwide, the 1981–1985 RX-7
retained the 'SA22C' VIN prefix. In the UK, the 1978–1980 series 1 cars
carried the SA code on the vehicle VIN but all later cars (1981–1983
series 3 & 1984–1985 series 3) carried the FB code and these 1st
generation RX7's are known as the "FB". The license-plate surround looks
much like Buhrer's "Styling Impressions." [ citation needed ]
1984–1985 Mazda RX-7 (Series 3; Australia)
The Series 3 (1984–1985) featured an updated lower front fascia.
North American models received a different instrument cluster (the NA S3
RX-7 is the only rotary-engined car to not have a centrally mounted
tachometer). GSL package was continued into this series, but Mazda
introduced the GSL-SE sub-model. The GSL-SE had a
fuel-injected
1.3 L
13B RE-EGI
engine producing 135 hp (101 kW) and
135 lb·ft (183 N·m). GSL-SEs had much the same options as the GSL
(clutch-type rear LSD and rear disc brakes), but the brake rotors were
larger, allowing Mazda to use the more common lug nuts (versus bolts),
and a new bolt pattern of 4x114.3 (4x4.5"). Also, they had upgraded
suspension with stiffer springs and shocks. The external
oil cooler
was
reintroduced, after being dropped in the 1983 model-year for the
controversial "beehive" water-oil heat exchanger.
The 1984 RX-7 GSL has an estimated 29 highway miles per gallon (8.11
litres per 100 km) /19 estimated city miles per gallon (12.37 l/100 km).
According to Mazda, its rotary engine, licensed by NSU-Wankel allowed
the RX-7 GSL to accelerate from 0 to 50 (80 km/h) in 6.3 seconds.
Kelley Blue Book , in its January–February 1984 issue, noted
that a 1981 RX-7 GSL retained 93.4% of its original sticker price.
1985 - Mazda released in Australia the RX7 Finale - this was the last
of the series and brought out in limited numbers. The Finale featured
power options and a brass plaque mentioning the number the car was as
well as "Last of a legend" on the plaque. The finale had special
stickers and a blacked out section between the window & rear hatch.
The handling and
acceleration
of the car were noted to be of a
high caliber for its day. This generation RX-7 had "live axle"
4-link
rear
suspension
with
Watt's linkage , a
50/50 weight ratio , and
weighed under 2500 lb (1100 kg). It was the lightest generation of RX-7
ever produced.
12A -powered models accelerated from 0–60 mph in 9.2
s, and turned 0.779 g
(7.64 m/s²) laterally on a skidpad. The
12A
engine produced 100 hp (75 kW) at 6000 rpm,
allowing the car to reach speeds of over 120 miles per hour (190 km/h).
Because of the smoothness inherent in the
Wankel
rotary engine , little vibration or harshness was experienced at
high rpm, so a buzzer was fitted to the
tachometer
to warn the driver when the 7000 rpm redline was approaching.
The 12A engine has a long thin shaped combustion chamber, having a
large surface area in relation to its volume. Therefore, combustion is
cool, giving few oxides of nitrogen. However, the combustion is also
incomplete, so there are large amounts of partly burned hydrocarbons and
carbon monoxide. The exhaust is hot enough for combustion of these to
continue into the exhaust. An engine driven pump supplies air into the
exhaust to complete the burn of these chemicals. This is done in the
"thermal reactor" chamber where the exhaust manifold would normally be
on a conventional engine. Under certain conditions the pump injects air
into the thermal reactor and at other times air is pumped through
injectors into the exhaust ports. This fresh air is needed for more
efficient and cleaner burning of the air/fuel mixture. [2]
Options and models varied from country to country. The gauge layout
and interior styling in the Series 3 was only changed for North American
versions. Additionally, North America was the only market to have
offered the first generation RX-7 with the fuel-injected
13B , model GSL-SE. A
turbocharged
(but non- intercooled )
12A
engine was available for the top-end
model of Series 3 in Japan.
Sales were strong, with a total of 474,565 first generation cars
produced; 377,878 were sold in the United States alone. In 2004,
Sports Car International
named
this car #7 on its list of
Top
Sports Cars of the 1970s . In 1983, the RX-7 would appear on
Car
and Driver
magazine's Ten Best list for the first time in 20 years

The Series 4 (1986–1988) was available with a naturally aspirated,
fuel-injected
13B-VDEI
producing 146 hp (108 kW). An optional
turbocharged
model, (1987–1988) known as the Turbo II in the American market, had
182 hp / 185 ps (135 kW). The Series 5 (1989–1992) featured updated
styling and better engine management, as well as lighter rotors and a
higher
compression ratio , 9.7:1 for the naturally
aspirated model, and 9.0:1 for the turbo model. The naturally aspirated
Series 5 FC made 160  hp
(119  kW ), while the
Series 5 Turbo made 200 hp / 205 ps (147 kW).
The second generation RX-7 ("FC", VIN begins JM1FC3 or JMZFC1), still
known as the
Savanna RX-7
in Japan, featured a complete
restyling reminiscent of the
Porsche
944
or
Porsche 924 . Mazda's stylists, led by Chief
Project Engineer Akio Uchiyama, focused on the Porsche 944 for their
inspiration in designing the FC because the new car was being styled
primarily for the American market, where the majority of first
generation RX-7's had been sold. This strategy was chosen after Uchiyama
and others on the design team spent time in the United States studying
owners of earlier RX-7's and other sports cars popular in the American
market. The Porsche 944 was selling particularly well at the time and
provided clues as to what sports-car enthusiasts might find compelling
in future RX-7 styling and equipment. While the SA22/FB was a purer
sports car, the FC tended toward the softer sport-tourer trends of its
day. Handling was much improved, with less of the
oversteer
tendencies of the FB. The rear end
design was vastly improved from the FB's live rear axle to a more
modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear axle). Steering was more
precise, with
rack and pinion
steering
replacing the old
recirculating ball
steering of the FB.
Disc
brakes
also became standard, with some models (S4: GXL, GTU, Turbo
II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston
front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC
RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also
introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the 2nd
generation RX-7. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated
special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited
degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. The DTSS worked
by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions
but induced slight toe-in under heavier cornering loads at around 0.5
G's or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation
of the rear, but toe-in allowed for a more stable rear under heavier
cornering. Mazda also introduced Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS) in the
2nd generation RX-7. The system changed damping characteristics
according to the road and driving conditions. The system compensated for
camber changes and provided anti-dive and anti-squat effects. The Turbo
2 uses a turbo charger with a twin scroll design. The smaller primary
chamber is engineered to cancel the turbo lag at low engine speeds. At
higher revolutions the secondary chamber is opened, pumping out 33% more
power than the naturally aspirated counterpart. The Turbo 2 also has an
air-to-air intercooler which has a dedicated intake on the hood. The
intake is slightly offset toward the left side of the hood.
Though about 80 lb (36 kg) heavier and more isolated than its
predecessor, the FC continued to win accolades from the press. The FC
RX-7 was
Motor Trend ' s
Import Car of the Year
for 1986,
and the Turbo II was on
Car and Driver
magazine's Ten Best list
for a second time in 1987.
In the Japanese market, only the turbo engine was available; the
naturally aspirated version was allowed only as an export. This can be
attributed to insurance companies penalizing turbo cars (thus
restricting potential sales). This emphasis on containing horsepower and
placating insurance companies to make RX-7's more affordable seems
ironic in retrospect. Shortly after the discontinuance of the second
generation RX-7's in 1992, an outright horsepower "arms race" broke out
between sports car manufacturers, with higher and higher levels of power
required to meet buyer demands. This rising horsepower phenomena arose
from the US
CAFE standards
remaining
stable while engine technologies marched forward rapidly.
Mazda sold 86,000 RX-7's in the US alone in 1986, its first model
year, with sales peaking in 1988.
Australian Motors Mazda released a limited run of 250 'Sports' model
Series 4 RX-7's; each with no power steering, power windows or rear
wiper as an attempt to reduce the weight of the car. In Japan, there was
a special limited release of the FC called Infini with only 600 made
for each year. Some special noted features for all Infini series are:
infini logo on the back, upgraded suspension, upgraded ECU, higher
horsepower, lightened weight, 15-inch BBS aluminum alloy wheels, Infini
logo steering wheel, aero bumper kits, bronze colored window glass,
floor bar on the passenger side, aluminum bonnet with scoop, flare and
holder. The car was thought as the pinnacle of the RX-7 series (until
the FD came out). The Infini IV came with other special items such as
black bucket seats, 16-inch BBS wheels, Knee pads, and all the other
items mentioned before. There are differing years for the Infini, which
noted the series. Series I was introduced in 1987, Series II was
introduced in 1988, Series III was introduced in 1990, and Series IV was
introduced in 1991. Series I and II came in White or Black, Series III
came in Forest Green only, and Series IV came in Forest Green or Noble
Green. There are only minor differences between the series, the biggest
change which was from the Series II being an S4 (1986–1988) and the
Series III and IV being an S5 (1989–1991).
Convertible
Mazda introduced a convertible version of the RX-7 in 1988 with a
normally aspirated engine — introduced to the US market with ads
featuring Hollywood actor
James
Garner , at the time featured in many of Mazda's television
advertisements.
The convertible featured a removable rigid section over the
passengers and a folding textile rear section with heatable rear glass
window. Power operated, lowering the top required unlatching two header
catches, power lower the top halfway, exiting the car (or reaching over
to the right side latch), folding down the rigid section manually, and
then further power-lowering the top. Mazda introduced with the
convertible the first integral windblocker, a rigid panel that folded up
from behind the passenger seats to block unwanted drafts from reaching
the passengers — thereby extending the driving season for the car in
open mode. The convertible also featured optional headrest mounted audio
speakers and a folding leather snap-fastened
tonneau cover . The convertible assembly was
precisely engineered and manufactured, and dropped into the ready body
assembly as a complete unit — a first in convertible production.
Several leading car magazines at the time also selected the
convertible as one of the best rag-tops available on the market (see
Automobile Magazine/January 1988, Performance Car Magazine/January
1989). Mazda exported approximately five thousand convertibles to the
United States in 1988 and fewer in each of the next three model years,
although it is difficult to confirm these figures, as Mazda USA did not
keep RX-7 import records by model type. Production ceasing in October
1991 after Mazda marketed a limited run of 500 example for 1992 for the
domestic market only. In Japan, the United Kingdom, and other regions
outside the US, a turbocharged version of the convertible was available.
10th Anniversary RX-7
Mazda introduced the 10th Anniversary RX-7 in 1988 as a limited
production run based on the RX-7 Turbo II. Production was limited to
1,500 models. The 10th Anniversary RX-7 features a Crystal White
monochromatic paint scheme with matching white body side mouldings,
taillight housings, mirrors and 16-inch alloy 7-spoke wheels. Another
distinctive exterior feature is the gold rotor-shaped 10th Anniversary
Edition badge on the fenders. The interior is all black with leather
seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel (with 10th AE centerpiece) and
genuine MOMO shifter and boot. Glass windows are bronze tinted.

The third generation of the RX-7,
FD
(with FD3S for the JDM
and JM1FD for the USA VIN), featured an updated body design. The 13B-REW
was the first-ever mass-produced
sequential twin-turbocharger
system to export
from Japan, boosting power to 255 PS (188 kW; 252 hp) in 1993 and
finally 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp) by the time production ended in Japan in
2002.
The FD RX-7 was
Motor Trend 's
Import Car of the Year . When
Playboy
magazine first reviewed the FD RX-7 in 1993, they tested it in the same
issue as the [then] new
Dodge
Viper . In that issue, Playboy declared the RX-7 to be the better of
the two cars. It went on to win Playboy's Car of the Year for 1993. The
FD RX-7 also made
Car and Driver
magazine's Ten Best list for
1993 through 1995, for every year in which it was sold state-side. June,
2007 Road&Track magazine proclaimed "The ace in Mazda's sleeve is
the RX-7, a car once touted as the purest, most exhilarating sports car
in the world." [ citation needed ]
The sequential twin turbocharged system was a very complex piece of
engineering, developed with the aid of
Hitachi
and previously used on the domestic
Cosmo
series (JC Cosmo=90–95). The system was composed of two small
turbochargers, one to provide boost at low RPM. The 2nd unit was on
standby until the upper half of the rpm range during full throttle
acceleration. The first turbocharger provided 10 psi (0.7 bar) of boost
from 1800 rpm, and the 2nd turbocharger was activated at 4000 rpm and
also provided 10 psi. The changeover process occurred at 4500 rpm, 8 psi
(0.6 bar), was smooth, and provided linear acceleration and a wide
torque curve throughout the entire rev range.
Handling in the FD was regarded as world-class, and it is still
regarded as being one of the finest handling and best balanced cars of
all time. The continued use of the front-midship engine and drivetrain
layout, combined with an 50:50 front-rear weight distribution ratio and
low center of gravity made the FD a very competent car at the limits.
Australia had a special high-performance version of the RX-7 in 1995,
dubbed the
RX-7 SP . This model was developed as a
homologated
road-going version of the factory race cars used in the 12hr endurance
races held at
Bathurst, New South Wales ,
beginning in 1991 for the 1995 event held at Eastern Creek, Sydney, New
South Wales. An initial run of 25 were made, and later an extra 10 were
built by Mazda due to demand. The RX-7 SP produced 204 kW (274 hp) and
357 N·m (263 lb·ft) of torque, compared to the 176 kW (236 hp) and
294 N·m (217 lb·ft) of the standard version. Other changes included a
race developed carbon fibre nose cone and rear spoiler, a carbon fibre
120 L fuel tank (as opposed to the 76 L tank in the standard car), a
4.3:1-ratio rear differential, 17 in diameter wheels, larger brake
rotors and calipers. An improved intercooler, exhaust, and modified
ECU
were also included. Weight was
reduced significantly with the aid of further carbon fibre usage
including lightweight vented bonnet and Recaro seats to reduce weight to
just 1218 kg (from 1310 kg). It was a serious road going race car that
matched their rival
Porsche 911
RS CS for the final year Mazda
officially entered. The formula paid off when the RX-7 SP won the title,
giving Mazda the winning 12hr trophy for a fourth straight year. The
winning car also gained a podium finish at the international tarmac
rally Targa Tasmania months later. A later special version, the
Bathurst
R , was released in 2001 to commemorate this, in Japan only.
In the United Kingdom, for 1992, customers were offered only one
version of the FD which was based on a combination of the US touring and
base model. For the following year, in a bid to speed up sales, Mazda
reduced the price of the RX-7 to £25,000, down from £32,000 and refunded
the difference to those who bought the car before that was announced.
The FD continued to be imported to the UK until 1996. In 1998, for a car
that had suffered from slow sales when it was officially sold, with a
surge of interest and the benefit of a newly introduced
SVA
scheme, the FD would become so popular that there were more parallel
and grey imported models brought into the country than Mazda UK had ever
imported.
Series 6 (1992–1995) was exported throughout the world and had the
highest sales. In Japan, Mazda sold the RX-7 through its
Efini
brand as the
Efini RX-7.
Models in
Japan included the Type R, the top-of-the-range Type RZ, the Type RB,
the A-spec and the Touring X, which came with a 4-speed automatic
reducing power to 255 PS (188 kW; 252 hp). The others ran on the
standard 265 PS (195 kW; 261 hp) engine with a 5-speed manual gearbox.
Only the 1993–1995 model years were sold in the U.S. and Canada. Series 6
came with 255 PS (188 kW; 252 hp) and 294 N·m (217 lb·ft). In the UK
only 124 examples of this model were sold through the official Mazda
network. Only one spec. was available and this included twin
oil-coolers, electric sunroof, cruise control and the rear storage bins
in place of the back seats.
In 1993, three North American models were offered; the "base", the
touring, and the R models. The touring FD included a sunroof, fog
lights,
leather seats ,
a rear window wiper and a complex
Bose
Acoustic Wave system. The R (R1 in 1993 and R2 in
1994–95) models featured stiffer suspensions, an
aerodynamics
package, suede seats, and Z-rated tires. In 1994 a PEG (performance
equipment group) model was offered. This model featured leather seats
and a sunroof. It did not include the fog lights or Bose stereo of the
touring package. In 1995 the touring package was replaced by the PEP
(popular equipment package). The PEP package contained leather seats,
sunroof and fog lights, but didn't have the Bose Stereo nor the rear
window wiper.

Series 7 (1996–1998) included minor changes to the car. Updates
included a simplified vacuum routing manifold and a 16-bit ECU allowing
for increased boost which netted an extra 10 PS (7 kW). In Japan, the
Series 7 RX-7 was marketed under the Mazda brand name. The Series 7 was
also sold in Australia, New Zealand and the UK. Series 7 RX-7s were
produced only in right-hand-drive configuration.
Series 8 (January 1999– August 2002) was the final series, and was
only available in the Japanese market. More efficient turbochargers were
installed, while improved intercooling and radiator cooling was made
possible by a revised frontal area. The seats, steering wheel, and front
and rear lights were all changed. The rear spoiler was modified and
gained adjustability. The top-of-the-line " Type RS " came equipped
with Bilstein suspension and 17-inch wheels as standard equipment, and
reduced weight to 1,280 kg (2,822 lb). Power was increased with the
addition of a 16 bit ecu and upgraded (high flow) turbos, 280 PS
(206 kW; 276 hp) with 313.8 N·m (231 lb·ft) of torque as per the maximum
Japanese limit. The Type RS had a brake upgrade by increasing rotor
diameter and pad surface area. The Type RS version also sported a higher
ratio differential, providing a significant reduction in its
0–100 km/hr time. The gearbox was also modified, 5th gear was made
longer to reduce cruising rpm and improve fuel efficiency. The very
limited edition
Type RZ
version included all the features of the
Type RS, but at a lighter weight (at 1270 kg). It also featured custom
gun-metal colored BBS wheels and a custom red racing themed interior.
Further upgrades included a new 16-bit ECU and ABS system upgrades. The
improved
ABS
system worked by braking
differently on each wheel, allowing the car better turning during
braking. The effective result made for safer driving for the average
buyer. Easily the most collectible of all the RX-7s was the last 1,500
run-out specials. Dubbed the " Spirit R ", they combined all the
"extra" features Mazda had used on previous limited-run specials plus
new exclusive features. They still command amazing prices on the
Japanese used car scene years later. Sticker prices when new were
3,998,000 yen for Type-A and B and 3,398,000 yen for Type-C. Mazda's
press release said " The Type-A Spirit R model is the ultimate RX-7,
boasting the most outstanding driving performance in its history. "
- There are three kinds of "Spirit R": the "Type A", "Type B", and
"Type C". The "Type A" is a two-seater with a 5-speed manual
transmission. It features lightweight red trim Recaro front seats as
seen in the earlier RZ models. The "Type B" has a 2+2 seat configuration
and also sports a 5-speed manual transmission. The "Type C" is also a
2+2, but has a 4-speed automatic transmission. Of the 1500 Spirit R's
made, over 1000 were Type A's. An exclusive Spirit R paint color,
Titanium Grey, adorned over 700 of the 1500 cars sold.

Motorsport
Winning RX-7 in the GT3 class at the 2010
SCCA National Championship
Runoffs .
Racing versions of the first-generation RX-7 were entered at the
prestigious
24 hours of Le Mans
endurance race. The first outing for the car, equipped with a
13B
engine, failed by less than one second to
qualify in 1979. The next year, a
12A -engine car not only
qualified, it placed 21st overall. That same car did not finish in 1981,
along with two more 13B cars. Those two cars were back for 1982, with
one 14th place finish and another DNF. TheRX-7 Le Mans effort was
replaced by the
717C
prototype for 1983. In
1991, Mazda became the first Japanese manufacturer to win the 24 hours
of Le Mans. The car was a 4-rotor prototype, the
787B .
The FIA outlawed rotary engines shortly after this win. To this day the
rotary powered Mazda is the only Japanese manufacturer to have ever won
the prestigious 24 hour Le Mans race outright. [ citation needed ]
Mazda began racing RX-7s in the
IMSA
GTU
series in 1979. That first year, RX-7s placed
first and second at the
24 Hours of Daytona , and claimed the GTU series
championship. The car continued winning, claiming the GTU championship
seven years in a row. The RX-7 took the
GTO
championship ten years in a row from 1982. The
RX-7 has won more IMSA races than any other car model.In the USA SCCA
competition RX-7s were raced with great success by Don Kearney in the NE
Division and John Finger in the SE Division. Pettit Racing won the GT2
Road Racing Championship in 1998. The car was a 93 Mazda RX-7 street car
with only bolt-on accessories. At season end Pettit had 140 points - 63
points more than the 2nd place team. This same car finished the Daytona
Rolex 24-hour race 4 times.
The RX-7 also fared well at the
Spa
24 Hours
race. Three Savanna/RX-7s were entered in 1981 by
Tom Walkinshaw Racing . After hours of battling
with several
BMW 530i
and
Ford
Capri , the RX-7 driven by
Pierre Dieudonné
and
Tom Walkinshaw
won the event. Mazda had turned the
tables on
BMW ,
who had beaten Mazda's
Familia
Rotary
to the podium eleven years earlier at the same event. TWR's
prepared RX-7s also won the
British Touring Car
Championship
in 1980 and 1981, driven by
Win
Percy .
Canadian/Australian touring car driver
Allan
Moffat
was instrumental in bringing Mazda into the Australian
touring car scene. Over a four year span beginning in 1981, Moffat took
the Mazda RX-7 to victory in the 1983
Australian Touring Car
Championship , as well as a trio of
Bathurst
1000
podiums, in 1981 (3rd with
Derek Bell ),
1983 (second with
Yoshimi Katayama ) and 1984 (third with former motorcycle
champion
Gregg Hansford ). Australia's adoption of
international
Group A
regulations, combined with Mazda's
reluctance to homologate a Group A RX-7, ended Mazda's active
participation in the touring car series at the end of the 1984 season.
The RX-7 even made an appearance in the
World Rally Championship . The car
finished 11th on its debut at the
RAC Rally
in
Wales
in
1981.
Group
B
received much of the focus for the first part of the 1980s, but
Mazda did manage to place third at the 1985
Acropolis Rally , and when the Group B was folded, it's
Group A -based
replacement, the
Familia 4WD
claimed the victory at
Swedish Rally
in both 1987 and 1989.
