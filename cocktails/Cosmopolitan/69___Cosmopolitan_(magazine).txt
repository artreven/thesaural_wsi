Dennis Trillo defends self against critics
Maintaining public silence doesn't mean indifference. Matinee idol Dennis Trillo defended himself against critics that he's intentionally stalling to distance himself from the controversy involving Carlene Aguilar and Cristine Reyes. "Lahat ng posibleng communication na puwedeng gawin ginagawa ko para maayos," he said in a taped interview with
Showbiz Central
aired yesterday, November 25. Dennis argued that the lack of an official statement coming from him must not be interpreted as coldness, or worst, lack of concern especially to those who were directly involved with the mêlée. Trying to keep his poise while making a point, Dennis said, "May ginagawa ako para maayos ‘yon. Hindi ako walang pakialam lang." Amidst all the bickering and growing speculations, the evasive young actor revealed that he was constantly talking to both warring parties to properly address the situation and hopefully arrive at a settlement. TAINTED LOVE . When Carlene confronted Cristine at the taping of
All Star K
last November 7 at Broadway Centrum, sympathizers of the former beauty queen attributed the aggressive act to post-partum depression tangled with jealousy. Dennis clarified that his relationship with Carlene was already strained even before she got pregnant with their baby. "It was never planned," Dennis casually admitted, referring about Carlene's pregnancy. "Before pa noon, dun sa relasyon namin na ‘yon, marami na kaming mga problema sa press. Almost mga five years na on and off ‘yon. Meron kaming mga issues na hindi namin nari-resolve until 'ayun na nga, na-buntis na so naging kumplikado na ang lahat." Carlene's departure to the US during the pregnancy only aggravated the uncertainty of the crumbling relationship. "Lalo na nung pumunta na sa States. Hindi ko alam kung pagbalik niya rito papaano ‘yong situwasyon. So ganun na kagulo." FINDING LOVE ONCE MORE . It was during this stage when Dennis's attention slowly gravitated towards Cristine Reyes. "After ng
Super Twins
‘yon, e," Dennis said in recollection. Although the extent of their relationship remains foggy to the public, it is safe to assume that both Dennis and Cristine had mutual feelings for each other. "'Yong time na ‘yon, hindi pa rin kami naging ganoon ka-open... Pero ‘yon, eventually siyempre na-voice out na namin sa isa't isa," he added. NO LOVE LOST . Dennis acknowledged committing a serious blunder by failing to formally halt his relationship with Carlene. With a relationship still hanging on the balance and a baby to cling on to, Dennis miscalculated the consequences of his error—particularly the confusion it brought to his unsuspecting ex-girlfriend. Recognizing that Carlene has full custody of their baby, Dennis tensely confided: "Doon medyo kinakabahan ako, baka hindi ko na mabisita. Iyon ‘yong kinakatakot ko kaya gusto ko maging maayos kami as friends." Out of sheer emotional exhaustion, Carlene reportedly cited that she's already done fighting for Dennis's love. Responding to the comment, Dennis said: "Sana kung napagod man siyang ipaglaban ‘yong pagmamahal na ‘yon, sana huwag naman siyang mapagod na maging mabuting magulang kami dun sa anak namin." But despite all the mess, Dennis imparted that there will always be love intended to the mother of his child. "'Yong pagmamahal, nandoon naman ‘yon, e. Hindi naman mawawala, ‘di ba? Hindi naman puwedeng hindi mo siya mahal, ‘di ba? Kasi nandoon ‘yon, e. Nandoon pa rin ‘yong samahan. Siyempre 'yong pinagsamahan namin, matagal ‘yon and para maging mabuting magulang ka, kailangan nandoon pa rin ‘yong pagmahahal." WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE . Last November 23, Cristine decided to withdraw the slander and oral defamation case she filed against Carlene. The two met, talked, and eventually shook hands as a gesture of reconciliation. "Natuwa ako and ipinagdasal ko ‘yon kaya masayang-masaya ako na nangyari ‘yon," quipped Dennis, who was obviously relieved. As a parting shot, Dennis could only hope for the issue to finally simmer down. "Sana maging maayos na lahat. Mag-move on na tayo lahat." -

KC Concepcion shares artistic passion from Paris
KC Concepcion had her hands full during the weekend as she shuttled from one place to another to grace two worthwhile projects that she promotes enthusiastically. KC's first stop was Eastwood Center, Libis, Quezon City, last Saturday, November 24, to personally attend the Artists Fair Pilipinas III bazaar, which she co-organized. The beauteous commercial model has been a fixture in various charitable trade fairs sprouting around the metropolis. "Hopefully, next time may mga ibang artists na kaming mai-invite from Cebu, Davao, ganyan. It's a half-celebrity bazaar. Celebrities selling their second-hand items, dahil mahilig ang tao sa mga artista and yung mga lumang kagamitan na cheap lang," explained KC to PEP (Philippine Entertainment Portal) while holding a pen and paper containing her event checklist. Doing her share enthusiastically, KC dug into her closet and took out some old European magazines, clothes, hats and bags—all sold out during the first day of the bazaar. But more than celebrities selling their items, the bazaar also serves as the perfect venue for artists like painters, young designers, and even poets to exhibit their works for potential buyers. "Sana in the same way na mahilig sila sa mga artista, we also learn to enjoy visual arts. Dahil mga Pinoy napaka-talented and I'm sure masisiyahan sila ‘pag nahanap nila yung kasiyahan doon sa art," said optimist KC. Proceeds of the bazaar, however, don't go into the pockets of the participants. This year, KC chose the Hands On Manila Foundation Inc. and the Virlanie Foundation as beneficiaries. "Sana, kahit in our own little way, makatulong sa projects nila," smiled KC as she hopped from one booth to another. KC AND THE MUSE. After catching her breath, KC and her rumored boyfriend Lino Cayetano proceeded to the Absinth Bar in Greenbelt, Makati City, not to party but, guess what?—to recite poetry. With pre-programmed music and mood lighting as background, KC performed "Roses"—a romantic-sensual piece written by poet and spoken- word advocate, Kooky Tuason. Incidentally, it was the same poem recorded by KC herself when she graced—along with Angel Aquino, Barbie Almalbis and Iza Calzado—the spoken-word album Romancing Venus Vol. 1 back in 2005. Unknown to many, weaving words on paper has always fascinated KC. "I just do it for self-expression. It's another art form that I enjoy," she said beaming. Studying in Paris intensified her love for the arts. Now a celebrity here in the Philippines, Megastar Sharon Cuneta's daughter is eager to share and help promote art awareness. She strongly believes that creative individuals just need encouragement and the proper venue to show their artistry. KC shares her inspiration when she was living in Paris: "Siguro kasi I lived in a place na very passionate about visual arts and very supportive of their artists. There's always a venue for their passion na kahit isang sulok ng kalye meron kang makikitang artist na walang kaabog-abog nagpipinta lang siya or nagtitinda lang siya ng kung anu-ano. Nawawala ‘yong ego nila, parang nandoon ‘yong pride nila sa pagpapakita ng art nila kahit kanino." - Philippine Entertainment Portal Source:http://www.gmanews.tv/story/70219/KC-Concepcion-shares-artistic-passion-from-Paris

Angel Locsin next to enter PBB house
ABS-CBN's latest Kapamilya star Angel Locsin is set to enter the most famous house in the land, the Pinoy Big Brother house. DZMM's Laila Chikadora's source confirmed that Locsin will enter PBB house as a "celebrity house guest." The report came after Thursday's voluntary exit of PBB Celebrity Edition 2 housemates, band vocalist Mcoy and stand up-comedienne Ethel Booba. There is still no definite date on when Locsin is going to enter the house and what special task she will do inside. Prior to Locsin's scheduled visit, actress and TV host Kris Aquino also entered the house and cooked for the housemates. Angel will star in the Kapamilya network's latest television series, "La Loba Blanca," and will be shooting her first movie with actor Piolo Pascual under Star Cinema. Source:abs-cbnnews.com

Cristine Reyes, Carlene Aguilar kiss and make up
After a very public spat, actress Cristine Reyes and Binibing Pilipinas titlist Carlene Aguilar have finally settled their differences and agreed to reconcile. “I’m really happy to announce that both parties have decided to settle their differences in the best possible terms. Both of them come out winners,” Atty. Dexter Laquanan, Reyes's lawyer, told radio dzMM. Showbiz columnist Cristy Fermin said the reconciliation meeting happened at Rembrandt Hotel in Quezon City.
Laquanan said Reyes agreed to met with Aguilar after the latter's exclusive interview on ABS-CBN celebrity talk show "The Buzz" last Sunday. He said Reyes and Aguilar both realized that the whole thing was just a big misunderstanding. “As far as Cristine is concerned, she understands where Carlene is coming from. She understands the sentiments and emotions of Carlene and because she understands Carlene and since she is also a woman she decided to withdraw the case," he said. Laquanan said that on Monday (November 26), Reyes will file a motion to withdraw the slander case she filed against Aguilar. The rift started when Aguilar confronted Reyes about her relationship with actor Dennis Trillo. Trillo had earlier admitted fathering a love child with Aguilar. Earlier reports said Aguilar tailed Reyes to a dressing room in Broadway Centrum and whispered: “Hindi ka mahal no’n. Katawan lang ang gusto niya sa’yo (He doesn’t love you. He’s only interested in your body).” After the incident, Reyes filed charges against Aguilar on November 14. In her interview with The Buzz, Aguilar revealed that she and Trillo have been in a relationship for five years when she got pregnant. She said she and Dennis agreed that she would go to the US to protect Trillo's budding acting career. Aguilar refused to confirm what she whispered to Reyes during the incident. "I took the initiative to introduce myself to her. I shook her hand and introduced myself. Then I whispered something to her. I don’t want to elaborate on what I whispered to her because it's private. Then we left," she said.
She said she had felt aggravated upon hearing of news about Trillo's supposed affair with Reyes. She also got angry when Reyes sued her and even demanded a public apology. "I’ll ask you, do you think private conversations, a whisper, an exchange of text messages between two parties merit a public apology?" Aguilar asked.

Ethel, Mcoy exit PBB house
Pinoy Big Brother housemates stand-up comedienne Ethel Booba and musician Mcoy voluntarily exited the PBB house early morning of Thursday. It is unknown whether this would permanently end their stint in the second season of Pinoy Big Brother Celebrity edition, or if they would be given a chance to return. Dubbed as the "Musikerong Daddy", Mcoy felt offended by a comment from Kuya (the Tagalog word for "Big Brother") about a 15-minute film shot by the housemates. The short film was one of the tasks given to them by Kuya. Kuya mentioned that the film's script, which was written by Mcoy, was similar to "The Ghost of August Mayford” (a story about the ghost of a policeman killed in Alton town in the United States). Mcoy got offended, saying that he was traumatized before by a plagiarism issue levelled against him and his (former) band Orange and Lemons. That plagiarism accusation involved, interestingly, the song
"Pinoy Ako" which is Pinoy Big Brother's official theme. Mcoy calmed down when Kuya told him no insult was intended. Kuya said the film's concept was acceptable, but the Mcoy and the housemates could have done better.
Kuya said that a more Filipino concept would have been more appropriate In a conversation with the housemates later on, Mcoy explained that a fully Pinoy concept would be hard to do considering that the interiors of the PBB house were designed with a Victorian-era look. Mcoy also pointed out that even the garden appears foreign because of the cherubim and peacock statues. Then Mcoy was called into the confession room for a one-on-one session with Kuya. As soon as the Musikerong Daddy returned though, it became evident that their one-on-one talk did not resolve anything. On the contrary, he was fuming mad after their exchange. Adding fuel to Mcoy’s anger was PBB’s “Ultimate Pasaway,” Ethel Booba. She expressed confusion over everything that was happening to them. Already upset,Booba reiterated her "Praning Theory" (paranoid theory) regarding Mariel's true status; she asked whether Mariel was just a guest or a genuine housemate like them. It is unclear whether the two were allowed outside the house to calm down and blow some steam, or whether they had already been kicked out. An unconfirmed report said that Ethel and Mcoy are prepared to forfeit their chance to win the PBB prize.
Prior to Mcoy and Ethel's exit from the PBB house, the nominees for eviction were Donnie, Jon and Riza. Source:abs-cbnnews.com

Ara Mina: Manny has 'dramatic moments' in our film
By BOY VILLASANTA abs-cbnNEWS.com Will rumors about an Ara Mina-Manny Pacquiao romance never die? Despite repeated denials by both the actress and the world boxing champion, rumors about their alleged affair hound them all the way to the location shoot for the film "Anak ng Kumander", at the Nipa Hut Resort in San Leonardo, Nueva Ecija. It was a Wednesday morning, during a lull in the filming when members of the press caught up with the actress and the boxer inside a multi-purpose warehouse that alternately serves as gym, soundstage, dance floor or even session hall.
“Anak Ng Kumander” is
MP Productions’ official entry to the 2007 Metro Manila Film Festival in December. Manny plays a rebel while Ara plays a TV reporter. During the break Pacquiao could be observed whispering something to Ara, his right arm resting on her shoulder, as they talked in the presence of director Jose “Kaka” Balagtas, co-star comic Long Mejia, the film’s stuntmen, character actors, make-up artists and other production staff.
Pacquiao's right arm was resting on the actress' shoulder. The sight alone sparked speculations among the excited entertainment writers about the lead stars’ alleged romantic involvement. “Naku, magtigil na nga sila. (Oh! Stop that already.),” Mina told abs-cbnNEWS.com. She was visibly irked that despite her denials, the rumor about her and the boxing champ seems to have taken on a life of its own. What is it like working withPacquiao? “Ay, naku, ibang klase. Komikero siya. Puro biro. (Oh! He’s one of a kind. He’s such a comic. He’s always cracking jokes),” answered the pretty actress. Mina said that her role in the movie isn't much, acting-wise. She said that it's Pacquiao who will be getting the meatier, more dramatic moments. Real to reel Mina seemed more excited about a film project she's currently discussing with directors Peque Gallaga and Lore Reyes. Titled “Ate,” the drama vehicle would pit her characte against that of her real-life sister, Cristine Reyes. “Magkapatid kami rito. Next year namin isu-shoot. (We’re sisters here. We’ll shoot next year),” volunteered Mina. The movie, to be produced by Ara herself, will demonstrate once more the older sister’s concern over her younger sibling. This is a truly a translation from real to reel life. No matter how vividly Ara is painted as an overprotective sis, she doesn’t mind. “May pagkamakulit kasi si Cristine kaya kailangan na may gabay lagi. But I love her. I just want to protect her. (Cristine seems to be irrepressible so she needs
constant guidance),” she quipped. Reyes already filed a slander case agaisnt former beauty queen Carlene Aguilar, with Mina's full support. According to Reyes, Aquilar grabbed her hand inside a dressing room in Broadway Centrum and whispered something derogatory in her ear. Aguilar is supposedly jealous about a supposed relationship between Reyes and actor Dennis Trillo, who is the father of Aguilar’s baby. According to Reyes, Aguilar has been harrassing her in order to driver her away from Trillo.
Reyes claimed that Aguilar sent her threatening text messages, telling her that Trillo "is only interested in your body." Before ending her interview with reporters, Mina reacted to reports about her supposed move from GMA-7 to ABS-CBN. “Kung sakali man mangyari ‘yon, magpapaalam ako sa GMA Network. So far, okay naman ako sa kanila. Alam nila na non-exclusive naman ang contract ko sa kanila pero sila ang priority ko. (If ever that happens, I’d ask permission from GMA Network. So far, I’m okay with them. They know I have a non-exclusive contract with them but then again, they’re my priority).”
Then Mina said goodbye. It was already three o’clock in the morning and she had to get to the US Embassy in Manila to follow up her travel documents to Guam.
When the actress left, Pacquiao was nowhere in sight.

Piolo, Sam File libel charges vs. Lolit Solis, editor
Actors Piolo Pascual and Sam Milby filed libel charges against talk show host and talent manager Lolit Solis and a newspaper editor for publishing an allegedly malicious article against them. DZMM reported that the hunk actors, accompanied by their lawyers, filed the charges at the Makati Prosecutor's Office before noon Friday. The actors included Veronica Samio, entertainment editor of Pilipino Star Ngayon in the charge sheet. The lawsuit stems from a column by Solis and published by Pilipino Star Ngayon on October 15, 2007. In the column, Solis claimed she saw Milby and Pascual in a romantic tryst at the poolside cafe of the Hotel Sofitel last October 12. The actors said that the story of Solis is a complete fabrication and a mere figment of her imagination. Pascual and Milby lawsuit are seeking P5 million each for moral damages. Solis' most controversial brush with the law was right after the 1994 Manila Film Festival Scam, where she and actress Ruffa Gutierrez were embroiled in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to rig the results of the film festival in the awards for Best Actor and Best Actress. Solis later admitted to switching the names of the real winners for Best Actor and Best Actress (Edu Manzano and Aiko Melendez) for her talent, Gabby Concepcion and Ruffa Gutierrez.

Akon Live in Manila
The R&B superstar AKON is coming for his first ever concert in Manila on November 29 at the Araneta Coliseum. His concert will feature his chart topping hits such as Smack That, I wanna Love You, Don't Matter, Sorry Blame It On Me, Lonely, Shake Down, Mama Africa, Sweet Escape (Duet with Gwen Stefani)and Bartender(Collaboration with T-Pain). Background He is the son of jazz percussionist, Mor Thiam. He was born in St. Louis, Senegal, but grew up in Jersey City, New Jersey[11]. He recorded his first song, "Operations of Nature," at the age of fifteen. He was then subsequently jailed for armed robbery and drug distribution charges, and used his time in prison to work on his music. Upon release, Akon began writing and recording tracks in his home studio. The tapes found their way to SRC/Universal, which released Akon's debut LP Trouble in June 2004. The album is a hybrid of Akon's silky, West African-styled vocals mixed with East Coast and Southern beats. Most of Akon's songs begin with the sound of the clank of a jail cell with him uttering the word "Konvict." 2004–2005: Trouble Akon's solo debut album, Trouble was released on June 29, 2004. It spawned the hit singles "Locked Up" and "Lonely," as well as "Belly Dancer (Bananza)," "Pot Of Gold," and "Ghetto". Akon served a three-year jail sentence for grand theft auto, an experience that inspired his "Locked Up".[7] "Locked Up" reached the top 10 in the U.S. and the top five in the UK. His manager Robert Montanez was shot to death following a dispute in New Jersey in December 2005. "Ghetto" became a radio hit when it was remixed by Green Lantern to include verses from legendary rappers 2Pac and The Notorious B.I.G. In 2005, he released the single "Lonely" (which samples Bobby Vinton's "Mr. Lonely"). The song reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100, and topped the charts in Australia, the UK and Germany. His album also climbed to number one in the UK in April, 2005. When music channel The Box had a top ten weekly chart, which was calculated by the amount of video requests, Akon's "Lonely" became the longest running single on the top of the chart, spanning over fifteen weeks. Akon then released another single featuring with a New Zealand rapper, Savage with the single Moonshine, which had become a success in both New Zealand and Australia, becoming number one in the New Zealand charts. In 2005, Akon gained more popularity after being featured on Young Jeezy's debut album, Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101, on the song "Soul Survivor" which became a top five hit on the Billboard Hot 100. 2006–2007: Konvicted In 2006-2007 Akon has had one of the most successful spans any singer has ever enjoyed with eleven songs in the Billboard Hot 100. Akon's second album, entitled Konvicted, was released on November 14, 2006. Konvicted included collaborations with Eminem, Snoop Dogg and Styles P. Late August 2006, Akon released the single "Smack That" featuring Eminem, from the album. This single peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks. The music video for "Smack That" was directed by Raymond Garced. "I Wanna Love You", the second single off Konvicted, was released in September 2006. It is a collaboration between Akon and Snoop Dogg. This single earned Akon his first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, and Snoop's second. "I Wanna Love You" topped the U.S. charts for two consecutive weeks. In January 2007, Akon released his third single "Don't Matter" which earned him his first solo number one and second consecutive Hot 100 chart topper. "Mama Africa" was released as a European single in July 2007, making it the fourth single. It debuted in the UK at number 47. "Sorry, Blame It on Me" is the album's fifth single which debuted in August 2007, on the Hot 100 at number seven, which also happened to be a career best. The song is not available on the original album, but instead part of the Deluxe Edition of Konvicted, which came out August 28, 2007. The sixth and final single was confirmed in an interview by Akon to be "Never Took the Time". [12] Konvicted debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 286,000 copies in its first week. After only six weeks, Konvicted sold more than one million records in the U.S. and more than 1.3 million worldwide. The album was certified platinum after seven weeks, and after sixteen weeks it was certified double platinum. Konvicted was able to stay in the top twenty of the Billboard 200 for 28 consecutive weeks, where it peaked at number two on four different occasions. Currently it has sold more than 2.4 million records in the U.S. and 3.8 million worldwide in 30 weeks. Akon performing at a 2007 Live Earth concert in New Jersey.

On October 5, 2006, Akon broke a record on the Hot 100, as he achieved the largest climb in the chart's 48-year-history with "Smack That" jumping from number 95 to 7. The leap is fueled by its number six debut on Hot Digital Songs with 67,000 downloads. The record was broken on April 7, 2007 by Beyoncé and Shakira's Beautiful Liar when it jumped from 94 to 3 on the Hot 100, because of their 150,000 digital downloads on the Hot Digital Songs. In December 2006, Akon's "Smack That" was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards, but lost to Justin Timberlake and T.I.'s My Love. From April to July Akon performed in The Sweet Escape Tour with Gwen Stefani. From July to September he will embark on his worldwide Konvicted Tour. In September, Akon will start on the Canadian leg of the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour with Rihanna. On August 2, 2007, Akon was scheduled to perform at the Rock tha Block Tour in Australia but had trouble obtaining a visa due to his criminal past. The tour was postponed until late August and his visa was eventually processed but Akon was quoted as saying "Australia is the home of the convicts so it's the last place I would have ever thought it would be a problem".[13] Akon will release a Platinum Edition of his album Konvicted in UK on October 1. 2008 New Album It has been reported on Shade 45 that Akon will release a 2008 solo album.
