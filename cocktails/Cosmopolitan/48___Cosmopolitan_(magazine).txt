OF KINGS & QUEENS I AM

Bridge & Tunnel Nobility: One Time King of Corona
My friends, I must confess that I was born of Queens and was raised  and lived among Kings & Queens….counties, that is; a veritable Earl of
Sheepshead Bay
and one time Prince of
Kew Gardens
and perhaps even a
King of Corona , long before
‘Me and Julio [were spotted] down by the school yard’ , at
P.S. 14
on Otis Avenue or even at the
Corona Ice King
(raspberry or cherry please) or striking balls with bats in the
national pastime
down at
Flushing Meadows Corona Park .  On a side note, though we thought we were wonderfully talented we had no
Tom Terrific
from our
favorite local franchise
of fellow
Metropolitan’s
among us. In those days a
Cosmopolitan
was a a magazine for women. Today, however, we can all happily drink from the same vines as   Tom Seaver ,
Mr. George Thomas Seaver
– to be polite, in a full bodied product from the
Seaver Vineyards
as if every day was a
simply amazing
one
in 1969 .
I am thus a man of
Bridge & Tunnel nobility
and a veritable Royal Class of New Yorkers, a regular reader of
New York’s Hometown Newspaper
and
“All the News That’s Fit to Print.”
Please do know of course that I have never sought to trade off that standing and have instead settled for walking among the people, along side of folks like you.
Truth  told, my preferred carriage or mode of transport was always rather regal. My taste in that regard has not changed.  In my youth it was the
D, E & F trains . In later years when I came to reside on the other side of the moat in Manhattan, I took the green numbered cars of
4,5 & 6
while living in
Carnegie Hill
for the better part of a decade, and even the Red ones of
1,2 & 3
(much like I took the
Red Line
and the
Green Line
while living in the Boston/Cambridge areas during my days in New England) when I moved to the
Upper West Side / Morningside Heights . Notably, in recent years, due to the works of
quintessential New York leaders
like the former
Mayor of New York City , a
Prince of the City
who led
the turnaround
of New York City and who later came  to be known as America’s Mayor in   Rudolph W. Giuliani
and the
Alliance of Guardian Angels
led by
Curtis Sliwa , my means of transport has been increasingly secure, with minimal risk of stage coach robberies which Americans of an earlier age were subjected to while traveling in or across this region.*  (* Note : Yes,  there are critics and more
nuanced views
of the
Giuliani legacy , yet whatever one thinks, lessons due remain for future leaders who will look to aspects of his success referenced in
Fred Siegel :
“The Prince of the City: Giuliani, New York and the Genius of American Life”
to shape their governance. This legacy has continued under
Commissioner Raymond Kelly
and
Mayor Mike Bloomberg , one of the greatest philanthropists in this period of American history, even though their leadership styles have been different.)
This is simply how I roll as a man of privilege, class and style.  Yet, in this whole debate about the 1% vs. the 99%, sometimes the shortsighted acts of others simply force me to accept that I simply  might be a tad better than both — at times.  Capische?
Despite the royal lineage referenced herein and previous coverage of fundraising affairs of the  Central Park Conservancy , I found myself on the outside looking in this past week as I was denied for  the first time in the past 8 years as the Editor & Founder of ManhattanSociety.com,  the opportunity to cover the famed  FLO Luncheon
or Hat Luncheon, one of the  more regal
fundraisers for the  Central Park Conservancy
hosted by the  Women’s Committee . It had me wondering whether it was my association with one of the parks in the outer boroughs that cost me my societal standing with an elite group of proud  Upper East Side
Manhattanites committed to the maintenance of  the people’s park
at the heart of our metropolis. Why a private non-profit, managing a space in the public trust would choose to manage, control or limit social or society press that had afforded it and its benefactors and honorees traditionally positive coverage, in such a manner is curious. But I diverge and will explore this in my next blog post.

Women on my Mind in the Month of May
Mother & Son, Circa 1999
Women are on my mind these days. I am well aware of the many challenges women face still in America and around the world. But for me it is even more personal.  It has been a year since my mother was diagnosed with
Lung Cancer
which spread to her spine and brain and took her life shortly thereafter in the Summer of 2011. Yesterday was
Central Park Conservancy’s FLO Luncheon
which for the first time in 8 years, my website, ManhattanSociety.com did not receive an invitation to cover it despite
our prior coverage
being widely perceived as favorable (that story will be laid out in a coming blog post so do return for some juicy details), but on Thursday, May 3rd I will be at
Cipriani 42nd Street
to cover the
2012 Women Who Care Luncheon : A Benefit for
United Cerebral Palsy of New York City
which will honor many women, including a special lady I have a great deal of respect for in
Patricia Duff
(see also:
NNDB ,
IMDB ,
Blog ) who founded and heads an organization called
The Common Good
which is covered regularly by ManhattanSociety.com, including most recently
a discussion with Gloria Steinem
along with a screening of   “Gloria: In Her Own Words.”
On May 8th I will be at the
New York Historical Society’s Strawberry Festival Luncheon
will honor
Chelsea Clinton . And then on May 10th the
New York Women’s Foundation
will host the
25th Annual Celebrating Women Breakfast
honoring among others
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton . And then on May 13, 2012 it is
Mother’s Day .  Given all of the foregoing, I would expect that my mother would want me  to reflect and honor her life by being striving to be a better man each day that I am alive and following the lessons taught me from her own life.
Who Am I?
I have been asked on a number of occasions who I am, what I stand for and how did I become this way. Sometimes the inquiry was intended as a compliment, other times it was made perhaps out of shear frustration and confusion with my approach, but  finally in a number of other instances it was intended as an insult.  While it may be useful, from a communication standpoint, to be understood to achieve certain objectives, in those instances where those that did not get it or me, I was never insulted for their inability to grasp the import of a less conventional man. In some cases, perhaps a rapprochement might be necessary but yet in other cases I soon realized that it was perhaps not necessarily worth time to justify the essence or foundation of my character as a man.  Conventional thinkers have a hard time grasping unconventional people, and thus sometimes you can help them by simply walking away from them.  For, in this life, I know that I have already experienced profound love, lust, happiness and loss.  Were I to die today, I would rest comfortable in the knowledge that I have taken all that life could give in terms of punishment and need not solicit anymore.  Likewise,   I have sampled sufficiently from the tree of life, enjoyed its plentiful bounty and been given the opportunity to continue to plant seeds to infuse my spirit in to those who may out last me here on earth.  This gives me solace in the fact that while maybe there are things that cannot be changed in the here and now perhaps can be changed when I am gone.
A Revolutionary Builder of Souls: Virginia Bernadette Saunig-Roche
(1-31-39 to 8-24-2011)
In my mother’s company, I always felt truly rich for it was always clear that I was in the presence of a revolutionary builder of souls. On the eve of the anniversary of her  diagnosis with
Lung Cancer , which took her life soon thereafter, a little less than a year ago in the late Summer of 2011, while the pain of her loss is still fresh in my mind, the lessons of her life instilled in me are ones which I believe must be passed on.
Because of my mother, the women I have evolved to most admire have most often been
strong, independent minded women
committed to their own evolution, who were
“resilient and self-reliant” .  Much like my mother, they could do it all. And much like my mother, they often had to explain away their success or hold back their achievements, accomplishments or superior insight because it might undermine men the stature or confidence of men relying on their wisdom.   Many of my heroes and favorite artists are women.  I am sure that some even see a place in their life for  cold heartless bitches . Personally, I do not go that far, but I do have an appreciation for those who like author
Arden Leigh
who can embody being  ‘A Weapon of Mass Seduction’ .  ‘‘The New Rules of Attraction: How to Get Him, Keep Him, and Make Him Beg for More
is a philosophy any reasonable man would love to unwittingly embrace. Let the deception begin. But I diverge.
For the preferred type of women, a man was certainly a welcome or useful accessory but not a necessary component for their survival. While I embraced those kinds of women in my professional life, my romantic life was a mixed bag. Maybe I thought that I did not have enough to offer them? I am not 100% certain but all too often I rushed to those who I thought I might be able to assist rather than those who might complete me; some even
‘had me at hello’
but before too long I was already headed for the door.  At this point, with the clock winding down, all I can say is that may the epilogue to my mothers life be that I finally get the most important and obvious lesson of all, to embrace and support women of strength, independence and character who choose to embrace and accept me, a man with  both alpha
and  beta personality attributes , whose passion and pursuits are not always conventional. The reward I seek may sometimes have no value to the more conventional man. I do however, know, accept and appreciate that I need the love, if not the vital energy of a strong woman infused into me much like plants need sunlight. Unlike a  predatory vampire
stalking
his prey , I will let nature take its course; therein lay the conundrum of the  beta man , he may not invest the time only to learn that  she’s just not that into you . Besides which he won’t be tempted to hire
a Wing Women
or employ the  Wing girl method . You can instead figure out  how to get a Scorpio man to fall in love with you .
“Though all  Scorpios
do not spend their lives pondering the mysteries of life …  truly evolved Scorpios can learn to use their power to help and inspire others”, and this is what I hope to do hereby.   I honor my mother, my god and my country by embracing powerful feminine spirits who gravitate towards me and choose to steer carefully and respectfully away from those who offer a mere  frolic and detour
that will result in taking me off a productive trajectory in what remains of my life. I recommend you do the same. For I know that I no longer frankly have the time.  Those are my values as taught to this  Scorpio man
by the woman whose sign was brewed in  the Age of Aquarius .
The Lessons Learned/Distilled
Female strength comes in many forms. Know, understand and accept that. But more importantly, recognize it when you see it.  Don’t run from it. Fear not strong women. I am certainly not scared of them. Instead I am scared more of weaker and manipulative women who will detract from your pursuits in life and set you back from accomplishing your ultimate destiny.
Nurture and support a woman’s strength and independence for it is the best emotional venture capital investment that a man can make in life.  More and more men will come to grasp that as fact. As men grow increasingly more secure with women’s strength they will in effect become more liberated from self imposed servitude towards the wrong women and be free to love a woman for being all those amazing things that even you as a man are as well and some of those things that you are not.  And even so they will still accept you. If you need an arithmetic lesson: 2 + 2 = 4 and 1-1=0  Many of these women know that but too few of us men know that.
A real man should have little or no desire to restrain, inhibit, control or undermine a woman’s power and feminine strength should he be lucky enough for it to find and embrace him. Likewise he is not controlling, jealous or possessive in his romantic relations with her. Even when overwhelmed by desire for her, he stands back and let’s her roam free in the wild, taking care of his other business in life, until her return. If you satisfy her needs, quench her thirst and stimulate her mind, body and spirit on many levels, rest assured and be confident….for she will return, only to savage you for you patience in dealing with her evolution away from you and to celebrate how you too have evolved in her absence. This coming together and apart is part of the process of developing your spirits and power mutually and independently. Fear not the absence of your loved one, but instead do something with that time.
Our society will only grow stronger if we nurture and support the independence and strength of women in our personal relationships, in our country and worldwide in our human policy. As the anniversary of my mother’s passing draws near and in a month of women being honored while also facing challenges around the world, I am reminded that perhaps my ultimate purpose is to help others who would dare to repress women to recognize we as a people can only lose, if our women are less or if we strive to make them less to appease fragile male ego’s.
God bless America. God bless the women of America and everywhere on this planet they meet those who would contain their dreams and their passion. Tear down the walls that impede their progress and we will remove those impediments to our own evolution.
******************************************
About:
Virginia Bernadette Saunig-Roche (1-31-39 to 8-24-2011) , was born in
Chelsea section of Manhattan
to working class American parents of German, Austrian and Italian descent. Virginia attended  St. Colomba’s Catholic Parochial school
and attended mass regularly at  St. Colomba Church .  As an adult, Virginia resided on the  Upper East Side
of Manhattan for nearly a quarter century working in media ad sales and the barter industry, before retiring to  Cape Coral, Florida
with her second husband, James P. Roche (who worked in property management for the
Trump Organization
and  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
for nearly 3 decades) where she passed in the summer of 2011 at the  Hope Hospice
survived by her four sons, two sisters and her grandchildren.  In September of 2011, I, along with my older brother Stewart, eulogized our mother at a service held for her at  Church of Our Lady of Peace , a Roman Catholic Church on the  Upper East Side
of Manhattan which she regularly attended during her days in Manhattan. My development and perspective were impacted strongly by my mother’s
Catholic faith , common sense and wisdom as well as the regular nourishment she provided me and her other 3 sons with her flavorful and hearty meals, especially on Sunday. She will never be forgotten by those that were touched by her grace, wisdom and humanity.
