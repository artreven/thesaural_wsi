I stopped believing and never looked back
Sent in by Joseph Image via
Wikipedia I came across this site while search for the origins of
Easter .
I guess that was my
sunrise service .
I read
Nicole's testimonial dated April 6, 2009
and was inspired to share mine. (Thanks for the forum). I was raised Catholic and went to
Catholic schools
for 12 years.
I went to mass every Sunday and in college, when I worked on Sundays, I attended Saturday evening mass.
When I was 14, I saw the virgin Mary hovering over me one night.
Funny that a good Catholic boy would have a vision of the
Virgin Mary .
So yeah, I was pretty much brainwashed. In my late 20's I was in a bad marriage and wanted out.
But I was dealing with all the baggage and implications that come with being a good Catholic.
I went for a long walk down a busy main street and prayed for guidance.
I cried, just wanting an answer.
I got it. On the way home, I saw ambulances and mangled cars.
When I got home, the neighbor informed me
that a teenage girl was killed in the accident, decapitated.
It was at that exact moment that I stopped believing.
Sure, I probably was already on the cusp, I don't know.
But I realized that as I prayed for guidance about a looming
divorce , some poor mother had probably prayed for the safety of her daughter.
I stopped believing and never looked back. I don't have visions of the Virgin Mary, I don't believe in ghosts, I don't believe in hell.
It's funny how more spiritual I am now, than I was then.
But now it's just me and my relationship with the world.
So I'm off to
YouTube
to watch my Sunday morning sermon from
George Carlin
on religion.
Even non-believers need communion.

A FOOL FOR CHRIST
What made me finally start thinking
Why I left the Christian faith
Questioning my reality
Waking up
Rational delusions
Chucky's first video: My early years of atheism
From hardcore Jesus freak to atheist
Everything over the past years started swirling in...
Christianity made less and less sense to me
At least I'm finally free
Leaving Christianity in the midst of fears of hell...
I stopped believing and never looked back
Where I came from; where I'm going
Faith without God
Christianity left me looking for answers
Breaking up with God
Finally free!
Atheism is not a Religion
Christianity: fear, hypocrisy, self-righteousness ...
MY JOURNEY TO SANITY
I let out a deep breathe and let go
The red flags were everywhere
Praying to the moon
