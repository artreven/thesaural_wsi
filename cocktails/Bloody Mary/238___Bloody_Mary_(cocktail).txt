Hand cooked Bloody Mary potato crisps (chips) a_foxie_smile
wrote in
trashy_eats February 25th, 2012 Hands up who has a hangover. No? Either I don't believe you. Or more likely, you are still drunk. In the UK, when one requires a certain "hair of the dog" the next morning. One more than likely turns to that most reviving of drinks, the
Bloody Mary . That amazing cocktail of tomato juice,
Worcester Sauce , tabasco, optionally perhaps some salt and pepper and a natty celery-stick mixing spoon but most importantly, a double shot of vodka. Well, no longer do we have to restrict ourselves to a liquid lunch. Marks and Spencer, our favourite semi-upmarket purveyor of ready-meals has come up with the Hand Cooked Bloody Mary flavour crisp: They are quite robust, rustic things,. In a similar way to old-style Kettle chips. True to the cocktail they do contain (dried) tomatoes and celery (extract). They also contain garlic and onion  and cardamon, taste more or a spicy taco seasoning than of tabasco and I no matter how hard I try I can't find any alcohol in them. So, sorry M+S. While these are nice enough in a spicy tomato kind of way. I might have to continue to seek my Sunday refreshments at the hand of the barman instead. Tags:

hm, they sound good, but no wouldn't use them to replace Bloody Mary's either. I can't help it if I never have real hang-overs: my bloodlines all stem from heavy-drinking European nations, but I still like Bloody Mary's and hair of the dog. :P ( Reply ) ( Thread )

Between you and me, I don't really get proper hangovers either. Bloody marys are still darn nice though. ( Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread )

Yeah, ok. Why not! I'd wouldn't mind a swap for a few specific things if you'd be up for that? Email me at bluefox_diabolos@hotmail.com? ( Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread )

Irrelevant, but I just wanted to say I love Worcester Sauce. I put it on/in everything :) ( Reply ) ( Thread )

I mostly put it on tomato juice and vodka ;) It is great for adding to stews though. ( Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread )

I was making a note to stop into Marks & Sparks the next time I'm in London until I saw the words "I can't find any alcohol in them." No fun in that. :( Maybe I'll get some anyway and eat them as a snack with a liquid Bloody Mary. ( Reply ) ( Thread )
