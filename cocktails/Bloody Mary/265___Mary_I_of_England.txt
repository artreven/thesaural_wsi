100 million hand-painted seeds in London
This blew my mind. There’s a new exhibit at London's Tate Modern gallery (highly recommended place, by the way) that displays 100 million hand-painted seeds. You can see it in
this video . The seeds look just like regular shelled sunflower seeds, but they’re actually hand-crafted out of porcelain by artists from China. A Chinese artist named Ai Wei Wei is behind the project. With the help of what I assume is a very large team of artists in the Chinese city of Jingdezhen, he has created a truly incredible thing. Each ceramic seed was molded, fired, hand-painted and then fired again. It took two years to create them all, and they weigh a total of 150 tons. They fill the Tate’s Turbine Hall in a layer eight inches thick. It looks fun to walk on and is definitely
a great place to play . The sunflower seeds hold a couple of different symbolic meanings. According to the woman in the video, people in China carried sunflower seeds in their pockets during the Cultural Revolution. As it was a time of great poverty and political repression, food was scarce and people would share these sunflower seeds with each other. So the seeds represent goodwill and compassion during trying times. Also, at that time, propaganda images of Chairman Mao depicted him as the sun and all the people as sunflowers turned toward him. The exhibit is the latest installment of the Tate’s Unilever series. The Unilever series shows eye-opening exhibits in the museum’s Turbine Hall, which used to house the electricity generators in the old power station (this building was the Bankside Power Station until 1981). For one Unilever exhibit the artist actually
tore up the floor of the Hall , which was pretty interesting. The current 100 million sunflower seeds exhibit will be around until next May, at which point some other cool and unusual thing will undoubtedly come to replace it.

Dining in complete darkness
Here’s an interesting dinner option for anyone traveling to London:
dining in complete darkness . The restaurant is called
Dans le Noir? , and it sounds like a cool concept to me.
It all starts with an orientation session in the restaurant lobby. Then you hand over any potential light sources (cell phones, lighters, cameras). Then you and your fellow diners form a line, hand-on-shoulder, and guides lead everyone into a completely pitch-dark dining room (the guides are actually blind, so they know what they’re doing). You’re maneuvered into your assigned seats, and the unusual dining experience begins.
You can imagine how the food takes on a whole new identity when you must rely on only smell, texture, and taste. And of course, the unique experience isn't all about the food. According to
this article , people eating in absolute darkness tend to say things they might not otherwise say (inhibitions melt away) and do things they might not otherwise do (soup is loudly slurped). There’s no body language to gauge, no table manners to worry about, no eye contact to maintain.
I know what you’re thinking: what if you have to go to the bathroom? No problem. You just let one of the guides know, and they’ll help you get there. (And yes, there are lights in the bathroom, so you don’t make a mess.)
The concept of Dans le Noir?, according to the restaurant’s founders, has three main purposes: 1) To give customers the experience of being blind for a couple hours; 2) To see how the darkness affects the other senses during eating; 3) To create restaurant-industry jobs for blind people (as I mentioned, Dans le Noir? employs blind people as guides to help diners get around).
I like it. I like when dinner becomes about more than just getting food into my stomach and turns into an experience unto itself. I also like activities that make my brain work in ways it's not used to working. In short, I like Dans le Noir?. It looks like
they also have them
in Paris, Barcelona, Bangkok, and several other cities.
I want to eat there.

Ad for London Dungeon is too horrifying
I thought
this story
from London was pretty funny. A digital poster ad for the
London Dungeon
had to be taken down because it was too terrifying for children.
The digital ad, which was posted in Tube stations and trains, showed a standard portrait of the 16th-century English Queen, Queen Mary I, otherwise known as
Bloody Mary . After a few moments, the Queen suddenly changed into a flesh-eating zombie.
Apparently, the zombie caused many young children to freak out. So, Britain’s official Advertising Standards Authority ordered the ad’s removal. I especially enjoyed this part of the agency’s official explanation for banning the ad: "We also considered that when the face morphed into the scary character, the bloody gashes, white flesh, rotting teeth, red eyes and the threatening expression meant it was not suitable for young children to see.”
Fair point.
While the ad may be too much for little children, I have only good things to say about the London Dungeon itself. I’ve had good times there. You wander through spooky medieval London, looking at ghastly tableaus of torture, mayhem and horror. Scary sound effects and background noise add to the ghoulish atmosphere.
I have a real affinity for tableaus (my favorite ride at Disneyworld is Pirates of the Caribbean). And it looks like they’ve added some new features to the London Dungeon since I was there a few years back. They now have a Drop Ride to Doom, a Boat Ride to Hell, and the new Bloody Mary attraction. And they still have the old faithfuls like Jack the Ripper and Sweeney Todd.
Some people might tell you the London Dungeon is stupid. But those people are just scared.

Ping Pong all over London
Here’s an idea I can get behind. This summer, between July 24 and August 22, there will be
ping pong tables all over London , free for anyone who wants to use them.
One hundred tables in all will be available to the public, for residents and tourists alike. There will be paddles available at each table. The tables will be popping up at many famous landmarks, including Trafalgar Square, Regent's Park, the Tate Britain and Heathrow Airport.
I used to play ping pong in my younger days. I like the game. The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, claims that it was invented in Victorian England. They called it whiff-whaff. I don’t know if that’s really true, but I like the name.
London’s month-long event is called
Ping! , and in addition to free ping pong table use, it will also include ping pong classes, ping pong history lectures, and a literary ping pong quiz. In short, this is a good month to be in London if you’re a ping pong enthusiast.
The point of the whole thing is to get people excited for ping pong at the 2012 Olympic Games, which will be in London. This summer’s event will kick off at London's St Pancras International train station, where trains arrive from Paris and Brussels. The UK Olympic ping pong team will be there. After the summer, the Ping! project will move on to four other cities and then come back to London in 2012.

London’s Secret Cinema
There’s an organization that's really catching on in London. It’s for people who love movies, love events, and love being in on secrets. It’s called
Secret Cinema , and it has more than 60,000 members and 40,157
facebook fans
(and counting).
Here’s how it works: Once a month, Secret Cinema members get an email about the next movie screening event. The invitation tells you where to meet, when to meet, and what to wear. And this isn’t just practical information, it’s also a clue about what the movie is going to be (if you’re told to wear a blue wig and cowboy boots, and wrap yourself in toilet paper, then the movie must be...).
You go to the meeting place at the appointed time. From there, everyone is transported by bus or trolley or spaceship or whatever to the secret screening location, which could be anything from a farm, to an abandoned theater, to a rooftop, to a five-star hotel parking garage. Along the way, you may stop at other unexpected locations to witness art installations and staged performances, all with the goal of re-creating the world of the secret movie. Finally, you reach the secret location, the secret movie is shown, and members watch it together
in a party-like atmosphere.
The idea of Secret Cinema is to transport people to another world. It’s to make movie-watching a more interactive and social experience. It’s all very thematic. Members are immersed in a surreal alternate reality, all the while trying to guess what the movie might be.
It all looks like a pretty good time. And a pretty nerdy time. But nerdiness is in these days, so it’s not surprising that this thing is gaining popularity. Next time you’re in London, you might be able to partake. You can register at the
Secret Cinema website .

Summer solstice at Stonehenge
Happy
Summer Solstice , everybody.
One place that takes its Summer Solstice very seriously (or any solstice, for that matter), is
Stonehenge . At the crack of dawn this morning, about 20,000 people were gathered at the famous circle of stone slabs to watch the sunrise that marks the beginning of the longest day of the year (north of the equator).
Here are some
enchanting photos .
Those in attendance were lucky; the skies were clear for the first time in the last six years of Summer Solstices. Folks were actually able to see the sun as it poked out from the horizon at 4:52 AM local time. They chanted, danced and beat drums in celebration. Guests included all kinds of people, including local residents, visitors from around the world, and people pretending to be druids.
Stonehenge
is a mysterious circle of giant stones in the countryside about eight miles from Salisbury, England. Probably dating from around 2,500 BC, the arrangement is thought to relate to astronomical alignments. Just outside the main entrance to the site stands the so-called Heel Stone. On the Summer Solstice, if you stand within the circle of Stonehenge and face northeast through the entrance, you see the sun rise directly from the top of the Heel Stone.
I bet the Summer Solstice at Stonehenge is magical. Stonehenge is cool, any time of year. I went there when I was a boy, and it sparked my imagination. Some people think Stonehenge is boring, because it’s just a bunch of stones standing around in the middle of the countryside for no reason. I think it’s cool, because it’s just a bunch of stones standing around in the middle of the countryside for no reason.

Introducing London’s new Olympic mascots
We’re still two years from the London Olympics in 2012, but yesterday was a big day in the long run-up to the international event. They
introduced the official mascots .
The mascots' names are Wenlock and Mandeville, and they are weird-looking. They each have one giant eye. They are expressionless. They have no genders. And they each have an orange light on the top of their head, a symbolic gesture to the “TAXI” signs on top of London’s famous black cabs. See them
for yourself .
Olympic mascots are a long-standing tradition. The mascots represent the host country, and they try to get children excited about sports. And, of course, they bring in revenue to the host city through merchandising. Anyone taking any
trips to London
starting this year will be able to buy all kinds of Wenlock and Mandeville memorabilia. You can get them on t-shirts, toys, mugs, hats—probably anything you can think of.
I like Wenlock and Mandeville. But I think I might be alone. It seems that everyone around the world is already
making fun of them . I say mascots are weird and creepy to begin with, so why not embrace that? And while Wenlock and Mandeville aren’t the customary cute and cuddly animals usually representing the Games, London Olympics officials say kids today are more into this kind of sleek, semi-robotic, digital look. I have to say I agree. Have you watched
Yo Gabba Gabba ? Wenlock and Mandeville would fit right in.
Anyway, I look forward to seeing more of this strange-looking pair over the next two years. Who’s with me?

The wacky London Marathon
Yesterday was the London Marathon. By all accounts, it was a great day. Ethiopian Tsegaye Kebede won the men’s competition, while Russia's Liliya Shobukhova came in first for the women. Congratulations to them both. Here's a
four-minute sprint
through the route, courtesy of Google street view.
Apparently, the London Marathon is
a bit different
from other marathons. In addition to simply facing the challenge of running 26 miles in a row, many competitors aim to break any number of odd records. For instance, Princess Beatrice became the first member of the royal family to run the marathon. That doesn't sound so odd until I tell you that she ran as part of a human caterpillar (runners connected by bungee cords).
There were many others. A man named David Ross was the fastest-ever cartoon character to run it (he was dressed as Fred Flintstone). A runner in a Superwoman costume set the record for fastest female superhero. Records were also broken for fastest leprechaun, fastest animal (in this case, a tiger outran a lobster), and fastest celebrity. All in all, it sounds like my kind of marathon.
As many know, the history of marathon races dates back to ancient Greece. According to legend, it all started when Pheidippides, a Greek soldier fighting in the Battle of Marathon (a seaside Greek city), had a message to deliver to Athens: The Persians had been defeated. So, Pheidippides ran the 26 miles to Athens (allegedly without stopping). When he arrived, he said “Nenikekamen” (“we are victorious”) and then dropped dead from exhaustion.

Steampunk gala in London
Have you heard of steampunk? I hadn’t until a few minutes ago. But this past Saturday, steampunk’s biggest event of the year, The Great Exhibition 2010, was held at La Scala club in London. By all accounts, it was
a very good time .
Steampunk is an offbeat sub-culture that takes retro-future-sci-fi-technology and combines it with the steam power era—especially 19th-century Victorian England. (If that doesn't make much sense, Wikipedia does
a better job of explaining steampunk
than I do).
Anyway, Saturday's party was the annual shining moment for steampunk and steampunk enthusiasts.
The video from the event
gives you a good feel for it. These people are passionate about steampunk. They came in elaborate costumes, like a man who called himself Syberfi who proudly wore his “cranio-meter” around his head. Then there was a man named Shipton Bellinger, who sold old-timey USB drives (he called them portable information cabinets.) And finally, there was Mr. B., a steampunk hip hop artist (he called it chap hop) who raps about things like cricket, fine sherry, and his pipe.
As you can tell, this was a very dedicated group of people. All in all, more than a thousand people attended the party, where they were treated to music, drink, and all the weird retro-futuristic excitement they could handle.
If you missed it this year, don't worry. There’s always The Great Exhibition 2011.

Harry Potter sport brought to life in England. Sort of.
I know there are big Harry Potter fans out there. Somehow I have never read any of the books myself, or seen the movies, but I was still pretty amused by a story about a group of students at the University of Nottingham in England who are trying to start their own real-life quidditch league.
Quidditch , for those who don’t know, is a fictional sport from the Harry Potter world where two teams of wizards and/or witches fly around on broomsticks and try to throw balls through elevated hoops.
The real-life Nottingham students do the exact same thing. Except they can’t fly. Instead they just hold broomsticks between their legs and run around a field. Here,
watch for yourself . While I haven’t seen Harry Potter, I'm pretty sure the quidditch matches in the books and movies were a little more intense than this Nottingham version.
Maybe real-life quidditch is more common around the world than I think. I don't know. The article that accompanies the video above does say that there’s a growing
Facebook group
for the league and that a team from Warwick University is eager to challenge the group from Nottingham.
I would like to see a video of that.
As a side note, Harry Potter fans visiting England don't have to find a quidditch match to get their Potter fix. There are a number of Harry Potter sights to visit in London (I've heard
Platform 9-3/4
at King's Cross Station is a popular one), and there are a bunch of Harry Potter tours you can take too.
