The Salty Dog at Faneuil Hall in Boston

I love historic
Boston . The Salty Dog Seafood Grille & Bar at 206
Faneuil Hall Marketplace
in Boston feels old.
If
you eat outside at the tables
on the cobblestone sidewalk, or sit at the bar, you can watch the Faneuil Hall tourists. It is a great people watching venue. Inside there are two bars and a small dining room.
Dark wood and
brick walls
enhance the relaxed atmosphere.
Travel Companions, my daughter and sister
When we arrived at the Salty Dog, we initially sat outside.
Since it was cool, we descended the
old stone steps into the bar. As we waited, hoping to get a seat,
I was impressed that the bartender acknowledged us promptly, because
he was busy preparing drinks and serving food. He got us three seats at the bar.
We enjoyed
New England clam chowder . It was creamy with diced potatoes. The best part of out meal was the raw
oysters
with lemon,
horseradish
and
cocktail sauce .
They were fresh and salty. We also had fried oysters served with tarter sauce. They were fair.
My sister ordered fish and chips with no-mayonnaise
coleslaw . The slaw was crisp and slightly sweet. We loved that it
was flavorful and didn’t have mayonnaise.
I had a
Bloody Mary
with a cooked shrimp (that was still in the shell) and a large celery stalk. You could taste horseradish in the drink. It was average at best.
I would visit again because of the friendly atmosphere and congenial bartender. I would order raw oysters and a beer.
