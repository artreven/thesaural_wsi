Eggs Rockefeller with Dandelion Greens and Hollandaise
Serves 2
Well-flavored greens, flavored with a hint of fennel, are a terrific counterpoint to runny egg-yolks and rich hollandaise. Any tender greens, wild or domesticated, may be used instead of dandelions.For special occasions, serve with a  Bloody Mary  or  Mimosa .
1 pound
dandelion greens
(uncleaned) or 1
bunch spinach
or Swiss chard
1 cup diced
onions , 1/4” dice
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 Tbsp.
olive oil
2 tsp. minced
garlic
1/2 tsp. freshly crushed
fennel seed
4 slices
artisan-style bread
or 2
English muffins
4
eggs
Blender Hollandaise Sauce
( see recipe here )
Pinch of cayenne pepper
Wash dandelions very carefully.
Discard any tough or damaged leaves, stems, roots, and the tiny flower bud often found in the very center of even young dandelions.
Bring pot of salted water to a boil. Stir in cleaned dandelions and cook for 1 minute. Using slotted spoon, remove greens and put them in bowl of cold water. (Reserve hot cooking water for poaching eggs.) Drain greens. Pick up handful of drained greens and, using your hands, squeeze as much water out of them as you can. Continue with remaining greens. Chop greens.
Sauté onions, lightly seasoned with salt and freshly ground black pepper, in olive oil until they soften and start to turn golden. Stir in garlic and crushed fennel; cook for 1 minute. Stir in chopped greens and toss to thoroughly combine. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until liquid in greens has evaporated. Keep warm.
Put ingredients for
Blender Hollandaise , except melted butter, in blender container.
Toast bread or English muffins. Bring greens cooking water to a simmer. Crack eggs into 4 separate small bowls. Slip eggs into simmering water. (While eggs are cooking, finish Hollandaise by blending hot bubbling butter into ingredients in blender.)
When simmering eggs are just set (be sure not to cook yolks hard), remove them from water with a slotted spoon. Drain eggs briefly on paper towels.
Assemble:
Place two slices of toast on plate. Top each piece of toast with cooked dandelion greens. Put poached egg on top of dandelions and pour ribbon of hollandaise on top of eggs. Sprinkle with pinch of cayenne and serve immediately.

Featured Product
All-Clad Stainless 3-quart Saucier. Best pot ever. I got it for Christmas and it always seems to be my first choice when I'm grabbing a pot. Curved sides mean no burned corners and make whisking and stirring easy.
