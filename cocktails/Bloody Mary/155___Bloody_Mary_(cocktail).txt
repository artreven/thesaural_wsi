Dehydration of the garden
Using it all up! Dehydrating is the best way to preserve the essence of a raw apple, as well as other fruits and vegetables.
~~~~~~~
First some neat information I found with a recipe or two.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Celery
Greek : Σέλινο
Celery First Used as a Medicine
~~~~~~~~~~~
Celery (Apium graveolens) is believed to be the same plant as selinon, mentioned in Homer's Odyssey about 850 B.C. Our word "celery" comes from the French celeri, which is derived from the ancient Greek word. The old Roman names, as well as those in many modern languages, are derived from the same root word and sound remarkably similar. This indicates a rather recent wide distribution and use of celery.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Apium graveolens is
plant
species in the family
Apiaceae , and yields two important vegetables known as celery and
celeriac .
is used as a seasoning, in
cocktails
(notably to enhance the flavour of
Bloody Mary
cocktails), on the
Chicago-style hot dog , and in
Old Bay Seasoning . Celery is one of three vegetables considered the
holy trinity
(along with
onions
and
bell peppers ) of
Louisiana Creole
and
Cajun cuisine . It is also one of the three vegetables (together with onions and
carrots ) that constitute the French
mirepoix , which is often used as a base for sauces and soups.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Did you ever wonder how a paper towel can soak up a spill, or how water gets from a plant's roots to its leaves? The name for this is "capillary action."

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now for the Peppers:
Purple Beauty, a sweet Bell[Capsicum annuum], Golden Bell and
Carmen Pepper, Sweet Italian Capsicum annuum [‘Carmen’ pepper]
This is a sweet, Italian-type pepper. It produces horn-shaped peppers about a week earlier than others in its group. This plant is a good selection for those who want a sweet-tasting pepper that produces well.

Bell Peppers with Summer Vegetables
(Originally from Country Living)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While vegetable dishes usually take second billing, these side-dish casseroles can easily assume star status when served alongside simple grilled meats or fish.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ingredients
~~~~~~~~~~~~
4 red bell peppers, halved lengthwise and seeds removed
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 1/2 cups fresh corn (about 3 ears)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 cups red and golden cherry tomatoes
2 tablespoons fresh oregano, chopped
1 teaspoon lemon zest
~~~~~~~~~~~
Directions
Preheat oven to 400° F. Toss the peppers in 2 tablespoons olive oil and place in a large baking dish and set aside. Heat remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add the onion and garlic, and cook for 3 minutes. Add the corn, salt, and pepper and cook for 3 more minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, oregano, and lemon zest and divide the mixture evenly among the 4 pepper halves; set aside. Mix the goat cheese and cream cheese together and distribute in heaping teaspoonfuls among the peppers. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until the cheese begins to brown -- 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until the cheese begins to brown -- 5 to 10

This is very interesting, I will be back later to study all. I have heard it mentioned, and we do buy dried fruit now and then so this subject is a must view one for me.

Interesting post. My family used to do this a lot but I think they stopped for some reason. Not sure why. Seems like the way to go.
Thanks for visiting.

We typically have too much humidity here for fast drying so we bought a little dehydrator for hot peppers. Works fast and you can stack many trays. It came with 4 which is plenty for us but you can add up to 6 more for a total of 10 trays.

Hi there O.W.T , Lincoln and Ki: I use a dehydrator as well. It is always a plus when the grocery store has mushrooms on sale and a
Bargain...use the dehydrator and they are perfect to Reconstitute later in soups, stews etc. Just one example ;)
