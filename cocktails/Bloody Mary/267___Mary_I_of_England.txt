Lewes Bonfire Night 2007 - Burning Crucifixes
The burning crucifix's relate to local Christian internecine strife. The seventeen crosses remember the seventeen Protestant (Christian) martyrs executed by the Catholic (Christian) Queen Mary (aka " Bloody Mary ") a long time ago. There are no racist connotations.
Images taken during the legendary Lewes Bonfire Night Celebrations on 5th of November 2007.
