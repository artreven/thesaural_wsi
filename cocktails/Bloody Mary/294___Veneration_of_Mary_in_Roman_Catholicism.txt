Madonna del Ghisallo
Okay, vacation over. Time to start churning out some content.
While my dream of taking a bike tour around Europe may be a ways into the future it never hurts to plan for it now. For this reason I have chosen my first stop on my grand cycling adventure, the  Madonna del Ghisallo .
“According to the legend, the  Medieval
count  Ghisallo
was being attacked by bandits when he saw an image of  Virgin Mary
at a  shrine . He ran to it and was saved from the robbers. The apparition became known as the Madonna del Ghisallo, and she became a patroness of local travellers. In later times, Madonna del Ghisallo (the hill) was made part of the  Giro di Lombardia
bicycle race.
A local priest, Father  Ermelindo Vigano , proposed that Madonna del Ghisallo (the apparition) be declared the  patroness
of  cyclists . This was confirmed by  Pope Pius XII . Nowadays the shrine of Madonna del Ghisallo contains a small cycling museum with photos and artifacts from the sport. There also burns an  eternal flame
for cyclists who have died. One particularly notable artifact is the crumpled bicycle that  Fabio Casartelli , a native of the region, rode on the day that he died in a crash in the  Tour de France .”
