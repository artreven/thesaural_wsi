For many, including Pythagoras, Parmenides, Xenophanes, Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus, Monad was a symbol for God or the first being or the totality of all beings.

PACHAMAMA
Review: James Lovelock, The Vanishing Face of Gaia: A Final Warning
....But there is a greater, more sacred cow that even the most strident climate sceptics seem reluctant to attack: James Lovelock. Lovelock is responsible for the now-famous Gaia hypothesis, which is predicated on the idea that each of the planet's systems exist in intricate symbiosis with one another. Or, in his words, Gaia is "a complex entity involving the Earth's biosphere, atmosphere, oceans, and soil; the totality constituting a feedback or cybernetic system which seeks an optimal physical and chemical environment for life on this planet". Sounds nice, doesn't it? But this isn't really a "hypothesis" at all: it's just a highfalutin' way of saying we shouldn't cut down so many trees and we shouldn't burn so much coal. The problem with Lovelock's theory is that he presents it as a scientific position, when really it's not even cargo cult stuff: Gaia is a perfectly pleasant metaphor for the dangers of abusing the natural world, but to posit his "cybernetic system" as a serious theory is to invite ridicule. Perhaps realising - as James Hansen surely now does, if only privately - that the planet might just make it through the twenty-first century intact after all, Lovelock has switched focus in his new book. Now it's only humanity that's at risk. The planet will look after itself. All that saving the planet stuff was just a sales pitch: what we really need to be doing is saving the human race...... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pachamama
is a goddess revered by the indigenous people of the
Andes . Pachamama is usually translated as " Mother Earth " but a more literal translation would be "Mother Universe" (in
Aymara
and
Quechua
mama = mother / pacha = world, space-time or the universe)
[ 1 ] . Pachamama and
Inti
are the most benevolent deities and are worshiped in parts of the Andean mountain ranges, also known as
Tawantinsuyu
(stretching from present day
Ecuador
to
Chile
and
Argentina ).
In
Inca mythology ,
Mama Pacha
or
Pachamama
is a fertility goddess who presides over planting and harvesting. She causes
earthquakes . Her husband was either
Pacha Camac
or
Inti , depending on the source.
Llamas
are sacrificed to her. After conquest by
Catholic
Spain
her image was masked by the
Virgin Mary , behind whom she is invoked and worshiped in the
Indian
ritual, in some parts of
Argentina ,
Chile ,
Bolivia
and
Peru
(Merlino y Rabey 1992).
Since Pachamama is a "good mother", people usually toast to her honor before every meeting or festivity, in some regions by spilling a small amount of
chicha
on the floor, before drinking the rest. This toast is called "challa" and it's made almost everyday. Pachamama has a special worship day called "Martes de challa" (Challa's Tuesday) where people bury food, throw candies, burn incense. In some cases, celebrants assist traditional priests called " yatiris " in ancient rites to bring good luck or the good will of the goddess, such as sacrificing guinea pigs or burning llama fetuses (although these last two are no longer very common). The festival is after carnival and one day before the Catholic "miércoles de ceniza" (Ash Wednesday). The central ritual to Pachamama is the Challa or Pago (Payment). It is carried out during all the month of August, and in many places also the first Friday of each month. Other ceremonies are carried out in special times, as upon leaving for a trip or upon passing an
apacheta . According to Mario Rabey and Rodolfo Merlino, Argentine anthropologists who studied the Andean culture since the decades from 1970 to that of 1990, "the most important ritual is the challaco. Challaco is a deformation of the quechua words 'ch'allay' and 'ch'allakuy', that refer to the action to insistently sprinkle (Lira 1941: 160 y 161). In the current language of the peasants of the southern Central Andes, the word 'challar' is used like a synonym of 'to feed and to give drink to the land'. The challaco, just as is practiced in the studied area (Merlino y Rabey 1983: 153-155), covers a complex series of ritual steps that begin in the family dwellings the night of the eve, during which cooks a special food, the tijtincha, and that culminate in an eye of water or the beginning of a ditch where is carried out the main ritual to the Mother Earth, with a series of tributes that include food, beverage, leaves of Coca and cigars" (Rabey y Merlino 1988).
The religion centered in the Pachamama is practiced currently in parallel form to the Christianity, to the point such that many families are simultaneously Christian and pachamamistas (Merlino y Rabey 1983 ). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachamama http://www.wunderground.com/blog/sebastianjer/comment.html?entrynum=119

The Flower of Life (FOL) is a geometrical figure composed of multiple evenly-spaced, overlapping circles, that are arranged so that they form a flower-like pattern with a sixfold symmetry like a hexagon. Leonardo da Vinci has studied the Flower of Life's form and its mathematical properties. He has drawn the Flower of Life itself, as well as components therein, such as the Seed of Life. He has drawn geometric figures representing shapes such as the platonic solids, a sphere, a torus, etc., and has also used the golden ratio of phi in his artwork; all of which may be derived from the Flower of Life design.

Monad being the source or the One meaning without division.
Monism is often erroneously seen in relation to pantheism, panentheism, and an immanent God. However, the concepts of absolutism, the monad, and the "Universal substrate" are closely related.
