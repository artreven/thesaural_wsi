:: What is a Mocktail ::
A
non-alcoholic beverage
is a
beverage
that contains no
alcohol . Non-alcoholic mixed drinks (including punches, "virgin cocktails", or "mocktails") are often consumed by children, people whose religion restricts alcohol consumption,
recovering alcoholics , and anyone wishing to enjoy flavorful drinks without alcohol. They are often available as alternative beverages in contexts (such as bars) where the norm is to drink alcoholic beverages. Examples include
Shirley Temples ,
Virgin Marys , and virgin-style
Piña Coladas . Non-alcoholic beverages contain no more than .5 percent alcohol by volume. The category includes drinks that traditionally have no trace of alcohol such as sodas, juices, and sparkling ciders. It also includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as
non-alcoholic beers
