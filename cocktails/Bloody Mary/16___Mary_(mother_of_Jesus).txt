CHAPTER 4:
THE RACIAL ANALOGY
While there are significant differences between antiquated bans on interracial marriage and contemporaneous bans on same-sex marriage, the similarity in rhetoric which has been used to defend both is striking. Indeed, many of the same moral and religious arguments originally utilized to oppose miscegenation have simply been recycled in recent times and inserted into the gay marriage debate.
Take rhetoric which employs definitive assertions about “nature,” rhetoric which is all too commonly, if erroneously, relied upon to oppose gay marriage. Not surprisingly, claims about “nature” were also made by those who advocated miscegenation bans thirty years ago. In opposing the legalization of interracial marriage, for instance, the
Supreme Court of Georgia
held that:
Amalgamation of the races is… unnatural, [yielding offspring who are] generally sickly and effeminate, and… inferior in physical development and strength to the full-blood of either race.
Religious objections to same-sex marriage, frequently utilized by gay marriage opponents, also played a primary role in creating a moral justification for miscegenation bans. Take, for example, a Virginia trial judge’s religious objection to mixed-race marriages:
Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend the races to mix.
Finally, the “slippery slope” argument so often cited by gay marriage opponents originated, not surprisingly, in the miscegenation debate. Virginia courts declared, for instance, that interracial marriage, by definition, simply could not exist because it had theretofore “never been the ‘custom’ of the state to recognize mixed marriages, marriage ‘always’ having been construed to presuppose a different configuration.”  If these traditional customs changed, another court argued, America could not “preserve the racial integrity of its citizens,” nor prevent “the corruption of blood” and “a mongrel breed of citizens.”
Indeed, the fear which once surrounded a commingling of the races can not be overestimated in a country whose entire social order was founded upon notions of racial hierarchy and racial purity for the better part of its history. The legalization of miscegenation was thought to represent nothing less than the downfall of Western civilization, an overinflated claim which bears a striking resemblance to contemporary auguries about the legalization of gay marriage.
It should come as no surprise then that many African-American leaders are among the strongest supporters of gay marriage. When the
Mississippi House of Representatives
passed a measure in March 2004 to ban gay marriage via the state Constitution, only 17 legislators voted against the measure; every one of them were black. And in nearby Georgia, my current home, a similar measure handily passed through the
Georgia Senate , but it remarkably each and every one of the 10 black members of the Senate voted against it.
“We cannot keep turning our backs on gay and lesbian Americans. I have fought too hard and too long against discrimination based on race and color not to stand up against discrimination based on sexual orientation.” –
African-American Civil Rights
Leader, and Congressman, John Lewis.
HISTORY, RECYCLED
The current heated topic on the subject of gay rights lately seems center around the
Defense of Marriage Act , which would amend the Constitution of the
United States
to ban same-sex marriage. The topic, which has driven conservatives to the polls in mass droves, is widely seen as having helped
George W. Bush ’s re-election campaign. In understanding the amendment, one would be wise to recall another proposed amendment to the Constitution introduced in 1912. It stated: “ Intermarriage
between negros or persons of color and Caucasians …  within the United States … is forever prohibited.” i Representative
Seaborn Roddenberry
of Georgia, who proposed the amendment, argued in his appeal to Congress that: “Intermarriage between whites and blacks is repulsive and averse to every sentiment of pure American spirit. It is abhorrent and repugnant. It is subversive to social peace. It is destructive of moral supremacy… Sound familiar?

CHAPTER 3:
SEXISM
AND
GAY MARRIAGE
In recent years, feminist scholars and gay theorists have developed a body of thought which explores homophobia as a manifestation of sexism. One basic tenet of this line of thought is that strict
gender roles , hierarchically constructed, serve to subordinate women to men — economically, culturally, and politically.
In order to maintain the status quo, these gender roles must be strictly adhered to, an adhesion which is maintained by punishing
gender
non-conformity (effeminacy in men, tomboyish qualities in women) by labeling that non-conformity, stigmatizing it, as “queer.”
Sound confusing? Let’s break it down: Those who have ever watched adolescents on a playground will attest that the boy who wants to play hopscotch rather than baseball will be strictly, and often relentlessly, teased as a “faggot.”
Homophobia
thus promotes sexism — a fear of being labeled
homosexual
enforces strict adherence to gender roles, which in turn solidifies male dominance over women.
Deriving from this interplay between sexism and homophobia is a line of argumentation which attacks the ban on same-sex marriage not because it is homophobic, but rather because it is sexist. The
Supreme Court of Hawaii
illustrated this argument utilizing a simple analogy between a same-sex couple in Baehr v. Mike and a mixed-race couple in
Loving v. Virginia .
In Loving, the court argued, a black woman could
marry
a black man, but not a white man. The difference was race — indisputable racism. In Baehr, a woman could marry a man, but not a woman. The difference was sex — indisputable sexism.
On this basis, just as bans on miscegenation were outlawed as racist, the court argued that bans on gay marriage should be outlawed as sexist. Especially in those states which have adopted the
Equal Rights Amendment
and subject gender bias to the highest levels of scrutiny, reasoning which exposes the ban on gay marriage as a form of sex discrimination may bear great weight in convincing legislators or judges that same-sex marriage should be declared unconstitutional.

CHAPTER 1:
A MATTER OF JUSTICE
Imagine if tomorrow, Congress enacted a law denying Jews the right to raise children together in a legally protected relationship. Or if by act of law, African- American
couples who had lived together for years would no longer be permitted joint filing of tax returns, joint policies for their home, health or auto insurance.
Of course, this is a daily reality for millions of gay Americans. While it may not be readily apparent, marriage comes with a host of legal rights — 1,049 to be exact,1 ranging from the ability to collect
Social Security
survivor’s benefits to the right not to have to testify against a spouse in court. Listed below is a small sampling of some of these rights and benefits, each of which are currently denied to gay couples:
Priority in being appointed guardian of an incapacitated spouse or in being recognized as acting for an incapacitated spouse in making health care decisions
The right to invoke special state protection for “intrafamily offenses.”
The right to receive, or the obligation to provide, spousal support and (in the event of divorce) alimony and an equitable division of property.
The right to receive additional Social Security benefits based on a spouse’s contribution.
The right to spousal benefits guaranteed to public employees, including health insurance, life insurance and disability payments, plus similar contractual benefits for private sector employees.
The right to survivor’s benefits following the death of a veteran spouse.
Numerous rights relating to the involuntary hospitalization of a spouse, including the right to be notified, and the right to initiate proceedings leading to release.
The right to conjugal visits with a spouse who is incarcerated in prison.
The right to priority in claiming human remains and in making anatomical donations on behalf of a deceased spouse.
The right for a non-American spouse to qualify as an “immediate relative” and gain American citizenship under federal law.
The right to bring a lawsuit for the wrongful death of a spouse and for the intentional infliction of emotional distress through harm to a spouse.
The right to file a joint bankruptcy petition with a spouse.
The right to 59 distinct income tax deductions, credits, and exemptions.
A multitude of inheritance rights, including priority in inheriting the property of a spouse who dies without a will, the right to a family allowance, and the right to dower.
The denial of these rights to gay and lesbian couples is no academic matter – it has palpable consequences in everyday lives. Take, for example, the case of Holly Gunner, who began advocating for the right to marry when she came to realize that, in the eyes of the law, lifelong gay and lesbian couples could be treated as little more than roommates.
Following the death of Eileen, her partner of fifteen years, Holly discovered that she did not have the legal authority to carry out Eileen’s wishes to be cremated. In fact, she came to discover that doctors could even have barred her from seeing her dying spouse in the hospital. At work, Holly was not permitted to take bereavement leave. Then she was forced to pay taxes on Eileen’s property without any benefit of a marital tax deduction, and to make matters worse, even though Holly inherited most of Eileen’s estate, Eileen’s family refused to permit her to be the administrator of the estate.
“As if this wasn’t [sic] all galling enough,” Holly later told a reporter, “it was happening at the most painful, awful time in my life.” Holly’s story provides a stark reminder that granting 1,049 federal rights and privileges to one class of persons and categorically denying them to another is a gross violation of fundamental principles of equality. The fight for equal access to the institution of marriage is a fight for justice. Indeed, if our constitution’s promise of “equal protection under the law” stands for anything, it surely stands for the principle that if lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender citizens work and pay taxes, then they deserve the same financial and other benefits that all other Americans receive.
On February 27, 2004,
Rosie O’Donnell
traveled to
San Francisco
to wed her partner,
Kelli Carpenter . Appearing on Good Morning America, she explained that previously, during a court battle with the publisher of Rosie magazine, O’Donnell’s attorneys requested that communications between her and her partner be excluded from testimony. Although communications between a husband and wife routinely receive this “spousal privilege,” the court rejected her request. “As a result,” O’Donnell explained, “everything that I said to Kelli, every letter that I wrote her, every e-mail, every correspondence and conversation was entered into the record. After the trial, I am now and will forever be a total proponent of gay marriage.”
“The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.”  –

Loving v. Virginia

This message goes out to all the people using the
Bible
as a weapon against their own personal fears; to the all the people teaching their children to sings hateful song about things they are too young to understand; to all the evil priests that rape children and the cowardly priests that protect them, to all the under-educated mothers that
home school
their children to insure that they never get any smarter then them; to all the “christians” that picket
military funerals
for their own agenda; to all the people that quote words in a book as justification for not liking people as a way to not have to make their own decisions; and to all the thieves, liars, murderers, and bullies that use other people’s need of a higher power to advance their own personal greed.
You are not
Christians , as you are not christ-like.  You are a bastardization, a mutation, a cultification.  A watered-down, highly edited,
Cliff’s Notes , Game of Telephone, copy of a copy of a copy, of something that was probably pretty good.  Your hatred and buffet-style approach to the Bible only fuels your need for righteous judgement of others.  You are worse than someone that has no formed religious beliefs.
“I never said that.  I don’t know those people.” –
Jesus

Scott —
Today, I was asked a
direct question
and gave a direct answer:
I believe that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry.
I hope you’ll take a moment to watch the conversation, consider it, and weigh in yourself on behalf of
marriage equality :
http://my.barackobama.com/Marriage
I’ve always believed that
gay and lesbian
Americans
should be treated fairly and equally. I was reluctant to use the term marriage because of the very powerful traditions it evokes. And I thought
civil union
laws that conferred
legal rights
upon gay and lesbian couples were a solution.
But over the course of several years I’ve talked to friends and family about this. I’ve thought about members of my staff in long-term, committed,
same-sex relationships
who are raising kids together. Through our efforts to end the “ Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell ” policy, I’ve gotten to know some of the gay and lesbian troops who are serving our country with honor and distinction.
What I’ve come to realize is that for loving, same-sex couples, the denial of marriage equality means that, in their eyes and the eyes of their children, they are still considered less than full citizens.
Even at my own dinner table, when I look at
Sasha
and Malia, who have friends whose parents are same-sex couples, I know it wouldn’t dawn on them that their friends’ parents should be treated differently.
So I decided it was time to affirm my personal belief that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry.
I respect the beliefs of others, and the right of religious institutions to act in accordance with their own doctrines. But I believe that in the eyes of the law, all Americans should be treated equally. And where states enact same-sex marriage, no federal act should invalidate them.
Thank you,
Barack

The Easter Bunny or Easter Rabbit is a character depicted as a rabbit bringing
Easter eggs , who sometimes is depicted with clothes. In legend, the creature brings baskets filled with colored eggs, candy and sometimes also toys to the homes of children, and as such shows similarities to
Father Christmas , as they both bring gifts to children on the night before their respective holiday. It was first mentioned in Georg Franck von
Frankenau ‘s De ovis paschalibus (About Easter Eggs) in 1682 referring to an
Alsace
tradition of an
Easter Hare
bringing Easter Eggs.
The hare was a popular motif in medieval church art. In ancient times it was widely believed that the hare was hermaphrodite. The idea that a hare could reproduce without loss of virginity led to an association with the
Virgin Mary , with
hares
sometimes occurring in illuminated manuscripts and
Northern European
paintings of the Virgin and
Christ Child .
Eggs, like rabbits and hares, are fertility symbols of antiquity. Since birds lay eggs and rabbits and hares give birth to large litters in the early spring, these became symbols of the rising fertility of the earth at the
Vernal Equinox .

Dear Princeton Law School
Early-1957, Harvey Wax — a young man hoping to one day become a
lawyer
— sent an
application letter
to
Princeton University ‘s Law School and crossed his fingers. A short time later, he received the following
rejection letter . It never fails to amuse me.
It’s worth noting that Mr. Wax subsequently applied to
Harvard’s
Law School, was far more successful, and to this day works as a lawyer.

PRINCETON UNIVERSITY

Dear Mr. Wax:
In reply to your recent letter, I regret that we must inform you that Princeton University has no Law School.
Sincerely yours,
(Signed)
