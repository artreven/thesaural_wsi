About Vodka
Octal Process, in short means it need only go through filtering and purification 3 times, to achieve the clear smooth taste, with less loss of proof! However the oxen injection process removes more impurities than most competitors standard industry technique of 5-6 excessive filtering's and   leave our competitors products flat and harsh.   Gera Vodka  has the smoothest flavor of any Vodka we've tested to date!  Try if for yourself and make your own comparison.
Vodka   Polish :  wódka , ( Russian :  водка ,  Czech :  vodka ,  Slovak :  vodka ) is a  distilled beverage  and one of the world's most popular liquors. It is composed primarily of water and  ethanol  with traces of impurities and flavorings. Vodka is made from  fermented  substances like  grain  and potatoes . For a liquor to be denominated  vodka , governments often establish a minimum alcohol content. Vodka's alcoholic content usually ranges between 35–70% by volume. The standard  Polish ,  Russian  and  Lithuanian  vodkas are 40% alcohol by volume (80  proof ). The  European Union   has established a minimum of 37.5% alcohol by volume content for any  European vodka  to be named as such.   Vodka may be distilled from any  starch / sugar -rich plant matter; most vodka today is produced from  grains  such as  sorghum ,  corn ,  rye  or  wheat . Among grain vodkas, rye and wheat vodkas are generally considered superior. Some vodkas are made from  potatoes ,  molasses ,  soybeans ,  grapes ,  rice ,  sugar beets  and sometimes even byproducts of oil refining or wood pulp processing. In some Central European countries like Poland some vodka is produced by just fermenting a solution of crystal sugar and yeast. In the  European Union  there are talks about the standardization of vodka, and the  Vodka Belt  countries insist that only spirits produced from grains,  potato  and  sugar beet   molasses  be allowed to be branded as "vodka", following the traditional methods of production Vodka is traditionally drunk  straight up  in the  vodka belt  countries of  Eastern Europe  and around the  Baltic Sea . It is also commonly used in cocktails  and mixed drinks, such as the  Bloody Mary , the  Screwdriver , the  Sex on the Beach , the  White Russian , the  vodka tonic , and the  vodka martini .
