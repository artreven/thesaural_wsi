Welcome to UAI Forum's One-Page-A-Day Online Study Session Today's Presentation Is From: PAPER 86 - EARLY EVOLUTION OF RELIGION [Introduction] P.950 - §1 The evolution of religion from the preceding and primitive worship urge is not dependent on revelation. The normal functioning of the human mind under the directive influence of the sixth and seventh mind-adjutants of universal spirit bestowal is wholly sufficient to insure such development. P.950 - §2 Man's earliest prereligious fear of the forces of nature gradually became religious as nature became personalized, spiritized, and eventually deified in human consciousness. Religion of a primitive type was therefore a natural biologic consequence of the psychologic inertia of evolving animal minds after such minds had once entertained concepts of the supernatural. *** [Each OPAD presentation is copied from

. Greetings Fellow Students, Forum Members and Guests,
Welcome to the opening page of Paper 86, the second of five on the early developments of a religious nature among primitive peoples. All five Papers were "presented" by a
Brilliant Evening Star
77 years ago in Chicago.
BES's are "superangels" of the local universe of Nebadon, siblings of Gabriel who were all created by the Father and Mother of this local creation, Michael and the Divine Minister. Michael later incarnated as Jesus right here on planet Urantia. Overview of
Paper 86:
Early Evolution of Religion
1. Chance: Good Luck and Bad Luck 2. The Personification of Chance 3. Death — The Inexplicable 4. The Death-Survival Concept 5. The Ghost-Soul Concept 6. The Ghost-Spirit Environment 7. The Function of Primitive Religion
[Presented by a Brilliant Evening Star of Nebadon.] A Synopsis of Paper 86: Early Evolution of Religion Primitive people lived in constant danger. Their struggle for survival depended on factors over which they had no control. Chance played such a large role in early human life that people lived in continuous anxiety. Most people died violently; natural deaths were so unusual that people thought they were caused by spirits.
Helplessness against the forces of nature impelled early man to seek to understand supernatural phenomena. Belief in the afterlife began when people dreamt of deceased tribesmen. Belief in the soul started when men observed that breath was present in living creatures but not in the dead; they speculated that the breath lived on as a ghost after death. Disembodied ghosts were thought to be responsible for all inexplicable events. Primitive people thought that the soul could escape the body during fainting, sleeping, comas, death, or sneezing. Dreams were thought to be adventures of the soul. People believed that disembodied souls could enter animals and inanimate objects. Shadows were feared and mirrors were regarded with superstition.
The religion of ghost fear led people to believe that a spirit world controlled human destiny and that they could appease the spirits by regulating personal conduct. Rituals helped to relieve people from their unrelenting fears by helping them believe that they had the power to influence their own fate.
The idea that specific actions could help one avoid angering wandering ghosts was the seed of the concept of right and wrong. From this humble beginning, human ethics were born. Mortal minds began to prepare for the bestowal of true spirit forces, the indwelling fragments of God who have labored ceaselessly to transform the fear of God into the love of God.

So, religious impulse is more or less an automatic response in primitive humans. The words "psychologic inertia" suggest a slowing, or retrogression, after an initial surge, no? *** In the first Section of this Paper, tomorrow's OPAD reading, the BES tells of the very roots of religious belief, man's peculiar fascinations and ruminations around an unknowable fate. Section 1 is titled:

Hi Rick and all. (950.1) 86:0.1 THE evolution of religion from the preceding and primitive worship urge is not dependent on revelation. The normal functioning of the human mind under the directive influence of the sixth and seventh mind-adjutants of universal spirit bestowal is wholly sufficient to insure such development. In my opinion is to take into account that the worship and wisdom spirits acts of
in all the mind, even in those primitive. This point has been a source of confusion because often we believe that gaining wisdom applies only to the most advanced;
Great Sage. I also thought so, but it seems to work according to the evolutionary potential of each level, to reach their full potential. It would be the Ideal. The normal functioning of the human mind under the directive influence of the sixth and seventh mind-adjutants of universal spirit bestowal is wholly sufficient to insure such development"
This means, therefore, what we always say about the importance of a generation to lay the groundwork for the next and successively...The generations should do their utmost to ensure the continued growth, without interruption. Otherwise, progress will stagnate. Some beings sages of antiquity, laid the foundation for humanity later in an attempt to emulate it strive to improve their skills in all disciplines, for example, the great Renaissance artists. The main problem arises when one party stops at some level, whether religious, scientific, social... ..and not advancing by the effects of uneven growth. (909.8) 81:6.27
Ideals elevate the source of the social stream. And no stream will rise any higher than its source no matter what technique of pressure or directional control may be employed. The driving power of even the most material aspects of a cultural civilization is resident in the least material of society’s achievements. Intelligence may control the mechanism of civilization, wisdom may direct it,
but spiritual idealism is the energy which really uplifts and advances human culture from one level of attainment to another. (910.1) 81:6.28
At first life was a struggle for existence; now, for a standard of living;
next it will be for quality of thinking, the coming earthly goal of human existenc e. Greetings to all! Alina ***

Welcome to UAI Forum's One-Page-A-Day Online Study Session Today's Presentation Is From: PAPER 86 - EARLY EVOLUTION OF RELIGION 1. CHANCE: GOOD LUCK AND BAD LUCK P.950 - §3 Aside from the natural worship urge, early evolutionary religion had its roots of origin in the human experiences of chance--so-called luck, commonplace happenings. Primitive man was a food hunter. The results of hunting must ever vary, and this gives certain origin to those experiences which man interprets as
good luck
and
bad luck . Mischance was a great factor in the lives of men and women who lived constantly on the ragged edge of a precarious and harassed existence. P.950 - §4 The limited intellectual horizon of the savage so concentrates the attention upon chance that luck becomes a constant factor in his life. Primitive Urantians struggled for existence, not for a standard of living; they lived lives of peril in which chance played an important role. The constant dread of unknown and unseen calamity hung over these savages as a cloud of despair which effectively eclipsed every pleasure; they lived in constant dread of doing something that would bring bad luck. Superstitious savages always feared a run of good luck; they viewed such good fortune as a certain harbinger of calamity. P.950 - §5 This ever-present dread of bad luck was paralyzing. Why work hard and reap bad luck--nothing for something--when one might drift along and encounter good luck--something for nothing? Unthinking men forget good luck--take it for granted--but they painfully remember bad luck. P.950 - §6 Early man lived in uncertainty and in constant fear of chance--bad luck. Life was an exciting game of chance; existence was a gamble. It is no wonder that partially civilized people still believe in chance and evince lingering predispositions to gambling. Primitive man alternated between two potent interests: the passion of getting something for nothing and the fear of getting nothing for something. And this gamble of existence was the main interest and the supreme fascination of the early savage mind. P.951 - §1 The later herders held the same views of chance and luck, while the still later agriculturists were increasingly conscious that crops were immediately influenced by many things over which man had little or no control. The farmer found himself the victim of drought, floods, hail, storms, pests, and plant diseases, as well as heat and cold. And as all of these natural influences affected individual prosperity, they were regarded as good luck or bad luck. P.951 - §2 This notion of chance and luck strongly pervaded the philosophy of all ancient peoples. Even in recent times in the Wisdom of Solomon it is said: "I returned and saw that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither bread to the wise, nor riches to men of understanding, nor favor to men of skill; but fate and chance befall them all. For man knows not his fate; as fishes are taken in an evil net, and as birds are caught in a snare, so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when it falls suddenly upon them." *** [Each OPAD presentation is copied from

. Greetings Fellow Students, Forum Members and Guests, Agree Alina. We now know uneven growth has always plagued Urantia and created every kind of havoc. The cause is of course ignorance and fear, both of which we acquired honestly.
Primitive humans are naturally ignorant, it's part of our evolution. Fear comes from the insecurity of not knowing one's own mind, much less the apparently strange, often cruel and unfair, circumstances of nature. Ignorance, fear and happenstance are every human's greatest oppressors. Our demons, our troubles and triumphs are our own creations, though we so often attribute them to chance, to good and bad fortune, eh? Just like modern day gambling casinos, man originally set up the game so he can't possibly win! ...Superstitious savages always feared a run of good luck; they viewed such good fortune as a certain harbinger of calamity.... P.950 - 4 *** Luck is still a prominent feature of humanity's mindset, even if religious leaders denounce it: 	Buddhism Gautama Buddha ,
the founder
of
Buddhism , taught his followers not to believe in luck. The view which was taught by Gautama Buddha states that all things which happen must have a cause, either material or spiritual, and do not occur due to luck, chance or fate. The idea of moral causality,
karma
( Pali : kamma), is central in Buddhism. In the
Sutta Nipata , the Buddha is recorded as having said the following about selling luck: Whereas some religious men, while living of food provided by the faithful make their living by such low arts, such wrong means of livelihood as palmistry, divining by signs, interpreting dreams ... bringing good or bad luck ... invoking the goodness of luck ... picking the lucky site for a building, the monk Gautama refrains from such low arts, such wrong means of livelihood. D.I, 9–12 [11] However belief in luck is prevalent in many predominantly Buddhist countries. In
Thailand , Buddhists may wear verses (takrut) or lucky amulets which have been blessed by monks for protection against harm. Hinduism In
Hinduism
it is said that by proper worship, with a meticulous prayer procedure (Sanskrit: Shri Lakshmi Sahasranam Pujan Vidhi) the blessings of
Lakshmi , the Hindu goddess of money and fortune, may be obtained. Lakshmi Parayan (prayer) is performed in most Hindu homes on the day of
Diwali , the festival of lights. At that time also
Rangoli
are drawn, decorative designs on floors of living rooms and courtyards during Hindu festivals that are meant as a sacred welcoming area for the luck. Islam There is no concept of luck in
Islam [13]
other than actions determined by God (Allah) based on the merit of the choice made by human beings, and God alone has power over all things ( divine decree ). It is stated in the
Qur'an
( Sura :
Adh-Dhariyat
(The Wind that Scatter) verse:22) that one's sustenance is pre-determined in heaven when the Lord says: "And in the heaven is your provision and that which ye are promised." However, one should supplicate towards God to better one's life rather than hold faith in un-Islamic acts such as using "lucky charms". 1927 advertisement for lucky jeweler. "Why Be Unlucky?".

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luck *** The rank unfairness of life was eloquently pointed to by Solomon and recorded in the Christian Bible: "...I returned and saw that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither bread to the wise, nor riches to men of understanding, nor favor to men of skill; but fate and chance befall them all. For man knows not his fate; as fishes are taken in an evil net, and as birds are caught in a snare, so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when it falls suddenly upon them...." P.951 - 2 The quotes above and below are from Ecclesiastes 9:11: E nglish Standard Version
(©2001) Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and chance happen to them all. New American Standard Bible
(©1995) I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift and the battle is not to the warriors, and neither is bread to the wise nor wealth to the discerning nor favor to men of ability; for time and chance overtake them all. King James Bible (Cambridge Ed.) I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race
is
not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. Source:
http://bible.cc/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm *** A sidenote about the "Wisdom of Solomon" (which the Brilliant Evening Star author capitalized): ...The
Book of Wisdom , often referred to simply as
Wisdom
or the
Book of the Wisdom of Solomon , is one of the
deuterocanonical
books of the
Bible . It is one of the seven
Sapiential
or wisdom books of the
Septuagint
Old Testament , which includes
Job ,
Psalms ,
Proverbs ,
Ecclesiastes ,
Song of Solomon
(Song of Songs), and
Sirach . Source:
http://en.wikipedia..../Book_of_Wisdom ...The Hebrew Bible credits Solomon as the builder of the
First Temple
in Jerusalem, [3]
and portrays him as great in wisdom, wealth, and power, but ultimately as a king whose sin, including
idolatry
and turning away from
Yahweh , leads to the kingdom being torn in two during the reign of his son
Rehoboam . [4]
Solomon is the subject of many other later references and legends. Source/more:

Welcome to UAI Forum's One-Page-A-Day Online Study Session Today's Presentation Is From: PAPER 86 - EARLY EVOLUTION OF RELIGION 2. THE PERSONIFICATION OF CHANCE P.951 - §3 Anxiety was a natural state of the savage mind. When men and women fall victims to excessive anxiety, they are simply reverting to the natural estate of their far-distant ancestors; and when anxiety becomes actually painful, it inhibits activity and unfailingly institutes evolutionary changes and biologic adaptations. Pain and suffering are essential to progressive evolution. P.951 - §4 The struggle for life is so painful that certain backward tribes even yet howl and lament over each new sunrise. Primitive man constantly asked, "Who is tormenting me?" Not finding a material source for his miseries, he settled upon a spirit explanation. And so was religion born of the fear of the mysterious, the awe of the unseen, and the dread of the unknown. Nature fear thus became a factor in the struggle for existence first because of chance and then because of mystery. P.951 - §5 The primitive mind was logical but contained few ideas for intelligent association; the savage mind was uneducated, wholly unsophisticated. If one event followed another, the savage considered them to be cause and effect. What civilized man regards as superstition was just plain ignorance in the savage. Mankind has been slow to learn that there is not necessarily any relationship between purposes and results. Human beings are only just beginning to realize that the reactions of existence appear between acts and their consequences. The savage strives to personalize everything intangible and abstract, and thus both nature and chance become personalized as ghosts--spirits--and later on as gods. P.951 - §6 Man naturally tends to believe that which he deems best for him, that which is in his immediate or remote interest; self-interest largely obscures logic. The difference between the minds of savage and civilized men is more one of content than of nature, of degree rather than of quality. P.951 - §7 But to continue to ascribe things difficult of comprehension to supernatural causes is nothing less than a lazy and convenient way of avoiding all forms of intellectual hard work. Luck is merely a term coined to cover the inexplicable in any age of human existence; it designates those phenomena which men are unable or unwilling to penetrate. Chance is a word which signifies that man is too ignorant or too indolent to determine causes. Men regard a natural occurrence as an accident or as bad luck only when they are destitute of curiosity and imagination, when the races lack initiative and adventure. Exploration of the phenomena of life sooner or later destroys man's belief in chance, luck, and so-called accidents, substituting therefor a universe of law and order wherein all effects are preceded by definite causes. Thus is the fear of existence replaced by the joy of living. P.952 - §1 The savage looked upon all nature as alive, as possessed by something. Civilized man still kicks and curses those inanimate objects which get in his way and bump him. Primitive man never regarded anything as accidental; always was everything intentional. To primitive man the domain of fate, the function of luck, the spirit world, was just as unorganized and haphazard as was primitive society. Luck was looked upon as the whimsical and temperamental reaction of the spirit world; later on, as the humor of the gods. P.952 - §2 But all religions did not develop from animism. Other concepts of the supernatural were contemporaneous with animism, and these beliefs also led to worship. Naturalism is not a religion--it is the offspring of religion. *** [Each OPAD presentation is copied from

. Greetings Fellow Students, Forum Members and Guests, Here we have it, an unambiguous admission from our Celestial cousins, a statement from those who know the process of evolutionary progress so very well, that life hurts. And not only that but hurt is necessarily designed into the process: ...Pain and suffering are essential to progressive evolution.... P.951 - 3 But the pangs of the birth of society do bring forth a new child, one of great promise--religion: ...And so was religion born of the fear of the mysterious, the awe of the unseen, and the dread of the unknown.... P.951 - 4 Other authors point to the inevitability of suffering. From Paper 3:5: ...Is
pleasure --the satisfaction of happiness--desirable? Then must man live in a world where the alternative of pain and the likelihood of suffering are ever-present experiential possibilities.... P.51 - 13 From Paper 9:1: ...The universe of your origin is being forged out between the anvil of justice and the hammer of suffering; but those who wield the hammer are the children of mercy, the spirit offspring of the Infinite Spirit.... P.100 - 2 And Buddhism was BUILT around suffering. From 94:8: ...The original gospel of Gautama was based on the four noble truths: 1. The noble truths of suffering. 2. The origins of suffering. 3. The destruction of suffering. 4. The way to the destruction of suffering. But there is an end to most suffering, albeit in Urantia's somewhat remote future. Indeed, right now suffering might be at it's peak, what with 7 billion people and growing, life is becoming cheaper everyday. Cheapened life always means increased child labor, broken families and early death, endless pain.
Obviously Urantia will have to change in many ways before suffering begins to abate, begins to transform itself in the joy of living merely by the sunshine of God's light and love. No one said planetary evolution from abject ignorance to total enlightenment is a stroll in the park. And certainly not on an experimental planet where two Sons sent by Michael defaulted in their sacred trust, thereby leaving Urantia open to even more suffering than would be had they kept their oaths. *** Here the Brilliant Evening Star seems to be saying if a savage's child could somehow be raised with moderns, he or she would become a modern, eh? ...The difference between the minds of savage and civilized men is more one of content than of nature, of degree rather than of quality.... P.951 - 6
Fortunately life is not ALL suffering, but it takes good science and intelligent religion to create the conditions where suffering can be eased, even replaced with its opposite: ...Exploration of the phenomena of life sooner or later destroys man's belief in chance, luck, and so-called accidents, substituting therefor a universe of law and order wherein all effects are preceded by definite causes. Thus is the fear of existence replaced by the joy of living.... P.952 - 0 *** But primitive man got one thing right apparently: ...Primitive man never regarded anything as accidental; always was everything intentional.... P.952 - 1 Compare with this from Paper 48:7: ...Blind and unforeseen accidents do not occur in the cosmos.... P.556 - 9 *** About "Animism": ... Animism
(from
Latin
anima
" soul ,
life ") refers to the belief that non-human entities are spiritual beings, or at least embody some kind of life-principle.
Animism encompasses the beliefs that there is no separation between the
spiritual
and physical (or
material ) world, and
souls
or
spirits
exist, not only in
humans , but also in all other
animals ,
plants ,
rocks , natural phenomena such as
thunder ,
geographic
features such as
mountains
or
rivers , or other entities of the natural environment.
Animism may further attribute souls to abstract concepts such as words,
true names , or metaphors in
mythology . Examples of Animism can be found in forms of
Shinto ,
Hinduism ,
Buddhism ,
Pantheism ,
Paganism , and
Neopaganism . Throughout European history, philosophers such as
Aristotle
and
Thomas Aquinas , among others, contemplated the possibility that souls exist in animals, plants, and people; however, the currently accepted definition of animism was only developed in the 19th century by
Sir Edward Tylor , who created it as "one of
anthropology 's earliest concepts, if not the first". According to the anthropologist
Tim Ingold , animism shares similarities to
totemism
but differs in its focus on individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source, such as the land itself or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups such as the
Australian Aborigines
are more typically totemic, whereas others like the
Inuit
are more typically animistic in their worldview. ...Animism is a belief held in many religions around the world, and is not, as some have purported, a type of religion in itself. It is a belief, such as
shamanism ,
polytheism
or
monotheism , that is found in several religions. In modern usage, the term is sometimes used improperly as a catch-all classification of "other world religions" alongside major organized religions.
Origin of religion Some theories have been put forward that the anthropocentric belief in animism among early humans was the basis for the later evolution of religions. In one such theory, put forward by Sir E. B. Tylor, early humans initially, through mere observation, recognized what might be called a soul, life-force, spirit, breath or animus within themselves; that which was present in the body in life and absent in death. These early humans equated this soul with figures which would appear in dreams and visions. These early human cultures later interpreted these spirits to be present in animals, the living plant world, and even in natural objects in a form of animism. Eventually, these early humans grew to believe that the spirits were invested and interested in human life, and performed rituals to propitiate them. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of “developed” religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced the society, the less that society believed in Animism; however, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented “survivals” of the original animism of early humanity.{{ link }}
World view In many animistic world views found in
hunter-gatherer
cultures, the human being is often regarded as on a roughly equal footing with other animals, plants, and natural forces. [13] [ page needed ]
Therefore, it is morally imperative to treat these agents with respect. In this world view, humans are considered a part of nature, rather than superior to, or separate from it. In such societies, ritual is considered essential for survival, as it wins the favor of the spirits of one's source of food, shelter, and fertility and wards off malevolent spirits. In more elaborate animistic religions, such as
Shinto , there is a greater sense of a special character to humans that sets them apart from the general run of animals and objects, while retaining the necessity of ritual to ensure good luck, favorable harvests, and so on.
Death Most animistic belief systems hold that the spirit survives physical death. In some systems [ which? ] , the spirit is believed to pass to an easier world of abundant game or ever-ripe crops, while in other systems, the spirit remains on earth as a ghost, often malignant. Still other systems combine these two beliefs, holding that the soul must journey to the spirit world without becoming lost and thus wandering as a ghost ( e.g. , the
Navajo
religion).
Funeral ,
mourning
rituals, and ancestor worship performed by those surviving the deceased are often considered necessary for the successful completion of this journey. From the belief in the survival of the dead arose the practice of offering food, lighting fires, etc., at the grave, at first, maybe, as an act of friendship or filial piety, later as an act of
ancestor worship . The simple offering of food or shedding of blood at the grave develops into an elaborate system of
sacrifice . Even where ancestor worship is not found, the desire to provide the dead with comforts in the future life may lead to the sacrifice of wives, slaves, animals, and so on, to the breaking or burning of objects at the grave or to provide the
ferryman's
toll: a coin placed on each eye of the corpse to pay the traveling expenses of the soul; and, a piece of honeyed bread in the mouth to distract the three-headed dog/demon Cerberus long enough for the soul to pass it. But all is not finished with the passage of the soul to the land of the dead. The soul may return to avenge its death by helping to discover the murderer, or to wreak vengeance for itself. There is a widespread belief that those who die a violent death become malignant spirits and endanger the lives of those who come near the haunted spot. In Malay folklore, the woman who dies in childbirth becomes a
pontianak , a vampire-like spirit who threatens the life of human beings. People resort to magical or religious means of repelling spiritual dangers from such malignant spirits. It is not surprising to find that many peoples respect and even worship animals (see
totem
or
animal worship ), often regarding them as relatives. It is clear that widespread respect was paid to animals as the abode of dead ancestors, and much of the
cults
to dangerous animals is traceable to this principle; though there is no need to attribute an animistic origin to it. [14] The practice of
head shrinking
among
Jivaroan
and
Urarina
peoples derives from an animistic belief that if the spirits of one's mortal enemies (i.e., the nemesis of one's being) are not trapped within the head, they can escape slain bodies. After the spirit
transmigrates
to another body, they can take the form of a
predatory
animal and even exact revenge.
Mythology A large part of mythology is based upon a belief in souls and spirits — that is, upon animism in its more general sense.
Urarina
myths that portray plants, inanimate objects, and non-human animals as personal beings are examples of animism in its more restrictive sense. [15] However, many mythologies focus largely on corporeal beings rather than "spiritual" ones; the latter may even be entirely absent. Stories of transformation,
deluge
and doom myths, and myths of the origin of death do not necessarily have any animistic basis. As mythology began to include more numerous and complex ideas about a future life and purely spiritual beings, the overlap between mythology and animism widened. However, a rich mythology does not necessarily depend on a belief in many spiritual beings.
Distinction from Pantheism Animism is not the same as Pantheism, although the two are sometimes confused. Some faiths and religions are even both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In Pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits and/or souls.

Welcome to UAI Forum's One-Page-A-Day Online Study Session Today's Presentation Is From: PAPER 86 - EARLY EVOLUTION OF RELIGION 3. DEATH--THE INEXPLICABLE P.952 - §3 Death was the supreme shock to evolving man, the most perplexing combination of chance and mystery. Not the sanctity of life but the shock of death inspired fear and thus effectively fostered religion. Among savage peoples death was ordinarily due to violence, so that nonviolent death became increasingly mysterious. Death as a natural and expected end of life was not clear to the consciousness of primitive people, and it has required age upon age for man to realize its inevitability. P.952 - §4 Early man accepted life as a fact, while he regarded death as a visitation of some sort. All races have their legends of men who did not die, vestigial traditions of the early attitude toward death. Already in the human mind there existed the nebulous concept of a hazy and unorganized spirit world, a domain whence came all that is inexplicable in human life, and death was added to this long list of unexplained phenomena. P.952 - §5 All human disease and natural death was at first believed to be due to spirit influence. Even at the present time some civilized races regard disease as having been produced by "the enemy" and depend upon religious ceremonies to effect healing. Later and more complex systems of theology still ascribe death to the action of the spirit world, all of which has led to such doctrines as original sin and the fall of man. P.952 - §6 It was the realization of impotency before the mighty forces of nature, together with the recognition of human weakness before the visitations of sickness and death, that impelled the savage to seek for help from the supermaterial world, which he vaguely visualized as the source of these mysterious vicissitudes of life.

. Greetings Fellow Students, Forum Members and Guests, ...Death as a natural and expected end of life was not clear to the consciousness of primitive people, and it has required age upon age for man to realize its inevitability.... P.952 - 3
So why does man automatically fear and attempt to avoid death? Because he knows not what lies beyond it? Because trying to hang onto this life is better than going into the unknown? Just as primitive man was shocked by the inevitability of death, I was shocked to find death is avoidable, by fusion! From Paper 112:7: ...Fusion with the Adjuster is usually effected while the ascender is resident within his local system. It may occur on the planet of nativity as a transcendence of natural death....
P.1237 - 5
*** ...Even at the present time some civilized races regard disease as having been produced by "the enemy" and depend upon religious ceremonies to effect healing.... P.952 - 5
So called "faith healing" is still being practiced today. No doubt Jesus' healing certain individuals influenced his followers, led them to attempt what he did. From Wikipedia: ...Faith healing
is healing through spiritual means. Believers assert that the
healing
of a person can be brought about by religious
faith
through
prayer
and/or
rituals
that, according to adherents, stimulate a
divine presence
and
power
toward correcting
disease
and
disability . Belief in divine intervention in illness or healing is related to religious belief. [1]
In common usage,
faith healing
refers to notably overt and ritualistic practices of communal prayer and gestures (such as
laying on of hands ) that are claimed to solicit divine intervention in initiating spiritual and literal healing. Claims that prayer, divine intervention, or the ministrations of an individual healer can cure illness have been popular throughout history. [2]
Miraculous recoveries
have been attributed to many techniques commonly lumped together as "faith healing". It can involve prayer, a visit to a religious shrine, or simply a strong belief in a supreme being. [3] The term is best known in connection with
Christianity . Some people interpret the Bible, especially the
New Testament , as teaching belief in, and practice of, faith healing. There have been claims that faith can cure blindness, deafness, cancer, AIDS, developmental disorders, anemia, arthritis, corns, defective speech, multiple sclerosis, skin rashes, total body paralysis, and various injuries. [3] Unlike faith healing, advocates of
spiritual healing
make no attempt to seek divine intervention, supporting an underlying belief system concerning
Humanity 's access to
divine
energy. The increased interest in
alternative medicine
at the end of the twentieth century has given rise to a parallel interest among sociologists in the relationship of religion to health. [1] The
American Cancer Society
states "available scientific evidence does not support claims that faith healing can actually cure physical ailments." [3]
"Death, disability, and other unwanted outcomes have occurred when faith healing was elected instead of medical care for serious injuries or illnesses." Source/much more:
http://en.wikipedia....i/Faith_healing *** About the "fall of man" and "original sin": The Fall: In
Christian doctrine , the
fall of man , or simply the
fall , refers to the transition of the first humans from a state of innocent obedience to
God
to a state of guilty disobedience to God. In
Genesis
chapter 3,
Adam and Eve
live at first with God in a
paradise , but the
serpent
tempts them into eating the
fruit
from the
tree of knowledge of good and evil , which God forbade. After doing so they become ashamed of their nakedness and God consequently expelled them from
paradise . The Fall is not mentioned by name in the
Bible , but the story of disobedience and expulsion is recounted in both
Testaments
in different ways. The fall can refer to the wider theological inferences for all humankind as a consequence of Eve and Adam's
original sin . Examples include the teachings of
Paul
in
Romans 5:12–19
and
1 Cor. 15:21–22 . Most
Christian denominations
believe that the fall corrupted the entire
natural world , including human nature, causing people to be born into
original sin , a state from which they cannot attain
eternal life
without the
gracious intervention of God .
Protestants
hold that
Jesus 's death was a
"ransom"
by which humanity was offered freedom from the sin acquired at the fall. In other religions, such as
Judaism ,
Islam , and
Gnosticism , the term "the fall" is not recognised and varying interpretations of the Eden narrative are presented. The term " prelapsarian " refers to the sin-free state of humanity prior to the fall. It is sometimes used in reference to sentimental recollections of a past time when conditions stood in sharp contrast to the present; this situation is called
nostalgia . Source/more:
http://en.wikipedia....iki/Fall_of_man ...Original sin
is, according to a Christian theological doctrine, humanity's state of
sin
resulting from the
Fall of Man . This condition has been characterized in many ways, ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a "sin nature", to something as drastic as
total depravity
or automatic guilt of all humans through
collective guilt . The doctrine is not found in
Judaism ; [4]
its scriptural foundation is in the
New Testament
teaching of
Paul the Apostle . ( Romans 5:12-21
and
1 Corinthians 15:22 ) [2]
It began to be developed by the 2nd-century Bishop of
Lyon
Irenaeus
in his controversy with the
dualist
Gnostics . In the theology of the
Catholic Church , original sin is regarded as the general condition of
sinfulness , that is (the absence of holiness and perfect charity) into which humans are born, distinct from the
actual sins
that a person commits. This teaching explicitly states that "original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants". [5]
In other words, human beings do not bear any "original guilt" from Adam's particular sin, which is his alone. The prevailing view, also held in Eastern Orthodoxy, is that human beings bear no guilt for the sin of Adam. Orthodoxy prefers using the term "ancestral sin", [6] [7]
which indicates that "original sin is hereditary. It did not remain only Adam and Eve's. As life passes from them to all of their descendants, so does original sin " [8]
In this quotation, "original sin" is used not of the personal sin of Adam, which is his alone and is not transmitted, but in reference to the "distortion of the nature of man", which is inherited. An important exposition of the belief of Eastern Christians identifies original sin as physical and spiritual death, the spiritual death being the loss of "the grace of God, which quickened (the soul) with the higher and spiritual life". [9]
Others see original sin also as the cause of
actual sins
although, in this view, original and actual sin may be difficult to distinguish. The fall depicted in the
Sistine Chapel
by
Michelangelo Source/more:
http://en.wikipedia....ki/Original_sin *** Unavoidable illnesses, endless torment and bad luck, the eventual and inevitable termination of life, all helped create belief in ghost-life after death, even heaven and hell for the good and the bad--these are the beginnings of religious thinking in our ancestors, and the subjects of tomorrow's reading.

Hi all! Thanks... Rick!
(952.6)
86:3.4
It was the realization of impotency before the mighty forces of nature, together with the recognition of human weakness before the visitations of sickness and death, that impelled the savage to seek for help from the supermaterial world, which he vaguely visualized as the source of these mysterious vicissitudes of life. The Wisdom of evolution acting, without skipping even one step! Since the total ignorance is born the urge to know, in this case the search for an invisible source as the cause of natural death. By this way, they came to blame sin
to explain death and then to the sacrifice to explain the sin. Many hardships! for to be here today, and have the possibility we are writing about Fifth Revelation!
A long way behind. They live in our memories. Not forgetting that even today there are beings in precarious state. "Among certain backward tribes, human sacrifice is still carried on by volunteers, a sort of religious or ritual suicide(980.7)" (975.6) 89:2.2
As the savage mind evolved to that point where it envisaged both good and bad spirits, and when the taboo received the solemn sanction of evolving religion, the stage was all set for the appearance of the new conception of sin. The idea of sin was universally established in the world before revealed religion ever made its entry. It was only by the concept of sin that natural death became logical to the primitive mind. Sin was the transgression of taboo, and death was the penalty of sin. Love Alina ***

Welcome to UAI Forum's One-Page-A-Day Online Study Session Today's Presentation Is From: PAPER 86 - EARLY EVOLUTION OF RELIGION 4. THE DEATH-SURVIVAL CONCEPT P.952 - §7 The concept of a supermaterial phase of mortal personality was born of the unconscious and purely accidental association of the occurrences of everyday life plus the ghost dream. The simultaneous dreaming about a departed chief by several members of his tribe seemed to constitute convincing evidence that the old chief had really returned in some form. It was all very real to the savage who would awaken from such dreams reeking with sweat, trembling, and screaming. P.953 - §1 The dream origin of the belief in a future existence explains the tendency always to imagine unseen things in the terms of things seen. And presently this new dream-ghost-future-life concept began effectively to antidote the death fear associated with the biologic instinct of self-preservation. P.953 - §2 Early man was also much concerned about his breath, especially in cold climates, where it appeared as a cloud when exhaled. The
breath of life
was regarded as the one phenomenon which differentiated the living and the dead. He knew the breath could leave the body, and his dreams of doing all sorts of queer things while asleep convinced him that there was something immaterial about a human being. The most primitive idea of the human soul, the ghost, was derived from the breath-dream idea-system. P.953 - §3 Eventually the savage conceived of himself as a double--body and breath. The breath minus the body equaled a spirit, a ghost. While having a very definite human origin, ghosts, or spirits, were regarded as superhuman. And this belief in the existence of disembodied spirits seemed to explain the occurrence of the unusual, the extraordinary, the infrequent, and the inexplicable. P.953 - §4 The primitive doctrine of survival after death was not necessarily a belief in immortality. Beings who could not count over twenty could hardly conceive of infinity and eternity; they rather thought of recurring incarnations. P.953 - §5 The orange race was especially given to belief in transmigration and reincarnation. This idea of reincarnation originated in the observance of hereditary and trait resemblance of offspring to ancestors. The custom of naming children after grandparents and other ancestors was due to belief in reincarnation. Some later-day races believed that man died from three to seven times. This belief (residual from the teachings of Adam about the mansion worlds), and many other remnants of revealed religion, can be found among the otherwise absurd doctrines of twentieth-century barbarians. P.953 - §6 Early man entertained no ideas of hell or future punishment. The savage looked upon the future life as just like this one, minus all ill luck. Later on, a separate destiny for good ghosts and bad ghosts--heaven and hell--was conceived. But since many primitive races believed that man entered the next life just as he left this one, they did not relish the idea of becoming old and decrepit. The aged much preferred to be killed before becoming too infirm. P.953 - §7 Almost every group had a different idea regarding the destiny of the ghost soul. The Greeks believed that weak men must have weak souls; so they invented Hades as a fit place for the reception of such anemic souls; these unrobust specimens were also supposed to have shorter shadows. The early Andites thought their ghosts returned to the ancestral homelands. The Chinese and Egyptians once believed that soul and body remained together. Among the Egyptians this led to careful tomb construction and efforts at body preservation. Even modern peoples seek to arrest the decay of the dead. The Hebrews conceived that a phantom replica of the individual went down to Sheol; it could not return to the land of the living. They did make that important advance in the doctrine of the evolution of the soul. *** [Each OPAD presentation is copied from

. Greetings Fellow Students, Forum Members and Guests, Thanks much for the insights and comments, Alina. And thanks be to God for wisdom and evolution, as well as the evolution of wisdom! So, the roots of religion reach into our dream life. Beliefs in an afterlife draw water from the fantastic wanderings of a sleeping mind/body. ...It was all very real to the savage who would awaken from such dreams reeking with sweat, trembling, and screaming.... P.952 - 7
Dreams are mentioned more than once in the UB. From Paper 63:3: ...Their ideas of survival after death were very vague and indefinite, being largely derived from their fantastic and variegated dream life.... P.713 - 5
Apparently human history pivoted on dreams! From Paper 68:3: ...Probably the greatest single factor in the evolution of human society was the ghost dream. Although most dreams greatly perturbed the primitive mind, the ghost dream actually terrorized early men, driving these superstitious dreamers into each other's arms in willing and earnest association for mutual protection against the vague and unseen imaginary dangers of the spirit world. The ghost dream was one of the earliest appearing differences between the animal and human types of mind. Animals do not visualize survival after death.... P.766 - 3
But what causes us to dream in the first place? What is the purpose? How much significance should dreams be accorded? From 110:5: ... Man's dream experiences, that disordered and disconnected parade of the un-co-ordinated sleeping mind, present adequate proof of the failure of the Adjusters to harmonize and associate the divergent factors of the mind of man. The Adjusters simply cannot, in a single lifetime, arbitrarily co-ordinate and synchronize two such unlike and diverse types of thinking as the human and the divine. When they do, as they sometimes have, such souls are translated directly to the mansion worlds without the necessity of passing through the experience of death. During the slumber season the Adjuster attempts to achieve only that which the will of the indwelt personality has previously fully approved by the decisions and choosings which were made during times of fully wakeful consciousness, and which have thereby become lodged in the realms of the supermind, the liaison domain of human and divine interrelationship. While their mortal hosts are asleep, the Adjusters try to register their creations in the higher levels of the material mind, and some of your grotesque dreams indicate their failure to make efficient contact. The absurdities of dream life not only testify to pressure of unexpressed emotions but also bear witness to the horrible distortion of the representations of the spiritual concepts presented by the Adjusters. Your own passions, urges, and other innate tendencies translate themselves into the picture and substitute their unexpressed desires for the divine messages which the indwellers are endeavoring to put into the psychic records during unconscious sleep. It is extremely dangerous to postulate as to the Adjuster content of the dream life. The Adjusters do work during sleep, but your ordinary dream experiences are purely physiologic and psychologic phenomena. Likewise, it is hazardous to attempt the differentiation of the Adjusters' concept registry from the more or less continuous and conscious reception of the dictations of mortal conscience. These are problems which will have to be solved through individual discrimination and personal decision. But a human being would do better to err in rejecting an Adjuster's expression through believing it to be a purely human experience than to blunder into exalting a reaction of the mortal mind to the sphere of divine dignity. Remember, the influence of a Thought Adjuster is for the most part, though not wholly, a superconscious experience.... P.1208 *** Of all the body's function, breathing must have been the most obvious and commonly recognized. If breathing ceased, the body died within minutes. Obviously, the breath must be life itself! Yoga claims controlling breathing can take us into the spirit realm: ...Prana
is the
Sanskrit
word for "vital life" (from the root
prā
"to fill",
cognate
to
Latin :
plenus
"full"). It is one of the five organs of vitality or sensation,
viz.
prana
"breath",
vac
"speech",
chakshus
"sight",
shrotra
"hearing", and
manas
" thought " (nose, mouth, eyes, ears and
mind ;
ChUp . 2.7.1). ...In
Vedantic
philosophy, prana is the notion of a vital,
life -sustaining force of living beings and
vital energy , comparable to the Chinese notion of
Qi . Prana is a central concept in
Ayurveda
and
Yoga , where it is believed to flow through a network of fine subtle channels called
nadis . Its most subtle material form is the breath, but it is also to be found in the blood, and its most concentrated form is semen in men and vaginal fluid in women. [1]
The
Pranamaya-kosha
is one of the five
Koshas
or "sheaths" of the
Atman . Pranayama
is the practice in which the control of prana is achieved (initially) from the control of one's breathing. According to Yogic philosophy the breath, or air, is merely a gateway to the world of prana and its manifestation in the body. In yoga, pranayama techniques are used to control the movement of these vital energies within the body, which is said to lead to an increase in vitality in the practitioner.However, intensive practice
[5]
of these techniques is not trivial. Kason
[6]
describes situations where intensive pranayama techniques may have adverse effects on certain practitioners. According to
kundalini yoga , intensive and systematic practice of pranayama can lead to the awakening of

Reincarnation is still a widely held belief among religionists, even members of religions that disavow it. From Wikipedia: ...According to the Hindu sage
Adi Shankaracharya , the world - as we ordinarily understand it - is like a dream: fleeting and illusory. To be trapped in samsara (the cycle of birth and death) is a result of ignorance of the true nature of our existence. It is ignorance ( avidya ) of one's true self that leads to ego-consciousness, grounding one in desire and a perpetual chain of reincarnation. The idea is intricately linked to action ( karma ), a concept first recorded in the
Upanishads . Every action has a reaction and the force determines one's next incarnation. One is reborn through desire: a person
desires
to be born because he or she wants to enjoy a body, [78]
which can never bring deep, lasting happiness or peace ( ānanda ). After many births every person becomes dissatisfied and begins to seek higher forms of happiness through spiritual experience. When, after spiritual practice ( sādhanā ), a person realizes that the true "self" is the immortal soul rather than the body or the ego all desires for the pleasures of the world will vanish since they will seem insipid compared to spiritual
ānanda . When all desire has vanished the person will not be born again. [79]
When the cycle of rebirth thus comes to an end, a person is said to have attained liberation ( moksha ). [80]
All schools agree this implies the cessation of worldly desires and freedom from the cycle of birth and death, though the exact definition differs. Followers of the
Advaita Vedanta
school believe they will spend eternity absorbed in the perfect peace and happiness of the realization that all existence is One
Brahman
of which the soul is part.
Dvaita
schools perform worship with the goal of spending eternity in a spiritual world or heaven ( loka ) in the blessed company of the
Supreme Being . [81] ...Reincarnation also appears in
Norse mythology , in the
Poetic Edda . The editor of the
Poetic Edda
says that
Helgi Hjörvarðsson
and his mistress, the
valkyrie
Sváfa , whose love story is told in the poem
Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar , were reborn as
Helgi Hundingsbane
and the valkyrie
Sigrún . Helgi and Sigrún's love story is the matter of a part of the
Völsunga saga
and the lays
Helgakviða Hundingsbana I and II . They were reborn a second time as
Helgi Haddingjaskati
and the valkyrie
Kára , but unfortunately their story,
Káruljóð , only survives in a probably modified form in the
Hrómundar saga Gripssonar . Hindus believe the self or soul ( atman ) repeatedly takes on a physical body. 	...Islam The idea of reincarnation is accepted by a few
Muslim
sects, particularly of the ( Ghulat ), [114]
and by other sects in the Muslim world such as
Druzes . [115]
Historically, South Asian Isma'ilis performed
chantas
yearly, one of which is for sins committed in past lives. [116]
( Aga Khan IV ) Sinan ibn Salman ibn Muhammad, also known as Rashid al-Din Sinan, (r. 1162-92) subscribed to the transmigration of souls as a tenet of the
Alawi , [117]
who are thought to have been influenced by Isma'ilism. Modern Sufis who embrace the idea of reincarnation include Bawa Muhaiyadeen. [118]
However
Hazrat Inayat Khan
has criticized the idea as unhelpful to the spiritual seeker. [119] 	Judaism See also:
Kabbalah#Human soul in Kabbalah Reincarnation is not an essential tenet of traditional
Judaism . [120]
It is not mentioned in the
Tanakh
("Hebrew Bible"), the classical rabbinical works ( Mishnah
and
Talmud ), or
Maimonides '
13 Principles of Faith , though the tale of the Ten Martyrs in the
Yom Kippur
liturgy, who were killed by Romans to atone for the souls of the ten brothers of Joseph, is read in
Ashkenazi
Orthodox Jewish communities. Medieval
Jewish Rationalist
philosophers discussed the issue, often in rejection. However, Jewish mystical texts (the
Kabbalah ), from their classic Medieval canon onwards, teach a belief in
Gilgul Neshamot
(Hebrew for metempsychosis of souls: literally "soul cycle", plural
"gilgulim" ). It is a common belief in contemporary
Hasidic Judaism , which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative, though unstressed in favour of a more
innate
psychological mysticism. Other, Non-Hasidic,
Orthodox Jewish
groups while not placing a heavy emphasis on reincarnation, do acknowledge it as a valid teaching. [121]
Its popularisation entered modern secular
Yiddish literature
and folk motif. The 16th-century mystical renaissance in communal
Safed
replaced scholastic
Rationalism
as mainstream traditional Jewish theology, both in scholarly circles and in the popular imagination. References to
gilgul
in former Kabbalah became systemised as part of the metaphysical purpose of creation.
Isaac Luria
(the Ari) brought the issue to the centre of his new mystical articulation, for the first time, and advocated identification of the reincarnations of historic Jewish figures that were compiled by
Haim Vital
in his
Shaar HaGilgulim . [122]
Gilgul
is contrasted with the other processes in Kabbalah of
Ibbur
("pregnancy"), the attachment of a second soul to an individual for (or by) good means, and
Dybuk
("possession"), the attachment of a spirit, demon, etc. to an individual for (or by) "bad" means. In Lurianic Kabbalah, reincarnation is not retributive or fatalistic, but an expression of Divine compassion, the microcosm of the doctrine of cosmic rectification of creation.
Gilgul
is a heavenly agreement with the individual soul, conditional upon circumstances. Luria's radical system focused on
rectification
of the Divine soul, played out through Creation. The true essence of anything is the divine spark within that gives it existence. Even a stone or leaf possesses such a soul that "came into this world to receive a rectification". A human soul may occasionally be exiled into lower inanimate, vegetative or animal creations. The most basic component of the soul, the
nefesh , must leave at the cessation of blood production. There are four other soul components and different nations of the world possess different forms of souls with different purposes. Each Jewish soul is reincarnated in order to fulfill each of the
613 Mosaic commandments
that elevate a particular spark of holiness associated with each commandment. Once all the Sparks are redeemed to their spiritual source, the
Messianic Era
begins. Non-Jewish observance of the
7 Laws of Noah
assists the Jewish people, though Biblical adversaries of Israel reincarnate to oppose. Rabbis who accepted reincarnation include the mystical leaders
Nahmanides
(the Ramban) and Rabbenu
Bahya ben Asher ,
Levi ibn Habib
(the Ralbah),
Shelomoh Alkabez , the
Baal Shem Tov
and later Hasidic masters, and the Mitnagdic
Vilna Gaon . Rabbis who have rejected the idea include
Saadia Gaon ,
David Kimhi ,
Hasdai Crescas ,
Joseph Albo ,
Abraham ibn Daud
and
Leon de Modena . Among the
Geonim ,
Hai Gaon
argued in favour of
gilgulim . 	 Native American nations Reincarnation is an intrinsic part of many
Native American
and
Inuit [123]
traditions. [ citation needed ]
In the now heavily
Christian
Polar North
(now mainly parts of
Greenland
and
Nunavut ), the concept of reincarnation is enshrined in the
Inuit language . [ citation needed ] [124] The following is a story of human-to-human reincarnation as told by Thunder Cloud, a Winnebago shaman referred to as T. C. in the narrative. Here T. C. talks about his two previous lives and how he died and came back again to this his third lifetime. He describes his time between lives, when he was “blessed” by Earth Maker and all the abiding spirits and given special powers, including the ability to heal the sick. T. C.’s Account of His Two Reincarnations I (my ghost) was taken to the place where the sun sets (the west). ... While at that place, I thought I would come back to earth again, and the old man with whom I was staying said to me, “My son, did you not speak about wanting to go to the earth again?” I had, as a matter of fact, only thought of it, yet he knew what I wanted. Then he said to me, “You can go, but you must ask the chief first.” Then I went and told the chief of the village of my desire, and he said to me, “You may go and obtain your revenge upon the people who killed your relatives and you.” Then I was brought down to earth. ... There I lived until I died of old age. ... As I was lying [in my grave], someone said to me, “Come, let us go away.” So then we went toward the setting of the sun. There we came to a village where we met all the dead. ... From that place I came to this earth again for the third time, and here I am. (Radin, 1923) [125] 	Christianity Though the major Christian denominations reject the concept of reincarnation, a large number of Christians profess the belief. In a survey by the Pew Forum in 2009, 24% of American Christians expressed a belief in reincarnation. [126]
In a 1981 Survey in Europe 31% of regular churchgoing Catholics expressed a belief in reincarnation. [127] Geddes MacGregor, an Episcopalian priest who is Emeritus Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of Southern California, Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, a recipient of the California Literature Award (Gold Medal, non-fiction category), and the first holder of the Rufus Jones Chair in Philosophy and Religion at Bryn Mawr, demonstrates in his book
Reincarnation in Christianity: A New Vision of the Role of Rebirth in Christian Thought , [128]
that Christian doctrine and reincarnation are not mutually exclusive belief systems. 	New religious movements 	Theosophy The
Theosophical Society
draws much of its inspiration from India. The idea is, according to a recent Theosophical writer, "the master-key to modern problems," including heredity. [129]
In the Theosophical world-view reincarnation is the vast rhythmic process by which the soul, the part of a person which belongs to the formless non-material and timeless worlds, unfolds its spiritual powers in the world and comes to know itself. It descends from sublime, free, spiritual realms and gathers experience through its effort to express itself in the world. Afterwards there is a withdrawal from the physical plane to successively higher levels of Reality, in death, a purification and assimilation of the past life. Having cast off all instruments of personal experience it stands again in its spiritual and formless nature, ready to begin its next rhythmic manifestation, every lifetime bringing it closer to complete self-knowledge and self-expression. However it may attract old mental, emotional, and energetic
karma
patterns to form the new personality. 	Eckankar Awareness of past lives, dreams, and soul travel are spiritual disciplines practiced by students of
Eckankar . Eckankar teaches that each person is Soul, which transcends time and space. Soul travel is a term specific to Eckankar that refers to a shift in consciousness. Eckists believe the purpose of being aware of past lives is to help with understanding personal conditions in the present. Practicing students of Eckankar can become aware of past lives, through dreams, soul travel, and spiritual exercises called contemplations. This form of contemplation is the active, unconditional practice of going within to connect with the "Light and Sound of God" known as the divine life current or Holy Spirit. 	Scientology See also:
Scientology beliefs and practices Past reincarnation, usually termed "past lives", is a key part of the principles and practices of the
Church of Scientology . Scientologists believe that the human individual is actually an immortal
thetan , or spiritual entity, that has fallen into a degraded state as a result of past-life experiences. Scientology
auditing
is intended to free the person of these past-life traumas and recover past-life memory, leading to a higher state of spiritual awareness. This idea is echoed in their highest fraternal religious order, the
Sea Organization , whose motto is "Revenimus" or "We Come Back", and whose members sign a "billion-year contract" as a sign of commitment to that ideal.
L. Ron Hubbard , the founder of Scientology, does not use the word "reincarnation" to describe its beliefs, noting that: "The common definition of reincarnation has been altered from its original meaning. The word has come to mean 'to be born again in different life forms' whereas its actual definition is 'to be born again into the flesh of another body.' Scientology ascribes to this latter, original definition of reincarnation." [130] The first writings in Scientology regarding past lives date from around 1951 and slightly earlier. In 1960, Hubbard published a book on past lives entitled
Have You Lived Before This Life . In 1968 he wrote
Mission into Time , a report on a five-week sailing expedition to Sardinia, Sicily and Carthage to see if specific evidence could be found to substantiate L. Ron Hubbard's recall of incidents in his own past, centuries ago. 	Meher Baba The Indian spiritual teacher
Meher Baba
stated that reincarnation occurs due to desires and once those desires are extinguished the ego-mind ceases to reincarnate: The power that keeps the individual soul bound to the wheel of life and death is its thirst for separate existence, which is a condition for a host of cravings connected with objects and experiences of the world of duality. It is for the fulfillment of cravings that the ego-mind keeps on incarnating itself. When all forms of craving disappear, the impressions which create and enliven the ego-mind disappear. With the disappearance of these impressions, the ego-mind itself is shed with the result that there is only the realisation of the one eternal, unchanging Oversoul or God, Who is the only reality. God-realisation is the end of the incarnations of the ego-mind because it is the end of its very existence. As long as the ego-mind exists in some form, there is an inevitable and irresistible urge for incarnations. When there is cessation of the ego-mind, there is cessation of incarnations in the final fulfillment of Self-realisation. [131] Source/more:
http://en.wikipedia....rnation#Origins *** Amazing what power beliefs have, even to negate the basic instinct to survive: ...The aged much preferred to be killed before becoming too infirm.... P.953 - 6
*** About ghost beliefs: ... Common attributes Another widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty, airy, or subtle material.
Anthropologists
link this idea to early beliefs that ghosts were the person within the person (the person's spirit), most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person's breath, which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist. [18]
This belief may have also fostered the metaphorical meaning of "breath" in certain languages, such as the
Latin
spiritus
and the
Greek
pneuma , which by
analogy
became extended to mean the soul. In the
Bible ,
God
is depicted as animating
Adam
with a breath. In many traditional accounts, ghosts were often thought to be deceased people looking for vengeance, or imprisoned on earth for bad things they did during life. The appearance of a ghost has often been regarded as an omen or portent of death. Seeing one's own ghostly double or " fetch " is a related omen of death. [23] White ladies
were reported to appear in many rural areas, and supposed to have died tragically or suffered trauma in life. White Lady legends are found around the world. Common to many of them is the theme of losing or being betrayed by a husband or fiancé. They are often associated with an individual family line or regarded as a harbinger of death similar to a
banshee . Legends of ghost ships have existed since the 18th century; most notable of these is the
Flying Dutchman . This theme has been used in literature in
The Rime of the Ancient Mariner
by Coleridge. *** About ghosts and the ancient Greeks: 	...Archaic and Classical Greece Ghosts appeared in
Homer 's
Odyssey
and
Iliad , in which they were described as vanishing "as a vapor, gibbering and whining into the earth". Homer’s ghosts had little interaction with the world of the living. Periodically they were called upon to provide advice or prophecy, but they do not appear to be particularly feared. Ghosts in the classical world often appeared in the form of vapor or smoke, but at other times they were described as being substantial, appearing as they had been at the time of death, complete with the wounds that killed them. [28] By the 5th century BC,
classical Greek
ghosts had become haunting, frightening creatures who could work to either good or evil purposes. The spirit of the dead was believed to hover near the resting place of the corpse, and cemeteries were places the living avoided. The dead were to be ritually mourned through public ceremony, sacrifice and libations, or they might return to haunt their families. The ancient Greeks held annual feasts to honor and placate the spirits of the dead, to which the family ghosts were invited, and after which they were “firmly invited to leave until the same time next year”. [29] The 5th century BC play
Oresteia
contains one of the first ghosts to appear in a work of fiction. Source/much more:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost *** About "Hades": Main article:
Greek underworld ...In older Greek myths, the realm of Hades is the misty and gloomy [17]
abode of the dead (also called
Erebus ), where all mortals go. Later Greek philosophy introduced the idea that all mortals are judged after death and are either rewarded or cursed. Very few mortals could leave his realm once they entered: the exceptions,
Heracles ,
Theseus , are heroic. Even Odysseus in his
Nekyia
( Odyssey , xi) calls up the spirits of the departed, rather than descend to them. There were several sections of the realm of Hades, including
Elysium , the
Asphodel Meadows , and
Tartarus . Greek
mythographers
were not perfectly consistent about the geography of the
afterlife . A contrasting myth of the afterlife concerns the
Garden of the Hesperides , often identified with the
Isles of the Blessed , where the blessed heroes may dwell. Hades in Biblical terms: ...Main article:
Hades in Christianity Hades is the standard translation for
Sheol
in the
Septuagint ,
Josephus ,
Philo of Alexandria , and other Jewish works written in Greek. In the Greek version of an obscure Judaeo-Christian work known as
3 Baruch
(never considered
canonical
by any known group), " Hades " is described as a dark, serpent-like monster or
dragon
who drinks a
cubit
of water from the sea every day, and is 200
plethra
(20,200 English feet, or nearly four miles) in length. Like other first-century Jews literate in Greek, early Christians used the Greek word
Hades
to translate the Hebrew word
Sheol . Thus, in
Acts 2:27 , the Hebrew phrase in
Psalm 16:10
appears in the form: "you will not abandon my soul to Hades." Death and Hades are repeatedly associated in the
Book of Revelation . [21] The
New Testament
uses the Greek word
Hades
to refer to the temporary abode of the dead (e.g. Acts 2:31; Revelation 20:13). [22]
Only one passage describes
hades
as a place of torment, the story of
Lazarus and Dives
( Luke 16:19-31 ). Here, Jesus depicts a wicked man suffering fiery torment in
hades , which is contrasted with the
bosom of Abraham , and explains that it is impossible to cross over from one location to the other. Some scholars believe that this parable reflects the
intertestamental
Jewish view of
hades
(or
sheol ) as containing separate divisions for the wicked and righteous. [22] [23]
In
Revelation 20:13-14
hades
is itself thrown into the "lake of fire" after being emptied of the dead. In Latin, Hades could be translated as
Purgatorium
( Purgatory
in English use) after about 1200 A.D., [24]
but no modern English translations relates Hades to
Purgatory . Source/more:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades *** ...Among the Egyptians this led to careful tomb construction and efforts at body preservation. Even modern peoples seek to arrest the decay of the dead.... P.953 - 7
Today people will have their dead bodies pumped full of toxic formaldehyde and put in cushiony steel box in an attempt to make it last longer, rest better, for what purpose they know not. But with more and more people, an increasingly polluted planet, and the soaring costs of such burials in the earth, cremation is quickly gaining acceptance. Funerals in the US can cost many thousands, while cremations can be had for $600. Real practicality is trumping bogus spirituality. *** More about "Sheol": ...Sheol
translated as "grave", "pit", or "abode of the dead", is the Old Testament/Hebrew bible's underworld, a place of darkness to which all the dead go, both the righteous and the unrighteous, regardless of the moral choices made in life, a place of stillness and darkness cut off from God. [1] The inhabitants of Sheol were the "shades" ( rephaim ), entities without personality or strength, cut off from God. [2]
Under some circumstances they could be contacted by the living, as the
Witch of Endor
contacts the shade of
Samuel
for
Saul , but such practices are discouraged (Deuteronomy 18:10). [3]
While the Old Testament writings describe Sheol as the permanent place of the dead, in the
Second Temple
period (roughly 500 BCE-70 CE) a more diverse set of ideas evolved: in some texts, Sheol is the home of both the righteous and the wicked, separated into respective compartments; in others, it was a place of punishment, meant for the wicked dead alone. [4]
When the Hebrew scriptures were translated into
Greek
in ancient
Alexandria
around 200 BC the word " Hades " (underworld) was substituted for Sheol, and this is reflected in the
New Testament
where Hades is both the underworld of the dead and the personification of the evil it represents. [5] Source:

But what causes us to dream in the first place? What is the purpose? How much significance should dreams be accorded? The mind never sleeps only consciousness does.
This is proof of mind ministry which is not part of the physical body.
The the physical electro/chemical centers that control consciousness rest while the subconscious and superconscious continue functioning right along as they always do, not being entirely reliant upon alertness.
Since physical energy levels vacillate, control over consciousness will vacillate during sleep such that these rhythmic swings occasionally capture some of the content of the subconscious and/or superconscious levels, allowing a glimpse of what goes on there.
Dreams consist of the activity of these other two levels and they overlap into occasional partial alertness during sleep. TUB tells us to accord them no particular significance.
110:5.2-5
Man’s dream experiences, that disordered and disconnected parade of the unco-ordinated sleeping mind, present adequate proof of the failure of the Adjusters to harmonize and associate the divergent factors of the mind of man. The Adjusters simply cannot, in a single lifetime, arbitrarily co-ordinate and synchronize two such unlike and diverse types of thinking as the human and the divine. When they do, as they sometimes have, such
souls
are translated directly to the mansion worlds without the necessity of passing through the experience of
death. During the slumber season the Adjuster attempts to achieve only that which the will of the indwelt
personality
has previously fully approved by the decisions and choosings which were made during times of fully wakeful consciousness, and which have thereby become lodged in the realms of the supermind, the liaison domain of human and divine interrelationship. While their mortal hosts are asleep, the Adjusters try to register their creations in the higher levels of the material mind, and some of your grotesque dreams indicate their failure to make efficient contact. The absurdities of dream life not only testify to pressure of unexpressed emotions but also bear witness to the horrible distortion of the representations of the spiritual concepts presented by the Adjusters. Your own passions, urges, and other innate tendencies translate themselves into the picture and substitute their unexpressed desires for the divine messages which the indwellers are endeavoring to put into the psychic records during unconscious sleep. It is extremely dangerous to postulate as to the Adjuster content of the dream life. The Adjusters do work during sleep, but your ordinary dream experiences are purely physiologic and psychologic phenomena. Likewise, it is hazardous to attempt the differentiation of the Adjusters’ concept registry from the more or less continuous and conscious reception of the dictations of mortal
conscience.
These are problems which will have to be solved through individual discrimination and personal decision. But a human being would do better to err in rejecting an Adjuster’s expression through believing it to be a purely human experience than to blunder into exalting a reaction of the mortal mind to the sphere of divine dignity. Remember, the influence of a Thought Adjuster is for the most part, though not wholly, a superconscious experience.

Welcome to UAI Forum's One-Page-A-Day Online Study Session Today's Presentation Is From: PAPER 86 - EARLY EVOLUTION OF RELIGION 5. THE GHOST-SOUL CONCEPT [Part 1 of 2] P.953 - §8 The nonmaterial part of man has been variously termed ghost, spirit, shade, phantom, specter, and latterly
soul . The soul was early man's dream double; it was in every way exactly like the mortal himself except that it was not responsive to touch. The belief in dream doubles led directly to the notion that all things animate and inanimate had souls as well as men. This concept tended long to perpetuate the nature-spirit beliefs; the Eskimos still conceive that everything in nature has a spirit. P.954 - §1 The ghost soul could be heard and seen, but not touched. Gradually the dream life of the race so developed and expanded the activities of this evolving spirit world that death was finally regarded as "giving up the ghost." All primitive tribes, except those little above animals, have developed some concept of the soul. As civilization advances, this superstitious concept of the soul is destroyed, and man is wholly dependent on revelation and personal religious experience for his new idea of the soul as the joint creation of the God-knowing mortal mind and its indwelling divine spirit, the Thought Adjuster. P.954 - §2 Early mortals usually failed to differentiate the concepts of an indwelling spirit and a soul of evolutionary nature. The savage was much confused as to whether the ghost soul was native to the body or was an external agency in possession of the body. The absence of reasoned thought in the presence of perplexity explains the gross inconsistencies of the savage view of souls, ghosts, and spirits. P.954 - §3 The soul was thought of as being related to the body as the perfume to the flower. The ancients believed that the soul could leave the body in various ways, as in: 1. Ordinary and transient fainting. 2. Sleeping, natural dreaming. 3. Coma and unconsciousness associated with disease and accidents. 4. Death, permanent departure. P.954 - §7 The savage looked upon sneezing as an abortive attempt of the soul to escape from the body. Being awake and on guard, the body was able to thwart the soul's attempted escape. Later on, sneezing was always accompanied by some religious expression, such as "God bless you!" *** [Each OPAD presentation is copied from

. Greetings Fellow Students, Forum Members and Guests, Thanks Bonita. Interesting that we both answered the question with the exact same text (on dreaming). Your comments are right on. Do you see dreaming in any way useful? *** The belief in nature spirits is generally classified under the heading animism. From Wikipedia: ...Animism is a belief held in many religions around the world, and is not, as some have purported, a type of religion in itself. [ citation needed ]
It is a belief, such as
shamanism ,
polytheism
or
monotheism , that is found in several religions. [ citation needed ]
In modern usage, the term is sometimes used improperly as a catch-all classification of "other world religions" alongside major organized religions. 	Origin of religion Some theories have been put forward that the anthropocentric belief in animism among early humans was the basis for the later evolution of religions. In one such theory, put forward by Sir E. B. Tylor, early humans initially, through mere observation, recognized what might be called a soul, life-force, spirit, breath or animus within themselves; that which was present in the body in life and absent in death. These early humans equated this soul with figures which would appear in dreams and visions. These early human cultures later interpreted these spirits to be present in animals, the living plant world, and even in natural objects in a form of animism. Eventually, these early humans grew to believe that the spirits were invested and interested in human life, and performed rituals to propitiate them. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of “developed” religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced the society, the less that society believed in Animism; however, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented “survivals” of the original animism of early humanity.{{ link }} 	World view In many animistic world views found in
hunter-gatherer
cultures, the human being is often regarded as on a roughly equal footing with other animals, plants, and natural forces. [13] [ page needed ]
Therefore, it is morally imperative to treat these agents with respect. In this world view, humans are considered a part of nature, rather than superior to, or separate from it. In such societies, ritual is considered essential for survival, as it wins the favor of the spirits of one's source of food, shelter, and fertility and wards off malevolent spirits. In more elaborate animistic religions, such as
Shinto , there is a greater sense of a special character to humans that sets them apart from the general run of animals and objects, while retaining the necessity of ritual to ensure good luck, favorable harvests, and so on. 	Death Most animistic belief systems hold that the spirit survives physical death. In some systems [ which? ] , the spirit is believed to pass to an easier world of abundant game or ever-ripe crops, while in other systems, the spirit remains on earth as a ghost, often malignant. Still other systems combine these two beliefs, holding that the soul must journey to the spirit world without becoming lost and thus wandering as a ghost ( e.g. , the
Navajo
religion).
Funeral ,
mourning
rituals, and ancestor worship performed by those surviving the deceased are often considered necessary for the successful completion of this journey. [ citation needed ] From the belief in the survival of the dead arose the practice of offering food, lighting fires, etc., at the grave, at first, maybe, as an act of friendship or filial piety, later as an act of
ancestor worship . The simple offering of food or shedding of blood at the grave develops into an elaborate system of
sacrifice . Even where ancestor worship is not found, the desire to provide the dead with comforts in the future life may lead to the sacrifice of wives, slaves, animals, and so on, to the breaking or burning of objects at the grave or to provide the

toll: a coin placed on each eye of the corpse to pay the traveling expenses of the soul; and, a piece of honeyed bread in the mouth to distract the three-headed dog/demon Cerberus long enough for the soul to pass it. [ citation needed ] But all is not finished with the passage of the soul to the land of the dead. The soul may return to avenge its death by helping to discover the murderer, or to wreak vengeance for itself. There is a widespread belief that those who die a violent death become malignant spirits and endanger the lives of those who come near the haunted spot. In Malay folklore, the woman who dies in childbirth becomes a
pontianak , a vampire-like spirit who threatens the life of human beings. People resort to magical or religious means of repelling spiritual dangers from such malignant spirits. [ citation needed ] It is not surprising to find that many peoples respect and even worship animals (see
totem
or
animal worship ), often regarding them as relatives. It is clear that widespread respect was paid to animals as the abode of dead ancestors, and much of the
cults
to dangerous animals is traceable to this principle; though there is no need to attribute an animistic origin to it. [14] The practice of
head shrinking
among
Jivaroan
and
Urarina
peoples derives from an animistic belief that if the spirits of one's mortal enemies (i.e., the nemesis of one's being) are not trapped within the head, they can escape slain bodies. After the spirit
transmigrates
to another body, they can take the form of a
predatory
animal and even exact revenge. 	Distinction from Pantheism Animism is not the same as Pantheism, although the two are sometimes confused. Some faiths and religions are even both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In Pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits and/or souls.

http://en.wikipedia....i/Nature_spirit *** ...This concept tended long to perpetuate the nature-spirit beliefs; the Eskimos still conceive that everything in nature has a spirit.... P.953 - 8 About the Eskimo (Inuit) beliefs: ...The environment in which the Inuit lived inspired a
mythology
filled with adventure tales of whale and walrus hunts. Long winter months of waiting for caribou herds or sitting near breathing holes hunting seals gave birth to stories of mysterious and sudden appearance of ghosts and fantastic creatures. Some Inuit looked into the
aurora borealis , or northern lights, to find images of their family and friends dancing in the next life. [72]
However, some Inuit believed that the lights were more sinister and if you
whistled
at them, they would come down and cut off your head. This tale is still told to children today. [73]
For others they were invisible giants, the souls of animals, a guide to hunting and as a spirit for the
angakkuq
to help with healing. [73] [74]
They relied upon the
angakkuq
(shaman) for spiritual interpretation. The nearest thing to a central deity was the Old Woman ( Sedna ), who lived beneath the sea. The waters, a central food source, were believed to contain great gods. The Inuit practised a form of shamanism based on
animist
principles. They believed that all things had a form of spirit, including humans, and that to some extent these spirits could be influenced by a
pantheon
of supernatural entities that could be appeased when one required some animal or inanimate thing to act in a certain way. The
angakkuq
of a community of Inuit was not the leader, but rather a sort of healer and
psychotherapist , who tended wounds and offered advice, as well as invoking the spirits to assist people in their lives. His or her role was to see, interpret and exhort the subtle and unseen.
Angakkuit
were not trained; they were held to be born with the ability and recognised by the community as they approached adulthood. Inuit religion was closely tied to a system of rituals integrated into the daily life of the people. These rituals were simple but held to be necessary. According to a customary Inuit saying, The great peril of our existence lies in the fact that our diet consists entirely of souls. By believing that all things, including animals, have souls like those of humans, any hunt that failed to show appropriate respect and customary supplication would only give the liberated spirits cause to avenge themselves. The harshness and unpredictability of life in the Arctic ensured that Inuit lived with concern for the uncontrollable, where a streak of bad luck could destroy an entire community. To offend a spirit was to risk its interference with an already marginal existence. The Inuit understood that they had to work in harmony with supernatural powers to provide the necessities of day-to-day life. Some Inuit believed that the spirits of their ancestors could be seen in the

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit *** The soul concept is variously perceived by each religion, even science may attempt to define it. There is a great deal of information available on the Web. Some of it is based in animism, some in humanity's higher religious concepts. From Wikipedia: ...A
soul
– in certain
spiritual , philosophical, and
psychological
traditions – is the
incorporeal
essence of a person, living thing, or object. [1]
Many philosophical and spiritual systems teach that only humans have souls, while others teach that all living things, and even inanimate objects (such as rivers), have souls. The latter belief is commonly called
animism . [2]
Soul
can function as a synonym for
spirit ,
mind
or
self ; [3]
scientific works, in particular, often consider 'soul' as a synonym for 'mind'. Source/more:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul The soul in Taoism: ...According to Chinese traditions, every person has two types of soul called
hun and po
(魂 and 魄), which are respectively
yang and yin .
Taoism
believes in ten souls,
sanhunqipo
"three
hun
and seven
po ". [74] [75]
The pò is linked to the dead body and the grave, whereas the hún is linked to the ancestral tablet. A living being that loses any of them is said to have mental illness or
unconsciousness , while a dead soul may
reincarnate
to a
disability , lower
desire realms
or may even be unable to reincarnate. In Sikhism: ... Sikhism
considers Soul (atma) to be part of God ( Waheguru ). Various hymns are cited from the holy book " Sri Guru Granth Sahib " (SGGS) that suggests this belief. "God is in the Soul and the Soul is in the God." [71]
The same concept is repeated at various pages of the SGGS. For example: "The soul is divine; divine is the soul. Worship Him with love." [72]
and "The soul is the Lord, and the Lord is the soul; contemplating the Shabad, the Lord is found." [73]
The "Atma" or "Soul" according to Sikhism is an entity or "spiritual spark" or "light" in our body because of which the body can sustain life. On the departure of this entity from the body, the body becomes lifeless – No amount of manipulations to the body can make the person make any physical actions. The soul is the ‘driver’ in the body. It is the ‘roohu’ or spirit or atma, the presence of which makes the physical body alive. Many religious and philosophical traditions, support the view that the soul is the ethereal substance – a spirit; a non material spark – particular to a unique living being. Such traditions often consider the soul both immortal and innately aware of its immortal nature, as well as the true basis for sentience in each living being. The concept of the soul has strong links with notions of an afterlife, but opinions may vary wildly even within a given religion as to what happens to the soul after death. Many within these religions and philosophies see the soul as immaterial, while others consider it possibly material.
Shamanism ...According to Nadya Yuguseva, a shaman from the Altai, "'A woman has 40 souls; men have just one[.]'" Repeatedly the UB authors give the soul this origin, this definition: ...the joint creation of the God-knowing mortal mind and its indwelling divine spirit, the Thought Adjuster.... P.954 - 1 	...Roman Catholic beliefs The present
Catechism of the Catholic Church
defines the soul as "the innermost aspect of humans, that which is of greatest value in them, that by which they are most especially in God's image: 'soul' signifies the
spiritual principle
in man." [52]
All souls living and dead will be Judged by Jesus Christ when he comes back to earth. The souls of those who die unrepentant of serious sins, or in conscious rejection of God, will at judgment day may be forever in a state called
Hell [ citation needed ] . The Catholic Church teaches that the existence of each individual soul is dependent wholly upon God: "The doctrine of the faith affirms that the spiritual and immortal soul is created immediately by God." [53] Source/more:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul Depiction of the soul on a 17th century tombstone at the cemetery of the
Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow *** On the history and beliefs around sneezing: Main article:
Responses to sneezing ...In
English -speaking countries, the common verbal response to another person's sneeze is "(God) bless you" or in the
United States
the much less common "Gesundheit" (the German word for "health"). There are several proposed origins for the use "bless you" in the context of sneezing: Various alleged but conflicting superstitions relating the sneeze to evil spirits. This includes beliefs that a sneeze could release one's soul, thus leading to its possible capture by lurking
evil spirits
(as explained in the "Historic instances and practices" section above), or that the evil spirits could enter the body through the open mouth of a sneezing individual, or that the individual is sneezing out sins or evil spirits which had taken residence within the body and is thus in need of the blessing to prevent the
exorcised
spirits
from re-entering the body. Some proponents of this last theory have further suggested that it was bad luck to open the mouth again to thank the person who uttered "Bless you" for fear of circumventing the original purpose of the blessing. [ citation needed ] Some say it came into use during the
plague
pandemics of the 14th century. Blessing the individual after showing such a symptom was thought to prevent possible impending death due to the lethal disease. [ citation needed ] In Renaissance times a superstition was formed claiming one's heart stopped for a very brief moment during the sneeze, saying bless you was a sign of prayer that the heart wouldn't fail. It has also been stated that one says "(God) bless you" so that one does not catch the flu, cold, or any other forms of sickness. Common
English
onomatopoeias
for the sneeze sound are
hachoo ,
achoo ,
atchoo ,
achew
and
atishoo , with the first syllable corresponding to the initial exhaling of air, and the last to the sound of the sneeze. ...In
Ancient Greece , sneezes were believed to be prophetic signs from the
gods . In 401 BC, for instance, the
Athenian
general
Xenophon
gave a speech exhorting his fellow soldiers to fight against the
Persians . A
soldier
underscored his conclusion with a sneeze. Thinking that this sneeze was a favorable sign from the gods, the soldiers were impressed. Another divine moment of sneezing for the Greeks occurs in the story of
Odysseus . His waiting wife
Penelope , hearing
Odysseus
may be alive, says that he and his son would take revenge on the suitors if he were to return. At that moment, their son sneezes loudly and Penelope laughs with joy, reassured that it is a sign from the
gods
( Odyssey
17: 541-550). In
Europe , principally around the early
Middle Ages , it was believed that one's life was in fact tied to one's
breath
- a belief reflected in the word "expire" (originally meaning "to exhale") gaining the additional meaning of "to come to an end" or "to die". This connection, coupled with the significant amount of breath expelled from the body during a sneeze, had likely [ citation needed ]
led people to believe that sneezing could easily be fatal. This theory, if proven conclusively, could in turn explain the reasoning behind the traditional "God bless you" response to a sneeze, the origins of which are currently unclear. (see "Traditional Responses To A Sneeze" below for alternative explanations). Sir
Raymond Henry Payne Crawfurd , for instance, the late registrar of the
Royal College of Physicians , in his 1909 book "The Last Days of
Charles II ", states that, when the controversial monarch was on his deathbed, his medical attendants administered a concoction of
cowslips
and extract of
ammonia
to promote sneezing. [5]
However, it is not known if this promotion of sneezing was done to hasten his death (as
coup de grace ), or as an ultimate attempt at treatment. In certain parts of
Eastern Asia , particularly in
Chinese culture ,
Japanese culture
and
Vietnamese culture , a sneeze without an obvious cause was generally perceived as a sign that someone was talking about the sneezer at that very moment. This can be seen in the
Book of Songs
(a collection of Chinese poems) [6]
in ancient China as early as 1000 BC, and this belief is still depicted in present-day
manga
and
anime . In
China ,
Vietnam
and
Japan , for instance, there is a
superstition
that if talking behind someone's back causes the person being talked about to sneeze; as such, the sneezer can tell if something good is being said (one sneeze), something bad is being said (two sneezes in a row), even if someone is in love with them (three sneezes in a row) or if this is a sign that they are about to catch a
cold
(multiple sneezes). Parallel beliefs are known to exist around the world, particularly in contemporary Greek, Slavic, Celtic, English, French, and Indian cultures. Similarly, in
Nepal , sneezers are believed to be remembered by someone at that particular moment. In
Indian culture , especially in
northern parts of India , and also in
Iran , it has been a common superstition that a sneeze taking place before the start of any work was a sign of impending bad interruption. It was thus customary to pause in order to drink water or break any work rhythm before resuming the job at hand in order to prevent any misfortune from occurring. Contrarily, in
Polish Culture , especially in what the Poles have known to be their Borderlands, the
Kresy , a popular belief persists that sneezes may be an inauspicious sign that one's mother-in-law speaks ill of their son-in-law at that moment. The same phenomenon is thought to correspond to daughters-in-law and their mothers-in-law. As with other
Catholic
countries, such as Mexico, Italy, or Ireland, the remnants of pagan culture are fostered in Polish peasant idiosyncratic superstitions. The practice among
Islamic culture , in turn, has largely been based on various Prophetic traditions and the teachings of
Muhammad . An example of this is
Al-Bukhaari 's narrations from
Abu Hurayrah
that the
Islamic prophet
once said: When one of you sneezes, let him say, "Al-hamdu-Lillah"
(Praise be to
God ) , and let his brother or companion say to him, "Yarhamuk Allah"
(May God have mercy on you) . If he says, "Yarhamuk-Allah", then let [the sneezer] say, "Yahdeekum Allah wa yuslihu baalakum"
(May God guide you and rectify your condition) . Source/more:

HI ALL! Thanks Rick! Again we see so much confusion product of the primitive, but pure, ignorance.Yet evolution continues...It is impossible to make a child stop growing. Evolution must continue because it is a universal law. I believe we should contribute to the evolution of the Supreme. right? Although I think we recognize that some false beliefs are still in force.The concept that the soul comes into this world with sin persists in these days, XXI century there are still people who believe in it. But, is the result of personal growth so we must respect it, of course. (974.1) 89:0. 1 PRIMITIVE man regarded himself as being in debt to the spirits, as standing in need of redemption. As the savages looked at it, in justice the spirits might have visited much more bad luck upon them. As time passed, this concept developed into the doctrine of sin and salvation. The soul was looked upon as coming into the world under forfeit — original sin. The soul must be ransomed; a scapegoat must be provided. The head-hunter, in addition to practicing the cult of skull worship, was able to provide a substitute for his own life, a scapeman. (974.3) 89:1.1
Observance of a taboo was man’s effort to dodge ill luck, to keep from offending the spirit ghosts by the avoidance of something. The taboos were at first nonreligious, but they early acquired ghost or spirit sanction, and when thus reinforced, they became lawmakers and institution builders. The taboo is the source of ceremonial standards and the ancestor of primitive self-control. It was the earliest form of societal regulation and for a long time the only one; it is still a basic unit of the social regulative structure. Alina ***

Welcome to UAI Forum's One-Page-A-Day Online Study Session Today's Presentation Is From: PAPER 86 - EARLY EVOLUTION OF RELIGION 5. THE GHOST-SOUL CONCEPT [Part 2 of 2] P.954 - §8 Early in evolution sleep was regarded as proving that the ghost soul could be absent from the body, and it was believed that it could be called back by speaking or shouting the sleeper's name. In other forms of unconsciousness the soul was thought to be farther away, perhaps trying to escape for good--impending death. Dreams were looked upon as the experiences of the soul during sleep while temporarily absent from the body. The savage believes his dreams to be just as real as any part of his waking experience. The ancients made a practice of awaking sleepers gradually so that the soul might have time to get back into the body. P.954 - §9 All down through the ages men have stood in awe of the apparitions of the night season, and the Hebrews were no exception. They truly believed that God spoke to them in dreams, despite the injunctions of Moses against this idea. And Moses was right, for ordinary dreams are not the methods employed by the personalities of the spiritual world when they seek to communicate with material beings. P.954 - §10 The ancients believed that souls could enter animals or even inanimate objects. This culminated in the werewolf ideas of animal identification. A person could be a law-abiding citizen by day, but when he fell asleep, his soul could enter a wolf or some other animal to prowl about on nocturnal depredations. P.955 - §1 Primitive men thought that the soul was associated with the breath, and that its qualities could be imparted or transferred by the breath. The brave chief would breathe upon the newborn child, thereby imparting courage. Among early Christians the ceremony of bestowing the Holy Spirit was accompanied by breathing on the candidates. Said the Psalmist: "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth." It was long the custom of the eldest son to try to catch the last breath of his dying father. P.955 - §2 The shadow came, later on, to be feared and revered equally with the breath. The reflection of oneself in the water was also sometimes looked upon as proof of the double self, and mirrors were regarded with superstitious awe. Even now many civilized persons turn the mirror to the wall in the event of death. Some backward tribes still believe that the making of pictures, drawings, models, or images removes all or a part of the soul from the body; hence such are forbidden. P.955 - §3 The soul was generally thought of as being identified with the breath, but it was also located by various peoples in the head, hair, heart, liver, blood, and fat. The "crying out of Abel's blood from the ground" is expressive of the onetime belief in the presence of the ghost in the blood. The Semites taught that the soul resided in the bodily fat, and among many the eating of animal fat was taboo. Head hunting was a method of capturing an enemy's soul, as was scalping. In recent times the eyes have been regarded as the windows of the soul. P.955 - §4 Those who held the doctrine of three or four souls believed that the loss of one soul meant discomfort, two illness, three death. One soul lived in the breath, one in the head, one in the hair, one in the heart. The sick were advised to stroll about in the open air with the hope of recapturing their strayed souls. The greatest of the medicine men were supposed to exchange the sick soul of a diseased person for a new one, the "new birth." P.955 - §5 The children of Badonan developed a belief in two souls, the breath and the shadow. The early Nodite races regarded man as consisting of two persons, soul and body. This philosophy of human existence was later reflected in the Greek viewpoint. The Greeks themselves believed in three souls; the vegetative resided in the stomach, the animal in the heart, the intellectual in the head. The Eskimos believe that man has three parts: body, soul, and name. *** [Each OPAD presentation is copied from

. Greetings Fellow Students, Forum Members and Guests, Right Alina, evolution means certain death to ignorance, blindness, fear and prejudice. Thanks be to Father for wisdom, experience and transcendence. But what do dreams have to do with evolution? ...A 2001 study showed evidence that illogical locations, characters, and dream flow may help the brain strengthen the linking and consolidation of
semantic memories . [44]
These conditions may occur because, during REM sleep, the flow of information between the
hippocampus
and
neocortex
is reduced. [45]
Increasing levels of the
stress
hormone
cortisol
late in sleep (often during REM sleep) cause this decreased communication. One stage of
memory consolidation
is the linking of distant but related memories. Payne and Nadal hypothesize these memories are then consolidated into a smooth narrative, similar to a process that happens when memories are created under stress. [46] 	Dreams for removing junk Robert (1886), [47]
a physician from Hamburg, was the first who suggested that dreams are a need and that they have the function to erase (a) sensory impressions that were not fully worked up, and ( ideas that were not fully developed during the day. By the dream work, incomplete material is either removed (suppressed) or deepened and included into memory. Robert's ideas were cited repeatedly by Freud in his
Die Traumdeutung .
Hughlings Jackson
(1911) viewed that sleep serves to sweep away unnecessary memories and connections from the day. This was revised in 1983 by Crick and Mitchison's " reverse learning " theory, which states that dreams are like the cleaning-up operations of computers when they are off-line, removing (suppressing) parasitic nodes and other "junk" from the mind during sleep. [48] [49]
However, the opposite view that dreaming has an information handling, memory-consolidating function (Hennevin and Leconte, 1971) is also common. Dreams are a result of the spontaneous firings of neural patterns while the brain is undergoing memory consolidation while sleeping. 	Dreams as resonance in neural circuits During sleep the eyes are closed, so that the brain to some degree becomes isolated from the outside world. Moreover all signals from the
senses
(except
olfaction ) must pass through the
thalamus
before they reach the
brain cortex , and during sleep thalamic activity is suppressed. [50]
This means that the brain mainly works with signals from itself. A well-known phenomenon in dynamical
physical systems
where the level of input and output from the system is low is that
oscillation
makes spontaneous
resonance
patterns to occur. Hence, dreams may be the simple consequence of
neural oscillation . Source/more:

...And Moses was right, for ordinary dreams are not the methods employed by the personalities of the spiritual world when they seek to communicate with material beings.... P.954 - 9
Apparently the Brilliant Evening Star is referring to this statement from Moses: ...Deuteronomy 13:1-5 "If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him. And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee." Source: Christian Bible
http://niv.scripture...teronomy/13.htm *** ...A person could be a law-abiding citizen by day, but when he fell asleep, his soul could enter a wolf or some other animal to prowl about on nocturnal depredations.... P.954 - 10 About werewolves: ...A
werewolf , also known as a
lycanthrope , is a
mythological
or
folkloric
human with the ability to
shapeshift
into a wolf or an
anthropomorphic
wolf -like creature, either purposely or after being placed under a
curse
and/or lycanthropic affliction via a bite or scratch from a werewolf, or some other means. This transformation is often associated with the appearance of the
full moon , as popularly noted by the medieval chronicler
Gervase of Tilbury , and perhaps in earlier times among the ancient
Greeks
through the writings of
Petronius . Werewolves are often attributed superhuman strength, speed, and senses, far beyond those of both wolves and men. The werewolf is generally held as a
European
character, although its lore spread through the world in later times. Shape-shifters, similar to werewolves, are common in tales from all over the world, most notably amongst the
Native Americans , though most of them involve animal forms other than wolves. Werewolves are a frequent subject of modern
fiction , although fictional werewolves have been attributed traits distinct from those of original folklore. For example, the ideas that werewolves are only vulnerable to
silver bullets
or that they can cause others to become werewolves by biting or wounding them derive from works of modern fiction. Werewolves continue to endure in modern culture and fiction, with books, films and television shows cementing the werewolf's stance as a dominant figure in horror. ...An 18th century engraving of a werewolf Source/more:

http://bible.cc/psalms/33-6.htm *** Mirrors and Superstition: ...There are many
legends
and
superstitions
surrounding mirrors. Mirrors are said to be a reflection of the
soul , and they were often used in traditional
witchcraft
as tools for
scrying
or performing other spells. It is also said that mirrors cannot lie. They can show only the truth, so it is a bad omen to see something in a mirror which should not be there. Also there is a European legend that a newborn child should not see a mirror until its first birthday as its soul is still developing. If the child sees its reflection it is said that it will die. It is a common superstition that someone who breaks a mirror will receive seven years of bad luck. [32]
The reason for this belief is that the mirror is believed to reflect part of the soul. Therefore, breaking a mirror will break part of the soul. However, the soul is said to
regenerate
every seven years, thus coming back unbroken.
To prevent a broken mirror from reflecting a broken soul during the seven-year
interim , one of many rituals must be performed. Two alternatives include grinding the broken mirror to dust (perhaps the easiest approach) [33]
or burying the mirror.
It is also said that tapping the broken mirror on a gravestone seven times will allow the soul to heal. However, if the mirror is both touched to the gravestone and buried, the bad luck will remain. The only course of action for one in this position is to dig up the mirror and grind it to dust. This dust must be sprinkled around the same gravestone on which the mirror was initially tapped. There is a
Buddhist
belief that negative spirits will enter houses through the door if they have triangular-shaped roofs. Hanging a small circular mirror in front of the door will prevent the bad spirits from entering. In days past, it was customary in the southern United States to cover the mirrors in a house where the
wake
of a deceased person was being held. It was believed that the person's soul would become trapped in a mirror if it was left uncovered. This practice is still followed in other countries (e.g.,
Romania ), extending to everything that could reflect the deceased person's face (such as
TVs
and appliances). Another explanation given is that the devil will appear in the reflection of the dead. Mirrors falling from walls or otherwise breaking or cracking mysteriously were said to be haunted. A similar custom existed in Greece, in the belief that use of mirrors is a sign of
vanity
that does not become
mourning . (Other Greek mourning customs include not playing music, not entertaining guests, and using no festive decorations, e.g. on
Christmas , during the customary year-long mourning period). According to legend, a
vampire
has no reflection in mirrors because it is an
undead
creature and has already lost its soul. Another superstition claims it is bad luck to have two mirrors facing each other. A staple of childhood
slumber parties
is the game
Bloody Mary , which involves chanting "Bloody Mary" three times in a darkened room while staring into a mirror. There are many versions of the game, but the general idea is that "Mary" will appear in the mirror and attempt to harm or kill the person who has summoned her. Thanks to a series of popular horror movies based on a supernatural killer who haunted mirrors, the phrase " Candyman " may be substituted for Mary. Source/more:

Amazon Basin , as well as among certain tribes of the
Celts , the
West Germanic
peoples, the Norse [1]
and
Scythians
of ancient
Europe . In fact, it occurred in Europe until the early 20th century in the Balkan Peninsula and to the end of the Middle Ages in Ireland and the
Anglo-Scottish border
regions. [2] ...Some experts theorize that the practice stemmed from the belief that the head contained " soul
matter" or life force, which could be harnessed through its capture. ...The
Celts
of
Europe
practised headhunting as the head was believed to house a person's soul. Source/more:
http://en.wikipedia....iki/Headhunting *** About scalping: ...Scalping
is the act of removing another person's
scalp
or a portion of their scalp, either from a dead body or from a living person. The initial purpose of scalping was to provide a trophy of battle or portable proof of a combatant's prowess in war. Eventually, the act became motivated primarily for financial reasons; people received payment per scalp they acquired. Scalping is often associated with
frontier
warfare in North America, and was practiced by
Native Americans , colonists, and frontiersmen across centuries of violent conflict. Some Mexican ( e.g. , Sonora and Chihuahua) and American territories ( e.g. , Arizona) paid
bounties
for enemy Native American scalps. [1]
Contrary to popular belief, scalping was far from universal amongst Native Americans. Source/more:

. PS: More about the dream state: ...The savage believes his dreams to be just as real as any part of his waking experience.... P.954 - 8
...Studies have observed dreaming in monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, elephants and shrews. There have also been signs of dreaming in certain birds and reptiles.
Sleeping and dreaming are intertwined. Scientific research results regarding the function of dreaming in animals remain disputable; however, the function of sleeping in living organisms is increasingly clear. For example, recent sleep deprivation experiments conducted on rats and other animals have resulted in the deterioration of physiological functioning and actual tissue damage of the animals. ...From the 1940s to 1985,
Calvin S. Hall
collected more than 50,000 dream reports at
Western Reserve University . In 1966 Hall and Van De Castle published
The Content Analysis of Dreams
in which they outlined a coding system to study 1,000 dream reports from college students. It was found that people all over the world dream of mostly the same things. Hall's complete dream reports became publicly available in the mid-1990s by Hall's protégé
William Domhoff , allowing further different analysis. Personal experiences from the last day or week are frequently incorporated into dreams. 	Visuals The visual nature of dreams is generally highly phantasmagoric; that is, different locations and objects continuously blend into each other. The visuals (including locations, characters/people, objects/artifacts) are generally reflective of a person's memories and experiences, but often take on highly exaggerated and bizarre forms. 	Emotions The most common emotion experienced in dreams is
anxiety . Other emotions include abandonment, anger, fear, joy, happiness, etc. Negative emotions are much more common than positive ones. 	Sexual themes The Hall data analysis shows that sexual dreams occur no more than 10% of the time and are more prevalent in young to mid-teens.
Another study showed that 8% of men's and women's dreams have sexual content. In some cases, sexual dreams may result in
orgasms
or
nocturnal emissions . These are colloquially known as
wet dreams . 	Recurring dreams While the content of most dreams is dreamt only once, many people experience recurring dreams—that is, the same dream narrative or dreamscape is experienced over different occasions of sleep. 	Color vs. black and white A small minority of people say that they dream only in black and white. Dreams make a fascinating study and there is a great deal of information available about them. Probably the living culture most focused on the "dreamlife" is in Australia:
...Aboriginal beliefs The Dreaming
is a common term within the
animist
creation narrative of
indigenous Australians
for a personal, or group,
creation
and for what may be understood as the "timeless time" of formative creation and perpetual creating. In addition, the term applies to places and localities on indigenous Australian traditional land (and throughout non-traditional Australia) where the uncreated creation spirits and
totemic
ancestors, or
genius loci , reside. No one English word covers the concept; for example,
Anangu
who speak
Pitjantjatjara
use the word
Tjukurpa
and those who speak
Yankunytjatjara
use
Wapar , but neither means dreaming in the English sense.
...Dreams and philosophical realism Main article:
Dream argument Some philosophers have concluded that what we think of as the "real world" could be or is an illusion (an idea known as the
skeptical hypothesis
about
ontology ). The first recorded mention of the idea was by
Zhuangzi , and it is also discussed in
Hinduism , which makes extensive use of the argument in its writings. [112]
It was formally introduced to Western philosophy by
Descartes
in the 17th century in his
Meditations on First Philosophy . Stimulus, usually an auditory one, becomes a part of a dream, eventually then awakening the dreamer. 	In Judaism In Judaism, dreams are considered part of the experience of the world that can be interpreted and that lessons can be garnered from. It is discussed in the Talmud, Tractate Berachot, Second Part. Source/much more:
