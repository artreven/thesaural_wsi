The
Sea of Galilee , also
Lake of Gennesaret ,
Lake Kinneret ,
Sea of Tiberias
or
Tiberias Lake
( Hebrew : ים כנרת‎,
Arabic : بحيرة طبرية‎), located near the
Golan Heights , is the largest
freshwater
lake
in
Israel , and it is approximately 53 km (33 miles) in circumference, about 21 km (13 miles) long, and 13 km (8 miles) wide. The lake has a total area of 166 km², and a maximum depth of approximately 43 m (141 feet). [3]
At 209 metres below sea level, it is the lowest freshwater lake on Earth and the second-lowest lake in the world (after the
Dead Sea , a
saltwater lake ). [4]
The lake is fed partly by underground springs although its main source is the
Jordan River
which flows through it from north to south.
The Kinneret is situated deep in the Jordan
Great Rift Valley , the valley caused by the separation of the
African
and
Arabian Plates . Consequently the area is subject to
earthquakes
and, in the past,
volcanic
activity. This is evident by the abundant
basalt
and other
igneous
rocks that define the geology of the Galilee region.
Etymology
The lake often appears on maps and in the
New Testament
as
Sea of Galilee
or
Sea of Tiberias
( John 6:1 ) while in the
Hebrew Bible , it is called the “Sea of Chinnereth” (or spelled as “Kinnereth”) ( Numbers 34:11 ;
Joshua 13:27 ).
The name may originate from the Hebrew word
kinnor
(“harp” or “lyre”)) in view of the shape of the lake. Christian religious texts call it
Lake of
Gennesaret
( Luke
5:1 ) or
Sea of Gennesaret [5]
after a small fertile plain that lies on its western side. The
Arabic
name for the lake is
Buhairet Tabariyya
( help · info ) (بحيرة طبريا) meaning
Lake Tiberias . Other names for the Sea of Galilee are
Ginnosar ,
Lake of Gennesar ,
Sea of Chinneroth
and
Sea of Tiberias
(Roman).
Antiquity
Lithograph of fishermen in the Sea of Galilee, 1890-1900
The Sea of Galilee lies on the ancient
Via Maris , which linked
Egypt
with the northern empires. The
Greeks ,
Hasmoneans , and
Romans
founded flourishing towns and settlements on the land-locked lake including
Gadara ,
Hippos
and
Tiberias . The first-century historian
Flavius Josephus
was so impressed by the area that he wrote, “One may call this place the ambition of Nature.” Josephus also reported a thriving fishing industry at this time, with 230 boats regularly working in the lake.
Much of the
ministry of Jesus
occurred on the shores of Lake Galilee. In those days, there was a continuous ribbon development of settlements and villages around the lake and plenty of trade and ferrying by boat. The
Synoptic gospels
of
Mark
(1:14-20),
Matthew
(4:18-22), and
Luke
(5:1-11) describe how Jesus recruited four of his
apostles
from the shores of Lake Galilee: the fishermen
Simon
and his brother
Andrew
and the brothers
John
and
James . One of Jesus’ famous teaching episodes, the
Sermon on the Mount , is supposed to have been given on a hill overlooking the lake. Many of his miracles are also said to have occurred here including
his walking on water ,
calming the storm , and his
feeding five thousand people
(in
Tabgha ).
In 135 CE
the second Jewish revolt against the Romans
was put down. The Romans responded by banning all Jews from
Jerusalem . The center of Jewish culture and learning shifted to the region of the Kinneret, particularly the city of
Tiberias . It was in this region that the so-called “ Jerusalem Talmud ” is thought to have been compiled.
In the time of the
Byzantine Empire , the lake’s significance in Jesus’ life made it a major destination for
Christian pilgrims . This led to the growth of a full-fledged
tourist
industry, complete with package tours and plenty of comfortable inns.

The lake’s importance declined when the Byzantines lost control and area came under the control of the
Umayyad Caliphate
and subsequent Islamic empires. Apart from Tiberias, the major towns and cities in the area were gradually abandoned. [ citation needed ]
The palace
Khirbat al-Minya
was built by the lake during the reign of the Umayyad caliph
al-Walid I
(705-715 CE). In 1187,
Saladin
defeated the armies of the
Crusades
at the
Battle of Hattin , largely because he was able to cut the Crusaders off from the valuable fresh water of the Sea of Galilee.
Modern times

In 1909, Jewish pioneers established the first cooperative farming village ( kibbutz ), Kvutzat
Kinneret . The settlement trained Jewish immigrants in farming and agriculture. Later, Kinneret pioneers established Kibbutz
Degania . The Kinneret is considered the cradle of the kibbutz culture of early
Zionism
and the birthplace of
Naomi Shemer
and the burial site of
Rachel
– two of the most prominent Israeli poets.
In 1917, the British defeated Ottoman Turk forces and took control of both Palestine and Syria. In the carve-up of the Ottoman territories between Britain and France, it was agreed that Britain would retain control of Palestine, while France would control Syria. However, the allies had to fix the border between the
British and French Mandates . [6]
In 1923 an agreement between the
United Kingdom
and
France
established the border between the
British Mandate for Palestine
and the
French Mandate of Syria . The Zionist movement pressured the French and British to assign as many water sources as possible to
Palestine
during the demarcating negotiations. These constant demands influenced the negotiators and finally led to the inclusion of the whole Sea of Galilee, both sides of the
Jordan river ,
Lake Hula , Dan spring, and part of the
Yarmouk . [7]
The High Commissioner of Palestine,
Herbert Samuel , had demanded full control of the Sea of Galilee. [8]
The new border followed a 10-meter wide strip along the lake’s northeastern shore, [9]
and
Syria
became landlocked in the southwest. However, the British and French Agreement provided that:
any existing rights over the use of the waters of the Jordan by the inhabitants of Syria shall be maintained unimpaired.
the Government of Syria shall have the right to erect a new pier at Semakh on Lake Tiberias or to have joint use of the existing pier
persons or goods passing between the existing landing-stage or any future landing-stages on the Lake of Tiberias and Semakh Station shall not by reason of the mere fact that they must cross the territory of Palestine be deemed persons or goods entering Palestine for the purpose of Customs or other regulations, and the right of the Syrian Government and their agents to access to the said landing-stages is recognised.
the inhabitants of Syria and of the Lebanon shall have the same fishing and navigation rights on Lakes Huleh and Tiberias and on the River Jordan between the said lakes as the inhabitants of Palestine, but the Government of Palestine shall be responsible for the policing of the lakes. [10]
On May 15, 1948, Syria invaded the State of Israel, [11]
capturing some Israeli kibbutzim near the Sea of Galilee. [12]
By the end of the war, Israel had recaptured the eastern shore. [ citation needed ]
Current status
Israel’s
National Water Carrier , built in 1964, transports water from the lake to the population centers of Israel, and is the source of much of the country’s drinking water.
In 1964,
Syria
attempted construction of a
Headwater Diversion Plan
that would have blocked the flow of water into the Sea of Galilee, sharply reducing the water flow into the lake. [13]
This project and Israel’s attempt to block these efforts in 1965 were factors which played into regional tensions culminating in the 1967
Six-Day War . During the war, Israel captured the
Golan Heights , which contain some of the sources of water for the Sea of Galilee.
Under the terms of the
Israel–Jordan peace treaty , Israel also supplies 50 million cubic metres of water annually from the lake to
Jordan . [14]
Increasing water demand and some dry winters have resulted in stress on the lake and a decreasing water line, at times to dangerously low levels.
Today, tourism is again the Kinneret’s most important economic activity with the entire region being a popular holiday destination. The many historical and spiritual sites around the lake, especially its main town Tiberias, are visited by millions of local and foreign tourists annually. Other economic activities include fishing in the lake and agriculture, particularly
bananas , in the fertile belt of land surrounding it.
A key attraction is the site where the Kinneret’s water flows into the Jordan River to which thousands of pilgrims from all over the world come to be baptized every year.
Fauna and flora
The warm waters of the Sea of Galilee allow a variety of flora and fauna to thrive, which have supported a significant commercial fishery for over two millennia. Local flora includes a variety of reeds along most of the shoreline as well as
Phytoplankton . Fauna includes
Zooplankton
and
Benthos , as well as a fish population which notably includes
Tilapia
(locally known as
St. Peter’s Fish ). [15]
Environmental issues
Water levels March 2007 – April 2010
Water levels are dangerously low, putting the Sea of Galilee at risk of becoming irreversibly salinized by the salt water springs under the lake that are limited by the weight of the freshwater on top of them. [16]

Tiberias
(pronounced
/taɪˈbɪəri.əs/ ;
Hebrew : טְבֶרְיָה‎,
Tverya
(audio)
( help · info );
Arabic : طبرية‎,
Ṭabariyyah ) is a city on the western shore of the
Sea of Galilee , Lower
Galilee ,
Israel . Established in 20 CE, it was named in honour of the emperor
Tiberius . [2]
Since the 16th century, Tiberias has been considered one of
Judaism ‘s
Four Holy Cities , along with
Jerusalem ,
Hebron
and
Safed . [3]
In the 2nd-10th centuries, Tiberias was the largest Jewish city in the Galilee, and the political and religious hub of the Jews of Palestine. According to Christian tradition,
Jesus
performed several miracles in the Tiberias district, making it an important pilgrimage site for devout Christians. [4]
Tiberias has historically been known for its
hot springs , believed to cure skin and other ailments, for thousands of years (This southern part of today’s Tiberias was probably the site of the Bilbical village of Chammath (Joshua 19:35)). [4]
History
Antiquity
Tiberias was founded as a Jewish city sometime around 20 CE by
Herod Antipas , son of
Herod the Great , who made it the capital of his realm in Galilee. It was named in honor of the
Roman Emperor
Tiberius . There is a legend that Tiberias was built on the site of the biblical village of
Rakkat , mentioned in the
Book of Joshua
(Joshua 19:35). [5]
A discussion of Tiberias as
Rakkat
appears in the
Talmud . [6]
In
The Antiquities of the Jews , the Roman Jewish historian
Josephus
states that Tiberias was near
Emmaus . [2]
This location is repeated in
The Wars of the Jews . [7]
Under the
Roman Empire , the city was known by its
Greek
name
Τιβεριάς
( Tiberiás ,
Modern Greek
Τιβεριάδα
Tiveriáda ), an adaptation of the
taw -suffixed
Semitic
form that preserved its
feminine grammatical gender .
In the days of Antipas, the more traditional (as opposed to Hellenized)
Jews
refused to settle there; the presence of a
cemetery
rendered the site ritually unclean. Antipas settled many non-Jews there from rural Galilee and other parts of his domains in order to populate his new capital, and built a palace on the acropolis. [8]
The prestige of Tiberias was so great that the sea of Galilee soon came to be named the sea of Tiberias; however, what would now be called Jewish zealots continued to call it ‘Yam Ha-Kinerett’, its traditional name. [8]
The city was governed by a city council of 600 with a committee of 10 until 44 CE when a Roman Procurator was set over the city after the death of
Agrippa I . [8]
In 61 CE
Agrippa II
annexed the city to his kingdom whose capital was
Caesarea Phillippi . [9]
During the
First Jewish–Roman War
Josephus Flavius took control of the city and destroyed Herod’s palace but was able to stop the city being pillaged by his Jewish army. [8] [10]
Where most other cities in Palestine were razed, Tiberias was spared because its inhabitants remained loyal to Rome after
Josephus Flavius
had surrendered the city to the Roman emperor
Vespasian . [8] [11]
It became a mixed city after the fall of Jerusalem; with Judea subdued, the southern Jewish population migrated to Galilee. [12] [13]
In 145 CE, Rabbi
Shimon bar Yochai
“cleansed the city of ritual impurity allowing Jews to settle in the city in numbers.” [9]
The
Sanhedrin , the Jewish court, also fled from Jerusalem during the Great Jewish Revolt against the Roman Empire, and after several moves eventually settled in Tiberias in about 150 CE. [8] [13]
It was to be its final meeting place before disbanding in the early Byzantine period. Following the expulsion of all Jews from
Jerusalem
after 135, Tiberias and its neighbor
Sepphoris
became the major Jewish centres. From the time when
Yochanan bar Nafcha
(d. 279) settled in Tiberias, the city became the focus of Jewish religious scholarship in the land. The
Mishnah
along with the
Jerusalem Talmud , (the written discussions of generations of rabbis in the Land of Israel – primarily in the academies of Tiberias and
Caesarea ), was probably compiled in Tiberias by Rabbi
Judah haNasi
in around 200 CE. [13]
The 13 synagogues served the spiritual needs of a growing Jewish population. [8]
In the sixth century Tiberias was still the seat of Jewish religious learning. In light of this, Bishop
Simeon of Beth Arsham
urged the Christians of Palestine to seize the leaders of Judaism in Tiberias, to put them to the rack, and to compel them to command the Jewish king,
Dhu Nuwas , to desist from persecuting the Christians in
Najran . [14]
In 614, Tiberias was the site where during the final
Jewish revolt
against the
Byzantine Empire , some of the Jewish population supported the
Persian
invaders; the Christians were massacred and the churches destroyed. In 628 the Byzantium army retook Tiberias and the slaughter of the Christians was then reciprocated with a slaughter of the Jews. [ citation needed ]
Middle Ages
In 636 CE Tiberias was the regional capital until Bet Shean took its place following the
Rashidun
conquest. The Caliphate allowed 70 Jewish families from Tiberias to form the core of a renewed Jewish presence in Jerusalem and the importance of Tiberias to Jewish life declined. [9]
The caliphs of the
Umayyad
Dynasty built one of its square-plan palaces on the waterfront to the north of Tiberias, at
Khirbet al-Minya . Tiberias was revitalised in 749 after Bet Shean was destroyed in an earthquake. [9]
Jewish scholarship flourished from the beginning of the 8th century to the end of the 10th., when the oral traditions of ancient
Hebrew , still in use today, were codified. One of the leading members of the Tiberian masoretic community was
Aaron ben Moses ben Asher , who refined the oral tradition now known as
Tiberian Hebrew . Ben Asher is also credited with putting the finishing touches on the
Aleppo Codex , the oldest existing manuscript of the Hebrew scriptures.
The Arab geographer
al-Muqaddasi
writing in 985, describes Tiberias as “the capital of Jordan Province, and a city in the Valley of Canaan…The town is narrow, hot in summer and unhealthy…There are here eight natural hot baths, where no fuel need be used, and numberless basins besides of boiling water. The
mosque
is large and fine, and stands in the market-place. Its floor is laid in pebbles, set on stone drums, placed close one to another.” According to Muqaddesi, those who suffered from scab or ulcers, and other such diseases came to Tiberias to bath in the hot springs for three days. “Afterwards they dip in another spring which is cold, whereupon…they become cured.” [15]
In 1033 Tiberias was again destroyed by an earthquake. [9]
Nasir-i Khusrou
visited in 1047, and describes a city with a “strong wall” which begins at the border of the lake and goes all around the town except on the water-side. Furthermore, he describes
“numberless buildings erected in the very water, for the bed of the lake in this part is rock; and they have built pleasure houses that are supported on columns of
marble , rising up out of the water. The lake is very full of fish. [] The Friday Mosque is in the midst of the town. At the gate of the mosque is a spring, over which they have built a hot bath. [] On the western side of the town is a mosque known as the Jasmine Mosque (Masjid-i-Yasmin). It is a fine building and in the middle part rises a great platform (dukkan), where they have their
Mihrabs
(or prayer-niches). All round those they have set
jasmine -shrubs, from which the mosque derives its name.” [16]
During the
First Crusade
it was occupied by the
Franks , soon after the capture of
Jerusalem
and it was given in fief to
Tancred , who made it his capital of the
Principality of Galilee
in the
Kingdom of Jerusalem ; the region was sometimes called the Principality of Tiberias, or the Tiberiad. [17]
In 1099 the original site of the city was abandoned, and settlement shifted north to the present location. [9]
St. Peter’s Church, originally built by the Crusaders, is still standing today, although the building has been altered and reconstructed over the years.
In 1187
Saladin
ordered his son
al-Afdal
to send an envoy to Count
Raymond of Tripoli
requesting safe passage through his fiefdom of Galilee and Tiberias. Raymond was obliged to grant the request under the terms of his treaty with Saladin. Saladin’s force left
Caesarea Philippi
to engage the fighting force of the
Knights Templar . The Templar force was destroyed in
the encounter . Saladin then
besieged
Tiberias, after 6 days the town fell. On July 4, 1187 Saladin defeated the Crusaders coming to relieve Tiberias at the
Battle of Hattin
10 km outside the city. [18]
At the beginning of the 12th century the Jewish community numbered about 50 families; and at that time the best manuscripts of the
Torah
were said to be found there. [14]
Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, ( Maimonides ), a leading Jewish legal scholar, philosopher and physician of his period, died in 1204 and was buried in Tiberias, now one of the city’s important pilgrimage sites.
Yakut , writing in the 1220s, described Tiberias as a small town, long and narrow. He also describes the “hot salt springs, over which they have built
Hammams
which use no fuel. Tabariyyah was first conquered by (the Arab commander)
Shurahbil
in the year 13 (634 AD) by capitulation; one half of the houses and churches were to belong to the Muslims, the other half to the Christians.” [19]
In 1265 the
Crusaders
were driven from the city by the
Mamluks , who ruled Tiberias until the Ottoman conquest in 1516. [9]
Ottoman era
A map of the Tiberias region in the 1870s by the
Palestine Exploration Fund
As the
Ottoman Empire
expanded along the southern Mediterranean coast under sultan
Selim I , the
Reyes Católicos
( Catholic Monarchs ) began establishing
Inquisition
commissions. Many
Conversos , ( Marranos
and
Moriscos ) and
Sephardi Jews
fled in fear to the Ottoman provinces, settling at first in
Constantinople ,
Salonika ,
Sarajevo ,
Sofia
and
Anatolia . The Sultan encouraged them to settle in Palestine. [9] [20] [21]
In 1558, a Portuguese-born
marrano ,
Doña Gracia , was granted tax collecting rights in Tiberias and its surrounding villages by
Suleiman the Magnificent . She envisaged the town becoming a refuge for Jews and obtained a permit to establish Jewish autonomy there. [22]
In 1561 her nephew
Joseph Nasi ,
Lord of Tiberias , [23]
encouraged Jews to settle in Tiberias. [24]
Securing a
firman
from the Sultan, he and
Joseph ben Adruth
rebuilt the city walls and lay the groundwork for a textile ( silk ) industry, planting
mulberry trees
and urging craftsmen to move there. [24]
Plans were made for Jews to move from the
Papal States , but when the Ottomans and the Republic of Venice went to war, the plan was abandoned. [24]
No Christians or Jews were mentioned in the Ottoman registers of 1525, 1533, 1548, 1553 and 1572. [25]
The registers in 1596 recorded the population to consist of 50 Muslim families and 4 bachelors. [26]
In 1624, when the Sultan recognized
Fakhr-al-Din II
as Lord of Arabistan (from Aleppo to the borders of Egypt), [27]
the
Druze
leader made Tiberias his capital. [9]
In the 1720s,
Dhaher al-Omar
a
Bedouin , fortified the town and signed an agreement with the neighboring Bedouin tribes to prevent looting. Accounts from that time tell of the great admiration people had for Dhaher, especially his war against bandits on the roads.
Richard Pococke , who visited Tiberias in 1727, witnessed the building of a fort to the north of the city, and the strengthening of the old walls, attributing it to a dispute with the
pasha (ruler)
of Damascus. [28]
In the 1740, Tiberias was under the autonomous rule of Dhaher. Under Dhaher’s patronage, Jewish families were encouraged to settle in Tiberias. [29]
He invited
Chaim Abulafia
of
Smyrna
to rebuild the Jewish community. [30]
The synagogue he built still stands. [31] [32]
That year, the Pasha of Damascus launched a raid against Tiberias. The siege lasted 85 days, ending in the capture of the city. [9]
View of Tiberas, 1862
In 1775,
Ahmed el-Jazzar
“the Butcher”, brought peace to the region with an iron fist. [9]
In 1780, many Polish Jews settled in the town. [30]
It was during the 18th and 19th centuries that the town received an influx of
rabbis
who established the city as a center for Jewish learning. [ citation needed ]
Six hundred people, including nearly 500 Jews, [30]
died in 1837 when the town was devastated by the
Galilee earthquake . [9]
An American expedition found Tiberias still in a state of disrepair in 1847/1848. [33]
In 1842 there were about 4,000 inhabitants, around a third of whom were Jews, the rest being Turks and a few Christians. [34]
In 1850 Tiberias contained
three synagogues
which served the
Sephardi
community, which consisted of 80 families, and the
Ashkenazim , all Poles and Russians, numbering about 100 families. It was reported that the Jewish inhabitants of Tiberias enjoyed more peace and security than those of
Safed . [30]
In 1863 it is recorded that the Christian and Muslim elements made up three-quarters of the population (2,000 to 4,000). [35]
In 1901, the Jews of Tiberias numbered about 2,000 in a total population of 3,600. [14]
By 1912 the population reached 6,500. This included 4,500 Jews, 1,600 Muslims and the rest Christians. [36]
British Mandate
Tiberias prior to 1946
Initially the relationship between Arabs and Jews in Tiberias was good, with few incidents occurring in the
Nebi Musa riots
and the disturbances throughout
Palestine in 1929 . [9]
The landscape of the modern town was shaped by the great flood of Nov. 11, 1934. Deforestation on the slopes above the town combined with the fact that the city had been built as a series of closely-packed houses and buildings – usually sharing walls – built in narrow roads paralleling and closely hugging the shore of the lake. Flood waters carrying mud, stones, and boulders rushed down the slopes and filled the streets and buildings with water so rapidly that many people did not have time to escape, The loss of life and property was great. The city rebuilt on the slopes and the British Mandatory government planted the Scottish Forest on the slopes above the town to hold the soil and prevent similar disasters from recurring. A new seawall was constructed, moving the shoreline several yards out form the former shore. [37] [38]
In October 1938 Arab militants
murdered 20 Jews
in Tiberias during the
1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine . [39]
The population of Tiberias was recorded by the British authorities as follows:
1922: 4427 Jews, 2096 Muslims, 422 Christians, 5 others
[40]
1931: 5381 Jews, 2645 Muslims, 565 Christians, 10 others
[41]
1945 : 6000 Jews, 4540 Muslims, 760 Christians, 10 others
[42]
1948 Arab-Israeli War
Between the April 8–9, 1948, sporadic shooting broke out between the Jewish and Arab neighbourhoods of Tiberias. On April 10, the Haganah launched a mortar barrage, killing some Arab residents. [43]
The local National Committee refused the offer of the
Arab Liberation Army
to take over defense of the city, but a small contingent of outside irregulars moved in. [43]
During April 10–17, the Haganah attacked the city and refused to negotiate a truce, while the British refused to intervene. [43]
The Arab population (6,000 residents or 47.5% of the population) was evacuated under British military protection on 18 April 1948. [43] [44]
No order to expel the population had been given to the Jewish forces and the evacuation seems to have surprised them. [43]
Widespread looting of the Arab areas by the Jewish population had to be suppressed by force by the Haganah and Jewish police, who killed or injured several looters. [43]
Urban renewal and preservation
Beachfront of modern Tiberias
Sea of Galilee from Tiberias, at dusk
Ancient and medieval Tiberias was destroyed by a series of devastating earthquakes, and much of what was built after the major earthquake of 1837 was destroyed or badly damaged in the great flood of 1934. Houses in the newer parts of town, uphill from the waterfront, survived. During 1949, 606 houses, comprising almost all of the built-up area of the old quarter other than religious buildings, was demolished over the objections of local Jews who owned about half the houses. [45]
This was an initiative of the Israeli government with the support of some local Jewish leaders who saw the Arab exodus as an opportunity to eradicate an urban area they considered as obsolete and a hindrance to modern redevelopment. [45]
The main local advocates for the demolition were Zionist leaders Moshe Weis and Yosef Nachmani, who wrote that the old quarter “fills one with disgust”, and believed that demolition would prevent the return of the former Arab residents. [45]
Redevelopment of the area did not begin in earnest until after the
1967 war , with the major part of the construction being completed in the early 1970s. [45]
In place of the old quarter now stand a waterfront promenade, open parkland, shopping streets, restaurants, and modern hotels. Carefully preserved were several churches, including one with foundations dating from the Crusader period, the city’s two Ottoman-era mosques, and several
ancient synagogues . [46]
The city’s old masonry buildings constructed of local black basalt with white limestone windows and trim have been designated historic landmarks. Also preserved are parts of the ancient wall, the Ottoman-era citadel, historic hotels, Christian pilgrim hostels, convents and schools.
The town retains two historic mosques, one on the waterfront promenade, and another larger one that is now boarded up. The masonry of both minarets has been carefully restored. In retaliation for the Arab attack on the
Tomb of Joseph
in Nablus, a group of Israeli right-wing extremists attempted to torch one of the old mosques. [47] [48]
Earthquakes
Tiberias has been severely damaged by earthquakes since antiquity. Earthquakes are known to have occurred in 30, 33, 115, 306, 363, 419, 447, 631-2 (aftershocks continued for a month) 1033, 1182, 1202, 1546, 1759, 1837, 1927 and 1943. [49]

Archaeology
A 2,000 year-old Roman theatre was discovered 15 meters below ground near Mount Bernike in the Tiberias hills. It seated over 7,000 people. [50]
Excavations on the shore unearthed a rare coin with the image of
Jesus
on one side and the Greek words “Jesus the Messiah King of Kings” on the other. It belongs to a series of coins issued in Constantinople to commemorate the First Millennium of Jesus’ birth. Such coins have surfaced in neighboring countries, such as Turkey, but this is the first one found in Israel. It is believed to have been brought to Tiberias by Christian pilgrims. [51]

Nazareth
(pronounced
/ˈnæzərəθ/ ;
Hebrew : נָצְרַת‎,
Natzrat
or
Natzeret ;
Arabic : الناصرة‎
al-Nā ṣ ira
or
al-Naseriyye ) is the capital and largest
city
in the
North District of Israel . Known as “the
Arab
capital of
Israel ,” the population is made up predominantly of
Arab citizens of Israel . [2] [3]
In the
New Testament , the city is described as the
childhood
home of
Jesus , and as such is a center of
Christian
pilgrimage , with many shrines commemorating biblical events. The name “Nazareth” may derive from the Hebrew verb
na·tsar , נָצַר, meaning “watch, guard, keep.”
Etymology
Nazareth is not mentioned in pre-Christian texts and appears in many different Greek forms in the New Testament. There is no consensus regarding the origin of the name. It must be noted that, in their scriptures, the Mandeans mention
nasirutha
as a place they go. [4] [5]
Biblical references
“Nazareth” assumes several forms (Nazara, Nazaret, Nazareth, Nazarat, Nazarath) in surviving Greek versions of the New Testament. Many scholars have questioned a link between “Nazareth” and the terms “ Nazarene ” and “ Nazoraean ” on linguistic grounds, [6]
while some affirm the possibility of etymological relation “given the idiosyncrasies of Galilean Aramaic.” [7]
Of the twelve appearances of the town’s name in the New Testament, ten use the form
Nazaret
or
Nazareth , and two use the form
Nazara . [4]
Nazara
(Ναζαρα) is generally considered the earliest form of the name in Greek, and is found in
Matthew 4:13
and
Luke 4:16 , as well as the putative
Q document , which many scholars maintain preceded 70 CE and the formation of the canonical Christian gospels. [4] [8]
The form
Nazareth
appears once in the Gospel of Matthew
21:11 , four times in the birth chapters of the Gospel of Luke at
1:26 ;
2:4 ,
2:39 ,
2:51 , and once in the Acts of the Apostles at
10:38 . In the Gospel of Mark, the name appears only once in
1:9
in the form
Nazaret .
Extrabiblical references
The form
Nazara
is also found in the earliest non-scriptural reference to the town, a citation by
Sextus Julius Africanus
dated about 200 CE. (See “Middle Roman to Byzantine Periods” below.) The Church Father
Origen
(c. 185 to 254 CE) knows the forms
Nazara
and
Nazaret . [9]
Later,
Eusebius
in his
Onomasticon
(translated by
St. Jerome ) also refers to the settlement as
Nazara . [10]
The first non-Christian reference to Nazareth is an inscription on a marble fragment from a
synagogue
found in
Caesarea Maritima
in 1962. [11]
This fragment gives the town’s name in Hebrew as
nun·tsade·resh·tav.
The inscription dates as early as c. 300 CE and chronicles the assignment of priests that took place at some time after the
Bar Kokhba revolt , 132-35 CE. [12]
(See “Middle Roman to Byzantine Periods” below.) An 8th century CE Hebrew inscription, which was the earliest known Hebrew reference to Nazareth prior to the discovery of the inscription above, uses the same form. [4]
Origin of name
One theory holds that “Nazareth” is derived from the Hebrew noun
ne·tser , נֵ֫צֶר, meaning branch. [13]
Ne·tser
is not the common Hebrew word for “branch,” but one understood as a messianic title based on a passage in the
Book of Isaiah . [14]
The negative references to Nazareth in the
Gospel of John
suggest that ancient Jews did not connect the town’s name to prophecy. [15]
Alternately, the name may derive from the verb
na·tsar , נָצַר, “watch, guard, keep.” [16]
Another theory holds that the Greek form
Nazara , used in Matthew and Luke, may derive from an earlier
Aramaic
form of the name, or from another
Semitic
language form. [17]
If there were a
tsade
in the original Semitic form, as in the later Hebrew forms, it would normally have been transcribed in Greek with a
sigma
instead of a
zeta . [4]
This has led some scholars to question whether “Nazareth” and its cognates in the New Testament actually refer to the settlement we know traditionally as Nazareth in Lower Galilee. [18]
Such linguistic discrepancies may be explained, however, “by a peculiarity of the ‘Palestinian’ Aramaic dialect wherein a sade (ṣ) between two voiced (sonant) consonants tended to be partially assimilated by taking on a zayin (z) sound.” [4]
The Arabic name for Nazareth is
an-Nā ṣ ira , and
Jesus
( Arabic : يسوع‎‎,
Yasū`
or
Arabic : عيسى‎,
`Īsā ) is also called
an-Nā ṣ irī , reflecting the Arab tradition of according people a
nisba , a name denoting from whence a person comes in either geographical or tribal terms. In the
Koran , Christians are referred to as
nasara , meaning “followers of an-Nāṣirī,” or “those who follow Jesus.” [19]
Geography and population
Map showing the location of Nazareth in Israel
Two general locations of Nazareth are attested in the most ancient texts. The Galilean (Northern) location is familiar from the Christian gospels. However, a Southern (Judean) tradition is also attested in several early noncanonical texts. [20]
Modern-day Nazareth is nestled in a natural bowl which reaches from 1,050 feet (320 m)
above sea level
to the crest of the hills about 1,600 feet (490 m). [21]
Nazareth is about 25 kilometres (16 mi) from the
Sea of Galilee
(17 km as the crow flies) and about 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) west from
Mount Tabor . The Nazareth Range, in which the town lies, is the southernmost of several parallel east-west hill ranges that characterize the elevated tableau of Lower Galilee.
Nazareth is the largest Arab city in Israel. [22]
Until the beginning of the
British Mandate in Palestine
(1922–1948), the population was predominantly Arabic speaking Christian (majority
Greek Orthodox ), with an Arab Muslim minority. Nazareth today still has a significant Christian population, made up of
Maronites , Greek Orthodox,
Coptics , among others. The Muslim population has grown, for a number of historical factors, that include the city having served as administrative center under British rule, and the influx of internally displaced Palestinian Arabs absorbed into the city from neighbouring towns following the
1948 Palestine war . Its population remains almost exclusively Arab and numbered 64,800 in late 2009. [23]
History
Ancient times
Archaeological research revealed a funerary and cult center at
Kfar HaHoresh , about two miles (3 km) from Nazareth, dating back roughly 9000 years (to what is known as the
Pre-Pottery Neolithic B
era). [24]
The remains of some 65 individuals were found, buried under huge horizontal headstone structures, some of which consisted of up to 3 tons of locally-produced white plaster. Decorated human skulls uncovered there have led archaeologists to believe that Kfar HaHoresh was a major cult centre in that remote era. [25]
In 1620 the Catholic Church purchased an area in the Nazareth basin measuring approx. 100 × 150 m (328.08  ft  × 492.13 ft). on the side of the hill known as the Nebi Sa’in. This “Venerated Area” underwent extensive excavation in 1955-65 by the Franciscan priest Belarmino Bagatti, “Director of Christian Archaeology.” Fr. Bagatti has been the principal archaeologist at Nazareth. His book,
Excavations in Nazareth
(1969) is still the standard reference for the archaeology of the settlement, and is based on excavations at the Franciscan Venerated Area.
Fr. Bagatti uncovered pottery dating from the Middle Bronze Age (2200 to 1500 BC) and ceramics, silos and grinding mills from the Iron Age (1500 to 586 BC), pointing to substantial settlement in the Nazareth basin at that time. However, lack of archaeological evidence from
Assyrian ,
Babylonian ,
Persian ,
Hellenistic
or Early
Roman
times, at least in the major excavations between 1955 and 1990, shows that the settlement apparently came to an abrupt end about 720 BC, when many towns in the area were destroyed by the Assyrians.
Early Christian era
Church of the Annunciation
According to the
Gospel of Luke , Nazareth was the home of
Joseph
and
Mary
and the site of the
Annunciation
(when Mary was told by the
Angel
Gabriel
that she would have
Jesus
as her son); in the
Gospel of Matthew , Joseph and Mary resettle in Nazareth after
fleeing to Egypt
from their home in
Bethlehem . The differences and possible contradictions between these two accounts of the
nativity of Jesus
are part of the
Synoptic Problem . Nazareth is also allegedly where Jesus grew up from some point in his childhood. However, some modern scholars argue that Nazareth was also the birth place of Jesus. [26]
James Strange, an American archaeologist, notes: “Nazareth is not mentioned in ancient Jewish sources earlier than the third century AD. This likely reflects its lack of prominence both in Galilee and in Judaea.” [27]
Strange originally speculated that the population of Nazareth at the time of Christ to be “roughly 1,600 to 2,000 people”, but later, in a subsequent publication, at “a maximum of about 480.” [28]
In 2009 Israeli archaeologist Yardenna Alexandre excavated archaeological remains in Nazareth that might date to the time of Jesus in the early Roman period. Alexandre told reporters, “The discovery is of the utmost importance since it reveals for the very first time a house from the Jewish village of Nazareth.” [29]
According to the Israel Antiquities Authority, “The artifacts recovered from inside the building were few and mostly included fragments of pottery vessels from the Early Roman period (the first and second centuries CE)… Another hewn pit, whose entrance was apparently camouflaged, was excavated and a few pottery sherds from the Early Roman period were found inside it.” Alexandre adds that “based on other excavations that I conducted in other villages in the region, this pit was probably hewn as part of the preparations by the Jews to protect themselves during the Great Revolt against the Romans in 67 CE”. [30]
Ancient Nazareth may have built on the hillside, as indicated in the
Gospel of Luke :
[And they led Jesus] to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong . However, the hill in question (the Nebi Sa’in) is far too steep for ancient dwellings and averages a 14% grade in the venerated area. [31]
Historic Nazareth was essentially constructed in the valley; the windy hilltops in the vicinity have only been occupied since the construction of
Nazareth Illit
in 1957. Noteworthy is that all the post-Iron Age tombs in the Nazareth basin (approximately two dozen) are of the
kokh
(plural: kokhim ) or later types; this type probably first appeared in Galilee in the middle of the first century AD. [32]
Kokh tombs in the Nazareth area have been excavated by B. Bagatti, N. Feig, Z. Yavor, and noted by Z. Gal. [33]
Excavations conducted prior to 1931 in the Franciscan venerated area revealed no trace of a Greek or Roman settlement there, [34]
Fr. Bagatti, who acted as the principal
archaeologist
for the venerated sites in Nazareth, unearthed quantities of later
Roman
and
Byzantine
artifacts, [35]
attesting to unambiguous human presence there from the 2nd century AD onward.
John Dominic Crossan , a major figure in New Testament studies, remarked that Bagatti’s archaeological drawings indicate just how small the village actually was, suggesting that it was little more than an insignificant
hamlet
[36] .
Interior of
St Joseph’s Church .
Matthew 2:19-23
reads:
After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child’s life are dead.” So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”
In the
Gospel of John ,
Nathaniel
asks, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” [ 1:46 ]
The meaning of this cryptic question is debated. Some commentators and scholars suggest that it means Nazareth was very small and unimportant, but the question does not speak of Nazareth’s size but of its goodness. In fact, Nazareth was described negatively by the evangelists; the
Gospel of Mark
argues that Nazareth did not believe in Jesus and therefore he could “do no mighty work there”; in the
Gospel of Luke , the Nazarenes are portrayed as attempting to kill Jesus by throwing him off a cliff; in the
Gospel of Thomas , and in all four
canonical gospels , we read the famous saying that “a prophet is not without honor except in his own country.” [37]
Many scholars since W. Wrede (in 1901) [38]
have noted the so-called
Messianic secret
in the Gospel of Mark, whereby Jesus’ true nature and/or mission is portrayed as unseen by many, including by his inner circle of disciples (compare the
Gospel of John ‘s references to those to whom only the Father reveals Jesus will be saved). [39]
Nazareth, being the home of those near and dear to Jesus, apparently suffered negatively in relation to this doctrine. Thus, Nathanael’s question, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” is consistent with a negative view of Nazareth in the canonical gospels, and with the Johannine proclamation that
even his brothers did not believe in him .
A tablet at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, dating to 50 AD, was sent from Nazareth to
Paris
in 1878. It contains an inscription known as the “Ordinance of Caesar” that outlines the penalty of death for those who violate tombs or graves. However, it is suspected that this inscription came to Nazareth from somewhere else (possibly
Sepphoris ). Bagatti writes: “we are not certain that it was found in Nazareth, even though it came from Nazareth to Paris. At Nazareth there lived various vendors of antiquities who got ancient material from several places.” [40]
C. Kopp is more definite: “It must be accepted with certainty that [the Ordinance of Caesar]… was brought to the Nazareth market by outside merchants.” [41]
Princeton University
archaeologist Jack Finegan describes additional archaeological evidence related to settlement in the Nazareth basin during the
Bronze
and
Iron Ages , and states that “Nazareth was a strongly
Jewish
settlement in the
Roman
period.”. [42]
In the mid-1990s, shopkeeper Elias Shama discovered tunnels under his shop near
Mary’s Well
in Nazareth. The tunnels were eventually recognized as a
hypocaust
(a space below the floor into which warm air was pumped) for a bathhouse. The surrounding site was excavated in 1997-98 by Yardena Alexandre, and the archaeological remains exposed were ascertained to date from the Roman,
Crusader ,
Mamluk
and
Ottoman
periods. [43] [44] [45] [46]
Nazareth in 1842
Epiphanius
writes in the
Panarion
(c. 375 AD) [47]
of a certain elderly Count Joseph of Tiberias, a wealthy imperial Roman Jew who converted to Christianity in the time of
Constantine . Count Joseph claimed that as a young man he built churches in
Sepphoris
and other towns that were inhabited only by Jews. [48]
Nazareth is mentioned, though the exact meaning is not clear. [49]
In any case, Joan Taylor writes: “It is now possible to conclude that there existed in Nazareth, from the first part of the fourth century, a small and unconventional church which encompassed a cave complex.” [50]
The town was Jewish until the seventh century AD. [51]
Although mentioned in the New Testament gospels, there are no extant non-biblical references to Nazareth until around 200 AD, when
Sextus Julius Africanus , cited by
Eusebius
( Church History
1.7.14), speaks of “Nazara” as a village in “Judea” and locates it near an as-yet unidentified “Cochaba.” [52]
In the same passage Africanus writes of
desposunoi
– relatives of Jesus – who he claims
kept the records of their descent with great care . A few authors have argued that the absence of first and second century textual references to Nazareth suggest the town may not have been inhabited in Jesus’ day. [53]
Proponents of this hypothesis have sought to buttress their case with linguistic, literary and archaeological interpretations, [54]
though mainstream historians and archaeologists dismiss such views as “archaeologically unsupportable”. [55]
Middle Roman to Byzantine periods
Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation
In 1960, a
Hebrew
inscription found in
Caesarea , dating to the late 3rd or early 4th century, mentions Nazareth as one of the places in which the priestly ( kohanim ) family of
Hapizzez
was residing after
Bar Kokhba’s revolt
(132-135 AD). [56]
From the three fragments that have been found, it is possible to show that the inscription was a complete list of the twenty-four priestly courses (cf.
1 Chronicles
24:7-19;
Nehemiah
11;12), with each course (or family) assigned its proper order and the name of each town or village in
Galilee
where it settled. An interesting aspect of this inscription is that the name for Nazareth is not spelled with the “z” sound (as one would expect from the Greek gospels) but with the Hebrew
tsade
(thus “Nasareth” or “Natsareth”). [57]
Eleazar Kalir
(a Hebrew Galilean poet variously dated from the sixth to tenth century A.D.) also mentions a locality clearly in the Nazareth region bearing the name Nazareth נצרת (in this case vocalized “Nitzrat”), which was home to the descendants of the 18th
Kohen
clan or ‘ priestly course ‘, Happitzetz הפצץ, for at least several centuries following the
Bar Kochva
revolt.
In the 6th century, religious narrations from local Christians about the
Virgin Mary
began to spark interest in the site among pilgrims, who founded the
Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation
at the site of a freshwater spring, today known as
Mary’s Well . In 570, the
Anonymous of Piacenza
reports travelling from
Sepphoris
to Nazareth; writing of the beauty of the Hebrew women there who say that St. Mary was a relative of theirs, he notes that, “The house of St. Mary is a basilica.” [58]
The Christian writer
Jerome , writing in the 5th century, says Nazareth was a
viculus
or mere village. The Jewish town profited from the Christian pilgrim trade which began in the fourth century, but latent anti-Christian hostility broke out in 614 AD when the
Persians
invaded Palestine. At that time, according to C. Kopp writing in 1938, the Jewish residents of Nazareth helped the Persians slaughter the Christians in the land. [59]
When the
Byzantine or Eastern Roman
emperor Heraclius ejected the Persians from Palestine in 630 AD, he singled out Nazareth for special punishment and imposed forced exile upon the Jewish families. At this time the town ceased to be Jewish.
Islamic rule

Félix Bonfils
The Muslim conquest of Palestine in 637 AD introduced Islam to the region. Over the next four centuries Islam was adopted by a significant portion of the population, though a significant Arab Christian minority remained. With outbreak of the
First Crusade , an extended period of conflict began in which control shifted several times between the local Saracens and Europeans. Control over Galilee and Nazareth shifted frequently during this time, with corresponding impact on the religious makeup of the population.
In 1099 AD, the Crusader
Tancred
captured Galilee and established his capital in Nazareth. The ancient diocese of
Scythopolis
was also relocated under the
Archbishop of Nazareth , one of the four archdioceses in the
Kingdom of Jerusalem . The town returned to Muslim control in 1187 AD following the victory of
Saladin
in the
Battle of Hattin . The remaining Crusaders and European clergy were forced to leave town. [60]
Frederick II
managed to negotiate safe passage for pilgrims from Acre in 1229, and in 1251,
Louis IX , the king of France, attended mass in the grotto, accompanied by his wife. [60]
In 1263,
Baybars , the
Mamluk Sultan , destroyed the Christian buildings in Nazareth and declared the site off-limits to Latin clergy, as part of his bid to drive out the remaining Crusaders from Palestine. [60]
While Arab Christian families continued to live in Nazareth, its status was reduced to that of a poor village. Pilgrims who visited the site in 1294 reported only a small church protecting the grotto. [60]
In the 14th century, monks from the Franciscan Order were permitted to return and resided within the ruins of the Basilica, but they were eventually evicted again in 1584. [60]
In 1620,
Fakhr-al-Din II , a
Druze
emir
who controlled this part of
Ottoman Syria
rule, permitted them to return to build a small church at the Grotto of the Annunciation. Pilgrimage tours to surrounding sacred sites were also organized by the Franciscans from this point forward, but the monks suffered harassment from surrounding
Bedouin
tribes who often kipnapped them for ransom. [60]
Stability returned with the rule of
Daher el-Omar , a powerful local
sheikh
who ruled over much of the Galilee and who authorized the Franciscans to build a church in 1730. That structure stood until 1955, when it was demolished to make way for the building a larger structure which was completed in 1967. [60]
Nazareth was captured by the troops of
Napoleon Bonaparte
in 1799, during his
Syrian campaign . Napoleon visited the holy sites and considered appointing his general Junot as the duke of Nazareth. [60]
During the rule of
Ibrahim Pasha
(1830–1840), the Egyptian general, over much of
Ottoman Syria , Nazareth was open to European missionaries and traders. After the Ottomans regained control, European money continued to flow into Nazareth and a number of institutions were established. The Christians of Naareth were protected during the pogroms of 1860s by the dominant rule of Aghil Agha, the Bedouin leader who exercised control over the political and security situation in the Galilee between 1845 and 1870. [60]
Kaloost Varstan, an
Armenian
from
Istanbul , arrived in 1864 and established the first medical missionary in Nazareth, the Scottish “hospital on the hill”, with sponsorship from the
Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society . The Ottoman Sultan, who favored the French, allowed them to establish an orphanage, the Society of Saint Francis de Sale. By the late 19th century, Nazareth was a town with a strong Arab Christian presence and a growing European community, where a number of communal projects were undertaken and new religious buildings were erected. [60]
Modern era
District court of Nazareth
Nazareth was in the territory allotted to the Arab state under the
1947 UN Partition Plan . The town was not a field of battle during
1948 Arab-Israeli War
before the first truce on 11 June, although some of the villagers had joined the loosely organized peasant military and paramilitary forces, and troops from the
Arab Liberation Army
had entered Nazareth. During the ten days of fighting which occurred between the first and second truce, Nazareth capitulated to Israeli troops during
Operation Dekel
on 16 June, after little more than token resistance. The surrender was formalized in a written agreement, where the town leaders agreed to cease hostilities in return for promises from the Israeli officers, including brigade commander
Ben Dunkelman
(the leader of the operation), that no harm would come to the civilians of the town.
Preparations for the
Pope ‘s visit to Nazareth in 2000 triggered highly publicized tensions related to the
Basilica of the Annunciation . The 1997 permission for construction of a paved plaza to handle the expected thousands of Christian pilgrims caused Muslim protests and occupation of the proposed site, which is considered the grave of a nephew of Saladin. This site used to be the home of a school built during the Ottoman rule. The school was named al-Harbyeh (in Arabic means military), and many elderly people in Nazareth still remember it as the school site, nevertheless, the same site still contains,the Shihab-Eddin shrine, along with several shops owned by the
waqf
(Muslim community ownership). The school building continued to serve as a government school until it was demolished to allow for the plaza to be built.
The initial argument between the different political factions in town (represented in the local council), was on where the borders of the shrine and shops starts and where it ends. The initial government approval of subsequent plans for a large mosque to be constructed at the site led to protests from Christian leaders worldwide, which continued after the papal visit. Finally, in 2002, a special government commission permanently halted construction of the mosque. [61] [62]

In March 2006, public protests that followed the disruption of a Lenten prayer service by an Israeli Jew and his Christian wife and daughter, who detonated incendiary devices inside the church, [63]
succeeded in dismantling a temporary wall that had been erected around the public square that had been constructed but had yet to be unveiled, putting an end to the entire controversy.
On 19 July 2006 a rocket fired by
Hezbollah
as part of the
2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict
killed two children in Nazareth. No holy sites were damaged. [64]
In 2007, a group of Christian businessmen declared plans to build the largest cross in the world (60 m (196.85  ft ) high) in Nazareth as the childhood town of Jesus. [65]
Demographics
According to the
Israel Central Bureau of Statistics , Nazareth had a population of approximately 65,000 in 2005. The vast majority of its residents are
Arab citizens of Israel , 31.3% of whom are
Christians
and 68.7% of whom are
Muslims . [66]
Nazareth forms a
metropolitan area
with the Arab
local councils
of
Yafa an-Naseriyye
to the south,
Reineh ,
Mashhad
and
Kafr Kanna
to the north,
Iksal
and the adjacent Jewish cities of
Nazareth Illit
to the east which has a population of 41,000
Jews
and
Migdal HaEmek
to the west with a population of 25,000
Jews . Together, the Nazareth metropolis area has a population of approximately 210,000 of which over 125,000 (59%) are Israeli Arabs, and 85,000 are Israeli Jews (41%), making it the only urban area with over 50,000 residents in Israel where the majority of the population is
Arabic . [67]
While the two communities of Muslims and Christians tend to get along, they also have come into sporadic conflict. Muslim activists outraged Christians when they built an unauthorized mosque next to the Basilica of the Annunciation, where Christians believe the Angel Gabriel foretold the birth of Jesus to Mary. Israel later tore down the mosque in 2003. Muslim activists also have periodically marched through the city in shows of strength meant to intimidate Christians. [68] [69]
Religious shrines
Nazareth is home to at least 23 monasteries and churches. [70]
Many of the older churches are located in the Old City.
The
Church of the Annunciation
is the largest Christian church building in the Middle East. In
Roman Catholic
tradition, it marks the site where the Archangel
Gabriel
announced the future birth of
Jesus
to the
Virgin Mary
(Luke 1:26-31).
The
Eastern Orthodox Church
constructed
St. Gabriel’s Church
at an alternative site for the Annunciation.
The
Melkite Greek Catholic Church
owns the Synagogue Church, which is located at the traditional site of the synagogue where Jesus preached (Luke 4)
The Church of St. Joseph’s Carpentry occupies the traditional location for the workshop of
Saint Joseph
The
Mensa Christi Church , run by the
Franciscan
religious order, commemorates the traditional location where Jesus dined with the Apostles after his Resurrection
The Basilica of Jesus the Adolescent, run by the
Salesian
religious order, occupies a hill overlooking the city.
The
Church of Christ
is an Anglican church in Nazareth.
There are also a number of
mosques
in Nazareth, the oldest of which is the
White Mosque , located in
Harat Alghama
(“Mosque Quarter”) in the center of Nazareth’s Old Market. [71] [72]

The
White Mosque
( Arabic : المسجد الأبيض‎) is the oldest
mosque
in
Nazareth ,
Israel [1]
and is located in
Harat Alghama
or the “Mosque Quarter” in the center of Nazareth’s Old Market. [2]
Its exquisite pencil-shaped
minaret , [2]
cream-coloured walls, green trim and green dome are just one example of the
Ottoman
architecture common throughout the city.
History and ownership
The construction of the mosque was funded by the
Egyptian
ruler
Suleiman Pasha
in the latter half of the eighteenth century, and overseen by the high commissioner of Nazareth, Sheikh Abdullah al-Fahoum. [1]
The mosque was completed between 1804 and 1808 and Sheikh Abdullah was granted trusteeship over it in the form of a
waqf
and administered it until the time of his death in 1815. [1]
The tomb of Sheikh Abdullah is in the mosque’s courtyard. [2]
After Sheikh Abdullah’s death, the managing of the mosque’s affairs were transferred to Sheikh Amin al-Fahoum. [2]
Presently, the mosque continues to form part of the al-Fahoum family waqf, which also includes the
khan
of the pasha on Casa Nova street. [1]
It is administered by one of Sheikh Abdullah’s descendants, ‘Atif al-Fahoum. [1]
The mosque was named by Sheikh Abdullah to mark the end of the reign of the former Ottoman governor,
Jezzar Pasha , predecessor to Suleiman Pasha. Sheikh Abdullah chose “white” to symbolize a new era of purity, light and peace to be enjoyed between the faiths in Nazareth. [2]
Community use
On a regular day, between 100 to 200 persons attend the noon and afternoon prayer services, while the Friday sermon is attended by 2,000 to 3,000 people. [1]
The mosque serves Nazareth’s
Muslim
community by offering religious classes for young men and sponsoring the Muslim scout troop in which 400 boys and girls ages 9 and older participate. [1]
The mosque also houses a museum with exhibits that document Nazareth’s history. [3]

Jericho
( Arabic : أريحا‎
Ārīḥā
[ʔæˈriːħɑː]   (
listen ));
Hebrew : יְרִיחוֹ‎
Yəriḥo
[jeʁiˈħo]   (
listen ) is a city located near the
Jordan River
in the
West Bank
of the
Palestinian Territories . It is the capital of the
Jericho Governorate , and has a population of over 20,000
Palestinians . [2]
Situated well below sea level on an east-west route 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the
Dead Sea , Jericho is the lowest permanently inhabited site on earth. It is also believed to be one of the
oldest continuously inhabited cities of the world . [3] [4] [5]
Described in the
Hebrew Bible
as the “City of Palm Trees”, copious springs in and around Jericho have made it an attractive site for human habitation for thousands of years. [6]
It is known in
Judeo-Christian
tradition as the place of the
Israelites ‘ return from bondage in
Egypt , led by
Joshua , the successor to
Moses .
Archaeologists
have unearthed the remains of over 20 successive settlements in Jericho, the first of which dates back to 11,000 years ago (9000 BC). [7]
Etymology
Jericho’s Arabic name,
Ārīḥā , means “fragrant” and derives from the
Canaanite
and Hebrew word
Reah , of the same meaning. [8] [9] [10] [11]
Jericho’s name in
Hebrew ,
Yəriḥo , is also thought to derive from that root, though an alternate theory holds that it is it derived from the word meaning “moon” ( Yareah ) in Canaanite and Hebrew, as the city was an early center of worship for
lunar
deities . [12]
History
Ancient times
French medieval image of the Biblical Battle of Jericho.
Jericho is one of the
oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world , with evidence of settlement dating back to 9000 BC, providing important information about early human habitation in the
Near East . [3]
The first permanent settlement was built near the
Ein as-Sultan
spring between 8000 and 7000 BC by an unknown people, and consisted of a number of walls, a religious shrine, and a 23-foot (7.0 m) tower with an internal staircase. [9]
After a few centuries, it was abandoned for a second settlement, established in 6800 BC, perhaps by an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten skulls, plastered and painted so as to reconstitute the individuals’ features. [9]
These represent the first example of
portraiture
in
art history , and it is thought that these were kept in people’s homes while the bodies were buried. [5] [13]
This was followed by a succession of settlements from 4500 BC onward, the largest of these being constructed in 2600 BC. [9]
Archaeological evidence indicates that in the latter half of the Middle
Bronze Age
(circa 1700 BC), the city enjoyed some prosperity, its walls having been strengthened and expanded. [14]
The Canaanite city (Jericho City IV) was destroyed c.1573 BC according to the carbon dating between 1617 and 1530, but rounded as c.1550 according to the stratigraphical dating. [15]
The site remained uninhabited until the city was refounded in the 9th century BC. [ citation needed ]
In the 8th century BC, the
Assyrians
invaded from the north, followed by the
Babylonians , and Jericho was depopulated between 586 and 538 BC, the period of the
Jewish exile
to Babylon.
Cyrus the Great , the
Persian
king, refounded the city one mile southeast of its historic site at the mound of Tell es-Sultan, and returned the Jewish exiles after conquering
Babylon
in 539 BC. [9]
Classical antiquity
Remains from Herod’s palace
Jericho went from being an administrative center under Persian rule, to serving as the private estate of
Alexander the Great
between 336 and 323 BC after his conquest of the region. In the middle of the 2nd century BC, Jericho was under
Hellenistic
rule, and the
Syrian
General
Bacchides
built a number of forts to strengthen the defenses of the area around Jericho against invasion by the
Macabees
(1 Macc 9:50). One of these forts, built at the entrance to
Wadi Qelt , was later refortified by
Herod the Great , who named it
Kypros
after his mother. [16]
Herod originally leased Jericho from
Cleopatra
after
Mark Antony
gave it to her as a gift. After their joint suicide in 30 BC,
Octavian
assumed control of the Roman empire and granted Herod free rein over Jericho. Herod’s rule oversaw the construction of a
hippodrome -theater ( Tel es-Samrat ) to entertain his guests and new
aqueducts
to irrigate the area below the cliffs and reach his winter palace built at the site of
Tulul al-Alaiq . [16]
The dramatic murder of
Aristobulus III
in a swimming pool at Jericho, as told by the Roman Jewish historian
Josephus , took place during a banquet organized by Herod’s Hasmonean mother-in-law. The city, since the construction of its palaces, functioned not only as an agricultural center and as a crossroad, but as a winter resort for
Jerusalem ‘s aristocracy. [17]
Herod was succeeded by his son, Archelus, who built an adjacent village in his name,
Archelais , to house workers for his date plantation ( Khirbet al-Beiyudat ). First century Jericho is described in
Strabo ‘s
Geography
as follows:
“Jericho is a plain surrounded by a kind of mountainous country, which in a way, slopes toward it like a theatre. Here is the Phoenicon, which is mixed also with all kinds of cultivated and fruitful trees, though it consists mostly of palm trees. It is 100
stadia
in length and is everywhere watered with streams. Here also are the Palace and the Balsam Park.” [16]
The rock cut tombs of a Herodian and Hasmonean era cemetery lie in the lowest part of the cliffs between Nuseib al-Aweishireh and Jebel Quruntul in Jericho and were used between 100 BCE and 68 CE. [16]
The Christian
Gospels
state that
Jesus
passed through Jericho where he healed one [18] [19]
or two [20]
blind beggars and inspired a local chief tax collector named
Zacchaeus
to
repent
of his dishonest practices. The road between Jerusalem and Jericho is the setting for the
Parable of the Good Samaritan [21]
After the fall of Jerusalem to Vespasian armies in 70 CE, Jericho declined rapidly, and by 100 CE it was but a small Roman garrison town. [22]
A fort was built there in 130 that played a role in putting down the
Bar Kochba revolt
in 133. Accounts of Jericho by a Christian
pilgrim
are given in 333. Shortly thereafter, the built-up area of the town was abandoned, and a Byzantine Jericho,
Ericha
was built a mile (1  1 ⁄ 2  km) to the east, around which the modern town is centered. [22]
Christianity
took hold in the city during the
Byzantine
era and the area was heavily populated. A number of monasteries and churches were built, including St. George of Koziba in 340 CE and a domed church dedicated to
Saint Eliseus . [17]
At least two
synagogues
were also built in the 6th century CE. [16]
The monasteries were abandoned after the Persian invasion of 614. [9]
Arab caliphate period
An
Arabic
Umayyad
mosaic
from
Khirbat al-Mafjar
in Jericho
By 661, Jericho was under the rule of the
Umayyad
dynasty. The tenth
caliph
of that dynasty,
Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik , built a palatial complex known as
Khirbet al-Mafjar
about one mile north of Tell as-Sultan in 743, and two mosques, a courtyard, mosaics, and other items from it can still be seen
in situ
today, despite its having been partially destroyed in an earthquake in 747.
Umayyad rule ended in 750 and was followed by the
Arab
caliphates of the
Abbasid
and
Fatimid
dynasties. Irrigated agriculture was developed under Islamic rule, reaffirming Jericho’s reputation as a fertile “City of the Palms”. [23]
Al-Maqdisi , the Arab geographer, wrote in 985 that, “the water of Jericho is held to be the highest and best in all
Islam .
Bananas
are plentiful, also
dates
and flowers of fragrant odor.” [24]
Jericho is also referred to by him as one of the principal cities of
Jund Filastin . [25]
The city flourished until 1071 and the invasion of the
Seljuk Turks , followed by the upheavals of the
Crusades . In 1179, the Crusaders rebuilt the Monastery of St. George of Koziba, at its original site six miles from the center of town. They also built another two churches and a monastery dedicated to
John the Baptist , and are credited with introducing
sugarcane
production to the city. [26]
In 1187, the Crusaders were evicted by the
Ayyubid
forces of
Saladin
after their victory in the
Battle of Hattin , and the town slowly went into decline. [9]
In 1226, Arab geographer
Yaqut al-Hamawi
said of Jericho, “it has many palm trees, also sugarcane in quantities, and bananas. The best of all the sugar in the
Ghaur
land is made here.” In the 14th century,
Abu al-Fida
writes there are
sulfur
mines in Jericho, “the only ones in Palestine.” [27]
Ottoman period (1517–1918)
Postcard image depicting Jericho in the late 19th or early 20th century
In the early years of Ottoman rule, Jericho formed part of the
waqf
and
imerat
of Jerusalem. The villagers processed
indigo
as one source of revenue, using a cauldron specifically for this purpose that was loaned to them by the Ottoman authorities in Jerusalem. [28]
For most of the Ottoman period, Jericho was a small village of farmers susceptible to attacks by
Bedouins . In the 19th century, European scholars, archaeologists and missionaries visited often. The first
excavation
at Tell as-Sultan was carried out in 1867, and the monasteries of St. George of Koziba and John the Baptist were refounded and completed in 1901 and 1904, respectively. [9]
20th century
The municipal headquarters of Jericho, 1967
After the collapse of the Ottoman empire at the end of
World War I , Jericho, like other places in Ottoman Palestine, fell under the rule of the
British Mandate . The British built fortresses in Jericho during
World War II
with the help of the Jewish company Solel Boneh, and bridges were rigged with explosives in preparation for a possible invasion by German allied forces. [29]
Jericho was captured by the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
during the
1948 Arab-Israeli war .
The Jericho Conference , organized by King Abdullah and attended by over 2,000 Palestinian delegates in 1948 proclaimed “His Majesty Abdullah as King of all Palestine” and called for “the unification of
Palestine
and
Transjordan
as a step toward full
Arab
unity.” In mid-1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank and Jericho residents, like other residents of West Bank localities became Jordanian citizens. [30]
Jericho was captured from
Jordan
by
Israel
during the
Six-Day War
of 1967 along with the rest of the West Bank. It was one of the first cities handed over to
Palestinian Authority
control in 1994, in accordance with the
Oslo accords , which saw construction of the Oasis
casino . The other city handed over to the Palestinians was
Gaza .
21st century
Jericho was retaken by Israel during the
Al-Aqsa Intifada
of 2001.

On 14 March 2006 the
Israel Defense Forces
launched
Operation Bringing Home the Goods , in which it took captive six inmates from a Jericho prison following a 10-hour siege. Israel’s reason for the siege was to capture PFLP general secretary,
Ahmad Sa’adat
and five other inmates for the alleged assassination of Israeli tourist minister
Rehavam Zeevi
because of announcements of their upcoming release. Both sides of the siege were armed and at least two people were killed and 35 wounded in the incident. Before the siege British and American monitors were guarding the prison but withdrew, citing lax security arrangements. The siege caused an uproar amongst the
PFLP
members and supporters as well as other
PLO
factions, and as a result Palestinian militants raided and kidnapped British and European citizens in the
West Bank
and
Gaza Strip . The event is considered controversial and somewhat hampered Palestinian relations with the UK and US. [31]
After Hamas assaulted a neighborhood in Gaza mostly populated by the Fatah-aligned
Hilles clan
in response to their attack on Hamas which killed six of its members, the Hilles clan was relocated to Jericho on 4 August 2008. [32]

The nearby spring of
Ein es-Sultan
produces 1,000 gallons of water per minute (3.8 m 3 /min), irrigating some 2,500 acres (10 km 2 ) through multiple channels and feeding into the
Jordan River , 6 miles (10 km) away. [9] [33]
Annual rainfall is 6.4 inches (160 mm), mostly concentrated between November and February. The average temperature is 59 °F (15 °C) in January and 88 °F (31 °C) in August. The constant sunshine, rich alluvial soil, and abundant water from the spring have always made Jericho an attractive place for settlement. [33]
Archaeology

Syro-Palestinian archaeology
The first excavations of the site were made by
Charles Warren
in 1868.
Ernst Sellin
and
Carl Watzinger
excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-‘Alayiq between 1907–1909 and in 1911, and
John Garstang
excavated between 1930 and 1936. Extensive investigations using more modern techniques were made by
Kathleen Kenyon
between 1952 and 1958.
Lorenzo Nigro
and
Nicolo Marchetti
conducted a limited excavation in 1997.
Tell es-Sultan
Dwelling foundations unearthed at Tell es-Sultan in Jericho
The earliest settlement was located at the present-day Tell es-Sultan (or Sultan’s Hill), a couple of kilometers from the current city. In
Arabic
and in Hebrew,
tell
means “mound” — consecutive layers of habitation built up a mound over time, as is common for ancient settlements in the Middle East and
Anatolia . Jericho is the
type site
for the
Pre-Pottery Neolithic A
(PPN A) and B periods.
Stone Age
Epipaleolithic —construction at the site appears to predate the invention of
agriculture , with the construction of
Natufian culture
structures beginning earlier than 9000 BC, the very beginning of the
Holocene
epoch in geologic history. [5]
Pre-Pottery Neolithic A
(8350–7370 BC); sometimes it is called
Sultanian . The site is a 40,000 square metre settlement surrounded by a
stone wall , with a stone tower in the centre of one wall. This is so far the oldest wall ever to be discovered, thus suggesting some kind of social organization. The town contained round mud-brick houses, yet no street planning. [34]
The identity and number of the inhabitants (some sources say 2000–3000 dwellers) [7]
of Jericho during the PPN A period is still under debate, though it is known that they had domesticated
emmer wheat ,
barley
and
pulses
and hunted wild animals.
Pre-Pottery Neolithic B , 7220 BC to 5850 BC (but
carbon-14 -dates are few and early). Expanded range of domesticated plants. Possible domestication of
sheep . Apparent
cult
involving the preservation of human skulls, with facial features reconstructed from
plaster
and eyes set with shells in some cases.
After the PPN A settlement-phase there was a settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPN B settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the
tell . The architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bounding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room (6.5 × 4 m (21.33  ft  × 13.12 ft) and 7 × 3 m (22.97  ft  × 9.84 ft)) with internal divisions, the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish
terrazzo -floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.
Kathleen Kenyon
interpreted one building as a
shrine . It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fit into this niche.
The dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A
skull
cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster;
cowries
were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in
Tell Ramad
and
Beisamoun
as well.
Other finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades,
burins , scrapers, a few
tranchet axes ,
obsidian , and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also
querns , hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size,
anthropomorphic
and
theriomorphic
clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.
In the late 4th millennium BC, Jericho was occupied during Neolithic 2 and the general character of the remains on the site link it culturally with Neolithic 2 sites in the West Syrian and Middle Euphrates groups. This link is established by the presence of rectilinear mud-brick buildings and plaster floors that are characteristic of the age.
Bronze Age
During the Middle Bronze Age Jericho was a small prominent city of the
Canaan
region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550 BC. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the
Maryannu , a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the
Mitannite
state to the north. Kathleen Kenyon reported “…the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna’an. … The defenses … belong to a fairly advanced date in that period” and there was “a massive stone revetment… part of a complex system” of defenses (pp. 213–218). [35]
Bronze-age Jericho fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617–1530 BC. Notably this carbon dating c. 1573 BC confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating c. 1550 by Kenyon.
Synagogues
For more details on this topic, see
Shalom Al Israel synagogue .
The
Jericho Synagogue
in the Royal Maccabean winter palace at Jericho dates from 70-50 BC.
A synagogue dating to the late 6th or early 7th century CE was discovered in Jericho in 1936, and was named
Shalom Al Israel , or “peace unto Israel”, after the central Hebrew motto in its mosaic floor. It was controlled by Israel after the 1967
Six Day War , but after the handover to
Palestinian Authority
control per the
Oslo Accords , especially during the
Al-Aqsa Intifada
it has been a source of conflict. On the night of October 12, 2000, the synagogue was vandalized by Palestinians who burned holy books and relics and damaged the mosaic. [36]
The
Na’aran
synagogue, another Byzantine era construction, was discovered on the northern outskirts of Jericho in 1918. While less is known of it than Shalom Al Israel, it has a larger mosaic and is in similar condition. [37]
Demographics
Demographics have varied widely depending on the dominant ethnic group and rule in the region over the past three thousand years. In a 1945 land and population survey by
Sami Hadawi , 3,010 inhabitants is the figure given for Jericho, of which 94% (2840) were Arab and 6% (170) were Jews. [38]
In the first census carried out by the
Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics
(PCBS), in 1997, Jericho’s population was 14,674.
Palestinian refugees
constituted a significant 43.6% of the residents or 6,393 people. [39]
The gender make-up of the city was 51% male and 49% female. Jericho has a young population, with nearly half (49.2%) of the inhabitants being under the age of 20. People between the ages of 20 and 44 made up 36.2% of the population, 10.7% between the ages of 45 and 64, and 3.6% were over the age of 64. [40]
Based on PCBS projections, Jericho presently has an Arab
Palestinian
population of over 20,000. [2]
The current mayor is Hassan Saleh, a former lawyer.

The Madaba Map & The Exodus Route
(mosaic floor)
542 AD
St. George’s Orthodox church
Madaba, Jordan
PRESENTATION
The Madaba Mosaic Map is a unique piece of art realised in 6th cent. A.D. as a decoration for the pavement of a church in the town of Madaba (Jordan) in the Byzantine Near East. At that time Madaba was part of the so called
Provincia Arabia , and was inhabited by Aramaic speaking Christians descendant from the ancient biblical people of the Moabites. The mosaic was discovered accidentally about one hundred years ago (in 1897) while constructing a new church for the Greek-Orthodox Arab community, which was then settling on the very ruins of the ancient town of Madaba.
The mosaic represents the biblical land from Egypt to Lebanon, including Sinai, Israel, Palestine, and Transjordan. Unfortunately the northern sector is almost completely lost, and the rest suffered a lot of damage too. The original panel would have measured about 94 square meter but only 25 are still preserved. What remains is still of the greatest importance for art, history and biblical topography. The city of Jerusalem is depicted with the uppermost care but a total of 156 places or biblical memoirs are present in the preserved portion of the map.
The mosaicist conceived and carried out his masterwork with great topographical skill and biblical knowledge. The Madaba Mosaic map is deemed by some scholars to be the best topographic representation ever done before modern cartography. As a source of biblical topography the map is fully comparable with the well-known treatise on the biblical places written in Greek about 395 A.D. by the historian Eusebius of Caesarea and translated into Latin by Jerome about 490 A.D.
Our aim is to present the richness of this little known masterpiece of art , religion and science to all people interested in the biblical places or just in the best achievements of humanity.

The Real Geography Of Madaba
Madaba in the Bible:
“”But we have cast them down, Heshbon is ruined as far as Dibon, Then we have laid waste even to Nophah, Which
reaches
to Medeba.”” Numbers 21:30
“from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba, as far as Dibon;” Joshua 13:9
“Their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by Medeba;” Joshua 13:16
“So they hired for themselves 32,000 chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and camped before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered together from their cities and came to battle.” 1 Chronicles 19:7
“They have gone up to the temple and
to
Dibon,
even
to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba; Everyone’s head is bald
and
every beard is cut off.” Isaiah 15:2
The Mosaic Map of Madaba, Jordan
It was the Christian vision of continuity and completeness that inspired the mosaic artists and craftsmen of the area to make the Mosaic Map of Madaba, which was considered a guideline for establishing geographic regions and borders.
This famous mosaic was designed in around 570 AD to decorate the floor of a Byzantine church in
Madaba . Actually, it is more than a geographic text of that era, showing the entire region from Jordan and Palestine in the north, to Egypt in the south, and depicting in picture form: plains, hills, valleys, villages, and many towns and cities, complete with walls and pitched re-roofed houses, while in the Nile huge fish swim.
It includes a fascinating plan of the holy city of
Jerusalem
placed at the center of the redeemed acumen: on the left is the north gate from which two colonnaded streets run south. On the straight street through the heart of the city stands the domed
Holy Sepulcher . Clearly inscribed above the north and east gates is the legend “Holy City of Jerusalem”.
Today this splendid map is housed in the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, which was built in 1896 over the remains of the original Byzantine Church. Only part of the map has been preserved. It originally measured a staggering 25 x 5 meters and was made of more than 2 million pieces of colored stone tesserae.
Madaba, Jordan
The trip south from Amman along the 5000-year-old
King’s Highway
is one of the most memorable journeys in the Holy Land, passing through a string of ancient sites. The first city you come upon is Madaba, “The City of Mosaics”.
In many respects Madaba is a typical East Bank town which differs in one major aspect: underneath almost every house lies a fine Byzantine mosaic. Many of these mosaics have been excavated and are on display in the town’s museum, but it is estimated that many more lie hidden waiting to be discovered.
Madaba’s chief attraction – in the contemporary Greek Orthodox church of St. George – is a wonderfully vivid, 6th-century Byzantine
mosaic map
showing the entire region from Jordan and Palestine in the north, to Egypt in the south.
This map includes a fascinating plan of
Jerusalem : on the left is the north gate from which two colonnaded streets run south. On the straight street through the heart of the city stands the domed
Holy Sepulcher . Clearly inscribed above the north and east gates is the legend “Holy City of Jerusalem”.
Other mosaic masterpieces found in the church of the Virgin and the Apostles and the Archaeological Museum, depict a rampant profusion of flowers and plants, birds and fish, animals and exotic beasts, as well as scenes from mythology and everyday pursuits of hunting, fishing and farming. Literally, hundreds of other mosaics from the 5th through the 7th centuries are scattered throughout Madaba’s churches and homes.
Madaba has a long history, dating back further than 1300 BC. It was first mentioned in the Bible as Medeba at the time of the Exodus (Numbers: 21,30; Joshua 13:9), it was then an Amorite town close to the Moab border, and it changed hands frequently. It was named in the famous Mesha Stele, or Moabite Stone (exhibited in
Jordan Archaeological Museum ), which recorded the achievements of Mesha, King of Moab in the mid-9th century BC – one of which was to regain Madaba from the Israelites.
The Nabataeans governed the city during the 1st century AD. And in the Hellenistic period, under the Romans, it was a flourishing provincial town with temples and colonnaded streets and surrounded by a strong wall. Under the Byzantines, Madaba became the seat of a bishopric, and in 451 AD, its bishop attended the Council of Chalcedon. During this period, and particularly in the 6th century, mosaics were lavished on churches and public and private buildings.
Madaba was sacked by the Persians in 614, and its ruin was completed by the earthquake of 747. It stood abandoned for over 1000 years until, around 1880, a group of about 2000 Christians from
Kerak
settled here. It was they, in the process of rebuilding, who found the mosaics buried under the rubble.
Madaba museum has many mosaics that were originally on the site. Also, mosaics from other locations have been housed in the museum to ensure their preservation. A collection of Byzantine churches as well as ancient Roman remnants and mosaics, make up this spectacular museum which is located near the Mosaics School.
The Mosaic Map of Madaba
A. Madaba in the Bible:
“”But we have cast them down, Heshbon is ruined as far as Dibon, Then we have laid waste even to Nophah, Which
reaches
to Medeba.”” Numbers 21:30
“from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba, as far as Dibon;” Joshua 13:9
“Their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by Medeba;” Joshua 13:16
“So they hired for themselves 32,000 chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and camped before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered together from their cities and came to battle.” 1 Chronicles 19:7
“They have gone up to the temple and
to
Dibon,
even
to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba; Everyone’s head is bald
and

The exodus route: Border of Egypt
The Wadi el-Arish is the same as the River of Egypt in Gen 15:18
All Bible maps have wrongly located Kadesh Barnea at
Ein el-Qudeirat
since 1916 AD. Yet Qudeirat, if they thought it was important, would have been located on a section of the map that is fully intact. Qudeirat should be located close to the large red text, “lot of Simeon”. (see above)
The sea port for where the Wadi el-Arish empties into the Mediterranean sea is called el-Arish. The port of Arish is also called Tharu and Rhinocolura. These three names refer to the same place. Rhinocolura gets its name from the fact it was a prison city for criminals of Egypt whom the Pharaoh would literally cut off their noses “Rhino-colura” and force them to live in this sea port on the far edge of Egyptian territory. Arish has been the western border of Egypt since 2000 BC.
Between the towns of Bitylium and Rhinocolura are the following red words in the Madaba Map: Border of Egypt and Palestine “Horoi Aigyptou kai Paleaistines”.
One of the most important things the Madaba map shows is that the border of Egypt was at the Wadi al-Arish. This is the historic border between Egypt and Israel from 1440 BC, the time of the exodus , to 70 AD, when Israel was destroyed. In modern times the border has been moved 44 km north east to Raphia at the eastern edge of the Gaza Strip. You can see from the Madaba map that the border is between Bitylium and Rhinoculura (Arish).
Raphia at the eastern edge of the Gaza Strip. You can see from the Madaba map that the border is between Bitylium and Rhinoculura (Arish).
The Bible clearly shows that the border between Egypt and Israel was just north of the
Wadi al-Arish : Genesis 15:18; Joshua 15:4,47. The Wadi al-Arish is the southern/eastern border of the promised land.
This proves that the modern Sinai Peninsula was under the control of Egypt and considered Egyptian territory, just as it is today. Since we can prove the Sinai Peninsula was “Egyptian” this proves that Mt. Sinai cannot be where Queen Helena chose it to be in a dream in 325 AD, at Mt. Musa, beside the St. Catherine’s monastery. Mt. Sinai was not in Egypt. The Bible says that Mt. Sinai was located in Arabia, not Egypt. (Gal 4:25)
The Onomasticon tells us that Bitylium was 20 km south of Raphia. “Bēthphou (Bathaffu). (In) tribe of Juda. A village fourteen miles beyond Raphia on the road to Egypt. It is the border of Palestine.”
The Onomasticon and the Exodus route . by Eusebius (325AD)
C. The exodus route: Red Sea, Mt. Sinai, Kadesh/Petra
Missing entirely from the Madaba Map is the Red Sea, Mt. Sinai and Petra/Kadesh Barnea. It would certainly be on the map, but was vandalized by the Muslims in 700 AD. Since we know these locations would be on the map, they must have been the primary targets of defacement. Most notably, however, is that the modern choice for the location of Kadesh Barnea at
Ein el-Qudeirat , should be in a section of the map that is fully intact. Qudeirat should be located close to the large red text, “lot of Simeon”.
Petra is not on the Madaba map and it most certainly would have been. Petra is where Eusebius located Kadesh Barnea, the Mt. Hor, the rock Moses struck, the place Miriam died. It would have been located in a section that is missing. We would expect it to be directly above Praesidium, Thamara, Moa and above and to the left of “The desert where the Serpent of brass saved the Israelites
There is one reference in the Bible to the “Wilderness of Kadesh” and this is also marked on the Madaba Map as the “Desert of”, just south of the dead sea: “The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness; The Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.” Psalm 29:8
Kadesh Barnea, if located at
Qudeirat , as most today wrongly believe, should be located on the map in a section that is not damaged. It is not located there. No where on the Madaba map is Kadesh Barnea located. However, if it was, there is absolute certainly that the church from the time of Christ down to 600 AD believed Kadesh Barnea was located at Petra.
To complicate matters, it is well documented that geographers from the time of Herodotus (450 BC) right up to the 17th century AD, had almost no concept of the Gulf of Aqaba. The Madaba map, in fact, looks exactly like the map of Herodotus below. Even
Strabo in 15 AD
had no idea of the Gulf of Aqaba. Compare the map of Herodotus with the Madaba map as they are based upon the same common misunderstanding of the “V” shaped Red Sea that branches into the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba.
It is truly sad that this portion of the Madaba map is missing that shows Mt. Sinai and the shape of the Red Sea.
We must keep in mind that in 545 AD, the prevailing view of the Western/Latin church (Rome/Roman Catholic) was that Mt. Sinai was located at Mt. Musa in the modern Sinai peninsula. The Madaba Map is located deep into Eastern/Greek (Constantinople/Orthodox) territory of the church. It is entirely possible that there was a rift between east and west as to the real location of Mt. Sinai. Perhaps the Madaba map located Mt. Sinai on the eastern side of the Gulf of Suez. All this is speculation of course. On the other hand, with their misunderstanding of the existence of the Gulf of Aqaba, it may have been mapped the same way on the Madaba map even if it was located in the traditional location west of the Gulf of Aqaba, or where the Bible says it is: in Saudi Arabia (Gal 4:25) on the east side of the Gulf of Aqaba.
Two little letters “ME” on the top of the Madaba map just right of Zered Wadi, simply cannot be Kadesh Barnea. Both Eusebius and Jerome believed Kadesh was at Petra. Petra was such a major center that many of their references were based upon distances from Petra/Kadesh.
D. The exodus route: Wilderness of Sin and Rephidim
Some translated maps of the Madaba map show the
Wilderness of Sin
as the Wilderness of Zin. These are two very different places and wildernesses. The wilderness of Sin is when Israel got the Sabbath revealed for the first time. it is also the place they first got Manna and also quail for food. (Ex 16:13) The wilderness of Zin is north of Kadesh, but includes Kadesh. (Num 27:14) Zin is transjordan and north of Petra in Modern Jordan. Twice during the Exodus God gave Israel quail. First at Sin and second at Kibroth-hattaavah (Num 11:34) and is one stop after Mt. Sinai. (Num 33:16) Therefore the Madaba map says, “Wilderness of Zin: The desert where the Serpent of brass saved the Israelites”, it translated incorrectly and should be the Wilderness of Sin. We are certain that the makers of the map knew the difference. Of course if it was the wilderness of Zin, that would directly locate Kadesh Barnea, but then we would not make sense of it because the story of the Manna and quails did not happen there. So it is the wilderness of Sin before Sinai, not Zin at Kadesh.
Petra is not on the Madaba map. It would have been located in a section that is missing. We would expect it to be directly above Praesidium, Thamara, Moa and above and to the left of “The desert where the Serpent of brass saved the Israelites”.(see below).
The placement of the Wilderness of Sin and Rephidim on the Madaba map is a problem for those who place Mt. Sinai in the mountainous area directly below both. We believe that Mt. Sinai, if it was on the map, would in the missing section at the right of this mountain range.
Both the “Desert of Sin where were sent down the manna and the quails” (Ex 16:13) AND “Rephidim, where Israel fought against Amalek who attacked them” (Ex 17:1-8) is a problem for those who believe Mt. Sinai is located in the mountain range directly below this text. This mountain range, they believe, represents the modern Sinai mountain range where Mt. Musa is located. The problem is that Israel entered the wilderness of Sin and Rephidim BEFORE they reached Mt. Sinai not after.
But even if Mt. Sinai was located on the other side of this Mt. range the order is still reversed: The map has them entering Rephidim first, then the wilderness of Sin second, then Mt. Sinai, so even the sequential order is backwards in addition to the major distortions of distance typical of this kind of “devotional map”.
Then we need to figure out how the section of the map that says, “desert where the serpent of brass saved the Israelites” fits into all this. We know that this event happened east of Kadesh/Petra. This means we would expect to find Petra somewhere directly below this text that highlights the events of Num 21:4-9.
What we do learn from all this, is that their understanding of the Gulf of Aqaba was as bad as their understanding of the Bible geography as the scriptures revealed.
E. The exodus route: Arabah Valley, Zoar, Tamara and Moa
The words “desert of” are likely a reference to either the Arabah Valley or possibly the “Desert of Cades/Kadesh” frequently referenced by Eusebius in his Onomasticon. The Arabah valley is easy to distinguish on a visual basis, since it would be to the right of the Dead Sea and above the three mountain ranges that Mampsis is located in the middle of. Perhaps Eusebius and the Madaba map were inspired by this verse to located the Desert of Kadesh: “The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness; The Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.” Psalm 29:8
The fort at Zoar is exactly where we would expect to find it: just above the right end of the Dead sea.
The series of three forts directly to the right of the Dead sea are known locations. First is Praesidium thought to be at al-Fayfa. Second is Thamara is mentioned in the Onomasticon and is located at Tamara. The third is Moa, perhaps located at near Nahal ‘Omer.
In 1910, Schmidt viewed Kadesh as being at
Qedeis
and viewed
Ein El Weibeh
as being the location for Thamara: “Edward Robinson, on his visit to ‘Ain el Webeh, June 2, 1838, was so strongly impressed with this most important watering place in the ‘Arabah that he identified it with Kadesh Barnea. His description of it was quite accurate. On the assumption that ” Mount Seir ” and “the land of Edom ” had the ‘Arabah for its western border, and that all Biblical statements are equally reliable and must at any price be harmonized, he could scarcely reach a different conclusion. When I visited the place in June, 1905, I was particularly impressed with the large number of palm trees and the excellence of the water in one of the springs. The references to Thamara in Ptolemy, the Peutinger Tables, the Notitia, the Onomasticon, the Madeba mosaic, and the recently discovered Beersheba rescript have convinced me that this place is to be looked for at ‘Ain el Webeh.” ( Kadesh Barnea , Nathan Schmidt, 1910 AD)
Tamara: For a full discussion of Tamara/Thamara, see:
Tamar .
Tamara: Eusebius says in the Onomasticon: “Asasan Thamar (Asasonthamar). Where the Amorrites dwelled whom Chodollagomor destroyed is located near the wilderness of Cades. It is said there is a village Tharmara (a fort Thamara) one day journey from Mapsis on the road from Hebron to Ailam. [Elat on the Red Sea, see Ailam] Today there is a garrison (Roman fort) of soldiers there.” Footnote #: 8: Asasan Thamar (Asasonthamar). Genesis 14:7; K. 8:6; L. 234:84. On the Madaba Map there is a Thamara located as suggested by Eusebius here.
Tabula Peutinger
has a Thamaro 52 or 53 miles from Jerusalem while Ptolemy’s list (V, 15, 5f) has a Thamaro about 55 miles distant. The
Notitia Dignitatum
(74:40) has a Tarba and (74:46) a Thamarra both of which have a garrison. Alt found a fort at
Qasr el Juheiniye
and he is followed by many locating the fort there and the village at
‘ain el ‘Arus . Aharoni more recently ( TEJ , 1963, p.30ff) suggests
‘Ain Husb
which is about a day’s walk (32 km) from Kurnub which is generally identified with Mapsis (cf. also Avi-Yonah) and has a large Roman fort as well as Nabatean and Iron II sherds. The Madaba Map using Jerome’s spelling has located properly Mampsis. Many Nabatean, Roman-Byzantine levels excavated at
Kuroub . It shows a revival in the fourth century A.D. as also does Oboda (Avdat, ‘Abda, and K. 176:9).This may be indicated by “village” in Greek and “oppidum” in Latin (cf. K. 10:25). II Chronicles 20:2 identified Thamar with En Gedi or at least locates it in the district of En Gedi (86:16). Jerome in
Hebrew Questions
says, “his city which we now call Engaddi, is rich in balsam and palms since Asason Thamar translated into our language is city of the palms'” (18) (cf. Judges 1: 16, Ezekiel 47: 29).
Tamar is was identified by Rudolph Cohen to be En Haseva. “In an article last year (BA 57:4119941), we outlined the Roman, Nabatean, and Iron Age remains at (and presented arguments for the identification of the site with the biblical Tamar and the Tamara mentioned in Roman and Byzantine sources. (En Haseva, Rudolph Cohen, The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 58, No. 4, Pots & People. (Dec., 1995), pp. 223-235., 1995 AD) This identification of Tamar with En Haseva is quite uncertain. For full discussion see:
Tamar
Moa: Rudolph Cohen says that, Moa unknown to Eusebius, is located at Nahal ‘Omer in the central Arabah: “Mo’a (Arabic: Kh. Maiyat ‘Awad) is situated near Nahal ‘Omer in the central ‘Arabah (map ref. 1654 9947). It was first surveyed in 1933 by F. Frank. He distinguished the exact ground plan of the principal building, which he described as a Roman castellum, and noted additional structures on hills to the east and west. He proposed the identification of the site with Asuada, referred to in the Notitia Dignitatum (early fourth century C.E.). Abel and Avi-Yonah proposed the identification of Maiyat ‘Awad with Mo’a, which appears on the Madaba map… Mo’a was clearly an important way-station on the road from Petra to Gaza, and consisted of a number of building units. Agricultural terraces were surveyed over a wide area in its neighborhood. The finds indicate that it was founded in the third-second centuries B.C.E., reached its zenith during the reign of Aretas IV, and continued to exist even after the Roman annexation of the Nabatean kingdom in 106 C.E., until the end of the third century. In recent years the site has been surveyed by numerous scholars. In 1980, in the framework of the Negev Emergency Survey, Mo’a was examined by a team directed by D. Nahlieli. … Mo’a was clearly an important way-station on the road from Petra to Gaza, and consisted of a number of building units. Agricultural terraces were surveyed over a wide area in its neighbourhood. The finds indicate that it was founded in the third-second centuries B.C.E., reached its zenith during the reign of Aretas IV, and continued to exist even after the Roman annexation of the Nabatean kingdom in 106 C.E., until the end of the third century.” (Rudolph Cohen, Notes and News, Israel Exploration Journal 32, 1982 AD, p164-165)
E. The exodus route: Shechem (Nabulus) Mt. Gerizim and Mt. Ebal.
The Madaba map places the two mountains twice, in two different locations: On the Madaba map, the mountains of Ebal and Gerizim are in two different locations. One is at Shechem (Modern Nabulus) and one near Jericho and Gilgal. This is because the Orthodox Jews had created a new location near Jericho in their longstanding dispute with the Samaritans. Eusebius, Jerome and the creators of the Madaba map were fully aware of the two traditions and chose to represent both on the map.
In 325 AD, Eusebius believed that the Samaritan’s choice for Mt. Gerizim was wrong and said so in his
Onomasticon
which he wrote in 325 AD. He likely based this on the Bible verse that said it was opposite Gilgal: “Are they [Mt. Ebal and Gerizim] not across the Jordan, west of the way toward the sunset, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?” Deuteronomy 11:30
From the Onomasticon of 325 AD:
Mt. Ebal : “Gaibal (Gebal). Mountain in the Promised Land where Moses commanded an altar to be built (at the command of Moses an alter was built). They say (there are) two neighboring mountains facing each other located at (near) Jericho, one of which (is said) to be Garizin [Gerizim], the other Gaibal [Ebal]. But the Samaritans erroneously point out two others near Neapolis (argue for two mountains near Neapolis but they err greatly) since the great distance of one from the other there shows that they are not able to hear one another when calling out from one (hear the voices calling out in turn blessing or cursing as Scripture records).” (Eusebius,
Onomasticon
325 AD)
Mt. Gerizim : “Garizein (Garizin). Mountain where those calling out the blessing (curse) stood. Read the above mentioned Gaibal (Gebal).” (Eusebius,
Onomasticon
325 AD)
Gilgal : “Golgol or Galgal. The Scriptures teach this is near Mt. Garisein and Mt.Gaibal. The place of Galgal is in the Jericho region (near Jericho). [Therefore the Samaritans err who would point out Mt.Gairsin and Mt.Gebal near Neapolis which Scripture testifies are near Galgal.]” (Eusebius,
Onomasticon
325 AD)
Footnote
from
Onomasticon
: This and the following entry can be treated together. The
Onomasticon
begins by recording the simple biblical information here. The generally accepted tradition is to follow the Samaritan tradition as given here. The two mountains are on either side of Neapolis (K. 4:28) and are
Jebel es-Slamiyeh
and
Jebel et Tur . The Madaba Map reflects this tradition by having them near Shechem (K. 150:1) called Garizin and Gōbel. The pilgrims also recognize this identity. “At Neapolis is Mt Gazaren where the Samaritans say Abraham brought the sacrifice. And to ascend up to the summit are 300 steps. At the foot of the mountain is located a place by the name of Shechem” ( Itin. Bourd.
PPT
I, 18). Zeno and Justinian built churches on Garizein according to Procopius
Buildings
V, vii, 5-17. Excavation of this area is going on. But Eusebius and Jerome prefer to follow an anti-Samaritan location. The Madaba map hesitates between the two opinions and so locates Gebal Garizeini near Ierichō [Jericho] (K. 104:25). The use of the LXX names in Ierichō region and the Aramaic in the Neapolis area may signify some preference. Since Josephus and the later Byzantines had the correct tradition, this rabbinic tradition must have developed in the late first and early second centuries. Procopius 905C is also confused: “This is situated at the Eastern part of Ierichō beyond Galgal” and he continues by denying the Samaritan tradition. Yet in 908A he seems to accept the Samaritan location and tradition. The two mountains near Jericho are probably those above
Aqaba jabr
sometimes called Tyros and Thrax. The Roman road to Jerusalem passed between them. In
Interpretation of Hebrew Names
“Gebal, ancient abyss or stone building” (87). (Eusebius,
Onomasticon
325 AD)
Herbert Donner comments on this: “The mountains Gerizim and Ebal are represented twice on the Madaba Map: near Jericho and near Neapolis. What has happened here? The problem can be solved on the basis of Eus. On. 64:9-14 where, strangely enough, both mountains are indeed located near Jericho. Eusebius, however, does not fail to add: “The Samaritans show other ones near Neapolis, but they are wrong, for the mountains shown by them are too far from each other, so that it is impossible to hear one´s voice when calling to each other.” Although this seems to be entirely intelligible and is confirmed by Deut. 27, the Samaritans were by no means wrong. Eusebius was wrong, and everybody knew it, perhaps he himself included. The Samaritans laid claim to the mountains, considering them to be their own holy mountains. Hostility to the Samaritans forced the orthodox Jews in Jerusalem to locate both mountains at another spot, for the Samaritans were not allowed to be right. Eusebius followed the orthodox Jewish tradition. The mosaicist, however, being well informed, preferred a Solomonic solution: he listed the mountains twice, indicating by larger letters that he regarded the location near Nablus as being correct.” (Herbert Donner, The Mosaic Map of Madaba, Kampen 1992, 24.48)
Here is a
detailed study of the Samaritans
and why they chose Mt. Gerizim as “their Jerusalem”.

Comment:
It must be noted, that Eusebius calls Mt Hermon
the :Mount of the Amorites” of Deut 1:19, 20
Not the “southern Slopes of Judea” which  was occupied by the Hittites and Jebusites, not Amorites. We all recall from whom Abraham bought
a grave for Sarah, a Hittite.
Eusebius would appear to be correct as Aphek, north of Sidon, is
called the “border of the Amorites” by Joshua 13:4
Historians and the Amarna Letters locate the land of the Amorites in
the north.
If we add Joshua 24:8 we get, from the bible itself, a completely
different picture of where Kadesh may have been
“‘I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. ”
The bible seems to indicate a Kadesh Barnea in what is now Syria. Something to think about.
