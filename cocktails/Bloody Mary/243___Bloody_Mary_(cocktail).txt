Apple's Newest Watch : iPod Nano

What time is it? Who cares!
Apple's
newest timepiece puts music, video, photos and step-counting front-and-center, and lets the minutes fall where they may.
Sure, you can check the time, but that's hardly the point with this attractive piece of wrist jewelry. Its unisex design goes equally well with a man's suit, a lady's sweater or a jogging outfit.
One downside: It doesn't come with a watchband, so you'll need to get your own. Fortunately, the clip on the back lets you easily attach it to the strap of your choice.
Unlike almost every other watch we've tested, Apple's
Nano
has a
touch-sensitive , high-resolution
LCD display . The interface is a little counterintuitive at first, but it's no more difficult than anything from
Tokyo
Flash. As a bonus, you can rotate its face with a twisty two-finger gesture, making it work for you in any orientation.

The Era of Robotic Warfare : 30% of All US Military Aircraft are Drones

Some herald it as the cure for terrorism, others deride it as mindless
video game
warfare, but few doubt that the American era of drone warfare has arrived. From short range surveillance craft like the Raven to missile packing hunter-killers like the infamous
Predator , the
US
military is awash with
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) . According to a recent report from the
Congressional Research Service , nearly one in three US warplanes are drones…and those machines are changing the way the world wages war.
US
soldiers in
Afghanistan
rely more and more upon intelligence gathered from drones, and
President Obama
recently lauded the precision and success of deadly drone-strikes against top terrorist targets in
Pakistan . Meanwhile all advanced militaries in the world, from
Israel
to
Russia , seem to be improving their own drone capabilities.

The World's Tallest Building Is Now A 'Distressed' Property

At 2,717 feet, the
Burj Khalifa
is the tallest building in the world, but since its opening two years ago, it has struggled to profit from its grand reputation.
As   Angela Shah reports   for   The New York Times , investors are calling the Burj "distressed," as the building has not yet bounced back from a 40 percent downturn in apartment prices it suffered in 2010.
Meanwhile
Dubai 's
stock market
is   stuck at its lowest level   in 7 years.
The slump in the Burj's value is indicative of just how much
Dubai
has suffered from its absurd
real estate bubble . Real estate values have fallen by over 60 percent since the
Dubai
crisis, according to   Arabian Business .
Some of the ambitious real estate projects that have already failed in
Dubai
include The
Nakheel Harbour and Tower , the   Palm   Deira, and the
Trump International Hotel and Tower .
Forty percent of buildings in Dubai   are vacant, despite that the Emirate has not stopped building and real estate values have dipped lower.

World's hottest Chilli Vodka
made from fiery naga pepper goes on sale at Selfridges

The hottest chilli
vodka
in the world is to go on sale at
Selfridges .
The Naga Chilli Vodka rates 1000,000 on the
Scoville scale
- the international method of measuring the heat in a chilli - making it the most potent chilli vodka ever to be sold. The chilli used in the vodka is the
Naga Jolokia , which is known to be one of the hottest
chillies
it is possible to grow: hotter than most law-enforcement grade pepper sprays.
The drink is made by fermenting litres of vodka with 18kg of the fiery peppers. The resulting concoction is left for several weeks to infuse. Once the vodka has turned a dark
caramel colour , the infusion is complete and the vodka can be bottled. The resulting spirit measures 100,000 on the Scoville scale - twice as hot as
Tabasco , and almost on a par with the level of heat from a
Habanero
or
Scotch bonnet
chilli. Expert mixologists recommend the new vodka be used in a classic
Bloody Mary
for a drink with extra kick.
