More mystery crisps from Walkers
After my post on Mystery Flavour B
Here are the other two. Walkers crisps Mystery flavour C and mystery flavour A. (and while I am at it Livejournal, please stop trying to tell me how to spell the word "flavour"). Mystery flavour C: Mystery SPICY flavour. Ooooh. I did not like you. You tasted like the leftover sauce from our madras curry takeaway. I guess I'm just not a great fan of curry flavour crisps. Not even a rich, tomatoey, curry flavour such as these. My guess? Maybe a Rogan Josh? Maybe "leftover takeaway food" flavour. Mystery flavour A: Mystery DAIRY flavour. Ok, better. As well as cheese powder they also contain celery! In fact the curry crisps above also contain celery. I don't even remember the last time that I ate actual celery! These taste of a light cheese, possibly a
Wensleydale?
That mild, crumbly tasty little cheese made famous by
a dog and some dodgy trousers I might even buy another pack of these for another go. I haven't actually yet bothered to enter the competition. Tags:

Marks and Spencer's Hand Cooked Bloody Mary potato crisps (chips)
Hands up who had a hangover. No? Either I don't believe you. Or more likely, you are still drunk. In the UK, when one requires a certain "hair of the dog" the next morning. One more than likely turns to that most reviving of drinks, the
Bloody Mary . That amazing cocktail of tomato juice,
Worcester Sauce , tabasco, optionally perhaps some salt and pepper and a natty celery-stick mixing spoon but most importantly, a double shot of vodka. Well, no longer do we have to restrict ourselves to a liquid lunch. Marks and Spencer, our favourite semi-upmarket purveyor of ready-meals has come up with the Hand Cooked Bloody Mary flavour crisp: They are quite robust, rustic things,. In a similar way to old-style Kettle chips. True to the cocktail they do contain (dried) tomatoes and celery (extract). They also contain garlic and onion  and cardamon, taste more or a spicy taco seasoning than of tabasco and I no matter how hard I try I can't find any alcohol in them. So, sorry M+S. While these are nice enough in a spicy tomato kind of way. I might have to continue to seek my Sunday refreshments at the hand of the barman instead. Tags:

Mystery flavour potato crisps (chips)
And so it begins again. Walkers crisps which so famously brought us the Cajun Squirrel and English Breakfast flavour crisps in a fine competition a year or so ago now brings us a whole set of "Mystery flavour" crisps to try (actually whatever did happen to those English Breakfast crisps?) And here is the competiton: http://www.walkers.co.uk/Home/Index I have so far tried this one: "Mystery Flavour B" A mystery meaty flavour. The ingredients on the back of the packet tell me that "Mystery Meaty Seasoning contains: Sugar, Glucose, Salt, Flavourings, Spices, Colour (Paprika Extract), Smoke Flavourings" All very mysterious. Truthfully they taste like chicken. A bit sweet perhaps. Not especially barbequey or smokey. My tastebuds jury is still out. Some kind of chicken stew maybe, or a seasoned and roasted drumstick. Time will reveal all. Tags:

My two Pringles of Christmas
The Sausage and Crispy bacon flavour pringles really do taste smokey and baconey. A bit like smokey bacon crisps actually. Roast turkey pringles, I'm not so sure. They do taste a bit like stock I guess. Why they contains liquorice extract is beyond me but at least they haven't cheated and made them taste of herbs, like so many of the roast chicken flavour crisps, which seem to be be rosemary flavoured above all else. By them. Serve them to your Gran with the stilton. Tags:

Valencian food
A quick trip over to Spain last weekend brought the opportunity to try a couple of the traditional foods of Valencia. Valencia is of course the birthplace of the amazing bowl of rice which i s the paella. Mixed seafood, rabbit and chicken or even a vegetarian version are all commonly available, although tradition dicates that it is eaten for lunch and never dinner. This rule doesn't apply to tourist restaurants of course. If you do order it, you might be waiting a while as it takes up to 45 minutes to cook. We did sample one of course, at lunch, in a cafe in the area of the beautful Valencia cathedral (where you can see the supposed Holy Grail ). I forgot to take a photo of the whole thing..by here it is anyway: Another traditional foodstuff, a bit like the Italian grissini breadsticks, are the rosquilletas: These are not like the cookie version I've had elsewhere in Spain, but are made with olive oil and in this case flavoured with subtle anise, although I did see other varieties for sale (including a Simpson's branded one made with chocolate chips!). Very crisp and snackworthy! Tags:

Yellow raspberry
This rarer, sweeter genetic varient is available as part of the English raspberry season. Apparently also known as the "champagne raspberry". It is strange how the hairs stand out against the colour of the fruit. It was mild and tasty and I'll buy them again. I bet it would be great in a cocktail. Tags:

I love blackberry season
Some serene time spent in the sunshine in the woods behind my house. Stepping on the brambles, squeezing through dense patches of trees and being caught by the odd stinging nettle or two in order to reach the dark purple bounty of the thorns. There are so many berries. I collected nearly two litres earlier, enough for myself and the other half, with leftovers to take to work to share. But I can see myself going back many evenings after work. There will be enough for baking, perhaps for sauces and jam and certainly to store in the freezer for winter.
The supermarkets now seem to sell outsize blackberry varities, two or three times the size of these beautiful, sweet tasting little specimens. But for me, I don't need to pay their extortionate prices for what I can harvest for free locally and are really just the perfect size. Tags:
