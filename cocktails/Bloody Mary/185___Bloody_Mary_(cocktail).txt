Recipe #116: Virgin Mary (Mocktail)
Tweet
As most of you surely already know, the
Virgin Mary
is the non-alcoholic version of the
Bloody Mary . :) We'll be eating outdoors on the patio tonight, and so I thought this would be a cool & refreshing accompaniment to the barbecued chicken with grilled vegetables we'll be making on the outdoor grill. Yay! Grilling & eating outdoors is so much fun. :-D It almost feels like a summer picnic. ;)
Virgin Mary (Mocktail)
Ingredients:
64 fl. oz. (8 liquid c.) V8 (or tomato) juice, chilled (I prefer V8, more vegetables/nutrition packed in there! :) )
4 Tbsp. freshly squeezed lime/lemon juice (about 2 limes or lemons)
2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1/8 tsp.Tabasco sauce
1/8 tsp. ground cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp. pure white horseradish
1/4 tsp. celery salt
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. ground black pepper
V8, frozen into ice cubes (eliminates the need for extra ice cubes, plus keeps drinks cold without watering them down)
4 large leafy celery stalks, cut in half
lime (or lemon) slices
Alternate Garnish Ideas:
a few stuffed green olives (stuffed with pimentos) (for garnish)
carrot &/or cucumber sticks
sun-dried tomatoes (i.e., the kind that's
not  packed in oil), julienned
fresh basil leaves
marinated sweet peppers
(sour) dill pickles
artichoke hearts
pearl onions garlic, minced or crushed (mixed into the drinks)
Directions:
Pour the chilled tomato juice into a large pitcher and stir in all other drink ingredients. Mix well. Adjust seasonings to your liking. Serve over ice cubes, adding a celery stick & lime/lemon wedge to each glass.
Serving Suggestions:  As a party idea, serve with a shrimp cocktail platter. :)
Yield:
Serves 8.
