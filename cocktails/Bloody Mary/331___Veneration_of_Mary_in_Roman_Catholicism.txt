Who is Phillip Calvin McGraw?
Who is Phillip Calvin McGraw? The entertainment and medical world knows him as
Dr.
Phil . Dr Phill  is an
American
television
personality ,
author , and
psychologist ,
currently the host of his own television show,
Dr. Phil , which debuted in 2002. McGraw first
gained celebrity status with appearances on
The Oprah Winfrey Show
in the late 1990s. [2]
//
Early life
McGraw was born September 1, 1950 in
Vinita, Oklahoma , the son of Jerry ( née
Stevens) and Joe McGraw. [3]
He grew up with two older sisters, Deana and Donna, and younger sister
Brenda [4]
in the oilfields of
North Texas
where his father was an equipment
supplier. During McGraw’s childhood, his family moved so his father
could pursue a lifelong dream of becoming a
psychologist .
McGraw attended
Shawnee Mission North High
School
in
Overland Park, Kansas . In 1968, he was
awarded a football scholarship to the
University of Tulsa , where he played
middle linebacker under Coach
Glenn
Dobbs . On November 23 of that year McGraw’s team lost to the
University of Houston
100–6, which
is one of the most lopsided games in college football history. [5]
Coach Dobbs retired after that season, and McGraw transferred to
Midwestern State University
in
Wichita Falls, Texas .
Career
McGraw graduated in 1975 from
Midwestern State University
with
a
Bachelor of Arts
degree
in
psychology . He went on to earn a
master’s degree
in
experimental psychology
in 1976, and
a
Ph.D
in
clinical psychology
in 1979 at the
University of North Texas , [6]
where his
dissertation
was titled “ Rheumatoid Arthritis: A
Psychological Intervention .” After run-ins with several faculty
members, [7]
McGraw was guided through the doctoral program by Frank Lawlis, Ph.D.,
who later became the primary contributing psychologist for the
Dr.
Phil
television show. [8]
McGraw owned a construction business with his brother-in-law while
completing his internship for his Ph.D.
After obtaining his Ph.D., McGraw joined his father, Dr. Joe McGraw,
in Wichita Falls, Texas, where the elder McGraw had established his
private psychology practice. [9]
In 1983, McGraw and his father joined Thelma Box, a successful Texas
businesswoman, in presenting “Pathways” seminars, “an experience-based
training which allows individuals to achieve and create their own
results.” [10]
Critics claim that many of the “phrases and the terminology and the
quaint sayings” used by McGraw on the
Oprah
and
Dr. Phil
shows were coined by Box and presented by McGraw in this seminar. McGraw
admits that some of the material from
Life Strategies , his first
best-seller, is taken directly from the Pathways seminar. However, he
has never mentioned Thelma Box or her contributions to his success in
any of his books or TV shows. [7]
Eight years after joining Box, McGraw signed an agreement for the sale
of his Pathways seminar stock for $325,000 without notifying either his
father or Thelma Box of the impending sale. “There was a feeling of
betrayal because Phil had compromised the integrity of the program. The
accusation is that he reduced Box’s asset value in the corporation by
selling behind her back.” [7]
Box founded her own seminars entitled “Choices.” [11]
It has been reported that McGraw and his father seldom speak. [7]
Texas State Board
of Examiners of Psychologists
The Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists determined on
October 21, 1988 that McGraw had hired a former patient for “part-time
temporary employment”. [12]
Specifically the Board cited “a possible failure to provide proper
separation between termination of therapy and the initiation of
employment” [13]
and issued a letter of reprimand and imposed administrative penalties. [14]
The Board also investigated claims made by the patient of inappropriate
contact initiated by McGraw, but the “Findings of Fact” document issued
by the Board on October 21, 1988, at the end of its investigation,
includes no reference to any physical contact of any kind. It
specifically identified the “the therapeutic and business relationships”
as constituting McGraw’s sole issue with the Board. [14]
McGraw fulfilled all terms of the Board’s requirements, and the Board
closed its complaint file in June, 1990. [15]
In 1990, McGraw joined lawyer Gary Dobbs in co-founding Courtroom
Sciences Inc. (CSI), a trial consulting firm through which McGraw later
came into contact with
Oprah
Winfrey . [16]
Eventually, CSI became a profitable enterprise, advising
Fortune
500
companies and injured plaintiffs alike in achieving
settlements. McGraw is no longer an officer or director of the company. [16]
After starting CSI, McGraw ceased the practice of psychology. He
maintained his license current and in good standing until he elected to
retire it 15 years later in 2006. [17]
Appearing on the
Today Show
in January 2008, McGraw said that he
has made it “very clear” that his current work does not involve the
practice of psychology. He also said that he had “retired from
psychology”. [18]
According to the
Today Show , the California Board of Psychology
determined in 2002 that he did not require a license because his show
involves “entertainment” rather than psychology. [18]
Oprah
Winfrey and the
Dr. Phil
show
In 1995,
Oprah Winfrey
hired McGraw’s legal consulting
firm CSI to prepare her for the
Amarillo Texas beef trial . Winfrey was so impressed with
McGraw that she thanked him for her victory in that case, which ended in
1998. Soon after, she invited him to appear on her show. His appearance
proved so successful that he began appearing weekly as a “Relationship
and Life Strategy Expert” on Tuesdays starting in April 1998.
The next year, McGraw published his first best-selling book,
Life
Strategies , some of which was taken from the “Pathways” seminar. [7]
In the next four years, McGraw published three additional best-selling
relationship books, along with workbooks to complement them.
As of September 2002, McGraw formed Peteski Productions [19]
and launched his own
syndicated
daily television show,
Dr. Phil , produced by Winfrey’s
Harpo Studios . The format is an advice show, where he
tackles a different topic on each show, offering advice for his guests’
troubles.
Weight loss
products
In 2003, McGraw entered the weight-loss business, selling shakes,
energy bars, and supplements. These products were promoted on his show
with his sisters Deana and Brenda and nephew Tony among the featured
testimonials on the show. [20]
These products’ labels, which carried the brand name “Shape It Up, Woo,
Woo!”, stated: “These products contain scientifically researched levels
of ingredients that can help you change your behavior to take control
of your weight.” This met with swift criticism from various sources, [2]
accusing McGraw (a clinical psychologist, and not a physician) of
lacking the expertise to recommend weight-loss products. Facing a
Federal Trade Commission
investigation into Shape Up’s claims, McGraw pulled his supplements off
the market in March 2004, and the FTC dropped its probe. In October
2005, several people who used McGraw’s products declared an intent to
file a
class-action lawsuit
against him, claiming that although the supplements cost $120 per month
they did not stimulate weight loss. [21]
McGraw settled the suit in September 2006 for $10.5 million. [22]
Some of the settlement ($6 million) may be paid to the plaintiffs in
the form of
Amway
( Quixtar ) brand
Nutrilite
vitamins. [23]
The
Making of Dr. Phil
unauthorized biography (2003)
The Making of Dr. Phil
is a biography by Sophia Dembling, a
reporter from the
Dallas Morning News , and Lisa
Gutierrez, a reporter from
The Kansas City Star . [3]
The book probed McGraw’s history, with interviews of his childhood
friends and former classmates. The book reported that McGraw allegedly
used unethical business practices in a gym business early in his career,
that he was allegedly abusive to his first wife, and was also allegedly
abusive to his staff, while noting that he overcame adversity through
setting goals and was persistent in achieving success. The book received
no promotional help from McGraw or his associates. [24]
In 2005, McGraw published another best-selling book,
Family First ,
along with a workbook. He also signed a five-year extension of his
syndication deal with his show’s distributors, King World Productions,
Inc. The deal will pay McGraw $15 million a year [25]
and keep the show in production through the 2013–2014 television
season. [26]
Spin-off shows
Also in 2005, McGraw’s son Jay’s television show
Renovate My Family
(a clone of ABC’s
Extreme Makeover: Home Edition )
was canceled at the start of its second season following a renovated
family’s lawsuit. [27] [28]
Jay McGraw and Dr. Phil then formed Stage 29 Productions. [29]
A week later, McGraw and son announced a new show called
Moochers
(a clone of ABC’s
Kicked Out ); [30]
however, the show was canceled before any episodes aired. McGraw also
released another book,
Love Smart , which did not achieve the
success of his previous bestsellers.
In 2006, the
Dr. Phil House
(a clone of CBS’s
Big Brother ) began airing as
part of the
Dr. Phil
television show. Following a protest by
neighbors, the house in Los Angeles was shut down, and production
resumed on a sound stage in a studio back lot. [31]
McGraw reached the number 22 spot on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list,
with income of $45 million. [32]
Another Stage 29 show,
Decision House
(a remix of the
Dr. Phil House )
aired from September through November, 2007 but was canceled due to poor
reviews and dismal ratings. [33]
Ratings for the
Dr. Phil
show in 2007 began to slide. In May,
viewership was close to 7 million people. [34]
However, by year’s end, viewership was about 5.5 million people (#10
for syndicated TV shows, and just under
Everybody Loves Raymond ,
Family
Guy
and
CSI: Miami ). [35]
By August 2008, viewership slipped to just over 4 million people. [36]
Two weeks later, the show slipped beneath the Nielsen top 12 syndicated
TV shows, and has yet to resurface. [37]
McGraw’s income fell by 1/3 to $30 million, and he dropped to the
number 30 spot on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list. [38]
Late in 2007, McGraw began promoting his 2008
Dr. Phil Show
extension,
The Doctors . [39]
The show is hosted by television personality and ER physician Dr.
Travis Stork
( The Bachelor ). Other experts scheduled
to appear include various personalities who have appeared on the
Dr.
Phil
show over the years, such as Dr. Lisa Masterson, an
obstetrician / gynecologist ; Dr. Andrew Ordon, a
plastic surgeon ; and Dr. Jim Sears, a
pediatrician . [40]
Masterson, Ordon, and Sears appeared on the
Dr. Phil
show during
the 2007–08 season so that McGraw could instruct them on “how to give
articulate medical advice while being scrutinized by a studio audience
in Los Angeles.” Jay McGraw (Dr. Phil’s eldest son) is executive
producer of the show.
The Doctors
debuted on September 8, 2008,
and as of November 10, 2008, had a 2.0 rating. [41]
Kalpoe
lawsuit (2006)
McGraw was named a co-defendant, along with
CBS
Television,
in a 2006 lawsuit filed in relation to the disappearance of
Natalee Holloway . [42]
The lawsuit was filed by
Deepak Kalpoe
and his brother
Satish Kalpoe , who claimed that an interview
they did with McGraw, aired in September 2005, was “manipulated and
later broadcast as being accurate, and which portrays Deepak Kalpoe and
Satish Kalpoe ‘as engaging in criminal activity against Natalee Holloway
and constitutes defamation.'” [42]
The Kalpoe brothers claimed invasion of privacy, fraud, deceit,
defamation, emotional distress, and civil conspiracy in the suit, which
was filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court. [43] [44]
Britney Spears
“intervention” (2008)
In January, 2008, McGraw visited entertainer
Britney Spears
in her hospital room. [45]
The visit by McGraw drew criticism from the Spears family and from
mental health professionals.
The visit appeared to be part of an attempt at getting Spears and her
parents to take part in an “intervention” on the Dr. Phil television
show. [46]
Immediately after the visit, McGraw issued public statements [47] [48]
about Spears’ situation that Spears’ family spokeswoman Lou Taylor said
violated their family trust in McGraw. “This is another example of a
trust being betrayed”, Taylor told
Today
co-host Meredith Vieira. “Rather than
helping the family’s situation, the celebrity psychologist caused
additional damage”, she said. [49]
Several mental health care professionals criticized McGraw for his
actions; however, fellow TV psychologist Dr.
Joyce Brothers
defended McGraw. [50]
It was reported that a psychologist filed a complaint with the
California Board of Psychology (BOP), alleging that McGraw had practiced
psychology without a license and had violated doctor-patient privilege
by discussing Spears’ case with the media. [51]
A copy of the complaint appeared in the media, [51]
but there is no way to verify whether or not it was actually submitted
to the BOP. The BOP does not disclose that information unless an
investigation is opened. [52]
Dr. Martin Greenberg, a former BOP President said on the Today Show
that this incident was not a matter that the law covers or would be
concerned about. [52]
Polk County, Florida
controversy (2008)
On April 13, 2008, a producer for the
Dr. Phil
show secured
$30,000 bail for the ringleader of a group of eight teenage girls who
viciously beat another girl and videotaped the attack. [53]
The teen had been booked at the Polk County, Florida jail on charges
that included kidnapping and assault. Producers of the
Dr. Phil
show had made plans to tape a one-hour show devoted to the incident and
had sent a production assistant to Orlando to help book guests for the
show. However, when news broke that the
Dr. Phil
show producer
had posted bail for the teen, the outcry caused the show to cancel their
plans. “In this case certain staffers went beyond our guidelines,” said
Theresa Corigliano, spokesperson for the
Dr. Phil
show. “We have
decided not to go forward with the story as our guidelines have been
compromised.” [54]
Riccio
lawsuit (2008)
McGraw was sued by
Thomas Riccio , the memorabilia collector
responsible for taping the Las Vegas robbery that led to
OJ Simpson
being convicted. Riccio sued McGraw
in Los Angeles Superior Court for defamation, fraud, intentional
infliction of emotional distress and false light for what Riccio claims
to have been deceitful editing of the Dr. Phil Show on which he appeared
in early October 2008. [55]
Approach to
psychology
McGraw’s advice and methods have drawn criticism from some fellow
psychotherapists as well as from some laymen. McGraw’s critics regard
advice given by him to be at best simplistic, and at worst, ineffective. [56]
McGraw said in a 2001 South Florida newspaper interview that he never
liked traditional one-on-one counseling, and that “I’m not the
Hush-Puppies, pipe and ‘Let’s talk about your mother’ kind of
psychologist.'” [57]
Charitable
foundation
McGraw announced the formation of the Dr. Phil Foundation, which
raises funds to fight childhood
obesity ,
on October 22, 2003. The Foundation also supports charitable
organizations that help address the emotional, spiritual and monetary
needs of many children and families. [58]

(March
2010)
McGraw’s first marriage was not publicized until a 2002 Newsweek
cover story. [9]
McGraw married his first wife, an ex-cheerleader and homecoming queen
named Debbie Higgins McCall, in 1970, when he was 20 years old.
According to her, McGraw was domineering and would not allow her to
participate in the family business. She claimed that she was confined to
domestic duties, which included lifting weights to improve her
bustline. [59]
During the process of annulling the marriage in 1973, McGraw began
dating a 19-year old who graduated a year late from high school the week
before they met: McGraw was 23 years old at the time.
[60]
Robin Jo Jameson, whom he married three years later. After the McGraws’
first child Jay was born in 1979, she became a
homemaker .
In 1986, McGraw’s second child, Jordan, was born. [61]
McGraw’s son, Jay McGraw, has partially followed in his father’s
footsteps, publishing books aimed at teenagers based on McGraw’s books
and working for Stage 29. Jay McGraw became engaged to
Erica Dahm , one of the famous Playboy Playmate
triplets. [62]
McGraw, who has been an outspoken critic of pornography, was best man
at his son’s wedding, which was held at his home in Beverly Hills. [8]
McGraw is also a private pilot, with an instrument rating, flying
single engine airplanes. [63]

Allan Sandage, American astronomer, died from pancreatic cancer he was , 84
Allan Rex Sandage   [1]
[2] [3] [4]
was an
American
astronomer . He was Staff Member
Emeritus
with the
Carnegie Observatories
in
Pasadena, California . [5]
He is best known for determining the first reasonably accurate value for the
Hubble constant
and the
age of the universe .
(born June 18, 1926 in
Iowa City, Iowa , died November 13, 2010)
Career
Allan R. Sandage was one of the most influential astronomers of the 20th century. [6]
Sandage graduated from the
University of Illinois
in 1948. By 1953 he earned his
Ph.D.
from the
California Institute of Technology
with the
German
observational astronomer
Walter Baade
as his advisor. During this time Sandage was a graduate student assistant to the famed cosmologist
Edwin Hubble .
Sandage continued Hubble’s research program after Hubble’s sudden death
in 1953. Walter Baade’s 1952 discovery of two separate populations of
Cepheid variable
stars in the
Andromeda Galaxy , resulted in a doubling of the
age of the Universe
from 1.8 to 3.6 billion years, since Hubble had only considered the weaker Population II Cepheid variables as
standard candles .
Following this, Sandage showed that astronomers’ previous assumption
that the brightest stars in galaxies were of approximately equal
inherent intensity was mistaken in the case of
H II regions
which he found not to be stars and inherently brighter than the
brightest stars in distant galaxies. This resulted in another 1.5 factor
increase in the age of the Universe, to approximately 5.5 billion years [7] . Throughout the 1950s and well into the 1980s Sandage was regarded as the pre-eminent observational
cosmologist . Sandage made seminal contributions to all aspects of the cosmological distance scale from local calibrators within our own
Milky Way Galaxy
to cosmologically distant galaxies.
Sandage began working at the
Palomar Observatory . In 1958 he published [8]
the first good estimate for the
Hubble constant ,
revising Hubble’s value of 250 down to 75 km/s/Mpc, which is quite
close to today’s accepted value. Later he became the chief advocate of
an even lower value, around 50, corresponding to a
Hubble age
of around 20 billion years.
He performed photometric studies of
globular clusters , and deduced that they had an age of at least 25 billion years. This led him to speculate that the
Universe
did not merely expand, but actually expanded and contracted with a
period of 80 billion years. The current cosmological estimates of the
age of the universe ,
in contrast, are typically of the order of 14 billion years. As part of
his studies on the formation of galaxies in the early Universe, he
co-wrote the seminal paper [9]
now called ELS after the authors
Olin J. Eggen ,
Donald Lynden-Bell , and Sandage first describing the collapse of a proto-galactic gas cloud into our present
Milky Way Galaxy .
In his paper of 1961 “The Ability of the 200-inch Telescope to Discriminate Between Selected World Models,” [10]
he discussed the future of observational cosmology as the search for two parameters – the
Hubble constant
H 0
and the
deceleration parameter
q 0 .
This paper influenced observational cosmology for at least three
decades as it carefully laid out the types of observational tests that
could be performed with a large telescope. He also published two atlases
of galaxies, in 1961 [11]
and in 1981, [12]
based on the
Hubble classification
scheme.
In 1962 [13]
studied a possibility of directly measuring the temporal variation of
the redshift of extra-galactic sources, an effect later called
Sandage–Loeb effect. [14]
He is noted for the discovery in the
M82
galaxy
of jets erupting from the core. These must have been caused by massive
explosions in the core, and the evidence indicated the eruptions had
been occurring for at least 1.5 million years. [15]
He was a prolific researcher with over 500 papers. Until his death he continued to be an active researcher at the
Carnegie Observatories , still publishing several papers a year. [16]

Henryk Górecki, Polish composer (Symphony of Sorrowful Songs), died after a long illness. he was , 76
Henryk Mikołaj Górecki
was a
composer
of
contemporary classical music
died after a long illness. he was , 76. He studied at the State Higher School of Music in
Katowice
between 1955 and 1960. In 1968, he joined the faculty and rose to
provost before resigning in 1979. Górecki became a leading figure of the
Polish avant-garde during the post-Stalin cultural thaw. [3] [4]
His
Webernian -influenced
serialist works of the 1950s and 1960s were characterized by adherence
to dissonant modernism and drew influence from
Luigi Nono ,
Karlheinz Stockhausen , [5]
Krzysztof Penderecki
and
Kazimierz Serocki . [6]
He continued in this direction throughout the 1960s, but by the mid 1970s had changed to a less complex
sacred minimalist
sound, exemplified by the transitional
Symphony No. 2
and the hugely popular
Symphony No. 3
( Symphony of Sorrowful Songs ). This later style developed through several other distinct phases, from such works as his 1979
Beatus Vir , [7]
to the choral 1981 hymn
Miserere , the 1993
Kleines Requiem für eine Polka [8]
and his requiem
Good Night . [9]
(December 6, 1933 – November 12, 2010)
Until 1992, Górecki was viewed as a remote and fiery figure [10]
known only to a few connoisseurs, primarily as one of a number of
composers responsible for sparking a postwar renaissance in Polish
music. [11]
In 1992, 15 years after it was composed, a recording of his
Third Symphony,
Symphony of Sorrowful Songs —recorded with
soprano
Dawn Upshaw
and released to commemorate the memory of those lost during
the Holocaust —became
a worldwide commercial and critical success, selling more than a
million copies and vastly exceeding the typical lifetime sales of a
recording of symphonic music by a 20th-century composer. As surprised as
anyone at its popularity, Górecki said, “Perhaps people find something
they need in this piece of music […] somehow I hit the right note,
something they were missing. Something somewhere had been lost to them. I
feel that I instinctively knew what they needed.” [11]
This popular success did not generate wide interest in Górecki’s other works, [12]
and he pointedly resisted the temptation to repeat earlier success, or compose for commercial reward.
Apart from two brief periods studying in Paris and a short time
living in Berlin, Górecki spent most of his life in southern Poland.
Early years
Henryk Górecki was born on December 6, 1933, in the village of
Czernica
(Silesian Voivodeship) in,
Silesia ,
southwest Poland. The Górecki family lived modestly, though both
parents had a love of music. His father Roman (1904–1991) worked at the
goods office of a local railway station, but was an amateur musician,
while his mother Otylia (1909–1935), played piano. Otylia died when her
son was just two years old, [14]
and many of his early works were dedicated to her memory. [15]
Henryk developed an interest in music from an early age, though he was
discouraged by both his father and new stepmother to the extent that he
was not allowed to play his mother’s old piano. However, he persisted,
and in 1943 was allowed to take violin lessons with Paweł Hajduga; a
local amateur musician, instrument maker and
chłopski filozof
(peasant philosopher). [16]
In 1945, Górecki fell while playing in a neighbor’s yard and dislocated his hip. The resulting
suppurative inflammation
was misdiagnosed by a local doctor, and delay in proper treatment led
to tubercular complications in the bone. The illness went largely
untreated for two years, by which time permanent damage had been
sustained. He spent the following twenty months in a hospital in
Germany, where he underwent four operations. [17]
Górecki continued to suffer ill health throughout his life and, as a result, said he had “talked with death often”. [18]
Emerging composer: Rydułtowy and Katowice
Between 1951 and 1953, Górecki taught 10- and 11-year-olds at a school outside of
Rydułtowy , in southern Poland. [16]
In 1952, he began a teacher training course at the
Szafrankowie Brothers State School of Music
in
Rybnik ,
where he studied clarinet, violin, piano, and music theory. Through
intensive studying Górecki finished the four year course in just under
three years. During this time he began to compose his own pieces, mostly
songs and piano miniatures. Occasionally he attempted more ambitious
projects—in 1952 he adapted the Adam Mickiewicz ballad
Świtezianka , though his work was left unfinished. [19]
However, life for the composer during this time was often difficult. Teaching posts were generally badly paid, while the
shortage economy
made manuscript paper at times difficult and expensive to acquire. With
no access to radio, Górecki kept up to date with music by weekly
purchases of such periodicals as
Ruch muzyczny
(Musical Movement) and
Muzyka , and by purchasing at least one
score
a week. [20]
The Academy of Music in Katowice where Górecki lectured from 1968
Górecki continued his formal study of music at the Katowice
Academy of Music , [21]
where he studied under the composer
Bolesław Szabelski , a former student of the renowned composer
Karol Szymanowski . As Górecki was later to follow, Szabelski drew much of his inspiration from Polish highland folklore. [10]
Szabelski schooled his pupil in a neoclassical reading of counterpoint
and motorics, during a period when Górecki was also absorbing the
techniques of
twelve-tone serialism . [22]
He graduated from the Academy with honours in 1960.
Professorship
In 1975, Górecki was promoted to Professor of Composition at the
State Higher School of Music in Katowice, where his students included
Eugeniusz Knapik ,
Andrzej Krzanowski
and Rafał Augustyn. [21]
Around this time, Górecki came to believe the Polish Communist
authorities were interfering too much in the activities of academy, and
described them as “little dogs always yapping”. [10]
As a senior administrator but not a member of
the Party ,
he was in almost perpetual conflict with the authorities in his efforts
to protect his school, staff and students from undue political
influence. [21]
In 1979 he resigned from his post in protest at the government’s refusal to allow
Pope John Paul II
to visit Katowice [24]
and formed a local branch of the “Catholic Intellectuals Club”; an
organisation devoted to the struggle against the Communist Party. [10]
He remained politically active through the late 1970s and 1980s. In 1991, he composed his
Miserere
for a large choir in remembrance of police violence against the
Solidarity
movement. [8]
Style and compositions
See also:
List of compositions by Henryk Górecki
Górecki’s music covers a variety of styles, but tends towards relative
harmonic
and
rhythmical
simplicity. He is considered to be a founder of the so-called
New Polish School . [25] [26]
Described by Terry Teachout, he said Górecki has “more conventional array of compositional techniques includes both elaborate
counterpoint
and the ritualistic repetition of melodic fragments and harmonic patterns.” [27]
His first works, dating from the last half of the 1950s, were in the
avant-garde
style of
Pierre Boulez
(b. 1925) and other
serialists
of that time. His compositions were not always well received by
critics, in 1967 his “Refrain” was described by a British writer with
the words, “players can bang and blow and scrape repeated notes as they
wish. The experiment might better have been conducted in private.” [28]
During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Górecki progressively moved
away from his early career as radical modernist, and began to compose
with a more traditional, romantic mode of expression. His change of
style was viewed as an affront to the then avant-garde establishment,
and though he continued to receive commissions from various Polish
agencies, by the mid 1970s Górecki was no longer regarded as a composer
that mattered. In the words of one critic, his “new material was no
longer cerebral and sparse; rather, it was intensely expressive,
persistently rhythmic and often richly colored in the darkest of
orchestral hues”. [29]
Early modernist works
The first public performances of Górecki’s music in Katowice in
February 1958 programmed works clearly displaying the influence of
Szymanowski and
Bartók . The
Silesian State Philharmonic
in
Katowice
held a concert devoted entirely to the 24-year-old Górecki’s music. The
event led to a commission to write for the Warsaw Autumn Festival. The
Epitafium
(“Epitaph”) he submitted marked a new phase in his development as a composer, [11]
and was described as representing “the most colourful and vibrant expression of the new Polish wave”. [30]
The Festival announced the composer’s arrival on the international
scene, and he quickly became a favorite of the West’s avant-garde
musical elite. [29]
Writing in 1991, the music critic James Wierzbicki described how that
at this time “Górecki was seen as a Polish heir to the new aesthetic of
post-Webernian serialism; with his taut structures, lean orchestrations
and painstaking concern for the logical ordering of pitches”. [29]
Górecki wrote his First Symphony in 1959, and graduated with honours from the Academy the following year. [21]
At the 1960 Warsaw Autumn Festival, his
Scontri , written for orchestra, caused a sensation among critics due to its use of sharp contrasts and harsh
articulations . [21] [31]
By 1961, Górecki was at the forefront of the Polish
avant-garde , having absorbed the
modernism
of
Anton Webern ,
Iannis Xenakis
and
Pierre Boulez ,
and his Symphony No. 1 gained international acclaim at the Paris
Biennial Festival of Youth. Górecki moved to Paris to continue his
studies, and while there was influenced by contemporaries including
Olivier Messiaen ,
Roman Palester , and
Karlheinz Stockhausen . [5]
He began to lecture at the
Academy of Music in Katowice
in 1968, where he taught score-reading, orchestration and composition. In 1972, he was promoted to assistant professor, [21]
and developed a fearsome reputation among his students for his often blunt personality. According to the Polish composer
Rafał Augustyn ,
“When I began to study under Górecki it felt as if someone had dumped a
pail of ice-cold water over my head. He could be ruthless in his
opinions. The weak fell by the wayside but those who graduated under him
became, without exception, respected composers”. [10]
Górecki admits, “For quite a few years, I was a pedagogue, a teacher in
the music academy, and my students would ask me many, many things,
including how to write and what to write. I always answered this way: If
you can live without music for 2 or 3 days, then don’t write…It might
be better to spend time with a girl or with a beer…If you cannot live
without music, then write.” [32]
Due to his commitments as a teacher and also because of bouts of ill
health, he composed only intermittently during this period. [33]
Minimalism
By the early 1970s, Górecki had begun to move away from his earlier
radical modernism, and was working towards a more traditional, romantic
mode of expression. His change of style affronted the avant-garde
establishment, and although various Polish agencies continued to
commission works from him, Górecki ceased to be viewed as an important
composer. One critic later wrote that “Górecki’s new material was no
longer cerebral and sparse; rather, it was intensely expressive,
persistently rhythmic and often richly colored in the darkest of
orchestral hues”. [29]
Górecki progressively rejected the dissonance,
serialism
and
sonorism
that had brought him early recognition, and pared and simplified his
work. He began to favor large slow gestures and the repetition of small
motifs. [34]
The “Symphony No. 2, ‘Copernican’, Op. 31”
(II Symfonia Kopernikowska)
was written in 1972 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the birth of the astronomer
Nicolaus Copernicus . Written in a monumental style for
solo soprano ,
baritone ,
choir
and
orchestra , it features text from
Psalms
no. 145, 6 and 135 as well as an excerpt from Copernicus’ book
De revolutionibus orbium coelestium . [35]
It was composed in two movements, and a typical performance lasts 35 minutes. The symphony was commission by the
Kosciuszko Foundation
in New York, and presented an early opportunity for Górecki to reach an
audience outside of his native Poland. As was usual, he undertook
extensive research on the subject, and was in particular concerned with
the philosophical implications of Copernicus’s discovery, not all of
which he viewed as positive. [36]
As the historian
Norman Davies
commented, “His discovery of the earth’s motion round the sun caused
the most fundamental revolutions possible in the prevailing concepts of
the human predicament”. [37]
By the mid-1980s, his work began to attract a more international audience, and in 1989 the
London Sinfonietta
held weekend of concerts in which his work was played alongside that of the Russian composer
Alfred Schnittke . [38]
In 1990, the American
Kronos Quartet
commissioned and recorded his First String Quartet,
Already It Is Dusk , Op. 62, an occasion that marked the beginning of a long relationship between the quartet and composer. [39]
Main article:
Symphony No. 3 (Górecki)
Górecki’s most popular piece is his “ Third Symphony “, also known as the “Symphony of Sorrowful Songs”
(Symfonia pieśni żałosnych) . The work is slow and contemplative, and each of the three movements is composed for orchestra and solo soprano. The
libretto
for the first movement is taken from a 15th century lament, while the
second movement uses the words of a teenage girl, Helena Błażusiak,
which she wrote on the wall of a
Gestapo
prison cell in
Zakopane
to invoke the protection of the
Virgin Mary . [40]
The third uses the text of a
Silesian
folk song which describes the pain of a mother searching for a son killed in the
Silesian uprisings . [41]
The dominant themes of the symphony are motherhood and separation
through war. While the first and third movements are written from the
perspective of a parent who has lost a child, the second movement is
from that of a child separated from a parent.
Later works
Despite the success of the Third Symphony, Górecki resisted temptation to compose again in that style, and according to
Allmusic
continued to work, not to further his career or reputation, but largely “in response to inner creative dictates”. [42]
In February 1994, the
Kronos Quartet
performed at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music
four concerts honoring postmodern revival of interest in new music. The
first three concerts featured string quartets and the works of three
living composers: two American ( Philip Glass
and
George Crumb ) and one Pole (Górecki). [27]
His later work includes a 1995 commission for the
Kronos Quartet
entitled “Songs are Sung”, “Concerto-Cantata” (written in 1992 for
flute and orchestra) and “Kleines Requiem für eine Polka”. Both
“Concerto-Cantata” and “Kleines Requiem für eine Polka” (1993 for piano
and 13 instruments) have been recorded by the
London Sinfonietta
and the Schoenberg Ensemble. [43]
“Songs are Sung” is his third string quartet and was commissioned in 1992, and inspired by a poem by
Velimir Khlebnikov .
When asked why it took almost thirteen years to finish, he replied, “I
continued to hold back from releasing it to the world. I don’t know
why.” [44]
Personal life
He was married to Jadwiga, a piano teacher. His daughter, Anna
Górecka-Stanczyk, is a pianist, and his son, Mikolaj Górecki, a
composer. [45]
Death
During the last decade of his life, Górecki suffered from frequent illnesses. [46]
His Symphony No. 4 was due to be
premièred
in London in 2010, by the
London Philharmonic Orchestra , but the event was cancelled due to the composer’s ill health. [46] [47]
He died on November 12, 2010, in his home city of
Katowice , of complications due to a lung infection. [48]
Reacting to his death, the head of the
Katowice Music Academy ,
Eugeniusz Knapik , said “Górecki’s work is like a huge boulder that lies in our path and forces us to make a spiritual and emotional effort”. [49]
Adrian Thomas , Professor of Music at
Cardiff University ,
said “The strength and startling originality of Górecki’s character
shone through his music […] Yet he was an intensely private man,
sometimes impossible, with a strong belief in family, a great sense of
humour, a physical courage in the face of unrelenting illness, and a
capacity for firm friendship”. [46]
Górecki had been awarded the
Order of the White Eagle , Poland’s highest honour, just a month before his death. [1]
He received the award from
Anna Komorowska , [50]
wife of
Polish President
Bronisław Komorowski , in his hospital bed. [48]
Critical opinion
When placing Górecki in context, musicologists and critics generally compare his work with such composers as
Olivier Messiaen
and
Charles Ives . [51]
He himself said that he also feels kindred with such figures as
Bach ,
Mozart , and
Joseph Haydn
though he has said he feels most affinity towards
Franz Schubert , particularly in terms of tonal design and treatment of basic materials. [51]
Since Górecki’s move away from
serialism
and
dissonance
in the 1970s, he is frequently compared to composers such as
Arvo Pärt ,
John Tavener
and
Giya Kancheli . [31] [51]
The term
holy minimalism
is often used to group these composers, due to their shared simplified approach to texture,
tonality
and
melody ,
in works often reflecting deeply held religious beliefs. However, none
of these composers has admitted to common influences. His modernist
techniques are also compared to
Igor Stravinsky ,
Béla Bartók ,
Paul Hindemith
and
Dmitri Shostakovich . [27]
In 1994 Boguslaw M. Maciejewski published the first biography of Górecki, entitled
Górecki – His Music And Our Times .
It includes a great deal of detail about the composer’s life and work,
including the fact that he achieved cult status thanks to valuable
exposure on
Classic FM . The serene Third Symphony (the Symphony of Sorrowful Songs) became the focus of his incredible rise in popularity.
Discussing his audience in a 1994 interview, Górecki said,
I do not choose my listeners. What I mean is, I never write for my
listeners. I think about my audience, but I am not writing for them. I
have something to tell them, but the audience must also put a certain
effort into it. But I never wrote for an audience and never will write
for because you have to give the listener something and he has to make
an effort in order to understand certain things. If I were thinking of
my audience and one likes this, one likes that, one likes another thing,
I would never know what to write. Let every listener choose that which
interests him. I have nothing against one person liking Mozart or
Shostakovich or Leonard Bernstein, but doesn’t like Górecki. That’s fine
with me. I, too, like certain things. [32]
Górecki received an honorary doctorate from
Concordia University ,
in Quebec, Canada. In a press statement, Concordia Professor Wolfgang
Bottenberg described him as one of the “most renowned and respected
composers of our time”, and stated that Górecki’s music “represents the
most positive aspects of the closing years of our century, as we try to
heal the wounds inflicted by the violence and intolerance of our times.
It will endure into the next millennium and inspire other composers”. [52]
In 2008, he received a further honorary doctorate from the Music
Academy in Krakow. At the awarding ceremony a selection of the
composer’s choral works was performed by the choir of the city’s
Franciscan Church. [53]

Who is Slipknot ? The heavy metal world know them as American
heavy metal
band from
Des Moines, Iowa . Formed in 1995, the group was founded by percussionist
Shawn Crahan
and bassist
Paul Gray , after several lineup changes in their early days the band consisted of nine members for the greater part of their tenure— Sid Wilson , Paul Gray,
Joey Jordison ,
Chris Fehn ,
Jim Root ,
Craig Jones , Shawn Crahan,
Mick Thomson , and
Corey Taylor . However, the death of Paul Gray on May 24, 2010 left the band with only eight remaining members.
Slipknot is well known by their attention-grabbing image, aggressive
music style and their energetic and chaotic live shows. The band had
somewhat of a meteoric rise to success following the release of their
self-titled debut album
in 1999. The 2001 follow-up album
Iowa
further increased the band’s popularity. After breaking for their first hiatus, Slipknot returned in 2004 with
Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)
and once again in 2008 with their fourth album
All Hope Is Gone , which debuted at the top spot on the
Billboard 200
charts. The band has also released one
