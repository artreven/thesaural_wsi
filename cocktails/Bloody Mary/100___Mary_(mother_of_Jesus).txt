Answer:
The word comes from the Latin "carne" which means "flesh". The Incarnation refers to the central Christian belief that the Second Person of the Trinity took flesh of the Virgin Mary, and became truly human (while remaining truly divine) in all things but sin. Christianity is the only religion which holds that God became incarnate. One must believe in the Incarnation (that Christ was truly human and truly divine) to be a Christian.
(Some other religions teach that their god takes human form, but the god does not actually become human.)

Literary Devices and Figures of Speech
What does the word incarnation mean?
Incarnation means being embodied in physical form (usually as a person, although other types of incarnation are also considered to be possible, such as incarnation as an insec … t). There are many religions which believe that a person consists of both a spiritual essence or soul, and a body. When the body dies, the spiritual essence might go somewhere else, to an afterlife, or may be reborn as another person, in which case that would be called reincarnation, or being incarnated again. If a spirit has no body (such as a ghost) it can be described as disincarnate, meaning not incarnated.

Gods
The Goddess Guan-Yin
As a goddess venerated in Asian religions, Guan-Yin is a bodhisattva associated with compassion. She is a figure prominent in both Buddhist and Taoist religions, and there is
… a huge array of folklore surrounding her. The outside observer, however, may not know exactly how the goddess fits into eastern thought and the kind of role she plays. This article explores who the goddess Guna-Yin is and her role in religious belief.The name Guan-Yin is originally a translation from Avalokitasvara, the name of the Mahayana bodhisattva. This bodhisattva is known as a bodhisattva of compassion. A bodhisattva is an enlightened being that has escaped the cycle of this life and has the ability to enter Nirvana at any time. Yet because of their kindness, they choose to remain behind to assist others in their journey to find Nirvana. In both the Indian Buddhist incarnation and the Chinese Buddhist and Taoist incarnations, Guan-Yin is a compassionate figure who could take on the form of both male and female, human or non-human, in order to teach humans the right way.According to Chinese mythology and belief, Guan-Yin had finally attained enlightenment and was ready to enter Nirvana. But even as she was about to join with the Buddhas and enter heaven, she heard the cries of suffering from the people left behind on earth. The sounds of their misery touched her heart and she knew that she could not leave them behind without helping them. She thus embarked on a monumental quest: to bring every soul into Nirvana, freeing them from the cycle of reincarnation.Guan-Yin worked hard to save others, but despite her hard work, the task seemed impossible. Even as she understood the pain and hurt of one individual, the pain of another would overwhelm her. She struggled with comprehending the pain of so many, and as she did so her head split into 11 pieces. It was a this point that the Buddha Amitabha, intervened and healed her, giving her 11 heads to help her hear the cries of so many on the earth. She now understood what she had to do to help others, but her two arms were not up to the task and shattered. Amitabha, then came to her aid and granted her a thousand arms so that she could reach out to those that needed help.In Buddhism a bodhisattva can take on the form of both male and female to help liberate souls from the reincarnating cycle of life. Indeed, Guan-Yin has been known to take on both roles, but is still mostly known as a bringer of peace and comfort. In the Lotus Sutra she is referenced as a "perceiver of the world's sounds" and saves people from suffering and ignorance. In this light she is often seen as a savior figure, both physically and spiritually.Guan-Yin in today's belief is still a figure that is called upon in the difficult situations. Though appearing before as a man, she is now most commonly depicted as a female, with the ability of delivering people from disasters, endowing people with fertility, and saving people from distress. In an interesting blending of religions, Guan-Yin has emerged as an essential part of belief. It is no wonder too, since so many people seek solace in a world becoming increasingly complex and cruel. A goddess of compassion has a prominent role in people's lives.Guan-Yin is also known for her role in the Chinese Classic, The Journey to the West. The story depicts the tale of a young monk seeking to travel to India. Because of the dangers of this journey, the Goddess gives the monk a few companions to aid him in his journey. Among them is the famous trickster god, the Monkey King.

Urban Legends
The Foundations of the Bloody Mary Legend
There are countless urban legends that exist all over the world. Some have basis in folklore and others come from more recent accounts of the paranormal. The interest in paran … ormal events is constantly climbing as ways are invented that seem to either credit or discredit the activity with scientific methods. Bloody Mary may be one of the best-known urban legends in existence. It is likely one of the first games and interaction with the idea of the paranormal that many experience.There are several legends about who Bloody Mary really is. She even has various names and incarnations that she's known by. The most common version of the myth is that she is a witch who was trapped in a mirror by a spell gone wrong. No one truly knows the origins of the story or what the truth may be, but every part of the country seems to have a different Mary myth. All the versions are made to terrify as much as possible.No one is sure of the exact origins of the legend. The most common source that is given credit for the story is Mary I the Queen of England. The daughter of King Henry VIII, she was very unhappy with the split from the Catholic Church. The split caused her to be considered an illegitimate child for many years. Once she was finally on the throne, she killed approximately 267 Protestants and reformers. She was determined to turn England back to the Roman Catholic Church and used force to do so. The first person to die by her hand was Lady Jane Grey, her cousin and rival to the throne. The numerous murders were what gave her the name Bloody Mary.There are many legends and myths revolving around Bloody Mary. The most well known are Mary Worth, Bloody Bones, and Mary Whales. With each area of the country and the world having its own version of the myth, it is almost impossible to determine how many Bloody Mary?s there are. With each version comes a new name and a new way to summon the apparition. There are just as many variations of the ritual as there are names for the spirit that is claimed to appear.The official term is Catoptromancy. This is a form of divination using a mirror; it is also known as scrying. The practice can be used to see the future, predict death or health issues, and to summon the dead. There are many old tales of using mirrors as a focus for abilities and magic. The tales go all the way back to Chaucer's Squire's Tale in 1390. Some claim that passages in the bible also reference this, such as I Corinthians 13.This depends on which version of the myth you follow. The basic instructions are turning out the lights and saying her name to the mirror three times while you stare at it. There are other versions that call for saying her name 13 times. Many more call for spinning in a circle and lighting candles. You can find many myths online or at your local library. You can pick your favorite one and give it a try in any mirror, but most people do this in the bathroom because you can shut the door.There may never be an answer to where or how the myth started. It will probably continue for many years to come. It is very popular with parties, especially sleepovers. More young girls play this game than boys, but it can be played by anyone. It becomes even more popular around Halloween.There are several legends about who Bloody Mary really is. She even has various names and incarnations that she's known by.

Are Pontiacs Good Cars? Determining If a Used Pontiac Is Right for You
The Pontiac car company's long and storied history came to an end in 2010, but millions of Pontiacs are still on the road and in the used market. Pontiac was one of the upscal … e and performance-oriented brands in the General Motors stable, so late-model Pontiacs are good cars for those looking for a bit of style with their performance. If you prefer older cars, classic Pontiacs from the 1960s and 1970s have never lost appeal; however, some Pontiacs are not good buys at any price.The quality of Pontiac vehicles was on the upswing at the time of its discontinuation. While this improvement began in the late 1990s, cars from 2006 onward are your best choices if you decide a modern Pontiac is right for you. Pontiacs from 2006 to 2010 showed noticeable improvements in performance and reliability from earlier models.Classic Pontiacs such as the 1960s-era GTO are classics for good reason. The combination of styling and performance was among the best in the world at the time and still stands up today. While collector-grade Pontiacs are expensive propositions, a Pontiac of similar vintage in slightly lesser condition sometimes becomes available for a very reasonable sum. Maintaining and restoring a classic Pontiac is neither cheap nor easy, but it is very rewarding both personally and in terms of resale value.The Pontiac Aztek is a strong candidate for the most unloved car of the 2000s. In fact, a number of automotive publications name the Aztek among the ugliest cars in existence, and some commentators explicitly blame this SUV for killing Pontiac in the first place. Prices for Azteks are often attractive, but bizarre exterior styling, low resale value and frequent mechanical issues are all good reasons to avoid this Pontiac.The most recent incarnation of the Pontiac GTO was not well-received by classic car fans, many of whom expected a reinvention along the lines of the modern Mustang or Camaro. While the 2000s-era GTO has more in common with a passenger sedan than a classic muscle car in terms of its exterior styling, the powerful V8 under the hood makes this incarnation faster than many of its legendary namesakes. The initial lack of popularity of the GTO drove down prices on the used market; thus, a used GTO is a great option for those looking for a high-speed bargain.1980s and 1990s Pontiacs were simply not good cars overall. Age and wear have likely exacerbated the issues inherent to the poor design and build quality in most high-mileage examples. While performance Pontiacs of this era, such as the Firebird and Fiero, still have some appeal for enthusiasts, most used car shoppers are better off avoiding these cars entirely.Not all Pontiacs are good cars for used shoppers. Most Pontiacs of the 1980s and 1990s and more modern failures such as the Aztek are best avoided; however, classic Pontiacs and overlooked modern gems such as the GTO are still great choices.The last great Pontiac on the market, the G8, was based on the popular Holden Commodore sedan from Australia. The combination of a powerful V8, sporty rear-wheel drive transmission and ultra-modern styling made the G8 extremely popular, with resale values holding strong on the secondary market. Unfortunately, the car was too little, too late for the beleaguered brand.

History
Saint Benedict Chapel: History and Design
High in the Swiss Alps, an austere wooden chapel looks over the Rhine Valley not far from stone ruins. This site is the famed Saint Benedict Chapel in Sumvitg, Switzerland. Wi … th a history stretching back almost 1,000 years, the strikingly modern chapel is the latest incarnation of a small church that has seen tragedy and rebirth. Most recently rebuilt by Swiss architect Peter Zumthor, the chapel is also an excellent example of Modernist architecture fused with traditional sensibilities. If you're interested in the architecture and history of this chapel, read on to find out more.The Saint Benedict Chapel overlooks the Romansch-speaking municipality of Sumvitg, a collection of hamlets spread across the Upper Rhine Valley in the Swiss canton of Graubunden. The villages of Sumvitg are located on a mountainside in the Alps. The villages are set into small farms, as well as forests and alpine meadows.Before its most modern incarnation, Saint Benedict Chapel had a long history. According to local monastic records, the chapel was erected in 1268 at the same time a branch of the Beguin devotional order was founded by the College of Saint Benedict. The records suggest an even earlier church existed at the site, but no traces of it remain.The chapel was expanded several times over the centuries. In 1522 the apse was replaced by a larger choir, and a new altar was consecrated in 1670. In 1923, the roof was torn from the building by an avalanche; when it was replaced, foundational additions were made to help protect against future avalanches. Several other renovations were also made in the early 20th century. In 1984, the chapel was destroyed in an avalanche. Its ruins still stand, somewhat protected against further decay by plastic sheeting.After the 1984 destruction of the original Saint Benedict Chapel, its owners, the monks of a monastery in the nearby town of Disentis, initiated a competition to design the new church. They awarded Swiss architect Peter Zumthor the contract to rebuild the chapel.The new chapel was completed in 1988 on a site about 100 yards from the ruins of its predecessor. It lies beneath a forest which shielded it from future avalanches. Saint Benedict Chapel is built of native wood in the form of a teardrop with an exterior covered in wooden shingles. The bare wood interior is a simple, intimate space, naturally lit by high windows that completely circumscribe the vaulted ceiling.Peter Zumthor is a widely respected architect, largely due to his innovative designs in wood and his special attention to the unique needs and qualities of each place he builds. Born in Basel Switzerland, Zumthor began his career as an apprentice to a carpenter in 1958. In 1966, he studied industrial design and architecture at the Pratt Institute in New York and went on to become an architectural conservationist in Graubunden canton in his native Switzerland.Zumthor started his own firm in 1979, and he quickly made a name for himself because of his merging of a rustic style with Modernist design. The Saint Benedict Chapel in Sumvitg was among his earliest works. He went on to create other famous buildings such as the thermal baths in Vals, Switzerland, and the Kunsthaus Bregenz, a contemporary art gallery in Austria. In recognition of his architectural accomplishments, he won the Pritzker Prize in 2009. He also earned the 2013 Royal Gold Medal awarded by the Royal Institute of British Architects.The Saint Benedict Chapel in Sumvitg, Switzerland, has a long history spanning centuries. It gained worldwide recognition only after its destruction and subsequent reconstruction by renowned architect Peter Zumthor in the late 20th century. Today, the new chapel sits near the tumbled-down ruins of the old one. If you are interested in the history of religious architecture, check out the design of this chapel to further your education.The original Saint Benedict Chapel wasn't destroyed by the avalanche directly. In fact, the onrushing snow was deflected toward the old church by a parking lot that had recently been built into the hillside.

Is Buddha an incarnation of Lord Vishnu?
yes , according to MAHAYAAN, he was!!!!
BUDDHA AND INCARNATIONS OF VISHNU Vishnu symbolizes the semi voluntary force, the central of the seven forces human beings are e … ndowed with. This force causes sea wave like ups and downs in our life. Therefore, Vishnu is associated with water and he has the blue color of sea water.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BUDDHA AND OTHER INCARNATIONS OF VISHNU
Unlike other incarnations of Vishnu,
1. Buddha represents the entire semi voluntary force. Every incarnation of Vishnu is about some part of the semi voluntary force. Thus, Rama symbolizes the negative (satisfaction) attitude and Krishna, the positive (achievement) attitude of this force.
2. Buddha is a historical character, even though some Hindus claim that even Rama and Krishna are historical.
3. Buddha doesn't possess mighty power.
4. Buddha is not compatible with not only other Hindu gods but also with other incarnations of Vishnu.
Therefore, Buddha is not an incarnation of Vishnu.

What is the purpose of lord balaji incarnation?
Tirupati Balaji is a re-incarnation of Lord Vishnu in the Kali Yuga.
Sage Bhrugu, who according to Vedas is believed to have an extra eye in the sole of his foot, once visit … ed Vishnu. At that time, Vishnu was in a private meeting with his consort, goddess Lakshmi, and failed to immediately receive and honour the sage. The sage felt humiliated and angry, and kicked Lord Vishnu in the chest. Vishnu did not react and remained silent. Lord Vishnu's chest is believed to be the abode of Goddess Lakshmi. The Goddess felt highly insulted at the sage's misdemeanour and Lord Vishnu's silence at the act. She left Vaikunta, the heavenly abode of Vishnu and Lakshmi.
Lord Vishnu, in an attempt to pacify the sage, got hold of legs of the sage and started to press them gently in a way that was comforting to the sage. During this act, he squished the extra eye that was present in the sole of Bhrugu's foot. The extra eye is believed to represent the sage's egotism. The sage then realised his grave mistake and apologized to Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu had then incarnated Himself as Venkateshwara and came to earth in search of Lakshmi, who had taken birth as Princess Alamelu (Padmavati) in the household of Akasa Rajan. The princess's father agreed to give his daughter's hand in marriage to Venkateshwara if he provided proof of his wealth. Towards this end, Venkateshwara obtained a heavy loan from Kubera, a god (yaksha) who is considered, accordingly to Hindu mythology, as the treasurer of the virtuous wealth in the Universe. Princess Padmavati and Lord Venkateshwara were then wed.
Lord Vishnu, in the form of Venkateshwara, and his consort are believed to have enshrined themselves at Tirumala Tirupati for the benefit of mankind. This phenomenon is called swayambhu loosely translated to mean "self-existent and established on earth of one's own accord, without any external cause".
Lord Venkateshwara's temple is at the top of the seven hills in the place called Tirumala. The temple of the Lakshmi, in the form of Princess Padmavati, is located at the foot of the seven hills at Tirupati, in a town called Tiruchanur. Another legend that goes by is that of a boy called Bala. This boy was a helper boy, who was one day wrongly accused as a thief. He ran for his life when he was chased by people. He was hit on the head by the mob and his head was bleeding profusely. He ran to the Tirupathi temple of Lord Vishnu and ran to the main door where GOD is placed. When the people entered the temple they couldn't find the boy but saw the head of God's idol bleeding.It was considered that the boy was sheltered and protected by God himself and the priests put cloth on the idol's head to stop the bleeding. So we see white covering on the God's idol and the presiding God is called BALAJI.
His Avatara is all about the peace and loka kalyana in the kali Yuga. His Abhaya Hasta(Auspicious Hand Reassures the Devotees ) makes you get rid of all pains,agony and worries. His darshan in the sanctum sanctorum considered to be a life's inner meaning would show the eternal bliss peace and solitude.
Venkatadri Samam sthanam Bramhande nasti kinchana.
Venkatesa samo devo na bhootho na bhavishyati...
"There is no place as mighty as Tirumala/venkatadri in the whole world, and there is no God equal to Venkateshwara(Balaji) either in the past or future."
My understanding as per Annamacharya keertans is that Lord Balaji imbibed His divine power in the learned scholar and poet Shri Annamacharya to inculcate devotion and wipe out the caste differences prevalent in the midieval times. This has been portrayed quite aptly in the Telugu movie "Annamayya". Annamacharya contributed to nearly 32000 Kirtanas (poems/lyrics) that are still been practiced and sung in Tirumala temple and most parts of South India.

Philosophy and Philosophers
What is the philosophy of Dialectical Incarnation?
Dialectical Incarnation is a philosophy which identifies a unity found in the infinite and diverse particularities (both "spiritual" and "material") of the universe, i.e … . the totality of reality. This thesis is aimed at clarifying the understanding that seeming opposing concepts, such as spirit and matter, transcendent and immanent, divine and human, are distinct "conditions of the possibility"http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_philosophy_of_Dialectical_Incarnation&action=edit&section=new#_ftn1 but are never separate in actual reality.
Dialectical Incarnation has the direct intention of breaking down the dualism of the past by indicating that such separation is merely an illusion and that all reality can now be understood as a synthesis of bi-polar concepts. All of reality is a single dialectical entity, and this is incarnation.

http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_philosophy_of_Dialectical_Incarnation&action=edit&section=new#_ftnref1 "condition of the possibility" is the term Kant uses to clarify the use of categories in human knowledge. It was a great insight when he developed his dialectical philosophy. I will no longer put it in quotes in that it has become a fairly used philosophical phrase.
