Tabasco Sauce
-- Hot Pepper Sauce
Tabasco
is the brand name for a
hot pepper sauce
that is a well-known
table
condiment . It is made from
red peppers
( Capsicum frutescens ), vinegar, water, and salt, and aged in white oak
barrels. There are many other kinds of "hot pepper sauce" on the market, most
of them similar to Tabasco, but Tabasco is by far the most famous. Although it
is produced in Louisiana, it is named after the
Tabasco
River
and
Tabasco State
of
Mexico . The original variety measures
2,500 to 5,000 su on the
Scoville scale . There are
now five varieties. The garlic variety also includes the
Tabasco
pepper . It
has a hot, spicy flavor and is popular in many parts of the world: it is sold
in more than 110 countries and packaged in 19 different languages. More than 150
million bottles are sold each year, half of those in the
United
States . These range in size from the common two-ounce and five-ounce (60 and
150 mL) bottles available in most grocery stores, up to a one US gallon (4 L)
jug for food service businesses, and down to a miniature bottle (which rural Louisianians
often carry in their shirt pocket at lunch time, "just in case"). In
Japan
and parts of Ontario,
Canada , Tabasco sauce is popular
on
pizza . Also, in
parts of the southeastern US it is used to "spice up" pancakes. Tabasco
has been produced by the McIlhenny Company of
Avery Island ,
Louisiana , since
1868 , holding the second-oldest
U.S. food patent. Several new types of sauces are now produced under the name
Tabasco Sauce , including green pepper, chipotle, Habanero, and garlic sauces.
In addition, the company has cashed in on its brand name by licensing the production
of branded merchandise, including neckties, hand towels, golf shirts, posters
and
Bloody Mary
mix. The
peppers used are a spicy
cultivar
of
Capsicum
frutescens
and are grown on Avery Island. Another cultivar commonly called
the "Tabasco pepper" is grown there as well, which is used in the garlic variety
of the sauce. Tabasco
sauce has a
shelf life
of 5 years when
stored in a cool and dry place. External
