Pork Confit Hash at Cocotte in Portland

When I first saw the name of this restaurant, my mind scrambled it and the word,¬† coquette , came to mind ‚Äì suggestive, eyelash-batting flirting. But no, it‚Äôs
cocotte , which is French for (among other things) an individual casserole baking dish. Personally, the flirting is more apt because their libations and pork confit hash were flirting with me the entire time! French press coffee, Bloody Mary with candied bacon and an exquisite Pork Confit Hash ‚Äì ooh la la, monsieur!
Cocotte on NE 30th and NE Killingsworth
Also flirting with culinary nirvana were veterans from prior
hashcapades ,
Mary
and
Cory , plus two newbies,
Nick
and
Andy . As it turns out, Andy is an¬† √ºber accomplished globetrotter , inspiring our table to recount trips, dishes and misadventures while abroad ‚Äì gypsy pickpockets in Cologne, walking around
Edinburgh , and
Stroopwafel
from The Netherlands. And here we were in little old Portland, eagerly awaiting oeufs en cocotte (eggs in cocotte) and pork confit hash!
Extraordinary Bloody Mary - Bacon Accessorized!
But first, we have to talk about the
Bloody Mary . I was the only one at the table to order a breakfast cocktail. When it arrived, we collectively zeroed in on the candied bacon that shamelessly caused us to ogle the amazing presentation. Honestly, the drink could have been colored blue with prickly pear cactus and it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered ‚Äì seriously!! Coincidentally, the rest of the crew ordered a side of the brown sugar¬† bacon ¬†with their entr√©es.
Cocotte's stellar Pork Confit Hash
When the pork confit hash arrived, Cocotte‚Äôs presentation was simply stunning ‚Äì pork confit,
rainbow chard stems , mustard, roasted brussels sprouts,
cr√®me fra√Æche , and a¬†sunny-side¬†egg. Are you kidding me? Hovering over the food, I stole a glance at my compatriots who were equally enthralled with their selections and proceeded to dig in. Impressive. Sublime. I could go on, but this was truly one of the best potato hashes I‚Äôve ever had! Who knew brussels sprouts could complement a potato hash so well ‚Äì great texture and slightly sweet counterpoint to the softer chard and roasted potatoes. Tr√®s bon!
Sated tweeps outside Cocotte
We could have easily spent another hour talking about food, travel and social media, but the cozy restaurant was bursting at the seams. We had to let Cocotte flirt with new patrons and lure them with candied bacon and libations ‚Äì sant√©!
Happy Hashcapades,
Clark

Everything looks amazing!
I must note, though, that prickly pear is honestly one of my favorite flavors. It‚Äôs sweet but also citrusy. Really quite tasty!

Thank you, Sarah!
Funny how I picked that randomly because of the sound of the words, without knowing the flavor ‚Äì doh!
So, we must create a prickly pear hash (wild boar) is optionals üòâ
