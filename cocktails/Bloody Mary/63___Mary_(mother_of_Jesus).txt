Andalusia
( / ˌ æ n d ə ˈ l uː s i ə ˌ
- z i ə ˌ
- ʒ ⁱ ə / ,
Spanish :
Andalucía
Spanish pronunciation:  [andaluˈθi.a] ,
Spanish pronunciation:  [andaluˈsi.a] , in Arabic: الأندلس) is a south-western European region established as an
autonomous community
of the
Kingdom of Spain . It is the most populated and the second largest in area of the autonomous communities in Spain. The Andalusian autonomous community is officially recognized as a
nationality of Spain . [ 4 ]
The territory is divided into eight
provinces :
Almería ,
Cádiz ,
Córdoba ,
Granada ,
Huelva ,
Jaén ,
Málaga
and
Seville . Its capital is the city of
Seville
(Spanish:
Sevilla ).
Andalusia is in the south of the
Iberian peninsula , immediately south of the autonomous communities of
Extremadura
and
Castile–La Mancha ; west of the autonomous community of
Murcia
and the
Mediterranean Sea ; east of
Portugal
and the
Atlantic Ocean ; and north of the
Mediterranean Sea
and the
Strait of Gibraltar . Andalusia is the only European region with both Mediterranean and Atlantic coastlines. The small
British overseas territory
of
Gibraltar
shares a three-quarter-mile land border with the Andalusian
province of Cádiz
at the eastern end of the Strait of Gibraltar.
The main mountain ranges of Andalusia are the
Sierra Morena
and the
Baetic System , consisting of the
Subbaetic
and
Penibaetic
Mountains, separated by the
Intrabaetic Basin . In the north, the Sierra Morena separates Andalusia from the plains of Extremadura and Castile–La Mancha on Spain's
Meseta Central . To the south the geographic subregion of Upper Andalusia lies mostly within the
Baetic System , while Lower Andalusia is in the
Baetic Depression
of the valley of the
Guadalquivir . [ 5 ]
The name "Andalusia" is derived from the
Arabic
word
Al-Andalus
(الأندلس) and this term derives in turn from an older word: Vandalusia or land of the
Vandals . [ 6 ]
As well as
Muslim
and
Romani
influences, the region's history and culture have been influenced by the earlier
Iberians ,
Carthaginians/Phoenicians ,
Greeks ,
Romans , Vandals,
Visigoths ,
Byzantines , all of whom preceded the Muslims, as well as the
Castilian
and other
Christian
North Iberian nationalities who regained and repopulated the area in the latter phases of the
Reconquista .
Andalusia has been a traditionally agricultural region, compared to the rest of Spain and the rest of Europe. However, the growth of the community especially in the sectors of industry and services was above average in Spain and higher than many communities in the eurozone. The region has, however, a rich culture and a strong cultural identity. Many cultural phenomena that are seen internationally as distinctively Spanish are largely or entirely Andalusian in origin. These include
flamenco ,
bullfighting , and certain
Moorish-influenced
architectural styles .
Andalusia's interior is the hottest area of Europe, with cities like
Córdoba
and
Seville
averaging above 36 °C (97 °F) in summer high temperatures. Late evening temperatures can sometimes stay around 35 °C (95 °F) up close to midnight, with daytime highs of over 40 °C (104 °F) common. Seville also has the highest average annual temperature in mainland Spain (19.2 degrees Celsius). [1]

The name
Andalucía
or
Andalusia
Map of the
Iberian peninsula
dated 1770. The Kingdoms of
Jaén ,
Córdoba
and
Seville
are collectively referred to under the name
Andalucía , while the
Kingdom of Granada
appears under its individual name.
Although its present form is certainly derived from the Arabic, [ 7 ]
the
etymology
of the name "Andalusia" is disputed, [ 8 ]
and the extent of Iberian territory encompassed by the name has changed over the centuries. [ 9 ]
In the form of
Vandalusia , it was traditionally believed to be derived from the name of the Germanic tribe, the
Vandals , [ 10 ]
that briefly colonized parts of Iberia from AD 409 to AD 429. This proposal is sometimes associated with the 19th-century historian
Reinhart Dozy , but it predates him and he recognized some of its shortcomings. Although he accepted that
Al-Andalus
derived from
Vandal , [ 6 ]
he believed that geographically it referred only to the harbor from which the Vandals departed Iberia for (North) Africa—the location of which harbour was unknown. [ 11 ]
The Spanish toponym (place name)
Andalucía
(immediate source of the English
Andalusia ) was introduced into the
Spanish languages
in the 13th century AD under the form
el Andalucía . [ 12 ]
The name was adopted to refer those territories still under the Moorish rule until then, and generally south of
Castilla Nueva
and
Valencia , and corresponding with the former Roman province hitherto called
Baetica
in Latin sources. This was a Castilianization of
Al-Andalusiya , the
adjectival
form of the Arabic language
al-Andalus , the name given by the Arabs to all of the Iberian territories under Muslim rule from 711 to 1492. The etymology of
al-Andalus
is itself somewhat debated (see
al-Andalus ), but it entered the Arabic language even before such time as this area came under Muslim rule.
Like the Arabic term
al-Andalus , in historical contexts the Spanish term
Andalucía
or the English term
Andalusia
do not necessarily refer to the exact territory designated by these terms today. Initially, the term referred exclusively to territories under Muslim control; later, it was applied to some of the last Iberian territories to be regained from the Muslims, though not always to exactly the same ones. [ 13 ]
In the
Estoria de España
(also known as the
Primera Crónica General ) of
Alfonso X of Castile , written in the second half of the 13th century, the term
Andalucía
is used with three different meanings:
As a literal translation of the Arabic
al-Ándalus
when Arabic texts are quoted.
To designate the territories the Christians had regained by that time in the
Guadalquivir
valley and in the Kingdoms of
Granada
and
Murcia . In a document from 1253, Alfonso X styled himself
Rey de Castilla, León y de toda Andalucía
("King of Castile, León and all of Andalusia").
To designate the territories the Christians had regained by that time in the Guadalquivir valley (the Kingdoms of
Jaén ,
Córdoba
and
Seville ) but
not
the Kingdom of Granada. This was the most common significance in the
Late Middle Ages
and
Early modern period . [ 14 ]
From an administrative point of view, Granada remained separate for many years even after the completion of the
Reconquista [ 14 ]
due, above all, to its emblematic character as the last territory regained, and as the seat of the important
Real Chancillería de Granada , a
court of last resort . Still, the reconquest and repopulation of Granada was accomplished largely by people from the four existing Christian kingdoms of Andalusia, and Granada came to be considered a fourth kingdom of Andalusia. [ 15 ]
The often-used expression " Four Kingdoms of Andalusia " dates back in Spanish at least to the mid-18th century. [ 16 ] [ 17 ]

named in his honor.
The Andalusian coat of arms shows the figure of
Hercules
and two
lions
between the two
pillars of Hercules
that tradition situates on either side of the Strait of Gibraltar. An inscription below, superimposed on an image of the
flag of Andalusia
reads
Andalucía por sí, para España y la Humanidad
("Andalusia by herself, for Spain and Humanity"). Over the two columns is a semicircular arch in the colors of the flag of Andalusia, with the
Latin
words
Dominator Hercules Fundator
superimposed. [ 1 ]
The official flag of Andalusia consists of three equal horizontal stripes, colored green, white, and green respectively; [ 18 ]
the Andalusian coat of arms is superimposed on the central stripe. Its design was overseen by
Blas Infante [ 19 ]
and approved in the
Assembly of Ronda
(a 1918 gathering of
Andalusian nationalists
at
Ronda ). The green symbolizes hope and union, and the white symbolizes peace and dialogue. Blas Infante considered these to have been the colors most used in regional symbols throughout the region's history. According to him, the green came in particular from the
standard
of the
Umayyad Caliphate
and represented the call for a gathering of the populace. The white symbolized pardon in the
Almohad dynasty , interpreted in European heraldry as parliament or peace. Other writers have justified the colors differently, with some Andalusian nationalists referring to them as the
Arbonaida , meaning white-and-green in
Mozarabic , a
Romance language
that was spoken in the region in Muslim times.

An instrumental version of the Andalusian anthem.
The
anthem
of Andalusia was composed by José del Castillo Díaz (director of the Municipal Band of Seville, commonly known as Maestro Castillo) with lyrics by Blas Infante. [ 19 ]
The music was inspired by
Santo Dios , a popular religious song sung at harvest time by peasants and day laborers in the provinces of Málaga, Seville, and Huelva. Blas Infante brought the song to Maestro Castillo's attention; Maestro Castillo adapted and harmonized the traditional melody. The lyrics appeal to the Andalusians to mobilize and demand
tierra y libertad
("land and liberty") by way of
agrarian reform
and a statute of autonomy within Spain.
The
Parliament of Andalusia
voted unanimously in 1983 that the preamble to the
Statute of Autonomy
recognize Blas Infante as the Father of the Andalusian Nation ( Padre de la Patria Andaluza ), [ 20 ]
which was reaffirmed in the reformed Statute of Autonomy submitted to popular
referendum
18 February 2007. The preamble of the present 2007 Statute of Autonomy says that Article 2 of the present
Spanish Constitution of 1978
recognizes Andalusia as a
nationality . Later, in its articulation, it speaks of Andalusia as a "historic nationality" (Spanish:
nacionalidad histórica ). It also cites the 1919 Andalusianist Manifesto of Córdoba describing Andalusia as a " national reality " ( realidad nacional ), but does not endorse that formulation. Article 1 of the earlier 1981 Statute of Autonomy defined it simply as a "nationality" ( nacionalidad ). [ 21 ]
The national holiday, the
Día de Andalucía , is celebrated on 28 February, [ 22 ]
commemorating the 1980 autonomy referendum. In spite of this, nationalist groups celebrate the holiday on 4 December, commemorating the 1977 demonstrations to demand autonomy.
The honorific title of
Hijo Predilecto de Andalucía
("Favorite Son of Andalucia") is granted by the Regional Government of Andalusia to those whose exceptional merits benefited Andalusia, for work or achievements in natural, social, or political science. It is the highest distinction given by the Autonomous Community of Andalusia.
Geography
The Sevillian historian
Antonio Domínguez Ortiz
wrote that:
...one must seek the essence of Andalusia in its geographic reality on the one hand, and on the other in the awareness of its inhabitants. From the geographic point of view, the whole of the southern lands is too vast and varied to be embraced as a single unit. In reality there are not two, but three Andalusias: the
Sierra Morena , the Valley [of the
Guadalquivir ] and the [Cordillera]
Penibética ... [ 23 ]
Location
Andalusia has a surface area of 87,597 square kilometres (33,821 sq mi), 17.3 percent of the territory of Spain. Andalusia alone is comparable in extent and in the variety of its terrain to any of several of the smaller European countries. To the east is the
Mediterranean Sea ; to the west the
Atlantic Ocean ; to the north the
Sierra Morena
constitutes the border with the
Meseta Central ; to the south, the
self-governing [ 24 ]
British overseas territory
of
Gibraltar
and the
Strait of Gibraltar
separate it from
Africa .
Climate
Locations of the principal Andalusian climate types. [ 25 ]
Andalusian firs,
Sierra de las Nieves
Andalusia sits at a latitude between 36° and 38° 44' N, in the warm-temperate region. In general, it experiences a
Mediterranean climate , with dry summers influenced by the
Azores High , but subject to occasional torrential rains and extremely hot temperatures. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]
In the winter, the tropical anticyclones move south, allowing cold polar fronts to penetrate the region. Still, within Andalusia there is considerable climatic variety. From the extensive coastal plains one may pass to the valley of the Guadalquivir, barely above sea level, then to the highest altitudes in the Iberian peninsula in the peaks of the
Sierra Nevada . In a mere 50 km (31 mi) one can pass from the subtropical coast of the province of Granada to the snowy peaks of
Mulhacén . Andalusia also includes both the dry
Tabernas Desert
in the province of Almería and the
Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park
in the province of Cádiz, which experiences Spain's greatest rainfall. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]
Annual rainfall in the Sierra de Grazalema has been measured as high as 4,346 millimetres (171.1 in) in 1963, the highest ever recorded for any location in Iberia. [ 31 ]
Andalusia is also home to the driest place in continental Europe, the
Cabo de Gata , with only 117 millimetres (4.6 in) of rain per year.
In general, as one goes from west to east, away from the Atlantic, there is less precipitation. [ 31 ]
"Wet Andalusia" includes most of the highest points in the region, above all the Sierra de Grazalema but also the
Serranía de Ronda
in western Málaga. The valley of the Guadalquivir has moderate rainfall. The
Tabernas Desert
in Almería, Europe's only true desert, has less than 75 days with any measurable precipitation, and some particular places in the desert have as few as 50 such days. Much of "dry Andalusia" has more than 300 "sunny" days a year.
The average temperature in Andalusia throughout the year is over 16 °C (61 °F). Averages in the cities range from 15.1 °C (59.2 °F) in
Baeza
to 19.1 °C (66.4 °F) in
Almería . [ 32 ]
Much of the Guadalquivir valley and the Mediterranean coast has an average of about 18 °C (64 °F). The coldest month is January when
Granada
at the foot of the Sierra Nevada experiences an average temperature of 6.4 °C (43.5 °F). The hottest are July and August, with an average temperature of 28.5 °C (83.3 °F) for Andalusia as a whole.
Córdoba
is the hottest provincial capital, followed by
Seville . [ 33 ]
The Guadalquivir valley has experienced the highest temperatures recorded in Europe, with a maximum of 46.6 °C (115.9 °F) recorded at Córdoba and Seville. [ 34 ]
The mountains of Granada and Jaén have the coldest temperatures in southern Iberia, but do not reach continental extremes (and, indeed are surpassed by some mountains in northern Spain). In the cold snap of January 2005,
Santiago de la Espada
(Jaén) experienced a temperature of −21 °C (−6 °F) and the
ski
resort at
Sierra Nevada National Park —the southernmost ski resort in Europe—dropped to −18 °C (0 °F). Sierra Nevada Natural Park has Iberia's lowest average annual temperature, (3.9 °C or 39.0 °F at Pradollano) and its peaks remain snowy practically year-round.

Terrain
Locations of the principal features of the Andalusian terrain.
Mulhacen peak, north face
Mountain ranges affect climate, the network of rivers, soils and their erosion, bioregions, and even human economies insofar as they rely on natural resources. [ 36 ]
The Andalusian terrain offers a range of altitudes and slopes. Andalusia has the Iberian peninsula's highest mountains and nearly 15 percent of its terrain over 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The picture is similar for areas under 100 metres (330 ft) (with the Baetic Depression), and for the variety of slopes.
The Atlantic coast is overwhelmingly beach and gradually sloping coasts; the Mediterranean coast has many cliffs, above all in the Malagan
Axarquía
and in Granada and Almería. [ 37 ]
This asymmetry divides the region naturally into Upper Andalusia (two mountainous areas) and Lower Andalusia (the broad basin of the Guadalquivir). [ 38 ]
The
Sierra Morena
separates Andalusia from the plains of Extremadura and Castile–La Mancha on Spain's
Meseta Central . Although sparsely populated, this is not a particularly high range, and its highest point, the 1,323-metre (4,341 ft) peak of La
Bañuela
in the
Sierra Madrona , lies outside of Andalusia. Within the Sierra Morena, the
gorge
of
Despeñaperros
forms a natural frontier between Castile and Andalusia.
The
Baetic Cordillera
consists of the parallel mountain ranges of the
Cordillera Penibética
near the Mediterranean coast and the
Cordillera Subbética
inland, separated by the
Surco Intrabético . The Cordillera Subbética is quite discontinuous, offering many passes that facilitate transportation, but the Penibético forms a strong barrier between the Mediterranean coast and the interior. [ 39 ]
The Sierra Nevada, part of the Cordillera Penibética in the Province of Granada, has the highest peaks in Iberia: El
Mulhacén
at 3,478 metres (11,411 ft) and El
Veleta
at 3,392 metres (11,129 ft).
Lower Andalusia, the
Baetic Depression , the basin of the Guadalquivir, lies between these two mountainous areas. It is a nearly flat territory, open to the
Gulf of Cádiz
in the southeast. Throughout history, this has been the most populous part of Andalusia.
Hydrography
Rivers and basins of Andalusia.
Andalusia has rivers that flow into both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Flowing to the Atlantic are the
Guadiana ,
Odiel - Tinto ,
Guadalquivir ,
Guadalete , and
Barbate . Flowing to the Mediterranean are the
Guadiaro ,
Guadalhorce ,
Guadalmedina ,
Guadalfeo ,
Andarax
(also known as the Almería) and
Almanzora . Of these, the
Guadalquivir
is the longest in Andalusia and fifth longest on the Iberian peninsula, at 657 kilometres (408 mi). [ 40 ]
The Guadalquivir as it passes through Córdoba.
The rivers of the Atlantic basin are characteristically long, run through mostly flat terrain, and have broad river valleys. As a result, at their mouths are
estuaries
and
wetlands , such as the marshes of
Doñana
in the delta of the Guadalquivir, and
wetlands
of the Odiel. In contrast, the rivers of the Mediterranean Basin are shorter, more seasonal, and make a precipitous descent from the mountains of the Baetic Cordillera. Their estuaries are small, and their valleys are less suitable for agriculture. Also, being in the
rain shadow
of the Baetic Cordillera means that they receive a lesser volume of water. [ 38 ]
The following hydrographic basins can be distinguished in Andalusia. On the Atlantic side are the Guadalquivir basin; the
Andalusian Atlantic Basin
with the sub-basins Guadalete-Barbate and Tinto-Odiel; and the Guadiana basin. On the Mediterranean side is the
Andalusian Mediterranean Basin
and the very upper portion of the basin of the
Segura . [ 41 ]
Soils
The soils of Andalusia can be divided into three large areas: the
Sierra Morena ,
Cordillera Subbética , and the
Baetic Depression
and the
Surco Intrabético . [ 42 ]
The Sierra Morena, due to its morphology and the acidic content of its rocks, developed principally relatively poor, shallow soils, suitable only for forests. In the valleys and in some areas where
limestone
is present, deeper soils allowed farming of cereals suitable for livestock. The more complicated morphology of the Baetic Cordillera makes it more heterogeneous, with the most heterogeneous soils in Andalusia. Very roughly, in contrast to the Sierra Morena, a predominance of
basic
(alkaline) materials in the Cordillera Subbética, combined with a hilly landscape, generates deeper soils with greater agricultural capacity, suitable to the cultivation of olives. [ 43 ]
Finally, the Baetic Depression and the Surco Intrabético have deep, rich soils, with great agricultural capacity. In particular, the
alluvial
soils of the
Guadalquivir
valley and plain of
Granada
have a
loamy
texture and are particularly suitable for intensive irrigated crops. [ 44 ]
In the hilly areas of the countryside, there is a double dynamic: the depressions have filled with older lime-rich material, developing the deep, rich, dark
clay
soils the Spanish call
bujeo , or
tierras negras andaluzas , excellent for dryland farming. In other zones, the whiter
albariza
provides an excellent soil for
vineyards . [ 45 ]
Despite their marginal quality, the poorly consolidated soils of the sandy coastline of Huelva and Almería have been successfully used in recent decades for hothouse cultivation under clear plastic of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and other fruits.
Flora
Floristic provinces
of Andalusia
Biogeographically, Andalusia forms part of the Western Mediterranean subregion of the
Mediterranean Basin , which falls within the
Boreal Kingdom . Five
floristic provinces
lie, in whole or in part, within Andalusia: along much of the Atlantic coast, the Lusitanian-Andalusian littoral or Andalusian Atlantic littoral; in the north, the southern portion of the Luso-Extremaduran floristic province; covering roughly half of the region, the Baetic floristic province; and in the extreme east, the Almerian portion of the Almerian-Murcian floristic province and (coinciding roughly with the upper Segura basin) a small portion of the Castilian-Maestrazgan-Manchegan floristic province. These names derive primarily from past or present political geography: "Luso" and "Lusitanian" from
Lusitania , one of three
Roman provinces
in Iberia, most of the others from present-day Spanish provinces, and
Maestrazgo
being a historical region of northern
Valencia .
Oaks, rhododendrons and ferns in the
Los Alcornocales Natural Park .
In broad terms, the typical vegetation of Andalusia is
Mediterranean woodland , characterized by
leafy
xerophilic
perennials , adapted to the long, dry summers. The dominant species of the
climax community
is the Holly Oak ( Quercus ilex ). Also abundant are Cork Oak ( Quercus suber ), various
pines , and Spanish Fir ( Abies pinsapo ). Due to cultivation,
olive
( Olea europaea ) and
almond
( Prunus dulcis ) trees also abound. The dominant
understory
is composed of thorny and aromatic woody species, such as
Rosemary
( Rosmarinus officinalis ),
Thyme
( Thymus ), and
Cistus . In the wettest areas with
acidic soils , the most abundant species are the Oak and Cork Oak, and the cultivated
Eucalyptus . In the woodlands, leafy
hardwoods
of genus
Populus
(poplars, aspens, cottonwoods) and
Ulmus
(elms) are also abundant; poplars are cultivated in the plains of Granada. [ 46 ]
The Andalusian woodlands have been much altered by human settlement, the use of nearly all of the best land for farming, and frequent
wildfires . The degraded forests become shrubby and combustible
garrigue . Extensive areas have been planted with non- climax
trees such as pines. There is now a clear conservation policy for the remaining forests, which survive almost exclusively in the mountains.
Fauna
The
Iberian Lynx
( Lynx pardinus )
The
biodiversity
of Andalusia extends to its fauna as well. More than 400 of the 630 vertebrate species extant in Spain can be found in Andalusia. Spanning the Mediterranean and Atlantic basins, and adjacent to the Strait of Gibraltar, Andalusia is on the migratory route of many of the numerous flocks of birds that travel annually from Europe to Africa and back. [ 47 ]
The Andalusian wetlands host a rich variety of birds. Some are of African origin, such as the
red-knobbed coot
( Fulica cristata ), the
purple swamphen
( Porphyrio porphyrio ), and the
greater flamingo
( Phoenicopterus roseus ). Others originate in Northern Europe, such as the
greylag goose
( Anser anser ).
Birds of prey
(raptors) include the
Spanish imperial eagle
( Aquila adalberti ), the
griffon vulture
( Gyps fulvus ), and both the
black
and
red kite
( Milvus migrans
and
Milvus milvus ).
Andalusian horse
Among the
herbivores , are several
deer
(Cervidae) species, notably the
fallow deer
( Dama dama ) and
roe deer
( Capreolus capreolus ); the
European mouflon
( Ovis orientalis musimon ), a type of sheep; and the
Spanish ibex
( Capra pyrenaica , which despite its scientific name is no longer found in the
Pyrenees ). The Spanish ibex has recently been losing ground to the
Barbary sheep
( Ammotragus lervia ), an
invasive species
from Africa, introduced for hunting in the 1970s. Among the small herbivores are rabbits—especially the
European rabbit
( Oryctolagus cuniculus )—which form the most important part of the diet of the carnivorous species of the Mediterranean woodlands.
The large
carnivores
such as the
Iberian wolf
( Canis lupus signatus ) and the
Iberian lynx
( Lynx pardinus ) are quite threatened, and are limited to the Sierra de Andújar, inside of Sierra Morena, Doñana and Despeñaperros. Stocks of the
wild boar
( Sus scrofa ), on the other hand, have been well preserved because they are popular with hunters. More abundant and in varied situations of conservation are such smaller carnivores as
otters , dogs, foxes, the
European badger
( Meles meles ), the
European polecat
( Mustela putorius ), the
least weasel
( Mustela nivalis ), the
wildcat
( Felis silvestris ), the
common genet
( Genetta genetta ), and the
Egyptian mongoose
( Herpestes ichneumon) . [ 48 ]
Other notable species are
Acherontia atropos
(a variety of
death's-head hawkmoth ),
Vipera latasti
(a
venomous snake ), and the endemic (and endangered) fish
Aphanius baeticus .
Protected areas
Nationals
and
natural parks
in Andalusia.
Andalusia has many unique ecosystems. In order to preserve these areas in a manner compatible with both conservation and economic exploitation, many of the most representative ecosystems have been given protected status. [ 49 ] [ 50 ]
The various levels of protection are encompassed within the Network of Protected Natural Spaces of Andalusia (Red de Espacios Naturales Protegidos de Andalucía, RENPA) which integrates all protected natural spaces located in Andalusia, whether they are protected at the level of the local community, the autonomous community of Andalusia, the Spanish state, or by international conventions. RENPA consists of 150 protected spaces, consisting of two
national parks , 24
natural parks , 21 periurban parks (on the fringes of cities or towns), 32 natural sites, two protected countrysides, 37 natural monuments, 28 nature reserves, and four concerted nature reserves (in which a government agency coordinates with the owner of the property for its management), all part of the European Union's
Natura 2000
network. Under the international ambit are the nine
Biosphere Reserves , 20
Ramsar
wetland sites, four
Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance
and two
UNESCO
Geoparks . [ 51 ]
In total, nearly 20 percent of the territory of Andalusia lies in one of these protected areas, which constitute roughly 30 percent of the protected territory of Spain. [ 51 ]
Among these many spaces, some of the most notable are the
Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park , Spain's largest natural park and the second largest in Europe, the
Sierra Nevada National Park ,
Doñana National Park and Natural Park , the
Tabernas Desert , and the
Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park , the largest terrestrial-maritime reserve in the European Western Mediterranean Sea.
History
Lady of Baza , ancient
Iberian
sculpture. Origin:
Baza . In the
National Archaeological Museum of Spain , Madrid.
The geostrategic position of Andalusia in the extreme south of
Europe , providing (along with
Morocco ) a gateway between Europe and Africa, added to its position between the
Atlantic Ocean
and the
Mediterranean Sea , as well as its rich deposits of minerals and its agricultural wealth, have made Andalusia a tempting prize for civilizations since prehistoric times. Add to this its area of 87,268 square kilometres (33,694 sq mi) (larger than many European countries), and it can be no surprise that Andalusia has figured prominently in the history of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Several theories postulate that the first
hominids
in Europe were in Andalusia, having passed across the Strait of
Gibraltar ; the earliest known paintings of humanity have been found in the
Caves of Nerja ,
Málaga . The first settlers, based on artifacts from the archaeological sites at
Los Millares ,
El Argar , and
Tartessos , were clearly influenced by cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean who arrived on the Andalusian coast. Andalusia then went through a period of
protohistory , when the region did not have a written language of its own, but its existence was known to and documented by literate cultures, principally the
Phoenicians
(Gadir, Malaka) and
Ancient Greeks . During the second millennium BCE, the kingdom of
Tartessos
developed in Andalusia. [ 19 ]
Carthaginians and Romans

With the fall of the
Phoenician
cities,
Carthage
became the dominant sea power of the western Mediterranean and the most important trading partner for the Phoenician towns along the Andalusian coast. Between the
First
and
Second Punic Wars , Carthage extended its control beyond Andalucia to include all of Iberia except the Basque Country. Andalusia was the major staging ground for the war with Rome led by the
Hannibal
Barca. The Romans defeated the Carthaginians and conquered Andalusia, the region being renamed
Baetica . [ 19 ]
It was fully incorporated into the
Roman Empire , and from this region came many Roman magistrates and senators, as well as the emperors
Trajan
and (most likely)
Hadrian .
Vandals, Visigoths and the Byzantine Empire
The Vandals moved briefly through the region during the 5th century AD before settling in North Africa, after which the region fell into the hands of the
Visigothic Kingdom . The
Visigoths
in this region were practically independent of the
Visigothic Catholic Kingdom of Toledo . This is the era of Saints
Isidore of Seville
and
Hermenegild . During this period, around 555 AD, the
Eastern Roman Empire
conquered Andalusia under
Justinian I , the
Eastern Roman Emperor . They established
Spania , a province of the
Byzantine Empire
from 552 until 624. Though their holdings were quickly reduced, they continued to have interests in the region until it was lost altogether in 624.

Timeline of the Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula
The
Caliphate of Córdoba
c. 1000, at the apogee of Almanzor's rule
The Visigothic era came to an abrupt end in 711 with the
Umayyad conquest of Hispania
by the
Umayyad
general
Tariq ibn Ziyad , an
Islamic
Berber . [ 19 ]
Tariq is known in Spanish history and legend as a formidable conqueror who dared and bore the nerve to burn his fleet of ships, when he landed with his troops on the coast of Gibraltar - an acronym of "Jabel alTariq" meaning "the mountain of Tariq". The
Muslim conquest —by the
Umayyad Caliphate —of the
Iberian Peninsula
in 711–718 marked the collapse of Visigothic rule and the establishment of the Islamic Empire era. Andalusian culture was fundamentally influenced by over half a millennium of rule by many
Muslim
caliphates
and
emirates . In this period, the name " Al-Andalus " was applied to a much larger area than the present Andalusia, and in some periods it referred to nearly the entire Iberian peninsula.
Nevertheless, the
Guadalquivir
River valley in present-day Andalusia was the hub of Muslim power in the peninsula, with the
Caliphate of Córdoba
making
Córdoba
its capital. The Umayyad Caliphate produced such illustrious leaders as Caliph
Abd-ar-Rahman III
(ruled 912–961) and his son, Caliph
Al-Hakam II
(ruled 961–976); and built the magnificent
Great Mosque of Córdoba . Under these rulers,
Moorish
Islam in Spain reached its zenith, and Córdoba was a centre of global economic and cultural significance. [ 52 ]
Great Mosque of Córdoba
Already in the 10th century, the Christians of northern Spain had begun what would eventually become the
Reconquista : the reconquest of Spain for Christendom. Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman suffered some minor military defeats, but often managed to play off the Christian kingdoms. Al-Hakam's death achieved military successes, but at the expense of uniting the Christian kings of the north against him.
Biggest and best conserved
Moorish

Internal divisions after the death of
Almanzor
(1002) led to the first of several decompositions of the Caliphate (1031). New centers of power arose, each ruling a
taifa
(and often with multiple levels of nominal fealty and relative independence, according to the patterns of
feudalism ). The
taifa
of Seville was especially influential, but the
Emirate of Granada
was the last to survive, lasting from 1228 until 1492.
After the conquest of Toledo in 1086 by
Alfonso VI , Christian rule dominated the peninsula. The main
Taifas
therefore had to resort to assistance from various Muslim powers across the Mediterranean. A number of different Muslim dynasties of North African origin—notably
Almoravid dynasty
and
Almohad dynasty —dominated a slowly diminishing Al-Andalus over the next several centuries. [ 53 ]
After the Muslim victory at the
Battle of Sagrajas
(1086) put a temporary stop to Christian expansion, the
Almoravid dynasty
constructed a unified Al-Andalus with its capital in Granada, ruling until the mid-12th century. The various
Taifa
kingdoms were assimilated. the
Almohad dynasty
expansion in North Africa weakened Al-Andalus, and in 1170 the Almohads transferred their capital from
Marrakesh
to
Seville . The Christian victory at the
Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa
(1212) marked the beginning of the end of the Almohad dynasty.
Kingdom of Castile
The weakness caused by the collapse of Almohad power and the subsequent creation of new
Taifas , each with its own ruler, led to the rapid Christian reconquest of the valley of the Guadalquivir. Córdoba was regained in 1236 and Seville in 1248. The
fall of Granada
in 1492 put an end to Muslim rule in the Iberian peninsula. [ 54 ]

On 3 August 1492
Christopher Columbus
left the town of
Palos de la Frontera , with the first expedition that resulted in the
Europeans learning of the existence of America . [ 55 ]
Many Andalusians participated in the expedition that would end the Middle Ages and signal the beginning of modernity. Contacts between Spain and the
Americas , including royal administration and the shipping trade of
Spanish colonies
for over three hundred years, came almost exclusively through Andalusia. [ 56 ]
As a result, the region became the wealthiest and most influential in Spain and one of the most influential in Europe. However,
Habsburg
ambitions elsewhere in Europe diverted much of the colonial wealth to war. Discontent with this situation culminated in 1641, when the Andalusian nobility staged an unsuccessful
conspiracy to gain independence
in 1641 from the provincial government of the
Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares .
Modern era
In the first half of the 16th century
plague
was still prevalent in Spain. According to George C. Kohn, "One of the worst epidemics of the century, whose miseries were accompanied by severe drought and food shortage, started in 1505; by 1507, about 100,000 people had died in Andalusia alone... Andalusia was struck once again in 1646. For three years,
plague
haunted the entire region, causing perhaps as many as 200,000 deaths, especially in Málaga and Seville." [ 57 ]
Following the
Second Rebellion of the Alpujarras
in 1568-1571, the Moorish population—that is, unconverted
Moriscos —were expelled from
Kingdom of Castile
(and
Aragon ). However, by order of the
Spanish crown , two Moorish families were required to remain in each village in order to demonstrate to the new inhabitants, introduced from northern Spain, the workings of the
terracing
and irrigation systems on which the district's agriculture depends. [ citation needed ]
In 1810-12 the people strongly resisted the French occupation during the
Peninsular War
(part of the Napoleonic Wars). [ 58 ]
Andalusia profited from the Spanish overseas empire, although much trade and finance eventually came to be controlled by other parts of Europe to where it was ultimately destined. In the 18th century, commerce from other parts of Spain began to displace Andalusian commerce when the Spanish government ended Andalusia's trading monopoly with the American colonies. The loss of the empire in the 1820s hurt the economy of the region, particularly the cities that had benefited from the trade and ship building. The construction of railways in the latter part of the 19th century enabled Andalusia to better develop its agricultural potential and it became an exporter of food. While industrialisation was taking off in the northern Spanish regions of Catalonia and the Basque country, Andalusia remained traditional and displayed a deep social division between a small class of wealthy landowners and a population made up largely of poor agricultural labourers and tradesmen.

Government and politics
The
Palace of San Telmo
is the residence of the Andalusian Parliament
Andalusia is one of the 17
autonomous communities of Spain . The
Regional Government of Andalusia
(Spanish:
Junta de Andalucía ) includes the
Parliament of Andalusia ,
its chosen president , a Consultative Council, and other bodies.
The Autonomous Community of Andalusia was formed in accord with a referendum of 28 February 1980 [ 59 ]
and became an autonomous community under the 1981 Statute of Automony known as the
Estatuto de Carmona . The process followed the
Spanish Constitution of 1978 , still current as of 2009, which recognizes and guarantees the right of automony for the various regions and nationalities of Spain. The process to establish Andalusia as an autonomous region followed Article 151 of the Constitution, making Andalusia the only autonomous community to take that particular course. That article was set out for regions like Andalusia that had been prevented by the outbreak of the
Spanish Civil War
from adopting a statute of autonomy during the period of the
Second Spanish Republic .
Article 1 of the 1981 Statute of Autonomy justifies autonomy based on the region's "historical identity, on the self-government that the Constitution permits every nationality, on outright equality to the rest of the nationalities and regions that compose Spain, and with a power that emanates from the Andalusian Constitution and people, reflected in its Statute of Autonomy". [ 60 ]
In October 2006 the constitutional commission of the
Cortes Generales
(the national legislature of Spain), with favorable votes from the left-of-center
Spanish Socialist Workers' Party
(PSOE), the leftist
United Left
(IU) and the right-of-center
People`s Party
(PP), approved a new Statute of Autonomy for Andalusia, whose preamble refers to the community as a " national reality " ( realidad nacional ):
The Andalusianist Manifesto of Córdoba described Andalusia as a national reality in 1919, whose spirit the Andalusians took up outright through the process of self-government recognized in our Magna Carta. In 1978 the Andalusians broadly backed the constitutional consensus. Today, the Constitution, in its Article 2, recognizes Andalusia as a nationality as part of the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation. [ 21 ]
—  Andalusian Statute of Autonomy on Wikisource , in Spanish
On 2 November 2006 the Spanish Chamber Deputies ratified the text of the Constitutional Commission with 306 votes in favor, none opposed, and 2 abstentions. This was the first time a Spanish
Organic Law
adopting a Statute of Autonomy was approved with no opposing votes. The Senate, in a plenary session of 20 December 2006, ratified the referendum to be voted upon by the Andalusian public 18 February 2007.
The Statute of Autonomy spells out Andalusia's distinct institutions of government and administration. Chief among these is the
Andalusian Autonomous Government
( Junta de Andalucía ). Other institutions specified in the Statute are the Defensor del Pueblo Andaluz (literally "Defender of the Andalusian People", basically an
ombudsperson ), the Consultative Council, the Chamber of Accounts, the Audiovisual Council of Andalusia, and the Economic and Social Council.
The Andalusian Statute of Autonomy recognizes Seville as the region's capital. The Andalusian Autonomous Government is located there. However, the region's highest court, the
High Court of Andalusia
( Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Andalucía ) is not part of the Autonomous Government, and has its seat in
Granada .
Andalusian Autonomous Government
Main article:
Andalusian Autonomous Government
Legal districts
of Andalusia.
The Andalusian Autonomous Government ( Junta de Andalucía ) is the institution of self-government of the Autonomous Community of Andalusia. Within the government, the
President of the Regional Government of Andalusia
is the supreme representative of the autonomous community, and the ordinary representative of the Spanish state in the autonomous community. The president is formally named to the position by the
Monarch of Spain
and then confirmed by a majority vote of the
Parliament of Andalusia . In practice, the monarch always names a person acceptable to the ruling party or coalition of parties in the autonomous region. In theory, were the candidate to fail to gain the needed majority, the monarch could propose a succession of candidates. After two months, if no proposed candidate could gain the parliament's approval, the parliament would automatically be dissolved and the acting president would call new elections. [ 61 ]
On September 5, 2013
Susana Díaz
was elected president.
The Council of Government, the highest political and administrative organ of the Community, exercises
regulatory
and
executive power . [ 62 ]
The President presides over the council, which also includes the heads of various departments ( Consejerías ). In the current legislature (2008–2012), there are 15 of these departments. In order of precedence, they are Presidency, Governance, Economy and Treasury, Education, Justice and Public Administration, Innovation, Science and Business, Public Works and Transportation, Employment, Health, Agriculture and Fishing, Housing and Territorial Planning, Tourism, Commerce and Sports, Equality and Social Welfare, Culture, and Environment.
The Parliament of Andalusia, its Autonomic Legislative Assembly, develops and approves laws and elects and removes the President. [ 63 ]
Elections to the Andalusian Parliament follow a democratic formula through which the citizens elect 109 representatives. After the approval of the Statute of Autonomy through Organic Law 6/1981 on 20 December 1981, the first elections to the autonomic parliament took place 23 May 1982. Further elections have occurred in 1986, 1990, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008.
The current (2008–2012) legislature includes representatives of the PSOE-A (Andalusian branch of the left-of-center PSOE), PP-A (Andalusian branch of the right-of-center PP) and IULV-CA (Andalusian branch of the leftist IU). [ 64 ]
Judicial power
The
High Court of Andalusia
( Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Andalucía ) in Granada is subject only to the higher jurisdiction of
Supreme Court of Spain . The High Court is not an organ of the Autonomous Community, but rather of the
Judiciary of Spain , which is unitary throughout the kingdom and whose powers are not transferred to the autonomous communities. The Andalusian territory is divided into 88
legal/judicial districts
( partidos judiciales ). [ 65 ]

The municipalities of Andalusia are regulated by Title III of the Statute of Autonomy, Articles 91–95, which establishes the municipality as the basic territorial entity of Andalusia, each of which has legal personhood and autonomy in many aspects of its internal affairs. At the municipal level, representation, government and administration is performed by the
ayuntamiento
(municipal government), which has competency for
urban planning , community social services, supply and treatment of water, collection and treatment of waste, and promotion of tourism, culture, and sports, among other matters established by law. [ 67 ]
Among the more important Andalusian cities besides the provincial capitals are:
El Ejido ,
Níjar
and
Roquetas de Mar
(Almería)
La Línea de la Concepción ,
Algeciras ,
Sanlúcar de Barrameda ,

and

(Sevilla)
In conformity with the intent to devolve control as locally as possible, in many cases, separate nuclei of population within municipal borders each administer their own interests. These are variously known as
pedanías
("hamlets"),
villas
("villages"),
aldeas
(also usually rendered as "villages"), or other similar names. [ 66 ] [ 68 ]
Comarcas and mancomunidades
Comarcas of Andalusia
Within the various autonomous communities of Spain,
comarcas
are comparable to
shires
(or, in some countries,
counties ) in the English-speaking world. Unlike in some of Spain's other autonomous communities, under the original 1981 Statute of Autonomy, the
comarcas
of Andalusia
had no formal recognition, but, in practice, they still had informal recognition as geographic, cultural, historical, or in some cases administrative entities. The 2007 Statute of Autonomy echoes this practice, and mentions
comarcas
in Article 97 of Title III, which defines the significance of
comarcas
and establishes a basis for formal recognition in future legislation. [ 69 ]
The current statutory entity that most closely resembles a
comarca
is the
mancomunidad , a freely chosen, bottom-up association of municipalities intended as an instrument of socioeconomic development and coordination between municipal governments in specific areas. [ 66 ] [ 70 ]
Demographics
Andalusia ranks first by population among the 17 autonomous communities of Spain. The estimated population at the beginning of 2009 was 8,285,692. [ 71 ]
The population is concentrated, above all, in the provincial capitals and along the coasts, so that the level of urbanization is quite high; half the population is concentrated in the 28 cities of more than 50,000 inhabitants. The population is aging, although the process of immigration is countering the inversion of the
population pyramid . [ 72 ]

At the end of the 20th century, Andalusia was in the last phase of
demographic transition . The
death rate
stagnated at around 8–9 per thousand, and the population came to be influenced mainly by birth and migration. [ 74 ]
Population by municipalities in Andalusia in 2007. [ 75 ]
In 1950, Andalusia had 20.04 percent of the national population of Spain. By 1981, this had declined to 17.09 percent. Although the Andalusian population was not declining in absolute terms, these relative losses were due to emigration great enough to nearly counterbalance having the highest
birth rate
in Spain. Since the 1980s, this process has reversed on all counts, [ 76 ]
and as of 2009, Andalusia has 17.82 percent of the Spanish population. [ 77 ]
The birth rate is sharply down, as is typical in developed economies, although it has lagged behind much of the rest of the world in this respect. Furthermore, prior emigrants have been returning to Andalusia. Beginning in the 1990s, others have been immigrating in large numbers as well, as Spain has become a country of net immigration. [ 76 ]
At the beginning of the 21st century, statistics show a slight increase in the birth rate, due in large part to the higher birth rate among immigrants. [ 78 ] [ 79 ]
The result is that as of 2009, the trend toward rejuvenation of the population is among the strongest of any autonomous community of Spain, or of any comparable region in Europe. [ 77 ]
Structure
Evolution of the birth and death rates of Andalusia 1975–2007
Structure of the population of Andalusia by sex and age. 2008 data 2008; 1986 data in red for comparison.
At the beginning of the 21st century, the population structure of Andalusia shows a clear inversion of the population pyramid, with the largest cohorts falling between ages 25 and 50. [ 80 ]
Comparison of the population pyramid in 2008 to that in 1986 shows:
A clear decrease in the population under the age of 25, due to a declining birth rate.
An increase in the adult population, as the earlier, larger cohort born in the "baby boom" of the 1960s and 1970s reach adulthood. This effect has been exacerbated by immigration: the largest contingent of immigrants are young adults.
A further increase in the adult population, and especially the older adult population, due to increased
life expectancy .
As far as composition by sex, two aspects stand out: the higher percentage of women in the elderly population, owing to women's longer life expectancy, and, on the other hand, the higher percentage of men of working age, due in large part to a predominantly male immigrant population. [ 77 ]
Immigration
In 2005, 5.35 percent of the population of Andalusia were born outside of Spain. This is a relatively low number for a Spanish region, the national average being three percentage points higher. The immigrants are not evenly distributed among the Andalusian provinces: Almería, with a 15.20 percent immigrant population, is third among all provinces in Spain, while at the other extreme Jaén is only 2.07 percent immigrants and Córdoba 1.77 percent. The predominant nationalities among the immigrant populations are
Moroccan
(92,500, constituting 17.79 percent of the foreigners living in Andalusia) and
British
(15.25 percent across the region). If one looks at regions rather than individual countries, the single largest immigrant block is from
Latin America , outnumbering either North Africans or non-Spanish Western Europeans. [ 81 ]
Demographically, this group has provided an important addition to the Andalusian labor force. [ 78 ] [ 79 ]
Economy
Andalusia is traditionally an agricultural area, but the
service sector
(particularly tourism, retail sales, and transportation) now predominates. The once booming construction sector, hit hard by the
2009 recession , was also important to the region's economy. The industrial sector is less developed than most other regions in Spain.
Between 2000–2006 economic growth per annum was 3.72%, one of the highest in the country. Still, according to the Spanish
Instituto Nacional de Estadística
(INE), the GDP per capita of Andalusia (€17,401; 2006) remains the second lowest in Spain, with only
Extremadura
lagging behind. [ 82 ]

Primary sector
The
primary sector , despite adding the least of the three sectors to the regional
GDP
remains important, especially when compared to typical developed economies. The primary sector produces 8.26 percent of regional GDP and employs 8.19 percent of the workforce. [ 84 ] [ citation needed ]
In monetary terms it could be considered a rather uncompetitive sector, given its level of productivity compared to other Spanish regions. [ citation needed ]
In addition to its numeric importance relative to other regions, agriculture and other primary sector activities have strong roots in local culture and identity.
The primary sector is divided into a number of subsectors:
agriculture ,
commercial fishing ,
animal husbandry ,
hunting ,
forestry ,
mining , and
energy .
Agriculture, husbandry, hunting, and forestry
Denominations of origin
of
olive oil
in Andalusia
For many centuries, Andalusian society was mainly agricultural. Even today, 45.74 percent of the Andalusian territory is cultivated. [ 85 ] [ citation needed ]
The primary cultivation is dryland farming of
cereals
and
sunflowers
without artificial
irrigation , especially in the vast countryside of the Guadalquivir valley and the high plains of Granada and Almería-with a considerably lesser and more geographically focused cultivation of
barley
and
oats . Using irrigation,
maize ,
cotton
and
rice
are also grown on the banks of the Guadalquivir and
Genil . [ 86 ]
Olive orchards in
Baños de la Encina
province of Jaén.
The most important tree crops are
olives , especially in the Subbetic regions of the provinces of Córdoba and Jáen, where irrigated olive orchards constitute a large component of agricultural output. [ 87 ]
There are extensive
vineyards
in various zones such as
Jerez de la Frontera
( sherry ),
Condado de Huelva ,
Montilla-Moriles
and
Málaga . Fruits—mainly
citrus
fruits—are grown near the banks of the Guadalquivir;
almonds , which require far less water, are grown on the high plains of Granada and Almería. [ 88 ]
In monetary terms, by far the most productive and competitive agriculture in Andalusia is the intensive forced cultivation of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and other fruits grown under hothouse conditions under clear plastic, often in sandy zones, on the coasts, in Almería and Huelva. [ 89 ]

Organic farming
has recently undergone rapid expansion in Andalusia, mainly for export to European markets but with increasing demand developing in Spain. [ 90 ]
Andalusia has a long tradition of
animal husbandry
and
livestock
farming, but it is now restricted mainly to mountain meadows, where there is less pressure from other potential uses. Andalusians have a long and colourful history of
dog breeding
that can be observed throughout the region today. The raising of livestock now plays a semi-marginal role in the Andalusian economy, constituting only 15 percent of the primary sector, half the number for Spain taken as a whole. [ 91 ]
"Extensive" raising of livestock grazes the animals on natural or cultivated
pastures , whereas "intensive" raising of livestock is based in
fodder
rather than pasture. Although the productivity is higher than with extensive techniques, the economics are quite different. While intensive techniques now dominate in Europe and even in other regions of Spain, most of Andalusia's
cattle , virtually all of its
sheep
and
goats , and a good portion of its
pigs
are raised by extensive farming in mountain pastures. This includes the
Black Iberian pigs
that are the source of
Jamón ibérico . Andalusia's native sheep and goats present a great economic opportunity in a Europe where animal products are generally in strong supply, but the sheep and goat meat, milk, and leather (and the products derived from these) are relatively scarce.
Dogs
are bred not just as companion animals, but also as herding animals used by goat and sheep herders.
Hunting remains relatively important in Andalusia, but has largely lost its character as a means of obtaining food. It is now more of a leisure activity linked to the mountain areas and complementary to forestry and the raising of livestock. [ 92 ]
Dogs are frequently used as hunting companions to retrieve killed game.
The Andalusian
forests
are important for their extent—50 percent of the territory of Andalusia—and for other less quantifiable environmental reasons, such as their value in preventing erosion, regulating the flow of water necessary for other flora and fauna. For these reasons, there is legislation in place to protect the Andalusian forests. [ 93 ]
The value of forest products as such constitutes only 2 percent of agricultural production. This comes mostly from cultivated species— eucalyptus
in Huelva and
poplar
in Granada—as well as naturally occurring
cork oak
in the Sierra Morena. [ 94 ]
Fishing
Fishing port of Algeciras.
Fishing
is a longstanding tradition on the Andalusian coasts. Fish and other seafood have long figured prominently in the local diet and in the local
gastronomic
culture:
fried fish
( pescaito frito
in local dialect), white
prawns ,
almadraba
tuna, among others. The Andalusian fishing fleet is Spain's second largest, after
Galicia , and Andalusia's 38 fishing ports are the most of any Spanish autonomous community. [ 95 ]
Commercial fishing produces only 0.5 percent of the product of the regional primary sector by value, but there are areas where it has far greater importance. In the province of Huelva it constitutes 20 percent of the primary sector, and locally in
Punta Umbría
70 percent of the work force is involved in commercial fishing. [ 96 ]
Failure to comply with fisheries laws regarding the use of trawling, urban
pollution
of the seacoast, destruction of habitats by coastal construction (for example, alteration of the mouths of rivers, construction of ports), and diminution of fisheries by
overexploitation [ 97 ]
have created a permanent crisis in the Andalusian fisheries, justifying attempts to convert the fishing fleet. The decrease in fish stocks has led to the rise of
aquaculture , including
fish farming
both on the coasts and in the interior. [ 98 ]
Mining
Despite the general poor returns in recent years,
mining
retains a certain importance in Andalusia. Andalusia produces half of Spain's mining product by value. Of Andalusia's production, roughly half comes from the province of Huelva. Mining for precious metals at
Minas de Riotinto
in Huelva ( see
Rio Tinto Group ) dates back to pre-Roman times; the mines were abandoned in the Middle Ages and rediscovered in 1556. Other mining activity is
coal
mining in the Guadiato valley in the province of Córdoba; various metals at
Aznalcóllar
in the province of Seville, and iron at
Alquife
in the province of Granada. In addition, limestone, clay, and other materials used in construction are well distributed throughout Andalusia. [ 99 ]
Secondary sector: industry
The Andalusian industrial sector has always been relatively small. Nevertheless, in 2007, Andalusian industry earned 11.979 million euros and employed more than 290,000 workers. This represented 9.15 percent of regional GDP, far below the 15.08 the secondary sector represents in the economy of Spain as a whole. [ 100 ]
By analyzing the different subsectors of the food industry Andalusian industry accounts for more than 16% of total production. In a comparison with the Spanish economy, this subsector is virtually the only food that has some weight in the national economy with 16.16%. Lies far behind the manufacturing sector of shipping materials just over 10% of the Spanish economy. Companies like Cruzcampo (Heineken Group), Puleva, Domecq, Santana Motors or Renault-Andalusia, are exponents of these two subsectors. Of note is the Andalusian aeronautical sector, which is second nationally only behind Madrid and represents approximately 21% of total turnover in terms of employment, highlighting companies like Airbus, Airbus Military, or the newly formed Aerospace Alestis. On the contrary it is symptomatic of how little weight the regional economy in such important sectors such as textiles or electronics at the national level. [ citation needed ]
Andalusian industry is also characterized by a specialization in industrial activities of transforming raw agricultural and mineral materials. This is largely done by small enterprises without the public or foreign investment more typical of a high level of industrialization.
Tertiary sector: services
Castle of Sancti Petri, located in
San Fernando, Cádiz . One of the largest components of the service sector is "sun and sand" tourism.
In recent decades the Andalusian tertiary (service) sector has grown greatly, and has come to constitute the majority of the regional economy, as is typical of contemporary economies in developed nations. [ 101 ]
In 1975 the service sector produced 51.1 percent of local GDP and employed 40.8 percent of the work force. In 2007, this had risen to 67.9 percent of GDP and 66.42 percent of jobs. This process of "tertiarization" of the economy has followed a somewhat unusual course in Andalusia. [ 102 ]
This growth occurred somewhat earlier than in most developed economies and occurred independently of the local industrial sector. There were two principal reasons that "tertiarization" followed a different course in Andalusia than elsewhere:
1. Andalusian capital found it impossible to compete in the industrial sector against more developed regions, and was obligated to invest in sectors that were easier to enter.
2. The absence of an industrial sector that could absorb displaced agricultural workers and artisans led to the proliferation of services with rather low productivity. This unequal development compared to other regions led to a hypertrophied and unproductive service sector, which has tended to reinforce underdevelopment, because it has not led to large accumulations of capital.

Due in part to the relatively mild winter and spring climate, the south of Spain is attractive to overseas visitors–especially tourists from Northern Europe. While inland areas such as
Jaén ,
Córdoba
and the hill villages and towns remain relatively untouched by tourism, the coastal areas of Andalusia have heavy visitor traffic for much of the year.
Among the autonomous communities, Andalusia is second only to
Catalonia
in tourism, with nearly 30 million visitors every year. The principal tourist destinations in Andalusia are the
Costa del Sol
and (secondarily) the
Sierra Nevada . As discussed
above , Andalusia is one of the sunniest and warmest places in Europe, making it a center of "sun and sand" tourism. [ 104 ]
70 percent of the lodging capacity and 75 percent of the nights booked in Andalusian hotels are in coastal municipalities. The largest number of tourists come in August—13.26 percent of the nights booked throughout the year—and the smallest number in December—5.36 percent.

Marbella .
On the west (Atlantic) coast are the
Costa de la Luz
(provinces of Huelva and Cádiz), and on the east (Mediterranean) coast, the
Costa del Sol
(provinces of Cádiz y Málaga),
Costa Tropical
(Granada and part of Almería) and the
Costa de Almería . In 2004, the
Blue Flag beach
program of the non-profit
Foundation for Environmental Education
recognized 66 Andalusian beaches and 18 pleasure craft ports as being in a good state of conservation in terms of sustainability, accessibility, and quality. [ citation needed ]
Nonetheless, the level of tourism on the Andalusian coasts has been high enough to have a significant environmental impact, and other organizations—such as the Spanish
Ecologists in Action
( Ecologistas en Acción ) with their description of "Black Flag beaches" [ 105 ]
or
Greenpeace [ 106 ] —have expressed the opposite sentiment.
Together with "sand and sun" tourism, there has also been a strong increase in nature tourism in the interior, as well as
cultural tourism , sport tourism, and conventions [ citation needed ] . One example of sport and nature tourism is the ski resort at
Sierra Nevada National Park .
As for cultural tourism, Andalusia has some notable monuments dating back to the Muslim era: the
Great Mosque of Córdoba , the
Alhambra
in Granada, the
Giralda
and
Alcazar
in Seville, and the
Alcazaba
in Málaga. There are hundreds of cultural tourist destinations: cathedrals, castles, forts, monasteries, and historic city centers; the city centers of
Úbeda
and
Baeza
in the province of Jaén are UNESCO
World Heritage Sites .
Each of the provinces shows a great variety of architectural styles:
Islamic architecture ,
Renaissance architecture ,
Baroque architecture
and more modern styles. Further, there are the
Lugares colombinos , significant places in the life of
Christopher Columbus : [ 107 ]
Palos de la Frontera ,
La Rábida Monastery , and
Moguer ) in the province of Huelva. There are also archeological sites of great interest: the Roman city of
Italica , birthplace of
Emperor
Trajan
and (most likely)
Hadrian ;
Baelo Claudia
near the Straits of Gibraltar;
Medina Azahara , the city-palace of the Cordoban
caliph
Abd-ar-Rahman III , where major excavations still continue.
Nerja .
Andalusia was the birthplace of such great painters as
Velázquez
and
Murillo
(Seville) and, more recently,
Picasso
(Málaga); Picasso is memorialized by his native city at the
Museo Picasso Málaga
and
Natal House Foundation ; the
Casa de Murillo
was a
house museum
1982–1998, but is now mostly offices for the Andalusian Council of Culture. The
CAC Málaga (Museum of Modern Art)
is the most visited museum of Andalusia [ citation needed ] and has offered exhibitions of artists such as
Louise Bourgeois ,
Jake and Dinos Chapman ,
Gerhard Richter ,
Anish Kapoor ,
Ron Mueck
or
Rodney Graham . Malaga is also located part of the private
Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection
at
Carmen Thyssen Museum .
There are numerous other significant museums around the region, both of paintings and of archeological artifacts such as gold jewelry, pottery and other ceramics, and other works that demonstrate the region's artisanal traditions.

Infrastructure
Transport
First order roads of Andalusia
As in any modern society, transport systems are an essential structural element of the functioning of Andalusia. The transportation network facilitates territorial coordination, economic development and distribution, and intercity transportation. [ 108 ]
In urban transport, underdeveloped public transport systems put pedestrian traffic and other non-motorized traffic are at a disadvantage compared to the use of private vehicles. Several Andalusian capitals—Córdoba, Granada and Seville—have recently been trying to remedy this by strengthening their public transport systems and providing a better infrastructure for the use of
bicycles . [ 109 ]
Estación de Santa Justa, Sevilla
For over a century, the conventional rail network has been centralized on the regional capital, Seville, and the national capital, Madrid; in general, there are no direct connections between provincial capitals. High-speed
AVE
trains run from Madrid via Córdoba to Seville and Málaga. Further AVE routes are under construction. [ 110 ]
The Madrid-Córdoba-Seville route was the first high-velocity route in Spain (operating since 1992). Other principal routes are the one from Algeciras to Seville and from
Almería
via Granada to Madrid.
Most of the principal roads have been converted into
limited access highways
known as
autovías . The Autovía del Este ( Autovía A-4 ) runs from Madrid through the Despeñaperros Natural Park, then via Bailén, Córdoba, and Seville to Cádiz, and is part of
European route E05
in the
International E-road network . The other main road in the region is the portion of
European route E15 , which runs as the Autovia del Mediterráneo along the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Parts of this constitute the
superhighway
Autopista AP-7 , while in other areas it is
Autovía A-7 . Both of these roads run generally east-west, although the Autovía A-4 turns to the south in western Andalusia.
Other first-order roads include the
Autovía A-48
roughly along the Atlantic coast from Cádiz to Algeciras, continuing European route E05 to meet up with
European route E15 ; the Autovía del Quinto Centenario ( Autovía A-49 ), which continues west from Seville (where the Autovía A-4 turns toward the south) and goes on to Huelva and into Portugal as
European route E01 ; the Autovía Ruta de la Plata ( Autovía A-66 ),
European route E803 , which roughly corresponds to the ancient Roman ' Silver Route ' from the mines of northern Spain, and runs north from Seville; the Autovía de Málaga ( Autovía A-45 ), which runs south from Córdoba to Málaga; and the Autovía de Sierra Nevada ( Autovía A-44 ), part of
European route E902 , which runs south from Jaén to the Mediterranean coast at Motril.
Málaga Airport .
As of 2008 Andalusia has six public airports, all of which can legally handle international flights; however the
Málaga Airport
is dominant, handling 60.67 percent of passengers [ 111 ]
and 85 percent of its international traffic. [ citation needed ]
The
Seville Airport
handles another 20.12 percent of traffic, and the
Jerez Airport
7.17 percent, so that these three airports account for 87.96 percent of traffic. [ 111 ]
Málaga Airport is the international airport that offers a wide variety of international destinations. It has a daily link with twenty cities in Spain and over a hundred cities in Europe (mainly in Great Britain, Central Europe and the Nordic countries but also the main cities of Eastern Europe:
Moscow ,
Saint Petersburg ,
Sofia ,
Riga
or
Bucharest ), North Africa, Middle East ( Riyadh ,
Jeddah
and
Kuwait ) and North America ( New York ,
Toronto
and
Montreal ).
Port of Algeciras .
The main ports are Algeciras (for freight and container traffic) and Málaga for cruise ships. Algeciras is Spain's leading commercial port, with 60,000,000 tonnes (66,000,000 short tons) of cargo in 2004. [ 112 ]
Seville has Spain's only commercial river port. Other significant commercial ports in Andalusia are the ports of the
Bay of Cádiz , Almería and Huelva.
The Council of Government has approved a Plan of Infrastructures for the Sustainability of Transport in Andalusia (PISTA) 2007–2013, which plans an investment of 30 billion euros during that period. [ 113 ]
Energy infrastructure
The lack of high-quality
fossil fuels
in Andalusia has led to a strong dependency on
petroleum
imports. Still, Andalusia has a strong potential for the development of
renewable energy , above all
wind energy . The Andalusian Energy Agency established in 2005 by the autonomous government, is a new governmental organ charged with the development of energy policy and provision of a sufficient supply of energy for the community. [ 108 ]
The infrastructure for production of
electricity
consists of eight large
thermal power stations , more than 70
hydroelectric
power plants, two
wind farms , and 14 major
cogeneration
facilities. Historically, the largest Andalusian business in this sector was the
Compañía Sevillana de Electricidad , founded in 1894, absorbed into
Endesa
in 1996.
Solar power tower
PS10
in
Sanlúcar la Mayor .
The
Solar power tower
PS10
was built by the Andalusian firm
Abengoa
in
Sanlúcar la Mayor
in the province of Seville, and began operating in March 2007. It is the largest existing solar power facility in Europe. [ 114 ]
Smaller solar power stations, also recent, exist at
Cúllar
and
Galera, Granada , inaugurated by
Geosol
and
Caja Granada . Two more large thermosolar facilities,
Andasol I y II , planned at Hoya de
Guadix
in the province of Granada are expected to supply electricity to half a million households. [ 115 ]
The
Plataforma Solar de Almería
(PSA) in the Tabernas Desert is an important center for the exploration of the solar energy. [ 116 ]
The largest wind power firm in the region is the
Sociedad Eólica de Andalucía , formed by the merger of
Planta Eólica del Sur S.A.
and
Energía Eólica del Estrecho S.A.
Education
Law School of the
University of Granada .
As throughout Spain, basic education in Andalusia is free and compulsory. Students are required to complete ten years of schooling, and may not leave school before the age of 16, after which students may continue on to a
baccalaureate , to intermediate
vocational education , to intermediate-level schooling in arts and design, to intermediate sports studies, or to the working world.
Andalusia has a tradition of higher education dating back to the
Middle Ages
and the
Madrasah of Granada ,
University of Baeza , and
University of Osuna .
As of 2009, there are ten private or public universities in Andalucia. University studies are structured in cycles, awarding degrees based on
ECTS credits
in accord with the
Bologna process , which the Andalusian universities are adopting in accord with the other universities of the
European Higher Education Area .
Healthcare
Healthcare districts of Andalusia
Responsibility for healthcare jurisdictions devolved from the Spanish government to Andalusia with the enactment of the Statute of Autonomy. Thus, the
Andalusian Health Service
( Servicio Andaluz de Salud ) currently manages almost all public health resources of the Community, with such exceptions as health resources for prisoners and members of the military, which remain under central administration.
Science and technology
According to the Outreach Program for Science in Andalusia, Andalusia contributes 14 percent of Spain's scientific production behind only Madrid and Catalonia among the autonomous communities, [ 117 ]
even though regional investment in
research and development
(R&D) as a proportion of
GDP
is below the national average. [ 118 ]
The lack of research capacity in business and the low participation of the private sector in research has resulted in R&D taking place largely in the public sector.
The Council of Innovation, Science and Business is the organ of the autonomous government responsible for universities, research, technological development, industry, and energy. The council coordinates and initiates scientific and technical innovation through specialized centers an initiatives such as the
Andalusian Center for Marine Science and Technology
( Centro Andaluz de Ciencia y Tecnología Marina ) and
Technological Corporation of Andalusia
( Corporación Tecnológica de Andalucía ).
Within the private sphere, although also promoted by public administration, technology parks have been established throughout the Community, such as the
Technological Park of Andalucia
( Parque Tecnológico de Andalucía ) in
Campanillas
on the outskirts of Málaga, and
Cartuja 93
in Seville. Some of these parks specialize in specific sector, such as
Aerópolis
in
aerospace
or
Geolit
in
food technology . The Andalusian government deployed 600,000
Ubuntu
desktop computers in their schools.
Media
Andalusia has international, national, regional, and local media organizations, which are active gathering and disseminating information (as well as creating and disseminating information entertainment).
The most notable is the public
Radio y Televisión de Andalucía
(RTVA), broadcasting on two regional television channels,
Canal Sur
and
Canal Sur 2 , four regional radio stations,
Canal Sur Radio ,
Canal Fiesta Radio ,
Radio Andalucía Información
and
Canal Flamenco Radio , as well as various digital signals, most notably
Canal Sur Andalucía
available on
cable TV
throughout Spain. [ 119 ]
Newspapers
Different newspapers are published for each Andalusian provincial capital,
comarca , or important city. Often, the same newspaper organization publishes different local editions with much shared content, with different
mastheads
and different local coverage. There are also popular papers distributed without charge, again typically with local editions that share much of their content.
No single Andalusian newspaper is distributed throughout the region, not even with local editions. In eastern Andalusia the
Diario Ideal
has edition in the provinces if Almería, Granada, and Jaén.
Grupo Joly
is based in Andalucia, backed by Andalusian capital, and publishes eight daily newspapers there. Efforts to create a newspaper for the entire autonomous region have not succeeded (the most recent as of 2009 was the
Diario de Andalucía ). The national press ( El País ,
El Mundo ,
ABC , etc.) include sections or editions specific to Andalusia.
Public television
RTVA 's headquarters, a former train station in Córdoba.
Andalusia has two public television stations, both operated by
Radio y Televisión de Andalucía
(RTVA):
Canal Sur
first broadcast on 28 February 1989 ( Día de Andalucía ).
Canal Sur 2
first broadcast 5 June 1998. Programming focuses on culture, sports, and programs for children and youth.
In addition, RTVA also operates the national and international cable channel Canal Sur Andalucía, which first broadcast in 1996 as Andalucía Televisión.
Radio
There are four public radio stations in the region, all operated by RTVA:
Canal Sur Radio , first broadcast October 1988.
Radio Andalucía Información , first broadcast September 1998.
Canal Fiesta Radio , first broadcast January 2001.
Canal Flamenco Radio , first broadcast 29 September 2008.
Art and culture
Flamenco
dance and music is native to Andalusia.
The culture of Andalusia has been shaped by its particular history and geography, as well as its complex flows of population. Andalusia has been home to a succession of peoples and civilizations, many very different from one another, each impacting the settled inhabitants. The ancient
Iberians
were followed by
Celts ,
Phoenicians
and other Eastern Mediterranean traders,
Romans ,
migrating Germanic tribes , North African
Muslims , and the
Castilians
and other Spanish of the
Reconquista . All have affected Andalusian identity and culture, which was already delineated in the 19th century and diffused widely in the literary and pictorial genre of the
costumbrismo andaluz . [ 120 ]
[ 121 ]
In the 19th century, Andalusian culture came to be widely viewed as the Spanish culture
par excellence , in part thanks to the perceptions of
romantic
travellers. In the words of
Ortega y Gasset :
Andalusia, which has never shown the swagger nor petulancy of particularism; that has never pretended to the status of a State apart, is, of all the Spanish regions, the one that possesses a culture most radically its own. Throughout the 19th century, Spain has submitted itself to the hegemonic influence of Andalusia. That century began with the
Cádiz Cortes ; it ended with the assassination of
Cánovas del Castillo ,
malagueño
[from Málaga], and the exaltation of
Silvela , no less
malagueño . The dominant ideas have an Andalusian accent. One paints Andalusia: a roof-terrace, some flowerpots, blue sky. One reads southern authors. One speaks at all times of the "land of the Most Holy Virgin Mary". The thief from the Sierra Morena and the smuggler are national heroes. All Spain feels its existence justified by the honor of having on its flanks the Andalusian piece of the planet. Around 1900, like so many other things, this changes. The North sits up. [ 122 ]

Arts
Andalusia has been the birthplace of many great artists: the classic painters
Velázquez ,
Murillo , and
Juan de Valdés Leal ; the sculptors
Juan Martínez Montañés ,
Alonso Cano
and
Pedro de Mena ; and such modern painters as
Daniel Vázquez Díaz
and
Pablo Picasso .
The composer
Manuel de Falla
was from Cádiz and incorporated typical Andalusian melodies in his works, as did
Joaquín Turina , from Seville. The great singer
Camarón de la Isla
was born in
San Fernando, Cádiz , and
Andrés Segovia
who helped shape the romantic-modernist approach to
classical guitar , was born in
Linares, Jaén .
Architecture
The
Alhambra , seen from the gardens of the Generalife in the
Albaicín .
Since the
Neolithic
era, Andalusia has preserved important
megaliths , such as the
dolmens
at the
Cueva de Menga
and the
Dolmen de Viera , both at
Antequera . Archeologists have found
Bronze Age
cities at
Los Millares
and
El Argar . Archeological digs at Doña Blanca in
El Puerto de Santa María
have revealed the oldest
Phoenicians
city in the Iberian peninsula; major ruins have also been revealed at Roman
Italica
near Seville. [ 123 ]
Some of the greatest architecture in Andalusia dates from the Muslim era: the
Alhambra
and the
Great Mosque of Córdoba .
A
patio andaluz
in Córdoba.
The traditional architecture of Andalusia retains its
Roman
and
Arab
roots, with a marked Mediterranean character strongly conditioned by the climate. Traditional urban houses are constructed with shared walls to minimize exposure to high exterior temperatures. Solid exterior walls are
painted
with
lime
to minimize the heating effects of the sun. In accord with the climate and tradition of each area, the roofs may be
terraces
or tiled in the Roman
imbrex and tegula
style. One of the most characteristic elements (and one of the most obviously influenced by Roman and
North African architecture ) is the interior
patio
or
courtyard ; the patios of Córdoba are particularly famous. Other characteristic elements are decorative (and functional)
wrought iron
gratings , and the
tiles
known as
azulejos . Landscaping—both for common private homes and homes on a more lavish scale—also carries on older traditions, with plants, flowers, and fountains, pools, and streams of water. Beyond these general elements, there are also specific local architectural styles, such as the
flat roofs , roofed chimneys, and radically extended
balconies
of the
Alpujarra , the cave dwellings of
Guadix
and of Granada's
Sacromonte , or the traditional architecture of the
Marquisate of Zenete . [ 124 ]
Gran Teatro Falla
in Cádiz.
The monumental architecture of the centuries immediately after the Reconquista often displayed an assertion of Christian hegemony through architecture that referenced non-Arab influences. [ citation needed ]
Some of the greatest
Renaissance
buildings in Andalusia are from the
then-kingdom of Jaén : the
Jaén Cathedral , designed in part by
Andrés de Vandelvira , served as a model for the
Cathedral of Malaga
and
Guadix ; [ citation needed ]
the centers of
Úbeda
and
Baeza , dating largely from this era, are UNESCO
World Heritage Sites . Seville and its kingdom also figured prominently in this era, as is shown by the
Casa consistorial de Sevilla , the
Hospital de las Cinco Llagas
or the
Charterhouse of Jerez de la Frontera . The
Palace of Charles V
in Granada is uniquely important for its
Italianate
purism. [ 125 ]
Andalusia also has such
Baroque -era buildings as the
Palace of San Telmo
in Seville (seat of the current autonomic presidency), the
Church of Our Lady of Reposo
in
Campillos , and the
Granada Charterhouse . [ 126 ]
Academicism
gave the region the
Royal Tobacco Factory
in Seville and
Neoclassicism
the nucleus of Cádiz, such as its
city hall ,
Royal Prison
and the
Oratorio de la Santa Cueva . [ citation needed ]
Revivalist
architecture in the 19th and 20th centuries contributed the buildings of the
Ibero-American Exposition of 1929
in Seville, including the
Neo-Mudéjar
Plaza de España . Andalusia also preserves an important industrial patrimony related to various economic activities.
Besides the architecture of the cities, there is also much outstanding rural architecture: houses, as well as ranch and farm buildings and
dog houses . [ 127 ]
Sculpture
Crying Over the Dead Christ , Pedro Millán,
Museum of Fine Arts of Seville .
The
Iberian reliefs
of
Osuna ,
Lady of Baza , and
León de Bujalance , the Phoenician
sarcophagi
of Cádiz, and the
Roman sculptures
of the
Baetic
cities such as
Italica
give evidence of traditions of sculpture in Andalusia dating back to antiquity. [ 128 ]
There are few significant surviving sculptures from the time of
al-Andalus ; two notable exceptions are the lions of the Alhambra and of the
Maristán of Granada
(the Muslim-era hospital in the Albaicín).
The
Sevillian school of sculpture
dating from the 13th century onward and the
Granadan school
beginning toward the end of the 16th century both focused primarily on Christian religious subject matter, including many wooden
altarpieces . Notable sculptors in these traditions include
Lorenzo Mercadante de Bretaña ,
Pedro Millán ,
Juan Martínez Montañés ,
Pedro Roldán ,
José de Arce ,
Jerónimo Balbás ,
Alonso Cano , and
Pedro de Mena . [ 129 ]
Non-religious sculpture has also existed in Andalusia since antiquity. A fine example from the Renaissance era is the decoration of the
Casa de Pilatos
in Seville. Nonetheless, non-religious sculpture played a relatively minor role until such 19th-century sculptors as
Antonio Susillo .
Painting
Pablo Picasso .
As in sculpture, there were
Sevillian
and the
Granadan
schools of painting. The latter has figured prominently in the history of Spanish art since the 15th century and includes such important artists as
Zurbarán ,
Velázquez
and
Murillo , as well as
theoreticians of art
such as
Francisco Pacheco . The
Museum of Fine Arts of Seville
and the
The Prado [ 130 ]
contain numerous representative works of the Sevillian school of painting.
A specific
romantic
genre known as
costumbrismo andaluz
depicts traditional and folkloric Andalusian subjects, such as bullfighting scenes, dogs, and scenes from Andalusia's history. Important artists in this genre include
Manuel Barrón ,
José García Ramos ,
Gonzalo Bilbao Martínez
and
Julio Romero de Torres . The genre is well represented in the private
Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection , part of which is on display at Madrid's
Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum
and
Carmen Thyssen Museum
in Málaga. [ 131 ]
Málaga also has been and is an important artistic center. Its most illustrious representative was
Pablo Picasso , one of the most influential artists of the twentieth century. The city has a
Museum
and
Natal House Foundation , dedicated to the painter.
Literature and philosophy
The 1492
Gramática
by
Antonio de Nebrija .
Andalusia plays a significant role in the history of
Spanish language
literature, however not all of the important literature associated with Andalusia was written in Spanish. Before 1492, there was the literature written in
Andalusian Arabic . Hispano-Arabic authors native to the region include
Ibn Hazm ,
Ibn Zaydun ,
Ibn Tufail ,
Al-Mu'tamid ,
Ibn al-Khatib ,
Ibn al-Yayyab , and
Ibn Zamrak [ 132 ]
or Andalusian Hebrew poets as
Solomon Ibn Gabirol . Twelfth-century writer
Ibn Quzman
crafted poems in the colloquial Andalusian language. [ 133 ]
In 1492
Antonio de Nebrija
published his celebrated
Gramática de la lengua castellana
("Grammar of the Castilian language"), the first such work for a modern European language. In 1528
Francisco Delicado
wrote
La lozana andaluza , a novel in the orbit of
La Celestina , and in 1599 the Sevillian
Mateo Alemán
wrote the first part of
Guzmán de Alfarache , the first
picaresque novel
with a known author.
The prominent
humanist
literary school of Seville included such writers as
Juan de Mal Lara ,
Fernando de Herrera ,
Gutierre de Cetina ,
Luis Barahona de Soto ,
Juan de la Cueva ,
Gonzalo Argote de Molina , and
Rodrigo Caro . The Cordoban
Luis de Góngora
was the greatest exponent of the
culteranismo
of
Baroque
poetry in the
Siglo de Oro ; [ 134 ]
indeed, the style is often referred to as
Góngorismo .
Literary Romanticism in Spain had one of its great centers in Andalusia, with such authors as
Ángel de Saavedra, Duke of Rivas ,
José Cadalso
and
Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer .
Costumbrismo andaluz
existed in literature as much as in visual art, with notable examples being the
Escenas andaluzas
of
Serafín Estébanez Calderón
and the works of
Pedro Antonio de Alarcón .
Andalusian authors
Ángel Ganivet ,
Manuel Gómez-Moreno ,
Manuel
and
Antonio Machado , and
Francisco Villaespesa
are all generally counted in the
Generation of '98 . Also of this generation were the
Hermanos Álvarez Quintero , dramatists who faithfully captured
Andalusian dialects
and idiosyncrasies. Also of note, 1956
Nobel Prize -winning poet
Juan Ramón Jiménez
was a native of
Moguer , near Huelva.
A large portion of the
avant garde
Generation of '27
who gathered at the
Ateneo de Sevilla
on the 300th anniversary of Góngora's death were Andalusians:
Federico García Lorca ,
Luis Cernuda ,
Rafael Alberti ,
Manuel Altolaguirre ,
Emilio Prados , and 1977 Nobel laureate
Vicente Aleixandre . [ 135 ]
Certain Andalusian fictional characters have become universal archetypes:
Prosper Merimée 's gypsy
Carmen ,
P. D. Eastman 's
Perro ,
Pierre Beaumarchais 's
Fígaro , and
Tirso de Molina 's
Don Juan .
As in most regions of Spain, the principal form of popular verse is the
romance , although there are also
strophes
specific to Andalusia, such as the
soleá
or the
soleariya . Ballads, lullabies, street vendor's cries, nursery rhymes, and work songs are plentiful.
Among the philosophers native to the region can be counted
Seneca ,
Avicebron ,
Maimonides ,
Averroes ,
Fernán Pérez de Oliva ,
Sebastián Fox Morcillo ,
Ángel Ganivet ,
Francisco Giner de los Ríos
and
María Zambrano .
Music of Andalusia
Main article:
Music of Andalusia
Baile por
bulerías , by
José García Ramos .
The music of Andalusia includes traditional and contemporary music, folk and composed music, and ranges from
flamenco
to
rock . Conversely, certain metric, melodic and harmonic characteristics are considered Andalusian even when written or performed by musicians from elsewhere.
Flamenco, perhaps the most characteristically Andalusian genre of music and dance, originated in the 18th century, but is based in earlier forms from the region. The influence of the traditional music and dance of the
Romani people
or Gypsies is particularly clear. The genre embraces distinct vocal ( cante flamenco ), guitar ( toque flamenco ), and dance ( baile flamenco ) styles. [ 136 ]
The Andalusian Statute of Autonomy reflects the cultural importance of flamenco in its Articles 37.1.18 and 68:
Guiding principles of public policy: 18th The preservation and enhancement of the cultural, historic and artistic heritage of Andalusia, especially flamenco. [ 137 ]
Also within the Autonomous Community (of Andalucia) is the exclusive competence in knowledge, conservation, research, training, promotion and dissemination of flamenco as a unique element of the Andalusian cultural heritage. [ 138 ]
Fundamental in the history of Andalusian music are the composers
Cristóbal de Morales ,
Francisco Guerrero ,
Francisco Correa de Arauxo ,
Manuel García ,
Manuel de Falla ,
Joaquín Turina , and
Manuel Castillo , as well as the father of modern
classical guitar , the guitarist
Andrés Segovia . [ citation needed ]
Mention should also be made of the great folk artists of the
copla (music)
and the
cante hondo , such as
Rocío Jurado ,
Lola Flores
( La Faraona , "the
pharaoh "),
Juanito Valderrama
and the revolutionary
Camarón de la Isla . [ 139 ]
Prominent Andalusian rock groups include
Triana
and
Medina Azahara . The duo
Los del Río
from
Dos Hermanas
had international success with their " Macarena ", including playing at a
Super Bowl
half-time show in the
United States , where their song has also been used as campaign music by the
Democratic Party . [ 140 ]
Other notables include the singer, songwriter, and poet
Joaquín Sabina ,
Isabel Pantoja ,
Rosa López , who represented Spain at
Eurovision
in 2002, and
David Bisbal . [ 141 ] [ 142 ]
Film
Málaga Film Festival
The portrayal of Andalusia in film is often reduced to archetypes: flamenco,
bullfighting , Catholic pageantry,
brigands , the property-rich and cash-poor
señorito andaluz
and emigrants. These images particularly predominated from the 1920s through the 1960s, and helped to consolidate a cliched image of the region. In a very different vein, the province of Almería was the filming location for many
Westerns , especially (but by no means exclusively) the Italian-directed
Spaghetti Westerns . During the dictatorship of
Francisco Franco , this was the extent of the film industry in Andalusia.
Nonetheless, Andalusian film has roots as far back as
José Val del Omar
in the pre-Franco years, and since the
Spanish transition to democracy
has brought forth numerous nationally and internationally respected directors:
Antonio Cuadri
( Heart of the Earth ),
Chus Gutiérrez
( Poniente ),
Chiqui Carabante
( Carlos Against the World ),
Alberto Rodríguez
( 7 Virgins ),
Benito Zambrano
( Solas ), and
Antonio Banderas
( Summer Rain ).
Counting together feature films, documentaries, television programs, music videos etc., Andalusia has boomed from 37 projects shooting in 1999 to 1,054 in 2007, with the figure for 2007 including 19 feature films. [ 143 ]
Although feature films are the most prestigious, commercials and television are currently more economically important to the region.
The
Filmoteca de Andalucía , headquartered in Córdoba, is a government-run entity in charge of the investigation, collection and diffusion of Andalusian cinematic heritage. Other important contributors to this last activity are such annual film festivals as the
Málaga Film Festival
( Festival de Málaga Cine Español (FMCE) ), the most important festival dedicated exclusively to cinema made in Spain, the
Seville Festival of European Film
(SFCE), the
International Festival of Short Films - Almería in Short , the
Huelva Festival of Latin American Film , the
Atlantic Film Show
in Cádiz, the
Islantilla Festival of Film and Television
and the
African Film Festival of Tarifa .
Culture
Customs and society
Andalusia has a wide array of social customs, many of which have their roots in the Islamic traditions integrated into the culture of the area under Muslim rule. Each sub-region in Andalusia has its own unique customs that represent a fusion of Catholicism and local folklore. Traditional dress in all areas of Andalusia tends to be colorful and involve various head coverings reminiscent of a Muslim past. Cities like Almería have been influenced historically by both
Granada
and Murcia in the use of traditional head coverings. The
sombrero de Labrador , a worker's hat made of black velvet, is a signature style of the region.
In Cádiz, traditional costumes with rural origins are worn at bullfights and at parties on the large estates. The
tablao flamenco
dance and the accompanying
cante jondo
vocal style originated in Granada. They are believed to have their roots in oriental, Gregorian, Moorish, and Jewish music. This music is most often performed by the gypsy
Romani , who are more numerous in Granada than anywhere else in Spain. One of the most distinctive cultural events in Andalusia is the
Romeria de El Rocio
in May. It consists of a pilgrimage to the
Hermitage of El Rocío
in the countryside near
Almonte , in honor of the
Virgin of El Rocío , an image of the
Virgin and Child , [ 144 ] [ 145 ]
which was supposedly hidden from the Muslims during Moorish rule. In recent times the
Romería
has attracted roughly a million pilgrims each year. [ 146 ]
In
Jaen , the
saeta
is a revered form of Spanish religious song, whose form and style has evolved over many centuries. Saetas evoke strong emotion and are sung most often during public processions.
Verdiales , based upon the
fandango , are a flamenco music style and song form originating in Almogia, near Málaga. For this reason, the Verdiales are sometimes known as
Fandangos de Málaga.
The region also has a rich musical tradition of flamenco songs, or
palos
called
cartageneras . Seville celebrates
Semana Santa , one of the better known religious events within Spain. During the festival, religious fraternities dress as penitents and carry large floats of lifelike wooden sculptures representing scenes of the
Passion , and images of the Virgin Mary.
Sevillanas , a type of old folk music sung and written in Seville and still very popular, are performed in fairs and festivals, along with an associated dance for the music, the
Baile por sevillanas . All the different regions of Andalusia have developed their own distinctive customs, but all share a connectedness to Catholicism and the region’s Muslim cultural past. [ 147 ]
Andalusian Spanish
Main article:
Andalusian Spanish
Most Spanish dialects in Spain differentiate between the sound of "z" and "c" (before e and i), pronounced
/θ/ , and that of "s", pronounced
/s/ . This distinction is lost in many Andalusian-speaking areas. In some mostly southerly areas, shown here in red, all three letters are pronounced
/θ/ , which is known as
Ceceo . In other areas, all three letters are pronounced ( /s/ ), which is known as
Seseo . Still other areas retain the distinction found elsewhere in Spain.
Andalusian Spanish is one of the most widely spoken forms of
Spanish
in Spain, and because of emigration patterns was very influential on
American Spanish . Rather than a single dialect, it is really a range of dialects sharing some common features; among these is the retention of more
Arabic
words than elsewhere in Spain, [ 148 ] [ 149 ]
as well as some
phonological differences
compared with
Standard Spanish . The
isoglosses
that mark the borders of Andalusian Spanish overlap to form a network of divergent boundaries, so there is no clear border for the linguistic region. [ 150 ]
Religion
Procession with statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Love of Saint Ferdinand (
Maria santísima del amor de San Fernando ), Cádiz.
The territory now known as Andalusia fell within the sphere of influence of ancient Mediterranean
mythological
beliefs. Phoenician colonization brought the cults of
Baal
and
Melqart ; the latter lasted into Roman times as
Hercules , mythical founder of both Cádiz and Seville. The
Islote de Sancti Petri
held the supposed tomb of Hercules, with representations of his
Twelve labors ; the region was the traditional site of the tenth labor, obtaining the cattle of the monster
Geryon . Traditionally, the
Pillars of Hercules
flank the
Strait of Gibraltar . Clearly, the European pillar is the
Rock of Gibraltar ; the African pillar was presumably either
Monte Hacho
in
Ceuta
or
Jebel Musa
in
Morocco . The
Roman road
that led from Cádiz to Rome was known by several names, one of them being
Via Herculea , Hercules route returning from his tenth labor. The present
coat of arms of Andalusia
shows Hercules between two lions, with two pillars behind these figures.
The principal characteristic of the local popular form of Catholicism is devotion to the
Virgin Mary ; Andalusia is sometimes known as
la tierra de María Santísima
("the land of Most Holy Mary"). [ 151 ]
Also characteristic are the processions during
Holy Week , in which thousands of
penitents
(known as
nazarenos ) sing
saetas . Andalusia is the site of such
pilgrim
destinations as the
Santuario de Nuestra Señora de la Cabeza
in
Andújar
and the
Hermitage of El Rocío
in
Almonte .
Bullfighting
José Gómez Ortega : Joselito "El Gallo".
While some trace the lineage of the
Spanish Fighting Bull
back to Roman times, today's fighting bulls in the Iberian peninsula and in the former
Spanish Empire
trace back to Andalusia in the 15th and 16th centuries. [ 152 ]
Andalusia remains a center of bull-rearing and
bullfighting : its 227
fincas de ganado
where fighting bulls are raised cover 146,917 hectares (363,040 acres). [ 152 ]
In the year 2000, Andalusia's roughly 100
bullrings
hosted 1,139
corridas . [ 152 ]
The oldest bullring still in use in Spain is the
neoclassical
Plaza de toros
in
Ronda , built in 1784. The Andalusian Autonomous Government sponsors the
Rutas de Andalucía taurina , a touristic route through the region centered on bullfighting.
Festivals
Cruz de mayo
of the
confraternity
Hermandad de la Paz y Esperanza ("Brotherhood of Peace and Hope"),
Cuesta del Bailío , Córdoba.
The Andalusian festivals provide a showcase for popular arts and traditional costume. Among the most famous of these are the
Seville Fair
or
Feria de Abril
in Seville, now echoed by smaller fairs in Madrid and Barcelona, both of which have many Andalusian immigrants; the
Feria de Agosto
in Málaga; the
Feria de Jerez
or
Feria del Caballo
in Jerez; the Festival of
Corpus Christi
in Granada; the
Feria de Nuestra Señora de la Salud
in Córdoba; the
Columbian Festivals
( Fiestas Colombinas ) in Huelva; the
Feria de la Virgen del Mar
in
Almería ; and the
Feria de San Lucas
in Jaén, among many others.
Festivals of a religious nature are a deep Andalusian tradition and are met with great popular fervor. There are numerous major festivals during
Holy Week . An annual pilgrimage brings a million visitors to the Hermitage of El Rocío in Almonte (population 16,914 in 2008); similarly large crowds visit the Santuario de Nuestra Señora de la Cabeza in Andújar every April.
Other important festivals are the
Carnival of Cádiz
and the
Fiesta de las Cruces
or
Cruz de mayo
in Granada and Córdoba; in Córdoba this is combined with a competition for among the
patios
(courtyards) of the city.
Andalusia hosts an annual festival for the dance of Flamenco in the summer-time.
Cuisine
Main article:
Andalusian cuisine
Gazpacho
served with
tropezones
(chopped vegetables).
The Andalusian diet varies, especially between the coast and the interior, but in general is a
Mediterranean diet
based on
olive oil ,
cereals ,
legumes ,
vegetables ,
fish ,
dried fruits
and
nuts , and
meat ; there is also a great tradition of drinking
wine . [ 153 ]
Fried fish — pescaíto frito —and
seafood
are common on the coast and also eaten well into the interior under coastal influence.
Atlantic bluefin tuna
( Thunnus thynnus ) from the
Almadraba
areas of the
Gulf of Cádiz ,
prawns
from
Sanlúcar de Barrameda
(known as
langostino de Sanlúcar ), and
Deepwater Rose Shrimp
( Parapenaeus longirostris ) from Huelva are all highly prized. Fishing for the Transparent Goby or
Chanquete
( Aphia minuta ), a once-popular small fish from Málaga, is now banned because the techniques used to catch them trap too many immature fish of
other species . [ 154 ]
The name
Jamón de Huelva
is protected as a
Denominación de Origen .
The mountainous regions of the Sierra Morena and Sierra Nevada produce cured
hams , notably including
jamón serrano
and
jamón ibérico . These come from two different types of pig, ( jamón serrano
from white pigs, the more expensive
jamón ibérico
from the
Black Iberian pig . There are several
Denominaciones de Origen , each with its own specifications including in just which
microclimate
region ham of a particular denomination must be cured.
Plato alpujarreño
is another mountain specialty, a dish combining ham, sausage, sometimes other pork, egg, potatoes, and olive oil.
Confectionery
is popular in Andalusia.
Almonds
and
honey
are common ingredients. Many enclosed

make and sell pastries, especially Christmas pastries:
mantecados ,
polvorones ,
pestiños ,
alfajores ,
yemas de San Leandro , as well as
churros
or
tejeringos ,
meringue
cookies ( merengadas ), and
amarguillos .
Cereal-based dishes include
migas
de harina
in eastern Andalusia (a similar dish to
couscous
rather than the fried breadcrumb based
migas
elsewhere in Spain) and a sweeter, more aromatic porridge called
poleá
in western Andalusia. Vegetables form the basis of such dishes as
alboronía
(similar to
ratatouille ) and the chopped salad known as
pipirrana
or
piriñaca . Hot and cold soups based in olive oil, garlic, bread, tomato and peppers include
gazpacho ,
salmorejo ,
porra antequerana ,
ajo caliente ,
sopa campera , or—using almonds instead of tomato— ajoblanco . [ 155 ]
Wine has a privileged place at the Andalusian table. Andalusian wines are known worldwide, especially
fortified wines
such as
sherry
( jerez ), aged in
soleras . These are enormously varied; for example, dry sherry may be the very distinct
fino ,
manzanilla ,
amontillado ,
oloroso , or
Palo Cortado
and each of these varieties can each be sweetened with
Pedro Ximénez
or
Moscatel
to produce a different variety of sweet sherry. [ 156 ] [ 157 ]
Besides sherry, Andalucía has five other
Denominaciones de Origen
for wine:
D.O. Condado de Huelva ,
D.O. Manzanilla-Sanlúcar de Barrameda ,
D.O. Málaga ,
D.O. Montilla-Moriles , and
D.O. Sierras de Málaga . [ 158 ]
Most Andalusian wine comes from one of these regions, but there are other historic wines without a
Protected Geographical Status , for example
Tintilla de Rota ,
Pajarete ,
Moscatel de Chipiona
and
Mosto de Umbrete .
Andalusia also produces D.O.
vinegar
and
brandy :
D.O. Vinagre de Jerez
and
D.O. Brandy de Jerez . [ 158 ]
Other traditions
Tiles from the Alhambra.
Sombreros cordobeses.
Sombrero de catite.
The traditional dress of 18th century Andalusia was strongly influenced by
majismo
within the context of
casticismo
(purism, traditionalism, authenticity). The archetype of the
majo
and
maja
was that of a bold, pure Spaniard from a lower-class background, somewhat flamboyant in his or her style of dress. This emulation of lower-class dress also extended to imitating the clothes of brigands and
Romani
("Gypsy") women. [ citation needed ]
Andalusian, in "Majo" dress
The
Museum of Arts and Traditions of Sevilla
has collected representative samples of a great deal of the history of Andalusian dress, including examples of such notable types of hat as the
sombrero cordobés ,
sombrero calañés ,
sombrero de catite
and the
pavero , as well as the
traje corto
and
traje de flamenca .
Andalusia has a great artisan tradition in
tile ,
leather
( see
Shell cordovan ),
weaving
(especially of the heavy
jarapa
cloth),
marquetry , and
ceramics
(especially in Jaén, Granada, and Almería),
lace
(especially Granada and Huelva),
embroidery
(in
Andévalo ),
ironwork ,
woodworking , and
basketry
in
wicker , many of these traditions a heritage of the long period of Muslim rule. [ 159 ]
Andalusia is also known for its dogs, particularly the
Andalusian Hound , which was originally bred in the region. Dogs, not just andalusian hounds, are very popular in the region.
Andalusian equestrianism, institutionalized in the
Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Art
is known well beyond the borders of Spain. The
Andalusian horse
is strongly built, compact yet elegant, distinguished in the area of
dressage
and
show jumping , and is also an excellent horse for
driving . They are known for their elegant "dancing"
gait . [ 160 ]
Sports
Team sports
La Rosaleda
is the stadium of
Málaga CF , one of four Andalusian clubs in
La Liga
In Andalusia, as throughout Spain,
football
is the predominant sport. Introduced to Spain by
British
men who worked in mining for
Rio Tinto
in the province of Huelva, the sport soon became popular with the local population. As Spain's oldest existing football club,
Recreativo de Huelva , founded 1889, is known as
El Decano
("the Dean"). [ 161 ]
For the 2015/16 season, four Andalusian clubs will compete in Spain's First Division
La Liga :
Granada CF ,
Málaga CF ,
Real Betis
and
Sevilla FC . Betis won La Liga in
1934–35
and Sevilla in the 1945–46 season. [ 162 ] [ 163 ]
The four other Andalusian teams,
Córdoba CF
and
UD Almería , play in the
Segunda División , whilst
Recreativo de Huelva , Spain's oldest club, and
Real Jaén
participate in the
Segunda División B .
The
Andalusia autonomous football team
is not in any league, and plays only
friendly matches . In recent years, they have played mostly during the Christmas break of the football leagues. They play mostly against national teams from other countries, but would not be eligible for international league play, where Spain is represented by a single national team.
In recent decades,
basketball
has become increasingly popular, with
CB Málaga , also known as
Unicaja Málaga
who have won the
Liga ACB
in 2007 and the
Korać Cup
in 2001 and usually play the
Euroleague ,
CB Sevilla
(Banca Cívica) and
CB Granada
competing at the top level in the
Liga ACB . [ 164 ]
Unlike basketball,
handball
has never really taken off in Andalusia. There is one Andalusian team in the
Liga Asobal , Spain's premier handball league:
BM Puente Genil , playing in the provincia of
Córdoba .
Andalusia's strongest showing in sports has been in
table tennis . There are two professional teams:
Cajasur Priego TM
and
Caja Granada TM , the latter being Spain's leading table tennis team, with more than 20 league championships in nearly consecutive years and 14 consecutive Copas del Rey, dominating the
Liga ENEBÉ . Cajasur is also one of the league's leading teams. [ 165 ] [ citation needed ]
Olympics
Estadio de La Cartuja
was constructed as part of
Seville 's bid to host the Summer Olympics
220 Andalusian athletes have competed in a total of 16 summer or winter
Olympic Games . The first was
Leopoldo Sáinz de la Maza , part of the silver-medal-winning
polo
team at the
1920 Summer Olympics
in
Antwerp ,
Belgium . [ citation needed ]
In all, Andalusians have won 6 gold medals, 11 silver, and 2 bronze. Winners of multiple medals include the Cordoban
boxer
Rafael Lozano
(bronze in the
1996 Summer Olympics
at
Atlanta, Georgia , USA and silver in the
2000 Summer Olympics
in
Sydney , Australia); sailor
Theresa Zabell , Malagueña by adoption (gold medals at
Barcelona
in
1992
and Atlanta in 1996). Other notable winners have been Granadan
tennis
player
Manuel Orantes
(silver in the men's singles of the
demonstration tournament
in
Mexico City
in
1968 ), Jerezano riders
Ignacio Rambla
and
Rafael Soto
(silver in
dressage
in
Athens
in
2004 ) and the
racewalker
Paquillo Fernández
from
Guadix
(silver in
Athens
in
2004 ).
The largest number of Olympic appearances were by the Malagueña swimmer
María Peláez
(five appearances), the Granadan skier
María José Rienda
(four), the Sevillian rider
Luis Astolfi
(four), and the Sevillian rower
Fernando Climent Huerta
(four, including a silver at
Los Angeles ,
California , USA in
1984 . [ 166 ]
Seville has been a pre-candidate to host the Summer Olympics in two occasions, 2004 and 2008, and Granada has been a pre-candidate to host the winter Olympics; neither has ever succeeded in its candidature. The ski resort of
Sierra Nevada , near Granada, has however hosted the
1996 Alpine World Ski Championships , and Granada will host the
2015 Winter Universiade .
Other sports
Other sporting events in Andalusia include
surfing ,
kitesurfing
and
windsurfing
competitions at
Tarifa , various
golf
tournaments at courses along the coast, and
horse racing
and polo at several locations in the interior. Andalusia hosted the
1999 World Championships in Athletics
(Seville), the
2005 Mediterranean Games
(Almería) and the
FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996
(Granada), among other major events. There is also the annual
Vuelta a Andalucía
bicycle road race and the
Linares chess tournament .
Sister region
Andalusia has a
sister region
relationship with
Buenos Aires ,
Argentina
since 2001. [ 167 ]

Only a few years after the lslamic conquest of Spain,
al-Andalus
appears in coin inscriptions as the Arabic equivalent of
Hispania . The traditionally held view that the etymology of this name has to do with the Vandals is shown to have no serlous foundation. The phonetic, morphosyntactic, and also historical problems connected with this etymology are too numerous. Moreover, the existence of this name in various parts of central and northern Spain proves that
al-Andalus
cannot be derived from this
Germanic tribe . It was the original name of the Punta Manoqui near Tarifa; very soon, it became generalized to designate the whole Peninsula. Undoubtedly, the name is of Pre-Indo-European origin. The parts of this compound ( anda
and
luz ) are frequent in the indigenous toponymy of the Iberian Peninsula.

El Manifiesto andalucista de Córdoba describió a Andalucía como realidad nacional en 1919, cuyo espíritu los andaluces encauzaron plenamente a través del proceso de autogobierno recogido en nuestra Carta Magna. En 1978 los andaluces dieron un amplio respaldo al consenso constitucional. Hoy, la Constitución, en su artículo 2, reconoce a Andalucía como una nacionalidad en el marco de la unidad indisoluble de la nación española.
