A Belgian White (Witbier)  brewed by
Brewery Ommegang (Moortgat)
Cooperstown, New York USA
ABV : 5.1%
Glassware : Snifter
Poured from the bomber a cloudy yellow bordering on orange with a nice head. The aroma had floral notes and a whole ton of citrus. Mild banana in the nose as well with hints of vanilla. Had with a lobster and it went perfect with the soft meat and the smooth butter. Overall the beer was smooth and balanced but at times there was nearly too much orange or citrus as it may be. On the palate it has a feel which is creamy with nutty wheat and crisp carbonation with mild spice additions adding a dry element contrasting the tang of the citrus. For the style it is up there on my list.
Beer Advocate food pairing suggestions:  Cheese (peppery; Monterey / Pepper Jack, tangy; Brick, Edam, Feta) General (Salad) Meat (Poultry, Fish, Shellfish)

Home Brewing: How to make a bad beer better (The art of the michelada)

Have a bad macro kicking around the fridge that you don’t want to give out and you don’t want to drink yourself? Well, you could do what I do: Make a michelada.
The michelada is a popular Mexican  alcoholic beverage  of a genre known in  Spanish  as  cerveza preparada  (prepared beer) and in  English as a variety of  cocktail . There are several variations. In some cases it is similar to a  Bloody Mary  but containing  beer  instead of  vodka , although a less complicated concoction of Mexican beer with sauces and  lime  juice added (see recipe below) is also referred to as a Michelada.
In traveling to Mexico – which I tend to do often – I was at first disgusted by the mixure. In Monterrey, Mexico where my in-laws live they take lime juice (fresh), a little pepper, some hot sauce or maybe salsa,  Worcestershire sauce , and Clamato and a light Mexican beer. Beers I have used include Negro Modelo, Sol, Tecate, Indio and some others. Corona is not allowed within city borders thank God.
Recently, major  American beer  producers have begun marketing  cervezas preparada , illustrating the wide variety of recipes in the Chelada/ Michelada category. For example,  Miller Brewing Company  produces  Miller Chill  which is a “Chelada-style light lager with a hint of salt and lime”. Going a different route,  Anheuser-Busch  is manufacturing  Bud Light Chelada  as a combination of lager,  clamato , lime juice, and salt.
I warn, you will not like this drink at first but after a bit it will take on the same appeal as margarita. You won’t want it everyday – maybe once a month – but it is a nice way to spice up a cheap macro.
