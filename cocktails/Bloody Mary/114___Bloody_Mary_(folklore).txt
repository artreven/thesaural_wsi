Golden Dreams
The Unwritten #35
Hmmm, how much can I say about this issue without spoiling all the good stuff? Probably not a lot. Tom Taylor has his great confrontation with Pullman. There’s some fighting and quite a bit of talking. Pullman reveals who he really is, who Tom really is, and what he really wants. The Leviathan makes its return, and we lose two of our cast members.
Verdict:
Thumbs up. A masterful ending to this storyarc, and to quite a few other things in this series. Don’t miss it — and if you haven’t been reading this series, I really don’t know why you’ve been skipping it.
Batwoman #7
Batwoman finally catches up to the hook-handed madman who attacked Bette Kane weeks ago, and when she tears the hook out of his arm, she gets a major surprise when the
hook
itself starts talking to her. Meanwhile, while Jacob Kane continues to try to get through to his niece Bette, lost in a coma after being attacked, and while Cameron Chase of the D.E.O. tries to get Kate Kane to break a prisoner out of the Gotham P.D. under her girlfriend’s nose, Falchion, head of Medusa, assembles a team of urban legends with the aid of his wizard Maro — the aforementioned
Hook , Killer Croc transmogrified into a mutated
sewer alligator ,
La Llorona , the Crying Woman, who has been a villain in previous issues of this comic, and the truly terrifying
Bloody Mary , summoned from a mirror and out of your nightmares. Don’t believe she’s scary?
Yeah, that’ll definitely keep me from chanting her name into a mirror.
Verdict:
Thumbs up. Still the best looking comic on the stands — and it’s too bad that Amy Reeder will soon be departing this series. Besides that, we get excellent scenes with Jacob Kane, good relationship stuff with Maggie Sawyer, and Falchion’s amazingly creepy urban legends. Good stuff, and you better be reading this.
Demon Knights #7
We get an all-out, wall-to-wall battle in this issue. Jason Blood goes to Hell to find the one substance that can revive Madame Xanadu. Vandal Savage turns on Mordred and the Questing Queen to steal from them and save his own hide. The Horsewoman seeks aid in the nearest city. The Shining Knight faces the Queen in battle, and Xanadu duels Mordred. How will this battle turn out for everyone?
Verdict:
Thumbs up. The action here is almost nonstop, and it all works out very, very well.
Today’s Cool Links:
“Womanthology” isn’t going to be a one-off project — it’s going to be an
ongoing series . (Still waiting to receive my copy so I can review it, by the way)
Why won’t book publishers put Jack Kirby art on the covers of
books about Jack Kirby ?
Ms. Marvel is
getting a promotion .
Everything Bruce Campbell does is awesome, but
this takes the cake .
