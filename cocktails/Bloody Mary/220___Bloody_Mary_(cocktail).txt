NYT Wednesday 4/21/10 - Car Pool
I like thematic grids that spatially correspond to something in the real world - I tried to incorporate that into some of my cryptic puzzles. So the theme of this Wednesday
New York Times
crossword particularly appealed to me, with its cars parked diagonally along the edge of the grid (symmetrically disposed too!) as if it represents a street running from west (left) to east (right).
The cars theme was evident after just over a minute, well before I found the central explanation at around 4 minutes. I got rather too enthusiastic about predicting car manufacturers along the bottom, going for
Lotus
rather than
Lexus
in the middle.
Lotus
is car manufacturer, but their products are unlikely to be seen along America's "Main Street" and it was a little foolish of me to think it would appear in an American crossword.
I got lucky with one dodgy crossing: not knowing 68a
ALDO , I was glad to have seen
Koi
(64-Down) today in a pond here at
Mohonk Mountain House , where Magdalen and I are on a mini-break to celebrate our second (cotton/china) wedding anniversary. This determined my choice of clip for
Dino
(16-Across) - I couldn't resist the first Flintstones clip that came up, even though it doesn't include their pet.
Unfortunately, I fell foul of another tough crossing: at 48a
ATF
and 48d
Fleer , I had no clue about the intersecting letter, eventually going for S of the many potential options, because the across clue looked like it had a plural answer. I don't feel
too
stupid about this, because I definitely haven't blogged about
Fleer
before. I have twice solved puzzles with
ATF
in (invariably clued with respect to the agency), but they were both Sunday puzzles, where a gap in my acquired knowledge sticks out less.
Solving time: 9 mins ( solo, no solving aids, two wrong answers )
Clue of the puzz: 35d
spaces out

16a
Dino
{Flintstones' pet}.
Dino
(pronounced
dee-no ) featured in the
Hanna-Barbera
animated television series
The Flintstones , and its spinoffs. He is a pet dinosaur
of the series' main characters,
Fred
and
Wilma Flintstone . In the show, he was a metaphorical pet
dog, and
exhibited the characteristics of a typical domesticated canine. He is
some generic
sauropod / prosauropod
type. He frequently leapt upon Fred
Flintstone, yapping happily, and energetically licked his face. Dino
could also be moved to anger, at which point he would snarl and snap. He
also loves to play with
Pebbles
and
Bamm-Bamm . His species, as told in episode eighteen, is
Snorkasaurus. The above clip doesn't feature Dino, but is relevant to what Magdalen and I are celebrating today (Wednesday)!

12d
Mott's
{Big name in applesauce}.
Mott's
is a company involved in producing apple-based
products, particularly juices and sauces.
The company was founded in 1842 by Samuel R. Mott in
Bouckville, NY , who made apple cider and vinegar.
Mott products were exhibited at Philadelphia's
Centennial Exposition
in 1876 and Chicago's
World's Columbian Exposition
in
1893. In 1900 the company merged with the
W.B. Duffy
Cider Company to become
Duffy-Mott . In 1933 the company
introduced prune juice. Eventually, the company was acquired by
American Brands
(formerly
American Tobacco ) and became a division
of that conglomerate. In 1982,
Cadbury Schweppes
purchased the
Duffy-Mott Company. In early 2006 all of Mott's beverage brands ( Grandma's
Molasses ,
Hawaiian Punch ,
IBC
Root Beer ,
Mr and Mrs T
Bloody Mary
mix,
Orangina ,
and
Yoo-hoo )
were folded into
Cadbury
Schweppes Americas Beverages . Mott's continues to operate as a
separate unit of
Dr Pepper Snapple Group
(recently demerged
from
Cadbury Schweppes plc ).

Thanks for the info Aaron. I'd have floundered in competition over the ATF/Fleer business. I have a Cruciverbal Cheat Sheet planned to cover the U.S. Depts., as I must get them under my belt before the next ACPT.
