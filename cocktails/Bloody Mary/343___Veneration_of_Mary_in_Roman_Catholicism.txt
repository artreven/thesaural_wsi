More Information
Our Lady of Guadalupe
Our Lady of Guadalupe
( Spanish :
Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe ), also the
Virgin of Guadalupe
(Virgen de Guadalupe) is a
Roman Catholic
icon
of the
Virgin Mary . The tradition relates that on 9 December 1531,
Juan Diego , a recently converted
Aztec
peasant , had a vision of a young woman, a lady, while on a hill in the
Tepeyac
desert, near
Mexico City . The lady in the vision asked him to build a church where they stood on the hill. Juan Diego told the local
Bishop ,
Juan de Zumárraga , of the apparition; doubtful, he asked for proof. Juan Diego later returned to the Tepeyac desert hill; again, the lady appeared to Juan Diego, who told her of the bishop’s request for proof of her apparition. The lady then instructed Juan Diego to go to the hill top, where he found
Castillian
roses – native to Durango, the bishop’s Spanish home town – and which did not bloom in winter. Juan Diego cut the roses, placed them in the
apron
of his
tilma
cloak, and delivered them to the bishop; an imprint of the
Blessed Virgin Mary
appeared on the
tilma , formed by the soil and the Castillian roses. The
tilma
icon
is displayed in the
Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe , which is among the most-visited
Marian shrines
in the Roman Catholic religious world. [ 1 ]
The icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe is Mexico’s most popular religious and cultural image, it appears bearing the titles: the
Queen of Mexico , [ 2 ]
the
Empress of the Americas , [ 3 ]
and the
Patroness of the Americas . [ 4 ]
Throughout the Mexican national history of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Guadalupan name and image have been unifying national symbols; the first
President of Mexico
(1824–29) changed his name from José Miguel Ramón Adaucto Fernández y Félix to
Guadalupe Victoria
in honor of the
Virgin of Guadalupe . Father
Miguel Hidalgo , in the
Mexican War of Independence
(1810), and
Emiliano Zapata , in the
Mexican Revolution
(1910) led their respective armed forces with Guadalupan
flags
emblazoned with an image of
Our Lady of Guadalupe . In 1999, the Church officially proclaimed her the
Patroness of the Americas , the
Empress of Latin America , and the
Protectress of Unborn Children . [ 5 ]
