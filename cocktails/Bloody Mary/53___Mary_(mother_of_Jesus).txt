______________________________
It’s hard to call the vandalisation of the cross in
Kiev
a mere “lapse in ethics”. It’s a challenge to the existing cultural order, which is based on the
Cross … on the sacrifice of the
Saviour . You see, today, millions of people… both believers and non-believers,
Christians
and
agnostics … live in accordance with moral principles that simply couldn’t exist if, two thousand years ago, there was
Golgotha . Of course, the destruction of the cross for the sake of fleeting publicity is rubbish. Unfortunately, however, it’s not only foolishness… it’s something much worse. Again, bear in mind that the Christian cross is the basis of modern culture. Logically, historically, aesthetically, morally… whichever way you wish to view it. The rejection of the cross is a renunciation of the inner meaning of our cultural life, a repudiation of the standards held by millions of people over the centuries. Our history records all of this.
In addition, this action is absurd because these people were supposedly freedom-fighters, but they destroyed a cross erected in memory of those who suffered in the
time of repressions , who asserted our right to be free. The inspiration to cut down the cross didn’t come from nowhere. Those who declare that the limitless creative freedom of the artist is always right prepared the ground for this. Alas, amongst them are respectable journalists, experts, writers, and musicians… who fight for the freedom to insult and mock. This, I repeat, isn’t just a trivial anti-Church campaign; it’s a demand for the dismantling of Christian civilisation. The fact that this event took place during the visit of our
First Hierarch
to
Poland
only strengthens our desire to work together with Polish
Catholics
to defend traditional
Christian values
​​in Europe. We don’t want to leave our children a society built on lies and hatred, a society that has no fear of the consequences of its actions, a society that glorifies the haters of the
Christian faith .

Editor’s Note:
You have to look beneath the surface to see what
Vladimir Romanovich  is criticising. As
John Baldoni
wrote in
Forbes
in re
Todd Akin :
Akin made another mistake… one that’s all too common in today’s “apologise and it will go away” culture. Akin has made himself the focus on his apology, not the millions of women he’d insulted. Akin also attempted to disavow his insult by claiming that he had used a poor choice of words. As  Ben Franklin  said, “Never ruin an apology with an excuse”.  When you watch Akin apologise , you get the feeling that he cares more about his candidacy than he does about anything else.

That’s what “a society that has no fear of the consequences of its actions” means. Some of the vilest flowers of evil flourish in supposedly-Christian precincts. A rotten Christian is FAR worse than the worst unbeliever is. Do give it some thought…

______________________________
Russian Flag
Day was established by presidential decree in 1994. In a move that seems natural to the eyes of modern Russians, the “tricolour” displaced the
Soviet red flag
during the
August coup  three years earlier. On 22 August 1991, President
Boris Yeltsin
approved the pre-revolutionary white-blue-red flag as the national flag of the new Russia.
The colours that became symbolic of the
Russian Federation
appeared for the first time in the state flag back in 1668. The so-called “flag of the king of Moscovy” was raised aboard the first Russian warship of Western design, the
Oryol , built under
Tsar
Aleksei Mikhailovich . Later, his son, Tsar
Pyotr Veliki , adopted the “tricolour” as a state flag, standardising it according to the colours flown on the 12-gun warship
Svatoy Pyotr,
which sailed on the
White Sea . The main symbol of the country, in one form or another, maintained this white-blue-red configuration until 1858. Tsar
Aleksandr Nikolayevich
made significant changes to the appearance of the flag; he used the heraldic colours of the
Romanov Dynasty … black, yellow, and white… for the state banner. During the
socialist era , the state flag became a red banner, up to 1923 it bore the golden letters “ RSFSR ” (in the
Cyrillic alphabet ), and, after that, it had a golden hammer and sickle with a five-pointed star.

Ex-Mayor
Ed Koch
(1924- ) of
New York City … one of my fave people. Anyone who said, “If you say you agree with me on everything, you’re either insane or kissing my ass. If we agree on what’s in front of us, we can work together”, is A-Number One in my book. If more of us followed that credo, there’d be less friction and bullshit in the world.

Madonna, the State Department, and the White House Have It All Wrong: The Russian Orthodox Church Is the Victim, Not Pussy Riot
This week, a Russian court sentenced three
feminist
punk  performers who call themselves
Pussy Riot
to prison for two years. The three women were charged with “ hooliganism ”. The graveness of the charge was described by the
New York Times
of 18 August:
The case began in February when the women infiltrated the
Cathedral of Christ the Saviour
wearing colourful
balaclavas , and pranced around in front of the golden
Holy Doors
leading to the
altar , dancing, chanting, and lip-syncing for what would later become a music video of a profane song in which they beseeched the
Virgin Mary
to rid
Russia  of Mr
Putin .
Stalin
deliberately destroyed the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in
Moscow . It was rebuilt in 1992, after the fall of the
Soviet Union
under
Mikhail Gorbachyov , it’s one of Moscow’s architectural gems, and, now, once again, a heavily-used Russian Orthodox church. The
Times
reported on the  Russian Orthodox Church ’s reaction to Pussy Riot:
On Friday, the Russian Orthodox Church issued a statement that referred to
Nazi
aggression and the
militant atheism
of the
Soviet era , which said, “What happened is blasphemy and sacrilege, the conscious and deliberate insult to the sanctuary and a manifestation of hostility to millions of people”.
Judge Syrova, when delivering her decision, according to the
Times , found that the action in the church was “motivated by religious hatred”.
The
Western
cultural élite is rallying to the defence of the disrupters in the cathedral. Some approve of the verbal attack on Putin. Others support the denunciation of the Russian Orthodox Church leadership and the church disruption because the Church leadership supports Putin. All cited characterise the issue as one of free speech. I don’t. I’d assume that many Pussy Riot supporters would take a different position, and rightly so, if here in the
USA , a
black church
were invaded and three men or women engaged in comparable conduct insulting holy places within the church and the pastor. I recall when I was Mayor in 1989, and the
AIDS
activist group
Act Up , unjustifiably angry with
John Cardinal O’Connor , invaded
St Patrick’s Cathedral
and interrupted the
Mass , throwing the
Communion wafers … which for
Catholics
are the actual
Body of Christ … to the floor. Some were arrested. So far as I can recall, no one was punished. I think the decision of the Russian court to punish a hate crime was just and to be applauded, rather than condemned and ridiculed. One can argue concerning the degree of punishment, whether fines rather than jail time should have been imposed, but that’s a function of the Russian penalty procedures.
I also believe it isn’t in the interest of the
USA
to support the actions of the Pussy Riot defendants. At a time when the
Iranian nuclear threat
grows by the day and we’re fighting
Islamic extremists
around the world, we should be seeking to enlist President Putin to join the West in our effort to prevent the Islamist fanatics from achieving their goal of destroying
Western civilisation , not making him the enemy and Pussy Riot the victim. The attacks on President Putin for “squelching free speech” included one by
Madonna
performing at the time in Moscow.
The extent of the culture clash was evident this month when Madonna paused during a concert in Moscow to urge the release of the women, who have been jailed since March, and performed in a black bra with “Pussy Riot” stencilled in bold letters on her back. The next day,
Dmitri Rogozin , a deputy prime minister, posted a
Twitter
message calling Madonna a “whore”.
Madonna’s an artist, always testing the limits of decency, and, often, going beyond restrictions accepted by ordinary people. However, I don’t defer to her judgment on such political matters. Most shocking to me was the response of the
White House , as reported by the
Times :
In
Washington , where
Obama administration
officials followed the trial closely, seeing it as a measure of Mr Putin’s new presidency and its own troubled relations with Russia, the White House and the  State Department  each criticised the verdict. The State Department all but called on Russia’s higher courts to overturn the conviction and “ensure that the right to freedom of expression is upheld”. A White House spokesman, Tommy Vietor, said the verdict was disappointing and the sentences disproportionate, saying, ”While we understand that the group’s behaviour was offensive to some, we have serious concerns about the way these young women have been treated by the
Russian judicial system ”.
Offensive to some? I don’t believe the issue is properly one of freedom of expression. The right to free expression isn’t unlimited, and it doesn’t mean one can say anything anywhere and at anytime. Furthermore, Russia and most countries don’t have embedded in their law the
Constitutional
protection of the
First Amendment
that we do. I, for one, am delighted they now punish religious hatred. Aren’t you?

Editor’s Note:
The above post is an example of Mayor Koch’s dictum… I don’t agree with his POV on the Iranian nuclear threat and I have some problems with his take on Islamism, but since the Pussy Riot affair is “what’s before us”, that doesn’t matter. We should all remember that… often, your best ally in a given situation may be someone who disagrees with you on another. I believe in that.
