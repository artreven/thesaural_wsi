Unveiling the Aureola Via Robin Tunney (Amended with Cake!)
An
aureola
or
aureole
(diminutive of
Latin
aurea , "golden") is the radiance of luminous cloud which, in
paintings
of sacred personages, surrounds the whole figure. In the earliest periods of
Christian
art
this splendour was confined to the figures of the persons of the
Christian Godhead , but it was afterwards extended to the
Virgin Mary
and to several of the
saints . Aureola Wikipedia Our Lady of Guadeloupe with the Zebra type radiating energy lines or Aureola. The idea has been introduced in these pages that the subtle bodies of our movie stars are becoming visible when a shift in Konsciousness is allowed. Let's explore the idea further with examples from the new series featuring Robin Tunney, "The Mentalist". See
E.T. Ipsissimus of the A.:A.:
for details. Robin Tunney is seen with Zebra type stripes radiating from her upper body (above) and head (below). The context creating this phenomena, from the usual perspective, is the wardrobe of actors moving behind her person. Star shapes, like the numerous ones below, are often seen bobbing up and down around the Stars...
I love how the CBS Eye logo and network watermark playfully interacts with this seven pointed star. In the image below one Star is seen 'emanating' from her head. Below we see a bright solar flare, caused by the interaction of our nearest star and the camera lens, while the sheriff's star and the CBS eye move in front of our synchromystic Isis and actress Star. I have often seen lens flares create hexagons and octagons over the silver screen. New here? Lost? Wandering what the &%$!! is all this sync and Robin Tunney talk? You've arrived at the deep end but no worries just try: Z is for Zebra Tunney Trilogy
Galactic Center Temple
or just turn of your 'thinking mind' and follow along with your 'knowing heart'.
A rainbow colored heart shaped necklace hits the border of Tunney's physical aspect, sync kissing hello. If we look closely (below) we note about 4 stars virtually swirling around the Stargate Queen as the 'light spectrum heart' enters the scene. See
StarMummy
for the Tunney as Isis and the Heart as Galactic Center exploration Also
Scarlet Dragon The heart and the eye in shot with Tunney's head filling the left half of the screen. In the following the sequence we note the eye tracing horizontally the human spirit pillar. The core of the subtle body, with the all seeing eye moving in alignment. It hits various
chakras
or energy centers as the camera moves. A lovely double Circle H, single Circle M (We3 Spinner) with a tiny satellite Circle R. She
moves into frame, the arrow penetrating her profile while Circle M briefly forms a halo. Circle H has taken over as vivifying crown, an arrow exits the left side of her
temple . Circle R has moved in for the kiss, fitting and hilariously susynct. Circle R was much discussed as the copyright talisman and Batman sidekick symbol, also a Robin in
E.T. Ipsissimus of the A.:A.: Cake HH and Robin Tunney Sync Wink Micheal
from Gosporn birthday post
with HH sync wink. Micheal was the
first STARG8TOR to blog about the HH . Me and Steve's latest collaboration
(video below), featuring the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson in The Matrix Reloaded) eating a slice of Matrix cake.. Babylon A.D, Jericho, and the Last Zion O.K look carefully, below... A star is about to kiss Tunney. As the star touches her, the eye has come into perfect alignment with her subtle body pillar. Don't get a fright, just stay calm.. A light emanating vortex with associated wisps of blue dancing and swooshing energy beams opens over lead actor Simon Baker (Patrick Jane a.k.a "The Mentalist") in the still image below. At the same time two balls of energy have formed over Tunney's head, a strange blue purple one and a subtle but perfectly round yellow one. The yellow one has chosen to appear directly in front of a window with sunlight pouring through blinds accentuating the starlight effect and vivifying Tunney's Aureola. From the regular awareness this is nothing but the network placing a stylized reminder of what show we are watching, should we have tuned in late and an announcement of the next show. Our balls of light appear one more time directly above Robin's head as the "tear in the space time fabric" opens inside the interrogation room.. Another fine example of the radiating Zebra type energy lines, as seen in portrayals of Our Lady of Guadeloupe. Try and imagine time removed in these frames of the purple stripes radiating from Tunney. If we could impose all these images, or overlay them on top of each other, what would we see? I imagine a sudden burst of stripes waxing and waning, ebbing and flowing like flames around her body. Want to see this mental image realized? I sure do. The technology and Konsciousness exits to turn this vision into reality. We have only scratched the surface of what can be done with synchromysticism. Imagine Kurt Russel as Snake Plissken flying towards the WTC then stepping through the Stargate, still as Snake. We could do it, animate and integrate. Tunney stepping through the looking glass in "The Craft", exiting atop the Pillarmids in "Gargoyles". Who knows? Explore, reinterpret, adapt and create your own vision. This realization, the environment as part of the subtle body or visible 'organism-environment-field' (an Alan Watts term)
is not limited to cinema. I have recently sat in awe as a big photograph of a blossoming lotus flower moved into alignment with the crown of my friend Jim inside a coffee shop. We were talking about the growing Konsciousness on the planet when I noticed a real life flowering, right in front of my eyes. See his new post
OZ BORN
and blog
CentrePortal
for insight and exploration of the mystery of what is happening with Konsciousness in these times. I
wonder
about that myself, all the time... I imagine this kind of insight will increase and be noticed by many more exponentially as Konsciousness syncs in deeper and aligns. I acknowledge the God inside you. Muse - Starlight "Our hopes and expectations Black holes and revelations"

Like the idea of taking all these syncs and re-editing all these clips to create something new.

I happened to be musing over AUS and remembered that the Southern Lights are Aurora Aus[Oz]tralis. The latest vid = flowing. I notice that Jericho means 'Moon'. So does the trumpets blowing down the walls some kind of veiled attack on the Moon. Gurdjieff apparently claimed most humes ' were food for the Moon'. perhaps a stargatey attempt to move beyond the strictness of lunar cycles Thinking of the Leon Haywood song - Don't push it, don't force it,
Let it happen naturally. It will surely happen
If it was meant to be! Cheers

jake, wow.
Ive got a story.... First off, the other day (the 14th) i asked myself about blue beam as a possibility and how I desired confirmation of some sort.
So i look up and over to the left side of the street.
What do I see?
A playground with BLUE BEAMs in the middle of it.
Yesterday, I came across a site describing annunaki and how aliens, from sirius, created the household cat we know today.
Then I watched a video of me as a 16 year old messing around.... http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=tkeyCYbjhSE theres a horned "demon" on my shirt, a bullseye, cats on a blanket (of course) and me RANDOMLY (sarcasm) saying "im a alien or something"

Ben I like that there are Dark Star and Alien Workshop sk8board chariot brands. Actually it's a goldmine of interesting syncs. Tony Hawk?
Judging by your video I must confess I agree with your assessment. You are an alien or something. Dig it.. Dr Do Little

The circle R is on the head of Geena Davis in a League of Their Own.... Her Baseball team is the Rockford Peaches. Madonna plays a lady called Mae Mordabito
and Geena's sister is named Kit Keller.... Also Kit Keller has the number 23 on her jersey. 23 passes in and out of Geena's body at random. Thanks and Love.

Interesting Shaman. Geena Davis is in "Earth Girls are Easy" with Green Man/Fool Jim Carrey and Jeff 'Sci:Fi' Goldblum (both as aliens along with Black Star Damon Wayans).. Hhhmmm? The aliens were furry and differently colored...
Bet it would be interesting to find out what colors... She's also in this classic (in certain wacky circles) 911 sync from "The Long Kiss Goodnight". I've yet to investigate all that, looks promising.
Anyway, Good Night!

Great post. Very illuminating. I have a couple of burning off-topic questions. What do you make of the current statistics-defying trend of celebrities having twins? As "as below resonators of cosmic consciousness" which you endorse, is there some occult reason this is happening with such frequency at this time?
The Jolie/Pitt twins born in a cloud of mystery in France and her nearly instantaneous return to her fit pre-pregnancy body seems particularly strange and unsettling. Secondly, I have been noticing honeycomb symbolism virtually everywhere these days.
Honeycomb-bees-Merovingian bloodlines-interconnected hexagons...any ideas on significance and why this is showing up so ubiquitously now?

Yee HaW!!!(YHWH) *In regards to Ghost world Image* 'UN'forgettable ... 'U'nited 'N'ations?
No that can't bee.. wait...Sky blue being their peaceful color too! Wow Mom! then I read - UN CRUMB. UN CRUMBLE? You can't just add 'le' to crumble without a reason!!! Ok...We also have a
raptor on a UN blue shirt. Raptors are extinct. Ghost world seems to hint towards extinction as well. Crumble in my mind is JUSTified ;) "Accentuate the negative" you say? Well I can think of Rwanda as the first example, I know of, where they definitely accomplished just that :(
-UNITED artists fabricated this movie. Then WORLD in 'Ghost World' and Nations share definition as well. I was taught so called Prophesy by a religion I won't mention when I was younger. One of their specialty's was the book of Revelations. In which they taught me the prophesy leading up to the 1000 years without Satan. One of these steps leading to utopia is the annihilation of the united nations due to there none effectiveness. War is on the mind guys and the fact that the army boots the Ghost girls are wearing resonate that and underline my possible paranoid preminations. Sorry Jake if I went out of bounds on this one.

Mini Gemini Post.
One more thing... This poster points to Gemini through its bizarre twin symbolism. Thora Birch is a Gemini and a dog too(1982).The movie was released in July 2001. I forgot all about this movie maybe I should fucking watch it!

The Cake synch is one of my faves, the big-O cake in the second Matrix film, the White Album track Savoy Truffle 'cake', the "time-extending drug from Eastern Europe" from the Brass Eye 'Drugs' episode a very funny Little Britain sketch, "carrot cake, carrot cake, have ye any nuts? ...... the carrot cake contains - no nuts." the pie-fight first-version ending of Dr. Strangelove

Circle R is one thing. What say you about the square, thus cube, R for Restricted movies??? Noticed the R while compiling images for my new post. I left them in the images.

'Earth Girls Are Easy'? - if you mean inferior aliens coming here and taking them by force, as the Old Testament even continues to say happened, then yes there's truth in that. Real Earth men however, do not have attitudes like yours towards women, and real women wouldn't drop their men for anyone that thinks of things the way you do.

In the first picture, the "eye" is fixed at a point just below Robin's neck. In the painting below, there is a mark (labia?) in that spot.
In the fourth picture, a drinking straw is pointing to it. Also, the plump woman below has a blue heart necklace over the same spot. Can somebody let me know if there is some kind of significance about that area on the chest? I'm rather new at "synchromysticism" stuff, so forgive me if this is an elementary question... The reason why I ask is that I've had a large dimple in my chest in that spot, my whole life. Feels like a "dent in my chest" when i press down on it.

speaking of the chest, are you aware, jake, that the areola is the circle of skin surrounding the nipple?

Robin's definitely starting to take on that androgynous look I remember seeing in a lot of women in Boston once they approached middle age. Robin is also an androgynous name.
