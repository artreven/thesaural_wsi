Tough Enough to Wear Pink....
So, I get all prepared, put on my pink shirt, go out in public and everything....
I come back home proud of my accomplishment (not much of one I wear the shirt regularly, but hey... give me credit anyway)
I'm wearing it to support my Grandma Shaw, who passed from breast cancer a few years ago.
So I get home all proud of myself for supporting Grandma...
I point out my massive accomplishment to my family at the dinner table when we do our, "What was your favorite part of today?" (We do this every dinnertime... It's an awesomely painful tradition where my daughters all try desperately to get out of finding something good that happened today.)
Only to hear my eldest daughter saying, "That's not pink, it's salmon."
I felt so deflated.
Sorry Grandma.
It was salmon.
Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but rather we have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.
- -- Aristotle
Believe nothing on the faith of traditions, even though they have been held in honor for many generations and in diverse places. Do not believe a thing because many people speak of it. Do not believe on the faith of the sages of the past. Do not believe what you yourself have imagined, persuading yourself that a God inspires you. Believe nothing on the sole authority of your masters and priests. After examination, believe what you yourself have tested and found to be reasonable, and conform your conduct thereto.
- -- The Buddha

That's okay it still counts.
Have to admit when I read the title I thought you were coming out.
Or as some would say, finally coming out.

LOL.
Do you really believe I would ever be bashful enough to hang in the closet?

It is strange how fashions change, pink used to be considered to be a male colour and blue was female.
In Western culture, the practice of assigning pink to an individual gender began in the 1920s [12]
or earlier. [13]
An article in the trade publication
Earnshaw's Infants' Department
in June 1918 said: "The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys,
and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided
and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is
more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl." [14]
From then until the 1940s, pink was considered appropriate for boys
because being related to red it was the more masculine and decided
color, while blue was considered appropriate for girls because it was
the more delicate and dainty color, or related to the
Virgin Mary . [15] [16] [17]
Since the 1940s, the societal norm was inverted; pink became considered appropriate for girls and
blue
appropriate for boys, a practice that has continued into the 21st century. [18]

Grind and Legion, they make such a lovely couple!

Red is a strong color, the color of socialism and fascism. Blue is the color of pussy conservatives.
In America, this pattern still repeats itself, with our conservatives being blue and our neo-fascists being red. Our socialists and liberals are nowhere in sight.
