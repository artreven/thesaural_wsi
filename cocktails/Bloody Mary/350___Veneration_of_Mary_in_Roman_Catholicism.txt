Celebrating Mexico's 201st Anniversary in Oakland, CA!
It is fun to see my Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar experience come full circle. I left for Mexico City on August 19th 2010 and soon after celebrated with Mexicans the bicentennial of their country's independence.
Now, yesterday on September 15th (the eve of Mexican Independence Day) I spoke to the Oakland Rotary Club about my experiences living and studying in the beautiful country that is our southern neighbor.
I also attended the San Francisco Rotary Club meeting on Tuesday (the second oldest club) and have plans to speak there on January 10th.

Where the Virgin of Guadalupe was first sighted
Recently we visited the Basilica of the Virgin de Guadalupe. It is found in the north of the city, amid a bustling community.  The new basilica is huge and very sterile...it resembles a train station. The old basilica just behind it, is beautiful with a museum inside with artwork and tributes to the Virgin.  And, just behind that basilica, is the real treasure, the chapel that was built on the hill where the Virgin was first sighted.
Here is some background on the Virgin de Guadalupe:
Our Lady of Guadalupe
( Spanish :
Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe ), also known as the
Virgin of Guadalupe
( Spanish :
Virgen de Guadalupe ;
Nahuatl :
Tonantzin Guadalupe ) is a celebrated
Catholic
icon
of the
Virgin Mary .
According to tradition,
Juan Diego , a simple
indigenous
peasant , saw a vision of a young woman on December 9, 1531. While he was on the hill in the desert of
Tepeyac
near
Mexico City , the lady told him to build a church exactly on the spot where they were standing. He told the local
bishop ,
who asked for some proof. He went back and saw the vision again. He
told the lady that the bishop wanted proof, and she said "Bring the
roses behind you." When he looked behind, he saw a bunch of roses
growing. He cut the roses, placed them in his poncho and returned to the
bishop. When he arrived to the bishop, he said he had brought proof.
When he opened his poncho, instead of roses there was a picture of the
young lady in the vision. Today, the
icon
is displayed in the
Basilica of Guadalupe
nearby, one of the most visited Catholic shrines in the world. [ 1 ]
The Virgin of Guadalupe is Mexico's most popular religious and cultural image, with the titles "Queen of Mexico", [ 2 ]
"Empress of the Americas", [ 3 ]
and "Patroness of the Americas"; [ 4 ]
both
Miguel Hidalgo
(in the
Mexican War of Independence ) and
Emiliano Zapata
(during the
Mexican Revolution ) carried
flags
bearing the Our Lady of Guadalupe, and
Guadalupe Victoria , the first
Mexican president
changed his name in honor of the
icon .

The Amazing Pyramids to the Sun and Moon (Teotihuacan, Mex)
We finally made the 2 hour trek north to the gorgeous indigenous pyramids of Teotihuacan in the State of Mexico. These pyramids (along with the city below them) were built in @ 100 BCE to honor the Gods of the Sun and the Moon.

Day trip to nearby Cuernavaca
A day trip to nearby Cuernavaca. Apparently there are more than 20 Spanish language schools here. Nice day trip, 1 hour south of Mexico City in the state of Morelos. Beautiful rolling hills.
