Crowds flock to Virgin miracle tree in New Jersey – Yahoo! News

Crowds flock to Virgin miracle tree in New Jersey – Yahoo! News .
Before I comment on this story, let me first say that I am in no way disparaging the
Catholic church
or its devoted followers. All people have a right to think and believe whatever they like.
But come on. A tree knot that looks like
Our Lady of Guadalupe ? It seems like kind of a stretch.
And just between you and me, it kind of looks like a part of the female anatomy. Man, I hope that didn’t come off as blasphemous.
I just find it hard to believe that the face of
Jesus
might suddenly appear on a potato chip or the image of the
Virgin Mary
could come through on a stained sidewalk. I did once excrete something that looked like
Richard Nixon , but that’s another story.
Think of it this way: Is
God
so bored that he or any other spiritual entity decide to start popping up in
tree bark
and snack foods? I think not.
I suppose the good thing is that this unusual
Ginkgo biloba
tree is bringing people together in a town riddled with crime. You go right ahead, my Catholic friends.
And sorry for that female body part comment. I know I’m a heathen.

Looks like a bootle of Absolut Vodka to me. Maybe she was a drinker?
