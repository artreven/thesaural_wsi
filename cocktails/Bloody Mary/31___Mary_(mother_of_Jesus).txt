Flipping Pink
“Picasso had his pink period and his blue period.  I am in my blonde period right now.”  – Hugh Hefner
Over the past couple of centuries, the associations of pink and blue have flip-flopped as relating to gender.
Real Men Wear Pink
Wikipedia explains the gender-role flip of pink over the last century. Interesting read…
An article in the trade publication Earnshaw’s Infants’ Department in June 1918 said: “The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.” [18]
From then until the 1940s, pink was considered appropriate for boys because being related to red it was the more masculine and decided color, while blue was considered appropriate for girls because it was the more delicate and dainty color, or related to the
Virgin Mary . [19] [20] [21]
Since the 1940s, the societal norm was inverted; pink became considered appropriate for girls and
blue
appropriate for boys, a practice that has continued into the 21st century. [22]
Don’t be shy, child.  If it feels good, throw it on!
