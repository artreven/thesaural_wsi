Supernatural : Carry on my Wayward Sons

Come on. How can you resist the hottness?
Here at the glittering glass and steel monument to TV that is Tubular World Headquarters, we’re passionate about certain shows.
*cough*
Lost
*cough*
I also happen to be a
freakshow about
fan of
Supernatural , an unheralded gem of a genre show on the CW.
The what?
Exactly.
But get past that, and what you’ll find is the beautiful love child of
Buffy
and the
X-Files .
Supernatural
just completed its 4th season, which the CW will be re-airing this summer, beginning tonight ( Ed: uh, actually, last night — my bad ) with the season premier, “Lazarus Rising”.
I’ll be recapping these episodes since they’re all just one big set up for the fall and Season 5.
But what happened in Seasons 1-3, you ask?
Well, you could start from the beginning – it’s only 60 episodes which is really only about 45 hours, which breaks down to a comfortable 4 episodes per week assuming a Season 5 start date of late September.
Easy.
Cake.
Or, you know,
pie .
Or, I can just bring you up to speed.
Short version – two hot brothers travel the back roads of America in a boss
’67 Chevy Impala
(known to the fandom as
Metallicar ) shooting monsters in the face with rock salt.
Sounds like good times, right?
Now for the longer version.
Spoilers ahead.
The road so far
…
November 2, 1983, the Yellow Eyed Demon (or YED), bent on nefarious mischief, slips into the nursery of wee Sammy Winchester.
YED is discovered by Momma Winchester – Mary – who gets
pinned to the ceiling and
set on fire
for her trouble.
This is literally in the first two minutes of the show.
Daddy Winchester – John (played by serial dead guy
Jeffrey Dean Morgan ) – is able to spirit wee Sammy out of the burning room, placing him in the arms of 4 year old brother Dean – and pretty much cementing the family dynamic that we will watch play out for the next four years.
John – distraught, grieving, and hell bent for revenge – raises his boys as soldiers in his one man war against the thing that took his wife.
They grow up as outsiders, on the road, and always on the move.
Dean – played by my tv boyfriend
Jensen Ackles
– is the “good” son.
He worships his father to the point of pathology, is obsessively protective of Sammy, and embraces the life because, well, because he’s a
big damn hero.
Sam – played by Rory Gilmore’s tv boyfriend
Jared Padalecki
–
in turn idolizes his big brother, and as much as he may want to be like him, also has a desperate need to be “normal”.
He has no memory of life pre-YED, but of the three, he’s the one who misses it and craves it most.
This desire plays out pre-series when Sam makes the decision to leave the family business behind and enroll at Stanford.
When the show begins, Sam has been at school for 2 (or 4 years, it’s a
fuzzy canon thing ), and has had little to no contact with his family.
Until Dean shows up in the middle of the night with the troubling news that Dad is missing.
And then Sam’s girlfriend – played by
Friday Night Lights
delightful
Adrianne Palicki
– is also pinned to the ceiling and set on fire.
So there you have the mission and motivation for Season 1 – find Dad and the thing that killed delightful Adrianne Palicki. The show in this season follows a pretty standard monster-of-the-week format, but with the twist of being grounded in American folk lore and urban legend.
The
Bloody Mary
episode actually made my skin crawl, but then again, I refuse to walk into darkened bathrooms because YOU JUST NEVER KNOW!
SHE COULD BE THERE!
Along the way, Sam develops psychic abilities, and discovers that there are others like him out there.
Young adults who had also been visited by the YED when they were infants.
The family also comes into possession of a
deus ex machina
Colt revolver that can kill demons.
As the season ends, Dad is found, the family is fighting together, and YED seems to be in their sites.
Until John goes and gets himself possessed by the YED and all but disembowels Dean in the process.
Which is actually not the worst thing John has ever done to one of his sons, if that tells you anything about what kind of father he is.
Boo!
Sam manages to wing the YED (just go with it), dispossessing his father, and as they race to the hospital, they’re
t-boned by a semi .
Metallicar, NOOOOOO!
Season 2 picks up right where things ended post-crash.
San and John walk away – more or less – the car is all but scrap (NOOOOO!), and Dean is in a coma with massive internal injuries and head trauma.
John makes a deal with the YED, trading the Colt and his soul for Dean’s life.
But before he boards the express elevator to the basement, John tells Dean that the YED has plans for Sam, and if Dean can’t save him, he will have to kill him.
So Season 2 is all about the crushing man angst of Dean trying to come to terms with his father’s sacrifice and the further burden of saving Sam from some dark fate.
Add to this the complication of being pursued by a dogged FBI Special Agent, Victor Henrickson – played by the awesome Malik Whitfield.
All that breaking and entering, impersonating law enforcement officials, grave desecration, and murder committed by a
shape shifter
pretending to be you tends to attract attention.
They spend the season chasing the YED and on the run from the FBI until Sam manages to get himself kidnapped by Yellow Eyes and
stabbed in the back
by a fellow psychic kid.
So Dean does what any loving, emotionally traumatized brother with zero self esteem and abandonment issues would do.
He
also
makes
a deal
with a demon – his soul for Sam’s life.
Sam’s alive, YAY! but Dean only has one year to live, BOO!
They manage to kill the YED with the Colt, YAY! and release Daddy Winchester’s soul from Hell, YAY! but not before also releasing a whole host of demons and lesser imps from the bowels of Hell via a Devil’s Gate in the middle of Wyoming.
Boo!
Season 3 was sadly shortened due to the writers strike, and it’s something of a transition.
We still get the monsters and myths, but there’s more emphasis on the overall story arc.
We learn more about YED, what his plans were, and Sam’s role in them.
He also gets a proper name – Azazel.
Oh,
and
save Dean and find a way out of his contract.
We’re also introduced to Ruby, a demon of uncertain motivations, who pops up from time to time with promises that she can save Dean and help Sam navigate his destiny.
We also get a new big bad, Lilith, who fills the demonic power vacuum left by the YED.
In the end,
Dean goes to Hell .
Seriously.
Even though you knew it was coming, it was still kind of a shock.
It’s not a spoiler to say that Dean gets out of Hell, because Jensen Ackles has a 5-year contract.
What Season 4 sets up instead is the why of it.
And with that, the show takes a huge turn, morphing from a weekly 1-hour horror movie into an epic throw down between good and evil with humanity – as always – caught in the middle with only two hot boys and a big black muscle car
to save us .
Intrigued?

I watched this for the first time Thurs night. Being LOST-less, I was looking for mental stimulation on the tube. (oxymoron, anyone?) This show caught my eye, and lo and behold! The Whit is covering it. Yippee, skippee! It will take me a while to get acclimated/attuned to what they are doing, but it looks so good. I love that big car.
Thanks, Whit.

Great article, Ms. Hall. I’ve been a fan of Supernatural since the end of its first season.
There is something compelling and steadfast about it, no?
What impresses me most is the growth of Jared Padalecki as an actor since season one.
Padalecki, let’s face it, was not the best when the series started but somewhere along the way that kid experienced a metamorphosis from an amateur into a skilled actor.
Sam the scrawny kid is now a man and Padalecki has made the journey believable.

SUPERNATURAL is THE best show on television, and I just wish more viewers would bypass the ordinary GREY’s, OFFICE and CSI on Thursday nights to give this unique, funny, scary, brilliant show a try.
SUPERNATURAL makes you think, laugh, shiver, cry–and I haven’t FELT this much for two characters in a TV show in YEARS.
Eric Kripke has created amazing people in the Winchester brothers and Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki have brought them to life with brilliant acting.
I watched and got hooked from the pilot, and it’s my fervent wish that everyone would just watch the season 1 DVD episodes.
If you aren’t hooked by then, don’t watch the rest.
I’m betting you’ll be hooked!
