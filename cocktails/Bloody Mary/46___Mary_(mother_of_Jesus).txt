The Annunciation
by
Leonardo da Vinci
(1472–1475)
Uffizi Gallery .
In the western
liturgical year ,
Lady Day
is the traditional name in some English speaking countries of the
Feast of the Annunciation
(25 March), known in the 1549 Prayer Book of Edward VI and the 1662 Book of Common Prayer as "The Annunciation of the (Blessed) Virgin Mary" but more accurately (as currently in the 1997 Calendar of the Church of England) termed "The Annunciation of our Lord to the Blessed Virgin Mary". It is the first of the four traditional English
quarter days . The "Lady" is the
Virgin Mary . The term derives from
Middle English , when some nouns lost their
genitive
inflections. "Lady" would later gain an -s genitive ending, and therefore the name means "Lady's day".
Non-religious significance
In England, Lady Day was
New Year's Day
between 1155 and 1752, when 1 January was declared to be the official start of the year. [ 1 ]
A vestige of this remains in the United Kingdom's
tax year , which starts on 6 April, i.e., Lady Day adjusted for the
lost days
of the calendar change. Until this change Lady Day had been used as the start of the legal year. This should be distinguished from the liturgical and historical year. It appears that in England and Wales, from at least the late 14th century, New Year's Day was celebrated on 1 January as part of
Yule . [ 2 ]
As a year-end and
quarter day
that conveniently did not fall within or between the seasons for ploughing and harvesting, Lady Day was a traditional day on which year-long contracts between landowners and
tenant farmers
would begin and end in England and nearby lands (although there were regional variations). Farmers' time of "entry" into new farms and onto new fields was often this day. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
As a result, farming families who were changing farms would travel from the old farm to the new one on Lady Day. After the calendar change, "Old Lady Day" (5 April), the former date of the Annunciation, largely assumed this role. The date is significant in some of the works of
Thomas Hardy , such as
Tess of the d'Urbervilles
and
Far from the Madding Crowd .
The logic of using Lady Day as the start of the year is that it roughly coincides with
Equinox
(when the length of day and night is equal); many ancient cultures still use this time as the start of the new year, for example, the
Iranian new year . In some traditions it also reckons years
A.D.
from the moment of the
Annunciation , which is considered to take place at the moment of the conception of Jesus at the Annunciation rather than at the moment of his birth at Christmas.

Originally posted to 15 March 1659/60 entry by Susanna:
This was the Feast of the Annunciation, celebrated on March 25. "Known popularly as Lady Day in honour of the Virgin Mary, it was a favourite date for the payment of quarterly rents and dues. From the twelfth century to 1752 it also marked the formal beginning of the year..." (Ronald Hutton, The Stations of the Sun) So on the 25th of March 1659/60 becomes 1660, and Pepys is paying his quarterly rent early, as he will be at sea when it is due.

As annotated earlier this year, in discussion of the calendar differences, the date of the formal year-end for accounting, etc, shifted to the current April date when the calendar was changed in the middle of the next century.
However, in Britain at least, Estate Agents will still refer to "Lady Day" for this particular quarter day, though in contracts they use the calendar date.

I believe that under English law, it is still the case that rent on a lease is payable on the "usual quarter days" unless the lease states to the contrary.
I was told at law school that you can remember the usual quarter days because for the first three, the second number is the same as the number of letters in the month (and even law students know the date of Christmas!)
