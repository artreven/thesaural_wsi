March 25 th. Maria’s Spring Mass. One important day on the R unic calender . It is also the 5th. Sunday in Lent. The angel Gabriel told Mary she would bear a son, nine months before Christmas. referring to  “Marie Messo Magdalene March 25th., our Lady’s mass in the spring fast.”
The
Angel Gabriel speaking
to the Virgin Mary
“The  Annunciation  ( anglicised  from the Latin  Vulgate  Luke 1:36-39 section title:  Annuntiatio nativitatis Christi ), also referred to as the  Annunciation to the Blessed Virgin Mary  or  Annunciation of the Lord , is the  Christian  celebration of the announcement by the  angel   Gabriel  to  Virgin Mary , that she would  conceive  and become the mother of  Jesus  the  Son of God . Gabriel told Mary to name her son  Jesus , meaning “Savior”. Many Christians observe this event with the  Feast  of the Annunciation on 25 March,  nine full months  before  Christmas .”
“ Annunciation by  Paolo de Matteis , 1712. The  white lily  in the angel’s hand is symbolic of Mary’s purity  [1]  in Marian art . [2] “
Nine full months to Christmas,and spring has just begun.
