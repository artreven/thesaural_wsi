Tokyo’s oddball theme parks
Everyone loves theme parks. Even though I tend to throw up on rollercoasters, I can appreciate how fun they are for people who don’t. And in Tokyo, I’ve just discovered that they have all kinds of eccentric theme parks, thanks to
this article on CNN.com .
There’s Tobu Zoo, which is a combination zoo/water park/amusement park. Apparently this place has great roller coasters. Then there’s Tokyo Summerland, a huge indoor/outdoor water park built into the side of a mountain. The indoor part includes a fake beach and lagoon, and a giant wave pool that sometimes gets
very, very, very crowded . And who can forget Asakusa Hanayashiki, Japan’s first theme park, built in 1853. This one’s full of rides and attractions, including the 60-meter-high Bee Tower.
But my favorite on the list has to be Sanrio Puroland, an amusement park dedicated entirely to Hello Kitty. I’m really not sure why, but I really get a kick out of Hello Kitty. This surreal indoor amusement park located just outside Tokyo has a Hello Kitty life-sized house (where every piece of furniture is modeled after Hello Kitty), a Sanrio character boat ride, and any number of Hello Kitty-related dance and music performances.
With so many theme park options in town, who needs Tokyo Disneyland?

Discovering Atlantis in Santorini
Have you ever wanted to go to Atlantis? Now you can! Maybe.
I’ve always had a soft spot for Atlantis, so I was excited to learn that many scientists and theorists think they know exactly where the legendary city existed: on the spot of
present-day Santorini , in the Greek Isles.
It does make sense. If you were to fly high over Santorini (one of the Greek Isles) and look down, you’d swear you were looking into the mouth of a gigantic volcano submerged in the sea ( see photo ). That’s because you are. The island of Santorini (and its surrounding islets) was partly formed by the largest volcanic eruption in recorded history, the
Minoan eruption , way back in the 16th or 17th century BC. This catastrophic eruption shook the whole planet, spewed a cloud 25 miles high, and altered climates all over the Earth. According to theorists, it was this devastating explosion that destroyed what had been an advanced naval society in the area. And this naval society just might have been... Atlantis.
Plato wrote about Atlantis almost a thousand years after the Minoan eruption, and many elements of his description align with the Santorini theory. Of course, it remains next to impossible that we will ever really know for sure. (Unless someone finds the remains of an ancient city at the bottom of the sea, like Kevin Costner did in
Waterworld .)
By the way, Atlantis or no Atlantis, Santorini looks amazing. I haven’t been there, but I have to go someday.
The Greek Isles
are high on my to-do list. I mean, look at
these pictures .

Hitting the beach in Paris and Prague
We’re entering the dog days of summer, and people are looking for ways to beat the heat and enjoy that summer vibe. Well, two of my favorite landlocked European cities happen to offer that very opportunity.
In Paris, they have recently opened up the annual
Paris Beach
( Paris Plage , in French). First started in 2002, Paris Beach has gone on every summer since. From July 20-August 20, every day from 8 AM to midnight, certain areas along the banks of the Seine are transformed into seaside resorts right in the middle of the city. Complete with chaise lounges, umbrellas, sand, and even some palm trees, it allows the locals and tourists to be all summery without leaving the city. Here's a
photo gallery .
They have a similar thing in Prague, my other favorite city in Europe. It’s called
Žluté lázně , and it’s actually way more elaborate than the temporary beachfronts in Paris. The Prague beach is on the spot of a 100-year-old spa (the name Žluté lázně means Yellow Spa). Since a major makeover in 2005, the area has been transformed into a huge riverside recreational complex of beach volleyball courts, tennis, soccer cages, sandy lounging areas, boats-for-rent, a bar, a restaurant, and many more activities. Located just a short tram ride away from the city center, Žluté lázně is a great place to spend a hot summer day in Prague. I only found out about this place at the end of my two years in Prague, so I only went once (I think the renovations had just been finished). Too bad, I wish I had gone more. I recommend it.
Summer in the city. Don't let anyone tell you it can't have
beaches .

Ad for London Dungeon is too horrifying
I thought
this story
from London was pretty funny. A digital poster ad for the
London Dungeon
had to be taken down because it was too terrifying for children.
The digital ad, which was posted in Tube stations and trains, showed a standard portrait of the 16th-century English Queen, Queen Mary I, otherwise known as
Bloody Mary . After a few moments, the Queen suddenly changed into a flesh-eating zombie.
Apparently, the zombie caused many young children to freak out. So, Britain’s official Advertising Standards Authority ordered the ad’s removal. I especially enjoyed this part of the agency’s official explanation for banning the ad: "We also considered that when the face morphed into the scary character, the bloody gashes, white flesh, rotting teeth, red eyes and the threatening expression meant it was not suitable for young children to see.”
Fair point.
While the ad may be too much for little children, I have only good things to say about the London Dungeon itself. I’ve had good times there. You wander through spooky medieval London, looking at ghastly tableaus of torture, mayhem and horror. Scary sound effects and background noise add to the ghoulish atmosphere.
I have a real affinity for tableaus (my favorite ride at Disneyworld is Pirates of the Caribbean). And it looks like they’ve added some new features to the London Dungeon since I was there a few years back. They now have a Drop Ride to Doom, a Boat Ride to Hell, and the new Bloody Mary attraction. And they still have the old faithfuls like Jack the Ripper and Sweeney Todd.
Some people might tell you the London Dungeon is stupid. But those people are just scared.

Mysterious Mona Lisa
Happy belated
Bastille Day , France. (Sorry, I only blog on Thursdays and Mondays.)
Speaking of France, I came across
this news article about the Mona Lisa . It seems the most famous painting in the world was involved in another study, this one using advanced X-ray technology. Scientists studied the shadows in the Mona Lisa’s face; more specifically, they studied how the light and dark areas blend so seamlessly, with no trace of the artist’s brushstrokes or fingerprints. You can read the article for details.
I saw the Mona Lisa with my own eyes several years back. I loved seeing it. Sure, it’s a bit smaller than expected, and there’s always a crowd around it, but there’s definitely something special about seeing it in person. Seeing anything in person that you’ve seen a million times in pictures always plays that weird trick on your brain. I like that feeling. Add the inherent mystery of the Mona Lisa, and her famous smile, and the experience took on a sort of creepy quality I enjoyed.
As for that smile, I once wrote about it for
EF College Break’s Eye on Paris newsletter . I wrote that Mona Lisa’s smile actually seems to change, depending on where and how you look at it. This is due to Leonardo Da Vinci’s use of
sfumato , a technique of subtle blurring and shadowing. It’s
sfumato
that the X-ray scientists were recently studying in the Mona Lisa.
Da Vinci loves messing with people’s minds.

A week to party in Madrid
As most of you know,
Spain won the World Cup yesterday . Congratulations, Spain.
With Spain on the brain, I looked into what was going on in Madrid these days, and I found that there are two more reasons besides
fútbol
to be partying this week.
First, there is the annual
Fiesta del Carmen . This runs from tomorrow through Friday in Madrid's Chamberí district, north of the city center. The party really picks up on Friday the 16th, when the locals honor their patron saint, la Virgen del Carmen. The Plaza de Chamberí comes alive with outdoor parties, live music, and fun for the kids. If the Madrileños aren’t too hungover from their World Cup celebrations,
I’m sure it’ll be a good time.
And then there’s another one, also honoring the patron saint Virgen del Carmen. But this time it’s with an
enormous water fight . This coming Sunday the 18th, in Madrid’s Vallecas district, is the so-called Naval Battle. Thousands show up, some in pirate costumes, most carrying buckets, hoses and water guns, and they proceed to drench each other. They also eat paella, enjoy live concerts, and attend after-parties. Sounds awesome.
What a great week to be in Madrid.

Ping Pong all over London
Here’s an idea I can get behind. This summer, between July 24 and August 22, there will be
ping pong tables all over London , free for anyone who wants to use them.
One hundred tables in all will be available to the public, for residents and tourists alike. There will be paddles available at each table. The tables will be popping up at many famous landmarks, including Trafalgar Square, Regent's Park, the Tate Britain and Heathrow Airport.
I used to play ping pong in my younger days. I like the game. The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, claims that it was invented in Victorian England. They called it whiff-whaff. I don’t know if that’s really true, but I like the name.
London’s month-long event is called
Ping! , and in addition to free ping pong table use, it will also include ping pong classes, ping pong history lectures, and a literary ping pong quiz. In short, this is a good month to be in London if you’re a ping pong enthusiast.
The point of the whole thing is to get people excited for ping pong at the 2012 Olympic Games, which will be in London. This summer’s event will kick off at London's St Pancras International train station, where trains arrive from Paris and Brussels. The UK Olympic ping pong team will be there. After the summer, the Ping! project will move on to four other cities and then come back to London in 2012.

Hang out like "Friends" in Beijing
Anyone like
Friends ? You should go to China.
In Beijing, on the 6th floor of an office building, is an exact replica of the Central Perk coffee shop made (sort of) famous by the long-running sitcom about Ross, Rachel, Joey and all the rest.
I’m not a big
Friends
guy, so I don’t know all the specifics of the Central Perk café, but according to
this article , the place in Beijing has all the classic elements of the TV show’s central hangout: a large orange couch, over-sized coffee mugs, the guitar on which Phoebe played “Smelly Cat.” Unlike in the show, the Beijing locale also has an endless loop of
Friends
reruns playing on a flat screen TV.
According to the article,
Friends
is one of the most popular American shows for young people in China. For many, it helped them learn English. This reminds me of my years teaching English in Prague, when my students would tell me they grew up learning English from reruns of
M.A.S.H.
and
Dallas . (Memorable quote from a student talking about
Dallas : “I love Bobby. My grandmother love Bobby. Everybody love Bobby.”)
At Beijing's Central Perk, after a slow start to business, word spread and things picked up big-time. Nowadays, it’s usually packed. And it’s not the only one of its kind in the world. There are also Central Perk replica coffee shops in London and Dubai.
Speaking of
Friends , check out
this behind-the-scenes video
about dubbing
Friends
into German. It’s pretty entertaining.
It all goes to show you,
friends are friends , in any language.

Getting medieval in central France
They’re building a castle deep in the forests of central France. A thousand years ago this wouldn’t be so newsworthy, but this is 2010. So why are they constructing an entire castle using only tools, methods, and material that would have been available in the Middle Ages? Because they want to.
I have to say, I actually think this is pretty cool. In
this BBC video , guide Sarah Preston explains the project and takes us on a brief tour of the grounds and the castle-in-progress. I recommend watching it. It’s amazing to see the detail the workers stick to, the painstaking process they endure every step of the way, and the enthusiasm with which they undertake the project. Also, Sarah is wearing an awesome cape.
The Guédelon castle, about two hours from Paris, is sort of an archaeological experiment. No one has built a castle like this from scratch since the Middle Ages. In doing so, the team is learning exactly how it was done and what challenges they faced. And it takes some serious patience. The project broke ground back in 1998, and they expect to finish it in the year 2025. That’s amazing to me. Piece by piece, part by part, day by day for 27 years.
I like castles. I’ve been to a number of castles around Europe. I especially enjoy the smaller more off-the-beaten-path ones, where it’s easier to transport yourself back to their medieval heyday. I’d like to visit the Guédelon castle if I ever find myself in central France between now and 2025. It would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience to see a castle under construction. In the meantime, here’s
their website .
