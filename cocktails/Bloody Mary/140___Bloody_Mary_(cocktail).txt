Description
Celery seed is the dried fruit of the Apium graveolens which is related, but not identical, to the vegetable celery plant. The tiny brown seeds have a celery-like flavor and aroma.
Uses
Used in pickling, vegetables, salad dressings, breads, soups, and tomato items. Celery seed is used in celery salt, bouquet garni, pickling and curry spice blends, and the ethnic cuisines of Germany, Italy, Russia, and the Orient.
Origins
The principal sources of Celery Seed are India and China but France also produces a small quantity. Indian and Chinese Celery Seed are similar in appearance while the French variety is slightly darker. Indian Celery Seed has the strongest flavor and the French type is milder. Indian seed, because of its color and taste, is considered the premium seed. Chinese seed is smaller and has a slightly milder flavor.
Folklore
Celery actually dates back to "smallage," a wild, bitter marsh plant. The ancient Greeks and Romans used Celery for its medicinal purposes and there was a popular belief that it was an aphrodisiac. In the Middle Ages, Italian farmers began to cultivate "smallage." Once begun, this cultivation steadily improved the quality of the Celery and it has become a popular item. It is difficult to say when the seeds were first used as a spice. It was not until the early 19th Century that Celery Seeds began appearing in American cookbooks, usually in pickling recipes.

Apium graveolens
is a
plant
species in the family
Apiaceae , and yields two important vegetables known as
celery
and
celeriac .
Cultivars
of the species have been used for centuries, whilst others have been domesticated only in the last 200-300 years. [1]
The
petiole
is the part consumed.

Taxonomy
Celery was officially described by
Carolus Linnaeus
in Volume One of his
Species Plantarum
in 1753. [2]
The closely related
Apium bermejoi
from the island of
Minorca
is one of the rarest plants in Europe with only 60 individuals left.
[ edit ]
Uses
Apium graveolens
is used around the world as a vegetable, either for the crisp petiole (leaf stalk) or fleshy taproot.
In temperate countries, celery is also grown for its seeds, which yield a valuable volatile oil used in the perfume and pharmaceutical industries. Celery seeds can be used as flavouring or spice either as whole seeds or, ground and mixed with salt, as celery salt. Celery salt can also be made from an extract of the roots. Celery Salt is used as a seasoning, in
cocktails
(notably to enhance the flavour of
Bloody Mary
cocktails), on the
Chicago-style hot dog , and in
Old Bay Seasoning .
Celery is one of three vegetables considered the
holy trinity
(along with
onions
and
bell peppers ) of
Louisiana Creole
and
Cajun cuisine . It is also one of the three vegetables (together with onions and
carrots ) that constitute the French
mirepoix , which is often used as a base for sauces and soups. It is a staple in
Chicken Noodle Soup .
[ edit ]
Medicine
The use of celery seed in pills for relieving pain was described by
Aulus Cornelius Celsus
ca. 30 AD. [3]
The whole plant is gently stimulating, nourishing, and restorative; it can be liquidized and the juice taken for joint and urinary tract inflammations, such as
rheumatoid arthritis ,
cystitis
or
urethritis , for weak conditions and nervous exhaustion. [ verification needed ]
Celery seeds
The root is an effective diuretic and has been taken for urinary stones and gravel. It also acts as a bitter digestive remedy and
liver
stimulant. A
tincture
can be used as a
diuretic
in
hypertension
and urinary disorders, as a component in arthritic remedies, or as a kidney energy stimulant and cleanser. [ verification needed ]
Celery roots, fruits (seeds), and aerial parts, are used
ethnomedically
to treat mild
anxiety
and agitation, loss of
appetite , fatigue, cough, and as an
anthelmintic
(vermifuge). [ verification needed ]

Nutrition
Celery is valuable in diets, where it provides low-calorie
fiber
bulk. Celery contains
androstenone , not androsterone
[4] .
Bergapten
in the seeds can increase photosensitivity, so the use of
essential oil
externally in bright sunshine should be avoided. The oil and large doses of seeds should be avoided during pregnancy: they can act as a uterine stimulant. Seeds intended for cultivation are not suitable for eating as they are often treated with fungicides. There is a common belief that celery is so difficult for humans to digest, that it has
negative calories
because human digestion burns more calories than can be extracted. [5]
[ edit ]
Allergic responses
Although many people enjoy foods made with celery, a small minority of people can have severe
allergic reactions . For people with celery allergy, exposure can cause potentially fatal
anaphylactic shock . [6]
The
allergen
does not appear to be destroyed at cooking temperatures. Celery root—commonly eaten as celeriac, or put into drinks—is known to contain more allergen than the stalk. Seeds contain the highest levels of allergen content. Celery is amongst a small group of foods (headed by peanuts) that appear to provoke the most severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).
Exercise-induced anaphylaxis
may be exacerbated. An allergic reaction also may be triggered by eating foods that have been processed with machines that have previously processed celery, making avoiding such foods difficult. In contrast with peanut allergy being most prevalent in the
U.S. , celery allergy is most prevalent in
Central Europe . [7]
In the
European Union , foods that contain or may contain celery, even in trace amounts, have to be clearly marked as such.
[ edit ]
History
Zohary and Hopf note that celery leaves and inflorences were part of the garlands found in the tomb of
Tutankhamun ,
pharaoh
of
ancient Egypt , and celery
mericarps
dated to the 7th century BC were recovered in the
Heraion of Samos . However, they note "since
A. graveolens
grows wild in these areas it is hard to decide whether these remains represent wild or cultivated forms." Only by classical times is it certain that celery was cultivated. [8]
M. Fragiska mentions another archeological find of celery, dating to the 9th century BC, at
Kastanas ; however, the literary evidence for
ancient Greece
is far more abundant. In
Homer's
Iliad , the horses of
Myrmidons
graze on wild celery that grows in the marshes of
Troy , and in
Odyssey
there is mention of the meadows of violet and wild celery surrounding the cave of
Calypso . [9]

Cultural depictions
Lists of miscellaneous information
should be avoided.
(April 2008)
Please
relocate
any relevant information into appropriate sections or articles.
A
chthonian
symbol, celery was said to have sprouted from the blood of
Kadmilos , father of the
Cabers , chthonian divinities celebrated in
Samothrace ,
Lemnos
and
Thebes . The spicy odour and dark leaf colour encouraged this association with the cult of death. In classical Greece celery leaves were used as garlands for the dead, and the wreaths of the winners at the
Isthmian Games
were first made of celery before being replaced by crowns made of
pine . According to
Pliny the Elder
( Natural History
XIX.46), in
Archaia
the garland worn by the winners of the sacred contest at
Nemea
was also made of celery. [9]
In the popular television show,
Doctor Who , the
fifth Doctor , played by
Peter Davison , often wore a piece of celery on his lapel.
The Class B
Michigan-Ontario League , a
minor league baseball
league from the early 20th century, included a team called the
Kalamazoo
Celery Pickers.
Dr. Brown's
makes a celery-flavoured
soft drink
called
Cel-Ray .
Foley artists
break stalks of celery into a microphone to simulate the sound of breaking bones.
There is a small farming community with the name
Celeryville
outside
Willard ,
Ohio
once known for its large yield of celery.
Mr. Celery is one of the mascots for the
Wilmington Blue Rocks .
In the popular Nickelodeon series,
Wonder Pets ,on
TVOKids . The Celery is eaten at the end of each episode by Linny the Guinea Pig, Tuck the Turtle, and Ming-Ming Duckling and shown as a healthy snack. One pet will usually end up suggesting "celery tastes good after...". In some episodes, the celery can be seen eaten after using the cooking methods of the place they had visited.
[ edit ]
Cultivation
Apium graveolens
grows to 1 m (3 ft) tall. The leaves are pinnate to bipinnate
leaves
with rhombic leaflets 3-6 cm long and 2-4 cm broad. The
flowers
are creamy-white, 2-3 mm diameter, produced in dense compound
umbels . The
seeds
are broad ovoid to globose, 1.5-2 mm long and wide.
In North America, commercial production of celery is dominated by a variety called Pascal celery. Gardeners can grow a range of
cultivars , many of which differ little from the wild species, mainly in having stouter leaf stems. They are ranged under two classes, white and red; the white cultivars being generally the best flavoured, and the most crisp and tender.
The wild form of celery is known as
smallage . It has a furrowed stalk with wedge-shaped leaves, the whole plant having a coarse, earthy taste, and a distinctive smell. With cultivation and blanching, the stalks lose their acidic qualities and assume the mild, sweetish, aromatic taste particular to celery as a salad plant.
The plants are raised from
seed , sown either in a hot bed or in the open garden according to the season of the year, and after one or two thinnings out and transplantings they are, on attaining a height of 15-20 cm, planted out in deep trenches for convenience of blanching, which is affected by earthing up to exclude light from the stems.
In the past, celery was grown as a vegetable for winter and early spring; because of its antitoxic properties, it was perceived as a cleansing tonic, welcomed after the stagnation of winter.
[ edit ]
Harvesting and storage
Harvesting occurs when the average size of celery in a field is marketable; due to extremely uniform crop growth, fields are harvested only once.
Petioles
and
leaves
are removed and harvested celery are packed by size and quality (determined by color, shape, straightness and thickness of petiole, stalk and midrib length and absence of disease, cracks, splits, insect damage and rot). When properly stored in optimal conditions, celery can be stored for up to seven weeks between 0 to 2°C (32 to 36°F). Inner stalks may continue growing if kept at temperatures above 0°C (32°F). Freshly-cut petioles of celery are prone to decay, which can be prevented or reduced through the use of sharp blades during processing, gentle handling and proper sanitation. [10]
