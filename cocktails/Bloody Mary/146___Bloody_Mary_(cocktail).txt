Brunch at Bistrotheque, Hackney, London
Brad and I decided to treat ourselves on Easter Saturday to a brunch at the highly recommended
Bistrotheque , which is just down the road from our apartment in Hackney.
Feeling a bit decadent, Brad went for a
Bloody Mary , whilst I plumped for a
Peach Bellini
to start. Given that I don’t eat egg unless it’s in a quiche, my breakfast options are severely limited. I decided to go for the
Bacon Sandwich on Toasted Sourdough
with a side of
Grilled Tomato . Healthy! All it needed was a dollop of ketchup and I was in heaven.
Brad went for a
Full English
and it was a fine specimen. It almost looks healthy it was so fresh and light. It’s interesting that they include black pudding over baked beans but perhaps that’s what separates it from your greasy spoon caff.
Despite being a little sleepy, Brad was a very happy camper, as you can see from the picture above. Food, drinks and service was around £30. A perfect start to a sunny Saturday.
