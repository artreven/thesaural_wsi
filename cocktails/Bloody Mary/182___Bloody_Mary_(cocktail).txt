Kabitzin :
I don’t really like Toshio’s hair or Shizuka’s insane rack, and unfortunately neither is a great medic.
What it comes to for me is results.  Shizuka will keep me out of the clutches of the undead with her fearsome driving, whereas Toshio will sit around drinking coffee while the undead treat me like a
Bloody Mary
(but not before driving my family into debt with all his useless and expensive testing).
Toshio looks like a slob, while Shizuka at least cares about how she dresses.  The undead are very judgmental.
Shizuka, I choose you!
Halfadeckshort :
Shizuka tells her patients to get undressed, while Toshio tells his patients to keep their clothes on. Given the relative attractiveness levels of the characters in both series, I’d say both were good calls. Advantage: tie.
Shizuka has been directly responsible for the death of only one student, but since she couldn’t remember his name, he probably wasn’t even sick. Toshio, on the other hand, is responsible for letting half the town die before he even started white-boarding symptoms. Advantage: Shizuka.
Toshio is “married” to a woman who doesn’t live with him, Shizuka provides cheerful meido cosplay for her hot female “friend” even though they “don’t live together.” Advantage:  steamy yuri , er, Shizuka.
Summary: I tried to think it through, but this one is literally a no brainer: Shizuka for the win.

One of the founders of Sea Slugs, I handle most of the blog admin tasks while wearing my I AM BOSS shirt.
I like my action series well choreographed, and my romance series extra trashy.
I also have a soft spot for puns.

fun fact Shizuka is acutlly a good Medic (gasp)
if some one is sick or hurt she knows what to do she saved a dude with a stab wound in the chest
she is in collage and was sent over to the school to be its tempory nurse for training (so she is not even done with her medical studies)

I don’t mean that Shizuka doesn’t know her stuff, as she demonstrates a few times that she does.
Unfortunately being bitten in HOTD means you’re toast, so pure medics are not very useful (although driver medics apparently are… calling all EMTs!!!).

I vote for Toshio. There’s no way Shizuka sticks around long enough to figure out the culprit are the vampires.

I dunno, they identified the undead like in the first episode in HOTD, and if there is an onsen near the village, that would probably give Shizuka a few episodes to make the connection.

Shizuka definitely has a better track record than Toshio, but I’m NOT letting someone who gets a creepy expression like that when she has to apply lotion to someone’s back near me…<_< I…I don't trust her! Not to mention that Toshio has only been failing miserably since his patients aren't sick, they're becoming vampires, which is kind of hard to cure (and he's doing a pretty good job considering that.) Maybe I just like that
Toshio at least acts like he was meant to pass school, whereas Shizuka looks like she should've failed everything. ^^; Confidence is key~

I know she didn’t ACTUALLY fail college if she made it as the school nurse, but it must’ve been a miracle given her usual…well..behaviour. XD

I’m a dude, so the guy would have to be some specimen for me to pick him over the gal.

I can’t believe I’m picking the rack… but I just can’t trust my life to someone as dumb as Ozaki.

I’ve been stuck at Ep 3 for the longest time but now… I have finally found the motivation to carry on with this series!
