Typepro 4: Self Potrait
I created this using Adobe Photoshop and by using type. For some of the letters I used the free transform tool and rotated the text letter so that it would suit the creation.

Typepro 3 - Vodka Label Created in Photoshop
This is the label I have came up with in Photoshop. I created by carrying out some research on different types of Vodka labels.
The center of the label is what will be on the front and back of the vodka bottle. The side parts e.g. left and right shown in the label will be what is displayed on the side of the vodka bottle.
Created in Adobe Photoshop
I used the middle image from Google images as it is relevant to the name of the vodka. The graphic I used in the middle is a logo of Derry / Londonderry.
My Designs for this are completed on an A4 sketchbook.

Typepro 3 - Vodka Research
Definition   Vodka ( Russian :  водка ,  Ukrainian :  горілка ,  Polish :  wódka ,  Czech :  vodka ,  Slovak :  vodka ) is a  distilled beverage  and one of the world's most popular liquors. It is composed primarily of water and  ethanol  with traces of impurities and flavorings. Vodka is made from  fermented  substances like  grain  and  potatoes . For a liquor to be denominated vodka, governments often establish a minimum alcohol content. Vodka's alcoholic content usually ranges between 35–70% by volume. The standard  Polish ,  Russian  and  Lithuanian  vodkas are 40% alcohol by volume (80  proof ). The  European Union has established a minimum of 37.5% alcohol by volume content for any European vodka to be named as such. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Vodka is traditionally drunk  straight up  in the  vodka belt  countries of  Eastern Europe  and around the  Baltic Sea . It is also commonly used in cocktails  and mixed drinks, such as the  Bloody Mary , the  Screwdriver , the  Sex on the Beach , the  White Russian , the  Black Russian , the  vodka tonic , and the  vodka martini . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodka
What have I learnt researching vodka? The origin of vodka comes from Russia or Poland
In the above languages vodka means "water" and this is because it was drunk with such ease and commonality that it may as well have been water.
It was a Russian scientist that created vodka and other alcohol content. He is the person that gets all the credit for what we now know as "vodka".
The way vodka is manufactured is by allowing certain grains, fruits and sugars to ferment so that they produce and intoxicating drink.
Vodka has been around since ancient times.
In the tenth century description of an Arabian alchemist named albukassen first accounted distillation, and this helped the process of vodka be created with much more ease.
