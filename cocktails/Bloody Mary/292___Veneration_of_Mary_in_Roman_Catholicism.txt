Anonymous gift to the Library of Congress, 1934. Carnation From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The
Virgin Mary
shed tears at Jesus' plight, and carnations sprang up from where her tears fell. Thus the pink carnation became the symbol of a mother's undying love, and in 1907 was chosen by
Ann Jarvis
as the emblem of
Mother's Day , now observed in the United States and Canada on the second Sunday in May. A red carnation may be worn if one's mother is alive, and a white one if she has died. This article is licensed under the
