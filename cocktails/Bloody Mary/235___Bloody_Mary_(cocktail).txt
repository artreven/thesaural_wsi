' Vodka
is a
distilled beverage
and one of the world's most popular liquors. It is composed primarily of water and
ethanol
with traces of impurities and flavorings.
Vodka is made from
fermented
substances like
grain
and
potatoes .
For a liquor to be denominated
vodka , governments often establish a minimum alcohol content. Vodka's alcoholic content usually ranges between 35–70% by volume. The standard
Polish ,
Russian
and
Lithuanian
vodkas are 40% alcohol by volume (80
proof ). The
European Union
has established a minimum of 37.5% alcohol by volume content for any
European vodka
to be named as such. [1]
Vodka is traditionally drunk
straight up
in the
vodka belt
countries of
Eastern Europe
and around the
Baltic Sea . It is also commonly used in
cocktails
and mixed drinks, such as the
Bloody Mary , the
Screwdriver , the
Sex on the Beach , the
White Russian , the
vodka tonic , and the
vodka martini .
