Well, technically, a
Mage-God-Prince
in
Germany , but close enough.
note  And
he does eventually end up
in
Manhattan
itself
at the climax.
Not involving J-Lo in any way , unless she's playing the person doing it, a Mage in Manhattan situation is where an evil character from a
Magical Land
enters our own with the intent of causing destruction. Hilarity ensues.
Villains Blend in Better , but they
do
still want to
Take Over the World , so such an appearance has a tendency to
blast any masquerade to pieces .
When the "Mage" first arrives in "Manhattan", you can expect
Mugging the Monster
to ensue. If it
works
though, expect that
Muggles Do It Better .
Compare
Welcome to the Real World ,
Refugee from TV Land . Usually involves
Save Both Worlds . Not to be confused with
Urban Fantasy .
Examples:
open/close all folders
Anime & Manga
Digimon . Happened at least once a season, and once in reverse with
Kurata .
The Devil Is a Part-Timer! !
has an
Evil Overlord
from a
Magical Land
fleeing to modern day Tokyo after being nearly defeated by the local hero. There he finds his magic powers don't work as they used to and ends up taking a job at a fast-food joint to make ends meet. He still intends to
Take Over the World , though he's actually
more worried about getting a promotion
for the time being.
Comic Books
Inverted in Bill Willingham's
Fables , in which fairy tale characters have fled from their magical homelands, which were conquered by the evil Adversary, to the mundane world, with most settling in New York.
Eventually played straight when the Adversary sends the witch Baba Yaga leading an army of wooden soldiers to New York to conquer Fabletown.
The Mundies never notice, because they think they are marching young Republicans.
The DCU
Villainess the Queen of Fables is the
Wicked Stepmother
from
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . The twist is that in
The DCU , (a
bloodier version of ) the events of the fairytale
actually happened , but then Snow White used a magic book to
Ret Gone
the whole thing into fiction, so the Queen is also a sort of
Sealed Evil in a Can . When the magic book is reopened, the Queen takes over Manhattan and becomes convinced that
Wonder Woman
is Snow White.
There is also Brother Grimm, King of Eastwind, who antagonizes
The Flash
and lusts after Flash's wife, Linda Park West. He has similar powers to the Queen of Fables, and can somehow detect and attack someone who is using
Super Speed , making him a tough foe for Flash to face.
Red Sonja 's enemy, the evil wizard Kulan Gath, attempted to conquer
Marvel Comics
version of New York City in an issue of
Marvel Team-Up
in the 1970s. Spider-Man and Red Sonja (in Mary Jane Watson's body) managed to drive him back. He tried again in 2007, brainwashing the population and remaking the city as a bronze-age nightmare.
In
Don Rosa 's
Scrooge McDuck
story
The Quest for Kalevala , the witch Louhi and the sea monster Iku-Turso from
Finnish mythology
wreak havoc in 20th century Helsinki.
Films — Live-Action
Queen Narissa from
Enchanted .
Evil Lyn from
Masters of the Universe .
Borderline example in
MirrorMask :
The Princess does escape to the real world for a while, but the destruction she causes is limited to "eating chips and snogging boys and smoking and everything." Her own world, however, faces
The End of the World as We Know It .
In the
So Bad, It's Good
Beastmaster II: Through the Portal of Time ,
Evil Overlord
Arklon finds his way into 1980s Los Angeles and proceeds to live it up.
In the
Super Mario Bros.
movie, Koopa zips over to our universe with an army of Goombas armed with
Devo guns
to chimpify some locals and take back "their" world.
Shiwan Khan in
The Shadow .
Gargamel in
The Smurfs .
As seen in the page image,
Trickster God
Loki
forces the people of Stuttgart, Germany to
kneel before him
in
The Avengers (2012) .
Dracula
himself in
Love at First Bite .
The Wizard is a bit of a non-evil (or at least neutral-ish) example in
Just Visiting
Highlander III: The Sorcerer
has the immortal Kane waking up from centuries of slumber and using his magic in New York City.
Literature
The climactic, gives-you-chills-every-time end battle from
So You Want to Be a Wizard . To elaborate and oversimplify, the
Lone Power
comes to New York and tries to turn it evil. When they try to stop It, It
puts out the Sun.
It helps that they have the canonical copy of reality in book form as their weapon.
Older than Television : Occurs in Chapter 8 of the early
Time Travel
children's novel
The Story Of The Amulet
(1902) by
E Nesbit : A queen from ancient Babylon (who doesn't have magical powers, though they do exist in the novel) ends up in "modern" (1900s) London.
A lift of this occurs in the
Narnia
prequel,
The Magician's Nephew
when the wicked Jadis (a.k.a. the White Witch) invades London (of roughly the same time period as
The Story of the Amulet ). Or at least she tries. Magic is inherent to a dimension here, and so she has no power in our world, but does have
Super Strength . She threatens to invade our world in
The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe , but that's a clear bluff.
Mercedes Lackey 's modern fantasies usually involve some version of this, with the monster usually being one of the
Unseleighe Sidhe
(Dark Court Elves). Most representative of this trope is
Mad Maudlin , in which Aerune, self-styled Lord of Death and Pain, tries to open a Nexus to
Underhill
in Central Park and a Sidhe driven mad by the presence of cold iron turns into a literal
Bloody Mary , murdering people left and right.
The climax of
Blood & Iron
by Elizabeth Bear.
The Fair Folk
in
The Science of Discworld
II: The Globe
and the
Auditors
in
The Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch . Both set to slow down human progress so that we can't create a colony ship before the world becomes a giant snowball again.
A large part of the series
Everworld : Loki's dream is to use Senna's powers to transport himself and the other gods back to this world to escape from Ka Anor. Given gods like Huitzilopoctli, who eats
thousands of human hearts in a sitting,
horror may ensue. Of course, this is
inverted with Senna's
own
plan — to conquer Everworld by bringing modern humans there with guns and other weapons .
In
Phenomena
evil wizards travel back and forth between
Trondheim
and
Aldra . In the 3rd book our heroes are going to Trondheim too.
Queen Redd arrives on Earth in
Seeing Redd , the sequel to
The Looking-Glass Wars .
Bluebeard (Caster) from
Fate/Zero , so much so that the supervisor temporarily put the war on hold and offered a reward of an extra command seal to whoever killed him. Then he summoned a
giant monster
made of slugs
and the JSDF called in some F-15Js'.
One gets eaten by supersonic tentacles, the other gets hijacked by an epic hero summoned from beyond the grave, and proceeds to have an aerial dogfight against another epic hero flying a magitech airplane.
Somehow
The Masquerade
survived.
Live-Action TV
The 10th Kingdom : The first nine kingdoms are all typical fairy tale places, while the legendary "Tenth Kingdom" is New York.
In the famous Czech fairy tale TV series
Arabela
(1979-81) (Western Germany title: "Arabella, die Märchenbraut", Eastern Germany title: "Die schöne Arabella und der Zauberer"), not only do characters and villains
from the Fairy Tale reality enter the Real World
and spread chaos there with their magic and strange ways, the sorcerous villains even take modern inventions (and ideas), like cars, back into their own reality which runs on
fairy tale tropes , install themselves as new rulers, and start a reign of tyranny by banning, on pain of death, all things magical, including
racism against non-human "magical" races . With hilarious results.
Ace Lightning , although the villains in question come from a video game rather than a fantasy dimension.
Charmed
has an example in the
"Evil Enchantress" clone of Paige
from the S4 episode, appropriately titled "Paige from the Past."
Subverted on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer .
One would
assume
this is why
Glory
came to this world from her original Hell dimension, but actually she's been exiled and just wants to return home. Though, this
would
probably
destroy this and many other worlds
in the process...
The sorceress Morgaine and her son Mordred from
Arthurian legend
arrive here from their
Magical Land
in the
Doctor Who
story "Battlefield". ("Battlefield" takes place entirely in the countryside, though, rather the city.)
Video Games
At the climax of
Viewtiful Joe
2 , the villain
Jet Black
escapes from Movie Land with the power of the Rainbow Oscars, resulting in a final showdown at an awards ceremony. Subverted in that
Jet Black was from the real world in the first place .
Inverted and played literally in
Dungeon Fighter Online . The Mage class's backstory starts her off being chased down by evil acolytes in Brooklyn, leading to Central Park, where the Mage eventually finds her way into the world that the game takes place in.
Web Original
Extremely commonplace in the first book of
Dimension Heroes , with evil Dark Overlord Clonar and his various brainwashed minions crossing over from Creturia to Earth in order to conquer it.
The base premise of
this blog
Western Animation
Debatably, King Koopa from
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show . His intent wasn't to destroy Brooklyn, though. Just simply conquer it.
Semi interestingly done in
Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase ,
where the evil character who enters the 'real world' is a computer virus. Who then chases the characters into another game, and then proceeds to cause havoc in each level of the video game world.
Though it featured dimension hopping villains quite prominently, it was never more so than in the season 2 finale of
W.I.T.C.H. , when a super sized Cedric invades Heatherfield with the intent of conquering earth.
The Masquerade
was preserved, mostly, through the use of some
reality warping
powers.
