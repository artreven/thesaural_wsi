What Goes Around Comes Around
As regular readers will know, I'm a huge fan of
Neatorama
and often link to it. Well, today things came full circle.
It would seem that Alex peruses the
Steatopygous Mathophile
occasionally, because he just gave me some link love in his
post
regarding
Fritz
the photographer cat. It's almost as exciting as if my
MacBook Air
had arrived! I wonder whether the
Free Dictionary
will survive all those requests for " steatopygous " :-).

Germs!
This is a wonderful parody of the kind of health films they used to play in schools a few decades ago. It appears to be a combination of actual footage from a number of them, but with a voice over that, while being in the same style, is just a little different to what you'd expect :-). Thanks to
Neatorama
for the link.

Getting Things Done?
Thanks to

for this very silly video of one man's attempt to check off all those items on his to-do list. I think he should have sorted out the last one first :-).

There's Hope For Me Yet
According to
this article
in the
Times , there seems to be some connection, within the brain, between appetite and memory. In an attempt to suppress a man's hunger, doctors inserted electrodes into his
hypothalamus , which is implicated in appetite regulation.
To their astonishment, this caused him to recall events from thirty years ago, in sharp detail. So, it looks like there may one day be a single treatment that can sort out both my rotundity and my appalling memory, simultaneously.
I live in hope!

Instapaper
When I find something interesting while blog scouring in bed, often I can't be bothered posting about it immediately.
So, I tend to mail a link to myself and blog the next day. During my most recent nocturnal browsing session, I discovered
Instapaper . It's a service that allows you to store URLs that you don't have time to digest now, for later reading. Working in tandem with the service is a bookmarklet called " Read Later " that you can drag to your toolbar. Pressing it grabs the current URL and sends it to your account on
Instapaper . You can go to the site at any time, to see and manage all of those links. Mind you, I'd prefer to just see a " Read Later " item when I
right click on any link.
That may be the desire that causes me to finally learn how to write Firefox plugins!

Web 2.0 Bookmarking
One of those presenting at
Demo '08
is
iterasi . Their product is a bookmarking facility that can handle the dynamic,
AJAX -based nature of
Web 2.0
sites. You know the sort of thing I mean: you go to
Google Maps , enter an address, drag the map around, zoom in a bit ... and then try to bookmark the page you're seeing. Sadly, because the URL hasn't changed, all you end up with is a link to the front page. Enter
iterasi
... when you click on its button, the current state of that website is stored, for later retrieval from any web browser via your account at
iterasi . You may say that
Google Maps
has its own way to bookmark things, but I much prefer learning one mechanism than a new one for every site.
Obviously, whether it's of any real value will depend on whether
iterasi
makes its product free, or at least reasonably priced. It's not yet available to the public, but they're
blogging about it
and here's a video to whet your appetite ...

Slow Food
For those in the know, that title is probably a bit misleading.
I'm not talking about the
slow food
concept.
I'm talking about " non-fast food ". Thanks to
Spluch
for pointing out
Cheeseburger In A Can ! This is one of the most bizarre products I've ever seen.
Rather than going to a fast food outlet and getting a burger in a couple of minutes, you buy a can, take it home, open it, stick it in your microwave and wait the same couple of minutes. Mind you, maybe the quality of the ingredients is superior ... and perhaps you'd end up with a burger that actually looks like its photo!

Better Google Reader
I love Google Reader.
It allows me to get through the posts from over fifty blogs every day ... easily. However, sometimes the presentation of a post within Reader isn't quite right, or the blog only feeds summaries.
In both those cases, I end up clicking on the title to go to the actual post ... at least, I used to! Yesterday, via
Life Hacker , I discovered a Firefox extension called
Better GReader , which aggregates a number of useful
Greasemonkey
scripts. While I've not looked into all of its features yet, there are two that I find invaluable: Clicking on the heading of a post replaces Reader's view of it with the post directly from the blog. When you subscribe to a feed, it bypasses the intermediate page that asks whether to add it to your Google homepage or to Reader. It also adds some keystroke shortcuts, which I plan to check out ASAP. Absolutely recommended if you use Reader ... and if you
don't
use Reader, I recommend that you give it a try.

Demo '08
The 2008
Demo
conference starts today in
Palm Desert ,
California . Demo
is an opportunity for people to show off new products, many of which are Web 2.0 services. Generally, videos of most of the presentations are made available some time after the conference.
Something to look forward to later in the year. To get an idea of the types of presenters who have aired their work at this conference, take a look at the list of

Super Torch
During my recent uncluttering fervour, one thing I didn't jettison was my array of torches. There's just something so attractive about a device that " shines out like a shaft of gold when all around is dark ". However, I think
The Torch , from
Wicked Lasers
may be just slightly more illumination than even I require. It's incredible power of 4100 lumens has apparently earned it a place in the

MacBook " Paper "
I expect to receive my

SkyFire Browser
While I think the Safari browser on my iPod Touch is pretty awesome, it's annoying that it doesn't handle Flash video ... at least not yet. This new browser for Windows Mobile, called
SkyFire
looks pretty damned good. There's no chance I'll ever buy a WM-based phone, because the overall interface is so crappy.
However, for those masochists who have, this looks like a very nice addition. It's currently in a closed beta programme.

Untraceable
I can't wait for
Untraceable
to make it to Australia. If the trailer is any indication, it looks to be excellent. It links two of my (many) obsessions ... serial killers and the internet.
Now, if the script writers were so kind as to have some ubergeek use
Category Theory
to help the FBI track down the killer, I'll be in
Nirvana
:-). Update:
I just checked the
release dates
section at

I'm In Love!
I generally think Apple does excellent user interface design. However, from the first five minutes with my first Mac, a number of years ago, one thing that has driven me
nuts
is that to resize a window you need to navigate your mouse into a small section of its bottom right hand corner. Madness, I say! Well, today I discovered
Zooom .
It's similar to a Windows app I posted about recently. The way it works is that you hold a couple of modifier keys (which you can configure) while moving the mouse pointer.
One set moves the window, while the other resizes. In addition, holding either pair of modifiers and double clicking is the equivalent of clicking the green button at the top left of the window. It cost me around AUD18, but my sanity is worth at least twice that!
Of course, having coughed up my dough, it's almost guaranteed that I'll shortly discover a freeware equivalent :-).
That's just how the universe works.

The Perfect Cup Of Coffee
The
Brugo Mug
is a clever device that keeps your coffee piping hot, while cooling each mouthful until it's in the " Perfect Temperature Zone ", so you don't burn your lips. I couldn't find any information on their site regarding the technology they use to achieve this, so we'll have to take their word for it. I discovered this one on the aptly named
Coolest Gadgets
blog :-).

Edward Tufte On The iPhone
Edward Tufte , the guy who wrote the book ... well,
quite a few , actually ... on the visual representation of information, has
a couple of words
to say about the iPhone. There's an associated
video
but it's quite a large QuickTime movie, which will start to download immediately, so I haven't embedded it here.
While it's well worth a look, if you do follow that link, wait a while before pressing the
play
button. The crux of his message is that Apple got it mostly right, using the high resolution 160dpi screen to good effect and not filling it with "administrative clutter". However, he does think that the widgets could have made better use of the resolution, rather than using very large fonts to display relatively little information. I think that's probably directly related to the fact that they
are
widgets, but that's no real excuse.

Say "Cheese"
I spent this afternoon helping my friends Carsten and Tina load the (second!) truck that will be wending its way to their new home in
Bega
tomorrow. There were plenty of hands to share the work, so it was done in an amazingly short time.
That's not to say that this little black duck isn't expecting to be more than a tad sore tomorrow. I met some nice people and enjoyed the fun of watching seven youngsters having a damned fine time! Here's a group photo.
See if you can pick the odd man out ... I'll give you a hint; he was the only mathophile present :-). Not a single space was wasted in the back of that truck.
However, when they arrive at the other end, I hope Tina and Carsten remember the warning they give you at the end of every plane trip ... " The contents of overhead lockers may have shifted during the flight ."

Whoops!
One of the things Apple left out of the
MacBook Air , in order to achieve its svelte form factor, is built-in 3G internet access. Of course, the theoretical solution to this is to use a USB modem.
Unfortunately, it would seem that may not be quite so simple. Engadget
tried out one of the smallest available 3G modems, only to discover that it won't actually fit, due to the way the USB port on the
Air
is stored inside a small drop down panel, rather than simply being embedded directly into the chassis. Of course, if the
Air
sells well, you can bet modem manufacturers will bring out models with casings that
do
fit ... both physically and aesthetically ..., but it's a very silly oversight from a company that boasts about its smart industrial design! It will be interesting to see what other devices are too flabby to be accepted into the new MacBook's circle of friends :-). As it happens, the 3G modem I'm most likely to use, from
3
is a little blob on the end of a cable, so I may just be in luck.

The

Ecosol , is a power storage device that you charge via a standard USB port. It, in turn, can provide power for your other USB-powered devices. There are adapters that fit various models of mobile phones and MP3 players.
Presumably, others will follow over time, based on user demand. It costs $US70, which seems reasonable.

Modu
This is a teaser video for a new product called
Modu . It's hard to tell precisely what
Modu

this article

It's still far too small for the main purpose I would like to use such a reader for ... reading A4 size PDFs of technical documents ... but it could be quite a nice way to carry around things like blog posts. We'll just have to wait and see whether it lives up to its hype and whether the price is reasonable, which is unlikely in the short term.

Pussy, Lie Down
I've been a fan of the music(?) of Scottish singer/poet
Ivor Cutler
for many years. So, I was pleased to find this video tribute to one of his songs.

Yummo!
To celebrate my birthday yesterday, I met Matt and Gavin at the
Belgian Beer Cafe
down in
The Rocks
for a couple of scrumptious ... and somewhat potent ... beers. We then grabbed a cab and met Susan and Linda at the
Pink Peppercorn
Laotian restaurant on
Oxford St
in
Darlinghurst . As expected, the food was excellent and the company was great.
It just doesn't get any better than that. I was slightly amused this morning to discover that, on the way home, I had popped into the supermarket at
Strathfield
and bought enough groceries to last me until my next birthday :-). Ah, the demon alcohol ... mind you, there were no naughty impulse purchases, just the stuff I normally buy, so I guess it worked out just fine.

Screwed Again!
According to
this article
over on
Gizmodo Australia , the announcement regarding iPod-friendly versions of movies being included on DVDs from Fox
Studios is ... as bloody usual! ... US only. Again, this is of no real concern to me, since I don't buy DVDs anymore; it's just damned annoying that yet again the septics get everything and we get nought!

Rules Of Thumb
Thanks to
Neatorama
for pointing me to
Rules Of Thumb . It's a website that aims to collect all those little rough and ready practical methods that people come up with. Some of them make a lot of sense, some of them are probably of no value and others are just weird or (presumably intentionally) funny. For example ... "Remember when choosing a prospective lawyer, a good lawyer knows the law, a great lawyer knows the judge." "To find the most interesting books in a library, look for the shelf where returned books are stored before they are reshelved." "A city street is most visually appealing if its width is the height of the buildings along it." "If a polar bear charges you, dodge to the right. Eskimos say most polar bears are left-pawed."

Damn Interesting
has an interesting article on psychopaths, entitled
The Unburdened Mind . Like
Ted Bundy
here, they basically don't have that little voice in their heads that we term a " conscience ". Herr
Freud
would call it the " superego ". Quite a fascinating article.

I used to carry a small bottle opener with me everywhere, in case a non-screw top dared to interpose itself between me and a beer :-). However, one day I realised that this didn't seem to be happening much anymore, so I stopped carrying it, because it was just slightly too big to fit neatly into my pocket. Well, it appears someone has solved that problem.
Meet the
Beer Belly Belt .
Ingenious!

Drumming In The New Year
Amazingly, this turned up in
Google Reader
this morning.
Unfortunately, I forgot to record which blog pointed me to it. I was half tempted to learn to use some video editing software, just to sneak myself into the (almost) middle of it :-).

I'm A Member!
No, not
that
kind of member ... although some may be of that opinion :-). Today, I'm an honorary member of ... Who'd have thought a quick google for my new age would turn up something quite so interesting?! According to
their FAQ
... " The 47 Society is an international interest-group that follows the occurence and recurrence of the quintessential random number: 47. Many suspect that the coincidental nature of 47 carries some mystical, metaphysical and/or scientific significance. The phenomenon may have first been
documented at Pomona College
in 1964, when Professor Donald Bentley proved that all numbers are equal to 47. Coincidentally, 47 seems to occur on or near the college campus with amazing frquency, even by enthusiast standards. But make no mistake:
47 is everywhere
and people were noticing it long before 1964. The 47 Society Web Site is the global source for 47 information. "

You Can Never Be Too Thin ...
Remember the marketing
faux pas
Apple made back in August 2007, when they used the slogan " The new iMac. You can't be too thin. Or too powerful ."? The page was quickly modified when someone realised what a negative message it was presenting. Anyway, this
MacBook Air
spoof ad takes that to the extreme.
It portrays a number of lesser laptops worrying about their weight.
Silly, but funny, particularly towards the end.

Mmmm ... Pizza
In recent times, I've been trying to cut down on the amount of junk food I shove into my gob. However, I figure if I had one of these
stove-top pizza ovens , I could at least choose some vaguely healthy toppings for my creations.

Card Microscope
This is a fascinating concept.
It's a
microscope on a card . There are two models; one magnifies 500X, the other 1000X. They come in packs of five for $US89 a pop.
Why five?
Because these are
disposable
microscopes.

Pray You Never Need Them
During the move last weekend, Nanette told me that she came across something interesting while searching online for a cleaner to give their house the once over after everything was out. The innocently named
Clean Queens
is an Australian company that specialises in mopping up crime scenes. Can't get your flatmate's blood out of the carpet?
Decomposed body partially bonded with the bed? No problem;
Clean Queens
to the rescue! Their site is a real eye opener.
However, if you're a bit squeamish, I'd recommend not delving too far down.

Pretty, Cute &
Weird
That's how I like 'em :-). This young Japanese lass fits those criteria ... especially the " weird " part. She has
quite a few videos
on YouTube, and in all of them the main thing she does is stare at the camera with those gorgeous dark peepers.
This is a tribute mash-up someone made from a number of them. I predict that, in another couple of years, we'll be seeing her in subtitled films all over the place ... some of them may even be in cinemas :-).

Whoa There!
Process Lasso
is a Windows utility that provides control over the amount of CPU various programs and processes use. What to control can be specified by rules, such as " When any process is consuming 35% or greater of the CPU for 1.5 seconds or more and the total system CPU usage is 95% or greater, lower that process's priority until it returns to 5% CPU utilization. " Thanks to
Life Hacker
for the heads up.

A Room Of One's Own
The Guardian 's website has a page dedicated to the
workspaces
in which their various authors toil. Having recently completed the de-cluttering of my "office", I feel
so
superior, looking at this one, belonging to
Russell Hoban
:-). Most are surprisingly well organised.
I get a sense that I would feel at home in them ... once I'd updated the computers, of course! While it's not really my style, I did like
Nicola Barker's . Rose Tremain's
and
David Lodge's
are also nice. Thanks to
Crooked Brains
for the link.

Bath Gel
I haven't had a bath for years ... don't worry, I do have the occasional
shower
..., but
Gelicity Spa Jelly Bath
is almost enough to tempt me back to submerged ablutions. It's a bath gel.
You add it to the water and in no time,
hey presto , you have a sweet-smelling tub of gunk to relax in. I'd give it a go, but I don't really want to disturb my little spidery friend who's been making his home in my bathtub for the last couple of months :-).

We're Getting Closer
I have a large number of technical papers and books (particularly those published by the
Pragmatic Programmers ) in the form of PDFs. Over a year ago, I bought an
iRex Iliad , in the hopes of being able to carry my entire technical library with me ... without irreparably injuring my back. Sadly, as it turned out, because the
Iliad 's screen size is only A5, reading PDFs formatted for A4 paper is a less than perfect experience. So, I've been hanging out for an A4
eInk
book reader to be released. It looks like
Hanlin
may answer my prayers sometime soon.
They've been showing off the
V9
reader, with 9.7" 825 X 1200 pixel screen. Here
is a hands on review of the current prototype, according to which the V9 should be available sometime around June this year ... I can't wait!

Favourable Atmospheric Conditions
I've lost track of which blog I found this on, but it certainly got my attention! Apparently, back in October of 2004, an artist named
Marti Guixe
created a piece called
Gat Fog Party .
In this case " Gat " stands for
Gin and Tonic . As it happens,
Gin & Tonic
is one of the few spirits-based drinks that holds any attraction for me ... the other being a good
Bloody Mary . According to the website, " Gat Fog party is an artificial indoor meteorological phenomenon based in weather engineering for 'cultural farming' purposes. "
