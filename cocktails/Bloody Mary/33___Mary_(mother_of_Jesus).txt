Opening Voluntary:
Nigra sum sed formosa – Marcel Dupré (1886-1971)
At the Communion :
Voluntary – F. H. Himmel (1765-1814)
Closing Voluntary:
Festival Postlude on Lasst uns Erfreuen – David Johnson (1922-1987)
I black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
– Song of Songs 1:5-6a (KJV)
The Latin text from the Song of Songs,
Nigra sum sed formosa  (I am black, but comely…), is one of the antiphons in the
Latin rite
liturgy appointed for the
Feast of the Assumption .  The
Song of Songs , from which the antiphon is excerpted has a controversial past as far as its place and meaning in the canon of scripture. In its plain, literal sense, the work is a series of love poems with dialogue among three protagonists – a man, a woman and the chorus of the daughters of Jerusalem.   According to Jewish tradition in the
Midrash
and the
Targumim
( Aramaic
translations and commentaries on the
Hebrew bible ), the Song of Songs is an allegory of God’s love for the children of Israel. In later Christian tradition, it was often seen as an symbolizing the love of Christ for the Church or the Soul, with obvious mystical associations.  From the Middle Ages onwards, however, it became traditional to identify the “beloved” in the Song with the
Virgin Mary , and this particular antiphon was fittingly incorporated into the liturgical texts appointed for the Feast of the Assumption which we commemorate today on the Sunday within the
Octave
of the feast day of August 15.  In a further extension of the identification of this text with the Virgin Mary, it became associated with the veneration of images of the Virgin in which she is depicted with dark skin, the so-called “ Black Madonnas ,” of which many were created in the Mediaeval period or earlier.  Literally hundreds of such images dating to this period exist – at least 180 of these
Vierges Noires
in France alone.
The piece played at the Opening Voluntary today was composed by 20th century French organ master,
Marcel Dupré
(1886-1971) and is the third in a collection of 15 pieces published as his Opus 18 in 1920 as
Vêpres du Commun des Fêtes de la Sainte Vierge .  In form, it is a rhythmically freely-rendered melody in the highest voice accompanied by a rigorously repeating but subtly varied motif of “rocking” chords with occasional punctuation by a single or short group of pedal notes. The effect is one of a simple but haunting beauty fitting to the text.
