Memorial of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton, religious
Saint
Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton
(August 28, 1774 – January 4, 1821) was the first native-born
citizen
of the
United States
to be
canonized
by the
Roman Catholic Church
(September 14, 1975).
Biography
Elizabeth Ann Seton was born on August 28, 1774 to
Richard Bayley
and Catherine Charlton of
New York City . [1]
She was raised in the
Episcopal Church .
Her mother, daughter of an
Episcopal priest , died when Elizabeth was
three. At the age of nineteen, she married William Magee Seton, a
wealthy businessman. Five children were born to the marriage, Anna
Maria, William, Richard, Catherine, and Rebecca.
Her home in
Manhattan ,
New York City , was located at the site on which a church now stands in her honor, with the formerly matching building at the right ( 7 State Street ) forming part of the shrine
Her husband’s business lost several ships at sea and the family ended
up bankrupt. Soon after, her husband became ill and his doctors sent
him to Italy ( Livorno )
for the warmer climate, with Elizabeth and their eldest daughter
accompanying him. In Italy, they were held in quarantine, during which
time her husband died. She spent time with a wealthy family where she
was exposed to Catholicism. Two years later, after her return to the
United States, she converted to
Roman Catholicism , on March 14, 1805 and was received into the Church by the
pastor
of
St. Peter’s Church ,
the only Catholic church open in the city at that time due to the
recent lifting of anti-Catholic laws under the new Republic. A year
later, she was
confirmed
by the first bishop of Baltimore,
John Carroll .
To support her children, she started a hospital, but it failed due to the
anti-Catholic sentiment
of the day. [ citation needed ]
By chance, around this time Mrs. Seton met a visiting
priest , the
Abbé
Louis Dubourg , S.S., who was a member of the French
emigré
community of
Sulpician Fathers . The priests had taken refuge in the United States from the religious persecution of the
Reign of Terror
in France, and were in the process of establishing the first Catholic
seminary
for the United States, in keeping with the goals of their Order. For
several years, Dubourg had envisioned a religious school to meet the
educational needs of the small Catholic community in the nation.
In 1809, after some trying and difficult years, Elizabeth accepted
the invitation of support the Sulpicians made to her and moved to
Emmitsburg, Maryland .
A year later she established the Saint Joseph’s Academy and Free
School, a school dedicated to the education of Catholic girls, due to
the financial support of Samuel Sutherland Cooper. He was a wealthy
convert and seminarian at the newly established
Mount St. Mary’s College and Seminary , begun by the Abbé (later Bishop)
John Dubois , S.S., and the Sulpicians.
Eventually, Elizabeth was able to establish a religious community in
Emmitsburg, Maryland dedicated to the care of the children of the poor.
It was the first religious community of non- cloistered
Religious Sisters to be founded in the United States, and its school
was the first free Catholic school in America. The order was called the
Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph.
The remainder of Elizabeth’s life was spent in leading and developing
the new congregation. Today, six separate religious communities trace
their roots to the humble beginnings of the Sisters of Charity in
Emmitsburg, Maryland. In addition to the original community of Sisters
at Emmitsburg (though now part of an older institute), they are based in
New York City ,
Cincinnati, Ohio ,
Halifax, N.S. ,
Convent Station, New Jersey
and
Greensburg, Pennsylvania .
St. Joseph’s Academy eventually developed into
Saint Joseph College ,
which closed in 1973. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
purchased the buildings and land of Saint Joseph College in 1979 and it
is now the site of the National Emergency Training Center (NETC) housing
the Emergency Management Institute, the United States Fire
Administration and the
National Fire Academy .
Elizabeth was described as a charming and cultured lady. Her
connections to New York society and the accompanying social pressures to
leave the new life she had created for herself did not deter her from
embracing her religious vocation and charitable mission. She established
St. Joseph’s Academy and Free School in order to educate young girls to
live by religious values. The greatest difficulties she faced were
actually internal, stemming from misunderstandings, interpersonal
conflicts, and the deaths of two daughters, other loved ones, and young
sisters in community. She died of
tuberculosis
at the age of 46 in 1821 in Emmitsburg, Maryland. Today, her remains
are entombed in the Basilica that bears her name: the Basilica of the
National Shrine of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton .
Dedicated to following the will of God, Elizabeth Ann had a deep devotion to the
Eucharist ,
Sacred Scripture
and the
Virgin Mary . The
23rd Psalm
was her favorite prayer throughout her life. She was a woman of prayer
and service who embraced the apostolic spirituality of Saint
Louise de Marillac
and Saint
Vincent de Paul . It had been her original intention—as well as of the Sulpician Fathers who guided them—to join the
Daughters of Charity
founded by these saints, but the
embargo
of
France
due to the
Napoleonic Wars
prevented this connection. It was only decades later, in 1850, that the
Emmitsburg community took the steps to merge with the Daughters, and
become their American branch, as their foundress had envisioned.
Statue in
Saint Raymond’s Cemetery, Bronx
“We must pray literally without ceasing—without ceasing—in every
occurrence and employment of our lives . . . that prayer of the heart
which is independent of place or situation, or which is rather a habit
of lifting up the heart to God as in a constant communication with Him.”
Elizabeth Ann Seton.
Canonization
On December 18, 1959, Elizabeth was declared
Venerable
by the
Sacred Congregation of Rites
of the
Catholic Church . She was
beatified
by
Pope John XXIII
on March 17, 1963, and
canonized
by
Pope Paul VI
on September 14, 1975, making her the first native-born United States citizen to be canonized. Her
feast day
is January 4.
St. Elizabeth Ann Seton is popularly considered a
patron saint
of Catholic schools. Her name appears on the front two doors of
St. Patrick’s Cathedral , as a
“Daughter of New York” .
The National Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton in Emmitsburg, Maryland,
is open to the public. In addition, In New York City, the Shrine of St.
Elizabeth Ann Seton was built on the site of her home in Manhattan, and
is accessible to the public. [2]
She had many schools named after her.
The
Mother Seton House
at
Baltimore, Maryland
was listed on the
National Register of Historic Places
in 1972. [3]
The house had been offered as an inducement to Elizabeth Seton to come
to Baltimore in 1808 and there to found a school and occupy the then
newly completed house. [4]
It is now operated as a museum by
St. Mary’s Seminary .
In 2009, she was added to the
Calendar of Saints for the Episcopal Church (United States)
with a minor feast day on January 4.
St. Raphael the Archangel Catholic Church
in
Raleigh, North Carolina
has a relic of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton inside the main altar. [5]
Miracles
As a pre-condition for
canonization , the Catholic Church requires a saint who has not been martyred to have performed at least two miracles. [6]
The
Holy See
recognised that this pre-condition was met by attributing three miracles to Elizabeth [7] [8] :
Curing Sister Gertrude Korzendorfer of
cancer .
Curing Ann Theresa O’Neill of acute
lymphatic leukemia
Curing Carl Kalin of
encephalitis
Namesakes
The Seton Hill neighborhood in
Baltimore, Maryland
is named for Mother Seton. Mother Seton School, a Catholic elementary school in
Emmitsburg, Maryland , [9]
traces its roots directly to St. Joseph’s Academy and Free School, founded by St. Elizabeth Ann in 1810.
One of her half-nephews,
James Roosevelt Bayley , would later also convert, and himself go on to became the first Catholic bishop of
Newark
and eventually
Archbishop
of the
Archdiocese of Baltimore . In 1856 he founded the first major institution named in her honor
Seton Hall College
(which is now
Seton Hall University ).
Quite a number of churches, other schools and hospitals have been named for Elizabeth Seton:
St. Elizabeth Seton, or St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, is a popular name for
Catholic
parishes
in the United States as well as schools, colleges, libraries and hospitals. [ citation needed ]
She was honored by the Office of the
Manhattan Borough President
in March of 2008 and was included in a map of
historical sites
related or dedicated to important women.
