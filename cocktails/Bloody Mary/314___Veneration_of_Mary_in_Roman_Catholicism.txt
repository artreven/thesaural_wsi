Our Lady Of Guadalupe
On December 12, or 12/12, many people celebrate the
Feast Day of Our Lady of Guadalupe
most often described as a manifestation of the
Virgin Mary
another icon of the feminine energies that goes back to the original archetype named differently in each culture.
The origin of the name, and the story behind Our Lady of Guadalupe, remain a mystery. According to one report, the Virgin Mary appeared as an apparition in 1531. Others argue that in 1533 a church was dedicated to the Spanish Our Lady of Guadalupe, with the American version of a Marion apparition developing later.
Others have suggested the name is a corruption of a Nahuatl name
Coatlaxopeuh , which has been translated as "Who Crushes the Serpent". In this metaphoric interpretation, the serpent (human DNA) referred to is
Quetzalcoatl , an Aztec God, whom Mother Mary crushed by inspiring the conversion of the natives to Catholicism.
Stories about the Virgin Mary take some souls on a journey to the Rose Bloodline, moving from the Middle East to France and western European iconology that came full circle in the Americas.
Encoded within the land, art, sculpture, music, and culture of the people, is the end time code for all things that emerge in consciousness today.
