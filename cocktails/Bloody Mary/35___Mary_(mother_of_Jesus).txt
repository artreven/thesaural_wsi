Of daughters and sleepovers
Sweet as can be as the flower frostings on a cake and as dear as the heart can see joys that only daughters can make sending little flutters of burtterflies and bees. Six girls gathered through the night Six friends ready to share whatever the evening may bring Laughters, screams and sweet little things
I wonder why it's called a slumber party When all of them would stay up through the night Playing games, watching movies, exchanging gossips Painting nails, doing hairs and every other things they can think about. It's my daughters second time to have a slumber party for her birthday. I remember very well the first time. It was totally stressed out. Having six girls together for 12 hours is more than I can handle. This time I just have to relax a bit and let my daughter do most of the planning. I should say that it was better this time. I still was not able to sleep because of the noise but compared with all the screaming on the first time, this time they are more subdued.
Preparing dinner, breakfast and lunch for six girls isn't a walk in the park either. But I've surrendered cooking to buying prepared and reheatable food. Pizza, fried chicken, cut up vegetables and fruits, pancakes, macaroni and cheese, nachos, and burgers. The only thing I prepared from scratch is spring rolls which they enjoyed immensely. *sigh* I wish I had slumber parties when I was a child.

Buddy's christmas gift
"Oh, gift! gift! i'd like to know my gift!", Buddy might be saying.
He probably knew it's for him and he can wait to see what it is.
Buddy has a dilema when he finally got his gift out of the bag.
What happened next is shown on the video below.
He's really happy with his gift.
Unfortunately the gift did not last long.
He gnawed it into pieces after a day.
I guess I underestimated my budget for his gift... poor baby buddy.
Mommy will give you another one and she will sure it will last until you get tired of playing with it.

Me and my buddy the wii fit
:)
The first time I tried wii fit, it told me that my wii age is 69....hehe. Truly, my first impression of the latest electronic trend is not so good. How could it say something sooooo darn awful?? I was upset to the max...hehe. But then, you know me ... I know it will change its mind sooner or later and it will see the real me and we'll be good friends at the end.
Last night, I tried it again. That is after one month ago and it told me I lost 2 pounds. oh, music to my ears..lol. It sounded like "i love you" to me ;) And below is my BMI. My weight and BMi are still in the normal range but it's in the upper normal range and I am being threatened tremendously by the fact that I can one day wake up and find myself on the much dreaded overweight range. Sca--ry!! So I have arranged for a goal of losing 2 more pounds in 2 weeks. How to do that during the Christmas season? .... is beyond me. Below reveals my wii age at the moment. Age determination was done through some balance and agility tests. I could've done better if i practiced before but that would be cheating. The video was taken by my daughter as I do all the tests. There will be lots of noises, please excuse them for my son and our dog buddy were goofing around all throughout the video.
See?? wii fit is my buddy buddy now!

Aftermath of a day of non stop snowing
It started with a snow storm warning. It came around 8am, flurries that turned to heavy snow pushed by strong winds. I was already at work and I have witnessed the torment of the snow as it lashes everything on it's path. It didn't stop one bit, kept pouring, kept swooshing all through the day. I was dreading the time to come home. By 2 pm, the snow is at 13cm and it's still howling outside. If only I brought my camera to work I would have taken some pics while the storm is at it's peak. The storm caused so much snow to gurantee a white Christmas! :) and it's not even officially winter yet.
When our dog buddy went for a walk tonight. I decided to take some pics. This is Buddy's paradise. He just love snow. Somehow the snow and the wind has created such dramatic formations as shown in the above picture. A branch that has succumbed to the bitter sweet love of nature. It looks like it's lying on a bed of crystals. But then it's probably is.
A foot on the snow. I'm the first to step on that area...hehe
Flurries are still falling. I was able to catch one on the LCD of my camera and it showed it's pretty patterns. One of these winters, I will be able to take a picture of a snowflake with it's intricate patterns. That's a dream... This shot has no flash. I wanted to catch the sparkle of the ice against natural night light. They are so pretty.
This is with flash. Not much sparkle but the color is more appreciated. Who says you can only do that on the sand?

Reyna de las Flores (Queen of Flowers)
Flores de Mayo is a
Catholic
festival held in the
Philippines
in the month of May. It lasts for a month, and is held in honor of the
Virgin Mary . The
Santa Cruzan
is a parade held on the last day of Flores de Mayo in honor of
Reyna Elena
(Queen Helena).
Flores, from the Spanish word for "flowers," also known as Flores de Mayo (Flowers of May), Flores de Maria (flowers of Mary) or alay (offering), may refer to the whole Flower Festival celebrated in the month of May in honor of the Virgin Mary . This is my entry to the Santa Cruzan ... and I call her Reyna de las Flores or Queen of Flowers. She is supposed to carry a boquet of flowers but since she doesn't have hands, her gown was adorned by roses. Reyna de las Flores celebrates her love of the sun through the beauty of the flowers. ______________________
This concludes the parade of Queens.
Please enter your vote as who is the Queen of Queens.
Who in your own personal opinion should lead this parade as the best dressed queen.
thanks in advance for your vote.

Queen Helena of Constantinople
Saint Helena ( Latin : Flavia Iulia Helena Augusta) also known as Saint Helen, Helena Augusta or Helena of Constantinople (c. 250 – c. 330) was the consort of Emperor
Constantius Chlorus , and the mother of
Emperor
Constantine the Great . She is traditionally credited with the finding of the
relics
of the
True Cross . ------ Wikipedia Wow! Finding the relics of the true Cross is probably the best thing that could happen to anyone. It's practically in the same league as the holy Grail, the holy shroud and Veronica's veil. I can't imagine how it will feel to be that close to the One. But for now since we can't be any closer to these most sought relics...we'll content ourselves to Queens Helena's gown :)
Red silk and laces is our gown of the night. The white flowers has created contrast to the whole ensemble. Simple and contemporary, the pearls outlining the edges of the sweetheart neckline and the body has created a sense of elegance and grace.

Queen Mary ... Mary...quite contrary
The most common version is: Mary, Mary, quite contrary, How does your garden grow? With silver bells, and
cockle
shells, And pretty maids all in a row. Like many nursery rhymes, it has acquired various historical explanations. One is that it refers to
Mary I of Scotland , with "how does your garden grow" referring to her reign, "silver bells" referring to ( Catholic ) cathedral bells, "cockle shells" insinuating that her husband cheated on her, and "pretty maids all in a row" referring to her ladies-in-waiting - "The four Maries". Another claims that it refers to
Mary I of England
and her attempts to restore England to Roman Catholicism. In this version, the "cockle shells" are identified with the symbol of pilgrimage to the shrine of
Saint James
in
Spain
( Santiago de Compostela ) and the "pretty maids all in a row" with nuns. The above mentioned information all came from Wikipedia... and there are more extreme and ugly meanings of the rhyme. If you want to read them click
here . So, this time I want to name my creation after Queen Mary.
Wearing
a gown of golden silk and of yellow laces, Queen Mary is a picture of elegance.
Ahuge yellow rose on soft feathers adorns her left shoulder. Following her is a trail of chapel length and embelished by pretty yellow flowers. Even the back gives an empression of being majestic and regal.
_____________________ I'm running out of names for my queens.
Hopefully I find ingenious names that are worth discussing and relating to their gowns.

"I am already bound unto an husband, which is the kingdom of England" - Queen Elizabeth
This is an evening dress fit for a steadfast Queen. Queen Elizabeth I, Queen of England and of Ireland until her death. This gown truly embodies he unwavering commitment to her constituents.
The sweetheart neckline was embelished with flowerette lace and met by an inticate leaf design in a fine net background outlined with heavy threads to define the pattern and add dimension that followed the shape of her body.
Golden lace adorns the edges of her chapel length trail and one of her shoulder. Long live Queen Elizabeth I!

Queen Arwen of Middle Earth
Queen Arwen, fair and courageous, passionate and true.
She embodies nature and nature embodies her.
She wears the color of nature, mystical, a color associated with nobility and spirituality.
A color that that has a
special, almost sacred place in nature.
It boasts of lavander, orchid, lilac and violet flowers which are often delicate and precious. Young and vibrant Queen Arwen is a fresh breath of air. The sweetheart neckline is adorned with purple flowers.
As well as the whole length of her waist and a delicate bow completes the whole of her back.
Whimsical pinches adorns her skirt with violet roses creating an image of softness in the likes of bubbles and cotton candies. ladies and Gentlemen.... my version of Queen Arwens evening with King Aragon.
Magical and dreamy.

About Me
EM
Toronto, Ontario, Canada
I discovered that I always have choices and sometimes it's only a choice of attitude.
View my complete profile
I Chose
I have decided and truly convinced My life is built on choices, choices I have made Although I was not able to choose my parents, I’ve chosen to live and abide by them I have not chosen to be born poor, But I was given the choice to strive and work hard, make a change I was able to choose whom to spend my life with, A choice in building a government A choice in faith I cannot choose the children that I will bring into life, I was given a pure soul, the rest is irrelevant How to guide them in life, all depends on my choices. I am here on Earth, half my life spent On choices I’ve made as I pass through time Some choices are not as good as I hope it would be But that is okay, it allows me to learn and make better choices the second time around To my childrenWhen you were born, I was given the privilege to choose for you It may not be perfect, you may not actually like some it, You’ve cried, you’ve pouted , you’ve rebelled I chose to be steadfast, chose that someday you will understand In time, soon I can see… This powerful of choice shall be handed down to thee Take heed of your choices, choose wisely You will find that some choices are hard to make But as soon as you have decided, be prepared for the consequence Some consequence may hurt, some may not be what you want Choose then, to learn from it For my sweet, we are what we chose to be.
