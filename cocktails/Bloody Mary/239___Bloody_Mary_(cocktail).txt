[Dine-Out] Seattle: Ivar’s Acres of Clams
When we were in Seattle, I was constantly on the look out for awesome
happy hour
specials. And
Ivar’s Acres of Clams
had a wicked awesome one. It’s not listed on their website, but they had great drink specials and a lot of food on the menu was at a reduced price. I started off with a
Bloody Mary
– cousin of the Canadian  Caesar  (which is much better – in my opinion).
A whopping $5.50 – goodness I love American prices
Happy Hour wine was $3.50 a pop:
Wino
I also got a
Martinelli’s  sparkling juice for $3.00:
Very sweet
We got a bunch of dishes to share. The first dish was a
smoked salmon
plate with whipped lemon
mascarpone
cheese and pickled red pepper jam. It also came with a side of (much needed) fresh greens. I always end up not eating enough fruits and vegetables when I’m on vacation…
I’m not a fan of this type of smoked salmon
This dish is listed as $10.00 on Ivar’s menu, can’t remember how much we actually paid for it. Got a plate of fresh
sautéed
Manila clams  for $8.00. This plate of clams in delicious garlic broth usually goes for $12.00.
Shallots, Carrots, Celery, Onions, Wine, and Butter Goodness
BTW
– Clams > Mussels.
And of course, had to get a bowl of
clam chowder :
Northwest Style White Clam Chowder with Bacon – $4.50
Tuna duo:
$7.00
We got a few orders of fresh
oyster
shooters. Six of these babies were only $4.00, instead of the normal price of $1.50 each. That means we only paid… drum roll ….$0.67 for each oyster!! These were served with “Ivar’s Classic Cocktail Sauce” – whatever that means.
Om Nom Nom Nom in my Tummy
Expertly fried Crispy
Calamari
for $6.00 ($4.00 off their regular menu price):
Is it wierd that I like aioli but not mayo? This came with a delicious Chipotle-Lime Aioli
Our table of ridiculously good and cheap food:
