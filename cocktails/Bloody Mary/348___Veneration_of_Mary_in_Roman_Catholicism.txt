02 Symphony No.3 Op.36 – 2 Lento e largo (tranquillisimo) by Henryk Mikolaj Gorecki
Polish composer Henryk Górecki has said that “Perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music […]
somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something
somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what
they needed.”  I am most definitely one of those people….and not just because I was born and raised in Poland.
from wiki: Górecki’s most popular piece is his “ Third Symphony “, also known as the “Symphony of Sorrowful Songs”
(Symfonia pieśni żałosnych) . The work is slow and contemplative, and each of the three movements is composed for orchestra and solo soprano. The
libretto
for the first movement is taken from a 15th century lament, while the
second movement uses the words of a teenage girl, Helena Błażusiak,
which she wrote on the wall of a
Gestapo
prison cell in
Zakopane
to invoke the protection of the
Virgin Mary . [40]
The third uses the text of a
Silesian
folk song which describes the pain of a mother searching for a son killed in the
Silesian uprisings . [41]
The dominant themes of the symphony are motherhood and separation
through war. While the first and third movements are written from the
perspective of a parent who has lost a child, the second movement is
from that of a child separated from a parent.
Without reading into any of that, or psychobabbling about how this that or the other current finds its way into my work, let me just say that I agree with him wholeheartedly.  I find something in this piece that I need.  Like I need to take pictures.  There is a solemnity and minimalism that comforts me.  Like this image below.
A friend asked me the other day to take a few photos for another friend who would love to stay in America, and has been unable to find work.  So modeling came up as an option and she needed something better than the occasional snapshot. We worked through a couple of looks for variety’s sake and she was brave enough to let me stage the one below. I think I end-up taking the same photo over and over of women when given the free reign and trust to do so.  The working title for all of them is “I Will Hurt You Eventually, If You Don’t Find Yourself.” Chew on that.
Henryk Górecki
died on November 12th, 2010.
Last but not least, I have to share this poem.
Litany by Bill Collins
“You are the bread and the knife,
the crystal goblet and the wine.
You are the dew on the morning grass
and the burning wheel of the sun.
You are the white apron of the baker,
and the marsh birds suddenly in flight.
However, you are not the wind in the orchard,
the plums on the counter,
or the house of cards.
And you are certainly not the pine-scented air.
There is just no way that you are the pine-scented air.
It is possible that you are the fish under the bridge,
maybe even the pigeon on the general’s head,
but you are not even close
to being the field of cornflowers at dusk.
And a quick look in the mirror will show
that you are neither the boots in the corner
nor the boat asleep in its boathouse.
It might interest you to know,
speaking of the plentiful imagery of the world,
that I am the sound of rain on the roof.
I also happen to be the shooting star,
the evening paper blowing down an alley
and the basket of chestnuts on the kitchen table.
I am also the moon in the trees
and the blind woman’s tea cup.
But don’t worry, I’m not the bread and the knife.
You are still the bread and the knife.
You will always be the bread and the knife,
not to mention the crystal goblet and–somehow–the wine.”
here it is read by a 3-year old…
