Our Lady of Guadalupe
or
the
Virgin of Guadalupe
is a
Roman Catholic
icon and arguably Mexico's most popular image:
Nobel laureate
Octavio Paz
is quoted as saying that "the Mexican people, after more
than two centuries of experiments, have faith only in the Virgin of
Guadalupe and the National Lottery" (Paz 1976). Most often described as a
manifestation of the
Virgin Mary , she is said to have appeared to St.
Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin
on the hill of
Tepeyac
near
Mexico City
from
December 9
through
December 12 ,
1531 .
The name
Virgin of Guadalupe
refers both to this
Marian apparition
and to the
icon
which is
housed in the
Basilica of Guadalupe
today.
Her popularity and cultural significance are multifaceted:
Catholics
honor her as the manifestation of the Virgin Mary in the
Americas, while others venerate her as a
syncretic
manifestation of the
indigenous
goddess
Tonantzin .
She is also an important symbol of Mexican
nationalism . When
Miguel Hidalgo
launched the Mexican independence movement in 1810, he
is said to have shouted "Death to bad government, and long live the Virgin
of Guadalupe!"
Emiliano Zapata 's men wore the Virgin's image on their hats during the
Mexican Revolution , and the modern-day
EZLN
has
named a "mobile town" after Our Lady.
Some theologians also associate the apparition and cult of the Virgin
of Guadalupe with a special relationship between the indigenous peoples of
the American continents and the Catholic Church, and therefore salvation,
an analysis that initially developed in paternalistic terms of truths "hid
... from the wise and prudent" but "revealed...unto babes" ( Matthew
11:25), but that later developed into the more complex approaches of the
"spiritual
mestizaje
of the Americas" (Elizondo 1997), and the "option for the
poor" provided by
Liberation theology .
