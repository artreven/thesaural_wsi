Our Lady Of Guadalupe-Friday 12/12

Our Lady of Guadalupe, also called the Virgin of Guadalupe ( Spanish :  Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe or Virgen de Guadalupe ) is a 16th century  Roman Catholic Mexican  icon  representing an  apparition of the Virgin Mary . It is perhaps Mexico’s most popular religious and cultural image. Guadalupe’s feast day is celebrated on  December 12 , commemorating the traditional account of her appearances to  Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin  on the hill of  Tepeyac  near  Mexico City  from  December 9 ,  1531  through December 12 ,  1531 .
The Virgin of Guadalupe is a symbol of significant importance to Catholics. Mainstream Catholics believe that Guadalupe was a manifestation of the  Virgin Mary  in the Americas  and recognize her as “Empress of the Americas.” The  Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe  in Mexico City is the second most visited Roman Catholic shrine in the world.
The Virgin of Guadalupe has also symbolized the Mexican nation since Mexico’s  War of Independence . Both  Miguel Hidalgo  and  Emiliano Zapata ‘s armies traveled underneath Guadalupan flags, and Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe is generally recognized as a symbol of all Mexicans. The Mexican novelist  Carlos Fuentes  once said that “…one may no longer consider himself a Christian, but you cannot truly be considered a Mexican unless you believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe.”
