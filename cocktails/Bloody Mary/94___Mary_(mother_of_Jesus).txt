The Rumors are True says Spellman
According to District 5 Supervisor Darren Spellman, the rumors are true, his posting on another news site stating that he was going to throw his hat in the ring for the 2012 Congressional running, hoping to oust current Congressman Dan Lungren, is true. It is not a hoax.
To contact Darren Spellman his email is
dspellman@co.calaveras.ca.us
If you would like to speak with Mr Spellman personally he will be holding his weekly forum at Snaps on Thursday from 2:30 to 4:00. (This weeks BOS meeting, regularily scheduled for Tuesday, was cancelled.)

Veteran Spaghetti Feed an Evening Honoring Vets
Approximately 180 veterans and veteran supporters came to enjoy the food, the fellowship, and the presentations at the Veteran Spaghetti Dinner Saturday April 30, 2011 at the Copperopolis Armory. Entering the Armory was a treat in itself as Bill and Roberto, two jeep aficionados, had their Willy’s military jeeps on display, answering questions and giving demonstrations of the firing of the mounted gun. (Not live artillery, thankfully.)
The dinner, hosted by the Action Committee to form a Copperopolis VFW and sponsored by the Copperopolis Community Center was an event specifically designed for veterans in hopes of giving them information about their benefits and how to access them as well as hoping to recruit a few more veterans of foreign war for the forming of a Copperopolis VFW. Armed with fliers, booklets and business cards, Chele Beretz from the Calaveras County Veteran’s Affairs Office gave a wonderful presentation regarding veteran benefits and how to access those benefits, stating that she would make in-home visits if a veteran could not physically make it to the County Office.
Bret Harte Senior, Carson Ellington, presented a check for $1,500 to the action committee to form a Copperopolis VFW, explaining eloquently his desire to honor all veterans, in the name of his friend and fallen Marine LCPL Gavin Brummund. The sum donated were proceeds that Carson had raised hosting a Gavin Brummund Memorial Golf tournament earlier that month.
Following Carson were two presenters from the Sonora Veteran’s Clinic. Valerie Gabriel, the outreach coordinator gave a brief talk on the upcoming visit of the Veteran medical van and an outline of the various programs offered at the clinic. (More information will forthcoming about the veteran medical van as soon as location, date, and time are set.) Dr. Emily Lawrence discussed the various services offered at the new VA Clinic in Sonora and welcomed all vets to please get in touch with her as she was eager to guide them in the right direction based on their needs. Ric Ryan, aka ‘the walking man of Murphys’ was presented with a challenge coin from Timothy Miller, Chief Surgeon at Operation Mend, via representative Charity Maness, who also read a letter penned by Dr. Miller thanking Ric for all his efforts towards raising funds and awareness for Operation Mend. Ric addressed the crowd telling of his goals and thanking all that have helped him along his journey. Oldest veteran of foreign war Mel Ogg 88 (WWII) and youngest veteran of foreign war Chris Maness 22 (Afghanistan) were recognized. As was Sean Ryan, active military present, US Coast Guard. John Minerva, 26
was a close runner up for youngest vet. Finally a representative from Vietnam Veterans 391 Sonora approached the mic and shared the good news that because the weather was so foul during the Traveling Wall visit, the keepers of the traveling wall will gladly come back next year for the cost of food and housing for the duration of the walls visit. He went on to explain that the traveling wall is a tribute to all veterans that have fought and died in our wars and conflicts, from WWI to Afghanistan. (LCPL Brummund’s name is engraved on a brass dog tag on the Iraq/Afghanistan tribute wall.) A thank you went out to all that supported the efforts and helped make the dinner a success: Copperopolis Community Center, Payles IGA, Shell, McCartys, Azzo’s, Lake Tulloch Quilters, and all the veteran’s of the Copper VFW formation group for cooking all the wonderful food. And finally Micki & Larry Phillips were thanked for their continued support, allowing the formation group to meet monthly at their place of business. The next VFW formation meeting will be held May 15, 2011 at the Copper Cove 8A Meeting Hall located on Feather Drive just off of Copper Cove Drive. For more information on how you can become a member or just wish to attend a meeting, please call Al Gilbert at 785-4218 or Michael McDaniel at 981-7200.

Come Join us at the 37th Annual Capitol Frog Jump! ~ Senator Ted Gaines
The renowned Calaveras County Jumping Frog Jubilee made famous by Mark Twain will "jump" off with a preview at the State Capitol on Wednesday, May 4 at 12 noon. I'll be hosting the 37th annual Capitol Frog Jumping Contest where elected officials, legislative staff and media will see who can make their frog jump the farthest.
Trophies (and bragging rights) will be awarded to winners of the following categories: longest jump, shortest jump and media jump. I will be "jumping" my frog, appropriately named "Tax Cutting Toad."
Started in 1928, the frog jump was inspired by Mark Twain's fictional work, "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County." The Calaveras County Fair adopted the Jumping Frog as its theme 10 years later.
The public is invited to the Capitol Frog Jump, or you can watch the official Calaveras County Frog Jumping Contest at the Calaveras County Fair and Jumping Frog Jubilee in Angels Camp, which runs May 19-22, 2011.

Sheriff News Release Re: Drop the Drugs Day
On April 30, 2011, the Calaveras County Sheriff's Office in Cooperation with the Angels Camp Police Department, Calaveras Alliance for Substance and Abuse Prevention, and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) conducted a county wide "Drop the Drugs" day.
Three locations throughout the county were staffed by law enforcement officers who collected prescription medication in an effort to prevent the medication from being improperly disposed of, and to keep the medication out of the hands of people for whom it was not prescribed.
In total, over 150 pounds of medication was collected at the three drop off locations. These pills filled a total of 9 large cardboard boxes. Included in these medications were prescription pills that are commonly stolen and abused. The pills were turned in to the Drug Enfrocement Administration where they will be disposed of at an approved hazardous materials facility.

A Thank you from Ric Ryan
Just to let you all know, last Saturday at the spaghetti dinner in Copper for Veterans I got a letter from Timothy A. Miller, M.D. F.A.C.S he is with Operation Mend. He sent me a UCLA Operation Mend challenge coin that is so cool, also at the dinner I received $ 585.00 from vets that were at the dinner. When my family and I left the dinner I reached in my pocket and pulled out the money and counted what I received and started to tear up. The people of Calaveras County are the best. They all really do care about our young men and women fighting for our great country. Also while walking this morning a couple pulled over and stopped me and gave me a $100.00 for the troops. Again I started to tear up. It blows me away how people can still give when so many are having a hard time with the way jobs are in this county.
I want to thank everyone for their support in this cause that I am walking for, I could not do it without the help from you all.
Thanks again  Ric    The Walking man of Murphys

Ric Ryan addressing the crowd at the veteran dinner explaining how and why he is raising money for Operation Mend. Pictures by Kyran Enzi.
To date Ric has raised approximately $4000 dollars for Operation Mend.
The following article, written by Charity Maness  in late August of 2010, chronicles the beginning of Ric's journey.
Marine Ric Ryan Walks to Raise Money and Awareness for Returning Wounded Vets ~ By, Charity Maness Turning 21 in the jungles of Vietnam was not an uncommon story to hear in the sixties, turning your experience into something that can help others? That’s where Ric Ryan’s story begins. Recalling his 21 st
birthday celebrated in a foxhole in Vietnam sucking back a couple of warm Schlitz beers procured with much difficulty by his buddies, Ric Ryan didn’t dare envision a fairytale dream-like future with a beautiful loving wife, three grown children and a keen desire to help veteran’s, he simply strived to survive, to live another day. In ’68, after serving 4 years, 1 month and 23 days in the United States Marine Corps, operating in areas of Vietnam: Da Nang, Chu Lai, and Marble Mountain, Ric Ryan came home to an angry country, one that not only did not honor the uniform he so proudly wore, but one that held his service to his country in distain. Offered a job as an ironworker he accepted and worked the high rises in San Francisco and Berkeley, with a birds eye view of the violent protests in peoples park.
Within a year of returning home he met the woman of his dreams…Joanne. Now married 40 years and happily retired he revisited his memory, the one where a proud soldier was not allowed to wear his uniform when he came home from war, for fear of retaliation or public harassment. He knew he needed to make a difference for our men and women returning home from war, a war that is not popular in many minds. This where Ric draws a clear distinction, “Whether we agree with the war or not, we have to support our troops…100%. These young people are our future. They have a tough job, I know, I’ve been there…done that.” Impressed with the incredible work that Operation Mend, a joint medical effort between UCLA and Brooke Army Medical Center, has achieved with regards to returning our wounded servicemen to recognizable persons after massive facial injuries due to war related injuries, Ric wanted to help. Just how he was to help such an organization was the question. Trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle, Ric began to walk and took note of the waves as he walked. Hatching an idea he began to count the waves he received on his daily walks and tallied them at the end of the day, putting 25 cents into a savings account for each wave. Living on Social Security and some retirement from the ironworkers, Ric found that the financial tally of his waves at times exceeded his budget, but none-the-less made up the difference when the first rolled around and the check was in the mail.
Soon word spread that Ric was walking for wounded vets and he was appropriately dubbed ‘the walking man of Murphy’s.’ Barely able to control his emotions he told of a time when a gentleman that saw Ric walking pulled over on the side of the road, silently walked to Ric shook his hand, handed him $30 and said, “I’m a Marine.”
Another day a woman handed him $20 and said, “My brother fought in Vietnam.”
Remembering those days Ric, lost in silence,
took a moment to compose himself before the interview continued. Ric’s goal was to walk from his home in Murphy’s to the Vietnam Memorial in Washington D.C., a place he would like to honor with a visit to say goodbye to some of his friends before he dies. But the logistics of that dream proved to be too difficult. “If someone would sponsor me for that walk, I would leave tomorrow.” He said with pride. Without being able to make his dream walk a reality, his son in law helped Ric with a virtual map of the 2771 mile route he would have taken if he could have gone, where Ric methodically charts and plots each mile he has walked.
To date Ric has walked throughout Calaveras County and some of Tuolomne County a total of 2388.4 miles. Which leaves just over 350 miles to go to achieve his goal of walking the 2771 miles it would take to reach the Vietnam Wall. Raising almost $1000.00, quarter by quarter, wave by wave, Ric strives to raise more so that he can also help local service men or women returning home that are in need of extra medical care. If you would like to help Ric with his mission please contact him at
RLR1970@hotmail.com
or give him a call at 209-728-2388. If you see a man walking down our many roads wearing a bright orange vest, donated by Ric’s friend at Gold Electric fearing Ric wasn’t visible enough, clearly marked USMC on the back, be sure to wave or better yet, stop and donate to help Ric help our returning wounded troops have the possibility of leading a rewarding and long life. Operation Mend,

Since the writing of that article, through the generosity of a local philanthropist, Ric and his wife were able to visit the Vietnam Wall in April 2011.

Shake, Rattle, & Bite ~ By, John Howsden (reposted)
With April approaching, two things come to mind: rattlesnakes and taxes. What’s the difference between a bite from a rattlesnake and an audit from the IRS? The snake bite might kill you, but an audit goes on forever.
Since an audit is such an unpleasant ordeal much beyond our control, let’s focus on something we can control: treatment for a venomous snake bite.
Snake bites aren’t funny; several people die from them each year, especially children.
There are four types of venomous snakes in this great country of ours, but we only have to worry about one in Copperopolis—the rattlesnake. Although a bite from a rattler may not kill a healthy adult, it can cause extensive tissue damage. Besides, why suffer any injuries at all when help is just a phone call away.
Should you find yourself snake bit, the first thing to do is get away from the snake. That’s probably why he bit you in the first place. Don’t try to catch it or kill it, and “Don’t drive to the fire station,” says Joe Butler, a paramedic with the Copperopolis Fire Department. The best thing you can do is call 911, stop moving and keep the bite below the heart.
If you feel you must do something, you can “circle the bite with a pen and write the time of the bite,” said
Butler . This gives the medical personnel a reference point to judge how fast the venom is traveling. While waiting for the paramedics, you may notice a burning sensation in bite area.
Not to worry. Once the fire paramedic is on scene, you’ll most likely get hooked up to some morphine, provided you’re not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Granted, this is a lousy way to get five milligrams of morphine, but when used properly, this wonder drug really is what the doctor ordered.
With professionals now on the scene and morphine easing the pain, the only thing left to do is fulfill the Fire Department’s main priory of, “getting the patient to an approved facility in a timely manner,” according to Butler.
Depending on the condition of the patient this may mean a ground trip via an ambulance to a local hospital or zipping across the sky in a life flight helicopter to as far away as
Davis .
Whether it’s by land or air, you’re in competent hands and on your way to where medical staff are waiting with the antivenin in hand.    Even though the fire paramedic, flight nurse and, and emergency doctors are in place to help you, there are many things you can do to improve your situation.
The information listed in the boxes is the latest dos and don’ts of first aid for a venomous snake bite. Only Cleopatra VII, who committed suicide by enticing a venomous snake to bite her on her left breast, would ignore this information. But then again, who knows what kind of audit she may have been facing.
Do these
·
Do apply first aid if you cannot get the person to the hospital right away. ·
Lay or sit the person down with the bite below the level of the heart. ·
Tell him/her to stay
calm and still . ·
Cover the bite with a clean, dry dressing.
Don’t do these
Do NOT allow the person to become over-exerted. If necessary, carry the person to safety. Do NOT apply a tourniquet Do NOT apply cold compresses to a snake bit. No NOT cut into a snake bite with a knife or razor. Do NOT try to suck out the venom by mouth. Do NOT give the person stimulants or pain medication unless a doctor tells you to do so.
Do NOT give the person anything by mouth. Do NOT raise the site of the bite above the level of the person’s heart.
Mountain Valley EMS protocol for Parmedic and EMT treatment standard states 'keeping extremity at heart level.'
While waiting for emergency assistance the US Library of Medicine and Mark Twain St Joseph's Hospital states that the snake bite victim:
Immobilize the bitten area and keep it lower than the heart.

Arson Awareness Week May 1-7, 2011 ~ FEMA
Working Together as a Whole Community to Combat Arson
National Arson Awareness Week is traditionally observed the first week in May, and this year’s theme is
Working Together to Extinguish Serial Arson . According to FEMA Regional Administrator Ken Murphy, the goal of this year’s Arson Awareness Week is to zero in on the horrific crime of arson, and to use the week of May 1 st
to the 7 th
to focus public attention on serial arsonists and provide law enforcement, fire and emergency service departments and communities with tools and tactics to prevent arson in their cities and towns.
“Firefighters across the country do the very best they can, but they can’t do it alone,” said Murphy.  “Fighting arson effectively takes the
Whole Community .”
Steps that can reduce incidents of arson include:
Contact your local fire or police department if you know or suspect an arson crime.
Report suspicious activity near houses or other buildings to your local fire or police department, or call 911.
Support Neighborhood Watch programs.
Keep leaves and flammable debris away from buildings. Don’t make it easy for an arsonist to start a fire or facilitate a fire’s spread to adjacent buildings.
If you see something, say something.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) reports that from 2009 – 20010 there were 88 reported serial arson incidents with an aggregate monetary loss of $4.8 million.  Arson in residential dwellings accounted for 49 percent of these incidents.
FEMA’s
Resolve to be Ready in 2011
campaign promotes
Whole Community
involvement in disaster preparedness.   For more information, including a media kit for the 2011 Arson Awareness Week campaign, please visit the USFA’s Web site at

President Obama Announces Bin Laden Dead
(CNN)
-- The most prominent face of terror in America and beyond, Osama Bin Laden, has been killed in Pakistan, U.S. officials said Sunday night.
Bin Laden was the leader of al Qaeda, the terrorist network behind the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. U.S. officials said that their forces have the body of bin Laden.
The enormity of the destruction -- the World Trade Center's towers devastated by two hijacked airplanes, the Pentagon partially destroyed by a third hijacked jetliner, a fourth flight crashed in rural Pennsylvania, and more than 3,000 people killed -- gave bin Laden a global presence.
The Saudi-born zealot commanded an organization run like a rogue multinational firm, experts said, with subsidiaries operating secretly in dozens of countries, plotting terror, raising money and recruiting young Muslim men -- even boys -- from many nations to its training camps in Afghanistan.

California Shines - The 2011 Capitol Christmas Tree Ornament Project
California has been asked to provide the Capitol Christmas Tree, which will be displayed in Washington, DC throughout the 2011 Christmas season. A 60 foot tree will be coming from the Stanislaus National Forest located in the Sierra Nevada. The tree, a gift to the nation from California’s “Range of Light”, symbolizes the theme: “California Shines” and will serve as the holiday centerpiece on the Capitol Lawn.
Californians will provide 7,000 handmade ornaments to adorn the Capitol tree and approximately 100 smaller trees that will be used to decorate offices throughout the Washington D.C. area.
We need your help to make both large and small ornaments!
Ornament Theme
The ornaments will showcase the theme, “California Shines”, and all that is special about California ‐ the Pacific Ocean to the sparkling deserts, the high mountain peaks to its forests, rivers and abundant Central Valley, the diversity of nature and the people who live here are what make the great state of California shine.
Kind of Ornaments Needed
Ornaments must reflect the theme, “California Shines” by showing how the rich cultural and ecological diversity of this state makes it shine. Two types of ornaments are needed:
• 5,000 ornaments for the large, outdoor tree
• 2,000 ornaments for the smaller, indoor “companion” trees
Please visit
http://www.capitolchristmastree2011.org/
for specific ornament criteria for indoor and outdoor trees and to find out more information about the rich traditions surrounding the annual Capitol Christmas Tree project, the details of California’s 2011 effort, and the many partners and sponsors who are working together to coordinate this effort.
Who Can Participate
Everyone! Individuals, school classes, youth clubs, art councils, civic organizations and all other interested youth and adult groups. You will have a unique opportunity to join a national tradition and create ornaments for this special California project!
Where & When
The Stanislaus National Forest will collect all ornaments prior to shipping them to Washington D.C. Ornaments must be received no later than June 30, 2011.
Ship ornaments to
Mi‐Wok Ranger District, Stanislaus National Forest
Attention: Capitol Christmas Tree Ornaments
P.O. Box 100, 24695 Highway 108, Mi‐Wuk Village, California 95346
What’s Involved
There are three key points to keep in mind before you get started.
1. It is important to follow the guidelines listed on the Ornament Criteria sheet for the ornaments you want to make. The criteria are very different for those destined for the outside tree versus those made for indoor trees. Please find the details on the website mentioned above.
2. We encourage use of recycled and natural materials. No ornaments will be returned and there is no guarantee which ornaments will be selected by the Capitol Architect for actual use. The outdoor ornaments are used for only one year. So while they should be beautiful and thoughtfully created, valuable artwork is not appropriate.
3. We encourage you to check in with the Capitol Christmas Tree Ornament Committee (see contact information at the bottom of this page) to confirm what type of ornaments are most needed before you start your project. The Christmas tree website will post ornament tallies to help guide your decision as to what ornaments are most needed.
Contact Information
You can also call and leave a message for
the
Capitol Christmas Tree Committee at 209‐586‐3234 ext 602.

Carson had chosen for his senior project to honor his friend and fallen hero LCPL Gavin Brummund by hosting a Golf Tournament in his name with the proceeds to benefit local veterans.
With a phenominal turnout for the event, held in April, Carson was able to not only to raise an amazing amount of funds for the formation of a Copperopolis VFW but also he helped remind many of the great loss of Gavin's young
life, placing his name in the hearts of many, so that his memory will never be forgotten.

Happy May Day!!!
Origins of May Day
The earliest May Day celebrations appeared in pre- Christian
times, with the festival of
Flora , the Roman
Goddess
of flowers, and the
Walpurgis Night
celebrations of the
Germanic
countries. It is also associated with the
Gaelic
Beltane . Many pagan celebrations were abandoned or
Christianized
during the process of conversion in Europe. A more secular version of May Day continues to be observed in Europe and America. In this form, May Day may be best known for its tradition of dancing the
Maypole
and crowning of the
Queen of the May . Various
Neopagan
groups celebrate reconstructed (to varying degrees) versions of these customs on May the 1st. The day was a traditional summer holiday in many pre- Christian
European
pagan
cultures. While February 1 was the first day of
Spring , May 1 was the first day of
summer ; hence, the
summer solstice
on June 25 (now June 21) was
Midsummer . In the
Roman Catholic
tradition, May is observed as Mary's month, and in these circles May Day is usually a celebration of the Blessed
Virgin Mary . In this connection, in works of art, school skits, and so forth, Mary's head will often be adorned with flowers in a
May crowning . Fading in popularity since the late 20th century is the giving of "May baskets," small baskets of sweets and/or flowers, usually left anonymously on neighbours' doorsteps.

Assemblymember Newsletter "Olsen on the Issues"
This month, I partnered with the California Small Business Association to host a Small Business Roundtable.  The opportunity to have small businesses throughout my district talk with me firsthand about the issues they face is sobering.  Though they come from a variety of industries they all have the same issue at the forefront - over-regulation on a state level.
At the Capitol, my bill to create an online one-stop-shop for all state level permits and licenses unanimously passed out of the Business and Professions Committee this month. The state's complex permitting system is costly, time-consuming, and confusing to businesses. This bill will help foster an improved business climate in California, encouraging businesses to grow and create jobs.
Two other jobs measures I have authored will be heard in policy committees next week. AB 830, which would create a flexible work week, will be heard in Labor and Employment Committee on May 4th.
Choosing a flexible work schedule of 4, 10-hour work days could give employees 50 additional non-working days per year, would save employers money so they can create new jobs and hire more people, and would have environmental benefits from reduced traffic on our roadways.
AB 1057 goes before the Revenue and Taxation Committee on May 9th. This measure would provide a sales tax exemption, beginning in 2014, for businesses who purchase manufacturing equipment or new equipment purchased for the purpose of air mitigation.

Spellman Town Hall 4-28-11 Re-cap
Spellman ‘Town Hall’ Meeting 4-28-11 Approximately 17 members of the Copperopolis Community came to listen to, and meet, Supervisor Spellman at his first Town Hall meeting in Copperopolis April 28, 2011 from 7-9 pm at Blackcreek Park. Spellman came with an itemized list of three “barn burners” that he wanted to address. First and foremost was the “FEMA issue” regarding the new flood zone maps within Calaveras County.
Soliciting information from the crowd Spellman filled in the blanks where information was missing.
When asked how many lots are affected by FEMA’s new flood zone maps Spellman said that on 12-17-10 there existed 2100 lots in Calaveras County that “were in a designated flood zone.” Yet after 12-17-10 an additional 5000 lots were added to the maps, including many homes on Lake Tulloch. Spellman states that the definition of a flood zone is the key to the problem. FEMA defines a flood zone as “1 foot of water, 1 day a year, in 100 years on your property.” Also flood maps were once utilized for the process of insuring a home site that was in danger of flooding. “FEMA has rewritten what constitutes a flood zone” and those new guidelines require insurance if ANY portion of your property lay within the parameters of FEMA’s definition. Spellman warned of the ripple effect of these new maps citing lower property values, drop in the value of homes, and resale. Also mentioning the cost of “non essential insurance” to the home owner.
Spellman noted that Saturday April 30 2011 Dan Lungren will be at the Calaveras County Fairgrounds at 10:30 AM, pointing out that as a “previous Attorney General and a Congressman that sits on the Homeland Security Commission” Lundgren has the ability to effect change if enough residents of Calaveras County come out and voice their opinion on the FEMA issue. Spellman did say that there was one “out” for the residents of the County that are affected by the new maps. The” Board of Supervisors can choose not to accept the FEMA flood maps.” He points out that this has inherent problems, but for only approximately 5% of the county that actually need flood insurance. Because if the Board “opts out” flood insurance cannot be provided by FEMA and the “open market price for flood insurance could be 3 to 4 times as much as FEMA flood insurance.” In finishing he said, “I will vote to not accept the flood maps. I don’t feel right saddling the other 95% with the expense... those who knowingly move to a flood zone should be responsible enough to cover themselves.” Next subject was the O’Byrnes bridge. At this point Spellman shared good news that the steel fabrication process for the repair of the bridge was already underway, and the “bridge should be repaired shortly.” He also said that putting a guardrail on ‘Dead Man’s Curve’ on Copper Cove Drive was in the works and slated to be completed soon. “I believe that job has already gone out to bid.”
When asked if any local contractors bid for the new jail building contract. Spellman thought there was one, yet the “bid came in over 1 million dollars more than the bid we accepted.” At the BOS meeting April 26, 2011 Spellman stated that he would like to see the County establish an Acceptable Contractor List in an attempt to keep more jobs locally. When asked if the $174 K the county received from California Department of Boating and Waterways combined with the 250k received from the USACE (US Army Corps of Engineers) for law enforcement on lakes would increase enforcement on Lake Tulloch, the answer was a definitive “No.” Spellman stated that those two incomes were for Law Enforcement on Lake Hogan, a USACE owned property. The development slated for the end of Little John Road, Tuscany Hills, was touched on and concern was voiced about the possible construction traffic on the already poor road. Spellman said that there was to be a looping road that went behind Saddle Creek and came out on Little John Road near Copper Cove Drive, saying that it may relieve some of the traffic. Monty Crigler said he had his eye on that and Spellman conceded that “Monty is the Little John traffic watch dog.” His final item…the Copperopolis Branch Library. While he says he is constantly looking for alternatives to insure that the library doors stay open, the fiscal crunch is only going to get worse. He did point out that in the 160k budget to run 8 libraries, one library resides within the city limits of Angels Camp. He questions the reasoning behind funding a City library from a County budget.
He closed by saying “I’m trying...I’m really trying. I’m getting beat up because I’m tipping over the apple cart.” He welcomed contact via phone, email, or at the weekly forum at Snaps, saying, “I’m not asking you to trust me blindly…I am fighting for you. I don’t mind getting beat up as long as you know I’m getting beat up on your behalf.”

Lawsuit Over Race-Based Lockdowns
Sacramento, CA -- A class action lawsuit filed against the California Department of Corrections could affect the Sierra Conservation Center.
The non-profit Berkeley based Prison Law Office has filed a lawsuit arguing that race should not be a determining factor when placing an inmate on lockdown status. Inmates are sometimes placed into temporary confinement following a fight or riot.
Inmates often separate themselves by race while in prison, and sometimes there are fights between the different ethnic groups. Often times when a large fight breaks out, inmates in the entire area are put on lockdown.

Copper Curmudgeon ~ By, Mike Shevlin
Springtime in the Foothills . . .
This is the time of the year when the foothills benefit from all the rain we have gotten this winter and the hillsides are covered with green grasses with a carpet of colorful wild flowers. It’s a photo op for anyone when the waterfalls run streaming down the hillsides. Of course there are those that suffer from allergies and pop Claritin like M&Ms . . . so there’s that side of it too.
But the other aspect of living in the foothills hills is watching all the newborn baby animals this time of year. My wife moved from the city after providing foster care for sixteen years and quickly learned what the country was all about then started taking in animals . . . you know the ones everyone “needs”, goats, chickens, turkeys, dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, cockatiels, ducks what did I miss? Oh yeah an aviary full of doves and quail and an aquarium of fish . . . lots of fish.
Now I come from a family of outdoor people that lived by fishing and hunting. So my jokes about roasted goats and BBQed quail seem to escape my wife’s sense of humor . . . probably because she realizes her sick husband is about half serious as he gazes at the aviary of quail licking my lips and saying over and over . . . a simple orange glaze or a chardonnay crust . . . ? And she just screams, “Get away from my birdies!!!”
So after all my kidding about eating her pets . . . the locals have decided to eat them for real . . . you know the ones . . . my neighbors that have a taste for raw flesh of newborn baby goats or that juicy chicken or turkey running free in the upper pasture.
Now this is not some backwoods inbred group of forest folks . . . although I think we have those here . . . nope this is Mr. & Mrs. Fox, a bunch of coyotes, a few raccoons and a huge owl that lives over in Saddle Creek somewhere . . .
The two fox’s diet includes any and all of her chickens and the ducks would be gone if not for our two Golden Retrievers. Two weeks ago the dogs were barking up a storm out front at 2am so I did what I normally do and yelled;
“S H U T – U P ! ! ! “ Only to find out they were earning their Kibble & Bits by keeping a raccoon treed near the duck cage . . . that made me feel stupid. Not sure the male Goldie has forgiven me yet . . .
Now those that know me realize my stance on cats . . . I am perfectly OK with the owl thinking they are the other white meat. My wife wants me to shoot the owl . . . I remind her the neighbors would call the Sheriff if I go banging away in the middle of the night with my 12 gauge and tracer rounds plus the Game Warden would have a problem with killing an owl.
So here we sit . . . I can’t eat anything she loves or keeps here that I happen to pay the feed store a lot of money to feed . . . but every wild animal in Copper knows where the smorgasbord is at our house after dark . . .
So again I ponder . . . a simple orange glaze or a chardonnay crust . . . ?
I know . . . just sit here and be quiet . . .

Copper Gazette Viewers Questions Asked at Recent CFPD Board Meeting
Recently a viewer of the Copper Gazette put forth some questions regarding the CFPD Agenda from March 24, 2011 with regards to the closed session agenda item
'5-C: Pursuant to Government Code Section 54957. Public employee Discipline/Dismissal/Release .' The closed session also included a performance evaluation for the Fire Chief. (Click
HERE
for agenda.) The veiwer questioned whether the Chief was disciplined?
Following this closed session meeting a press release was issued by the CFPD Board of Directors explaining that the Fire Chief had 'voluntarily assumed' the position of Captain assigned to administration. (Click
HERE
for press release.) The viewer asked whether the Chief had stepped down to help with the budget and if so how could he hold a position he had not previously held?
At the April 28, 2011 Board of Directors meeting the following questions were put before the Board.
#1. In the 3-24-11 closed session agenda the code stated covers Discipline/Dismissal/Release, yet in the press release it was stated that he voluntarily stepped down alluding to budget issues. Was the Chief demoted?
The answer came from Chariman Maness stating that the code utilized for closed session meetings dealing with personnel issues contains "wording (that) covers a broad spectrum." Further suggesting that the code should be read in full. The following is an excerpt from government code section 54957:
…consider the appointment, employment, evaluation of performance, discipline, or dismissal of a public employee or to hear complaints or charges brought against the employee by another person or employee unless the employee requests a public session. (5) Action taken to appoint, employ, dismiss, accept the resignation of,
or otherwise affect the employment status
of a public employee in closed session pursuant to Section 54957 shall be reported at the public meeting during which the closed session is held. To read the whole code click
HERE . #2. At whose discretion was it to offer the position of Captain, a position that had not previously been held by the current Chief?
Again the question was answered by Chairman Maness, "It was the highest rank we could offer and keep him full time."
#3. Was the Fire Marshal position part time?  Maness and Captain Cantrell both answered that there is/was no available Fire Marshal position. Currently Captain Cantrell functions as acting Chief while the hiring process for a part-time Chief moves forward.
At the April 20, 2011 Special Public Meeting, Resolution 4-20-11 was passed. (The minutes do not define resolution 4-20-11.)
Upon contacting the CFPD on 4-29-11 it was stated that resolution 4-20-11 gives Captain Keith Cantrell acting Chief status with the authority to act as executive officer. (Captain Keith Cantrell held the office of acting Chief beginning July 17, 2008 becoming Chief December 2008.)
