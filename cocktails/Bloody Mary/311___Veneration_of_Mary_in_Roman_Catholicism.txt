Explanation of Names
Coccinellidae
Latreille
1807
A group with many interesting biological, cultural, and linguistic associations:
Scientific name: from New Latin
coccinella , the diminutive of Latin
coccinus , "scarlet." That from Greek
kokkinos
(κοκκινος), from
kokkos , "berry." A related Greek term is
kermes , an insect that was used to make a scarlet dye. Compare
cochineal , another red insect, and also the bacterium
Coccus , from the same root (Internet searches),
( 1 ) .
Common name: "Ladybird" was first used in medieval England, perhaps because these beneficial predators of agricultural pests were believed to be a gift from the
Virgin Mary
- the "Lady." Other European names have similar associations, such as the German
Marienkafer , "Marybeetle." This may represent an even older, widespread pre-Christian mythology associated with the beetle ( Univ. Florida ,
Wikipedia , Internet searches).
A well-known use of the common name is the popular nursery rhyme
Ladybird, Ladybird , fly away home... .
Numbers
>480 spp. in 61 genera in our area ( 2 ) , ~6000 spp. in 360 genera total ( 3 )
Non-native lady beetles are frequently introduced for biocontrol, so the number of species may continue to rise. ( 4 )
Selected local faunas: ~160 spp. in Canada ( 5 ) , 96 in FL ( 6 ) , 190 in CA ( 7 ) , 67 in NH ( 8 ) , 63 in OK ( 9 ) , 81 in IA ( 10 ) , 49 in AR ( 11 ) , 75 in AB ( 12 ) , 71 in LA ( 13 )

Size
Adults: 1-10 mm; larvae up to twice as long as adults
Identification
Red lady beetles with black spots are among the most easily-recognized insects. There are many other colors and patterns, though, which can be hard to identify. The following physical features will identify all lady beetles, no matter what color they are.
Rounded or oval, dorsally convex (dome-shaped), nearly flat on the ventral (bottom)
Pronotum (hard shell in front of wings) often conceals the head from above, and may even look like a head. Photos show the same species with and without head concealed.
Antennae short or very short with 8-11 segments; last 3-6 segments form a weak club. Click the thumbnails for a close look at the details.
Tarsal formula 4-4-4, but appears to be 3-3-3. In other words, each lower leg appears to have three segments.
First abdominal sternite entire, not divided by hind coxae (characteristic of suborder
Polyphaga
of the Coleoptera)
Larvae
[key to genera and selected species in ( 14 ) ]
Larvae are very different-looking, and may not be recognized as lady beetles. They are soft-bodied, flattened and elongated ("alligator-shaped"). Predatory species have fully-developed legs, so they don't look as much like worms as many other beetle larvae. Larvae go through 4
instars , that is they molt three times before pupating; the instars can be fairly different. Many are gray or black and may have colorful markings (A). Others have waxy white tufts, resembling caterpillars or mealybugs (B). Plant-eating larvae are yellow with long spines (C).
A.
B.
C.
Range
Worldwide, including all of North America.
Habitat
Anywhere with suitable food. Usually outdoors, but in cold weather large groups may enter houses.
Season
Active adults and larvae are present from spring to fall. Some adults can survive cold winters, but are usually inactive. All life stages present year-round in the south.
Food
Most lady beetles are predatory, eating a wide variety of other insects. Prey includes aphids (A, B), mealybugs, scale insects, fly larvae (C), and small caterpillars. They also eat insect eggs (D) and pupae (E) - even those of other lady beetles (F).

B.
C.
D.
E.
F.
Some lady beetles are plant-eating, however, and can be destructive in gardens (A). Others consume fungus, such as mildew and plant molds (B). Predatory species may supplement their diet with pollen (C).
A.
B.
C.
Non-prey foods are an integral component of the diets of most predaceous coccinellids. Under field conditions, numerous coccinellids consume
nectar, honeydew, pollen, fruit, vegetation , and
fungus . These non-prey foods are used by coccinellids to increase survival when prey is scarce, reduce mortality during diapause, fuel migration, and enhance reproductive capacity. Each of these non-prey foods has unique nutritional and defensive characteristics that influence its suitability for lady beetles.
( 15 )
Life Cycle
Larvae go through 4 different instars before pupating and finally becoming adults. Some larvae have tufts of white wax on the surface that make them look like mealybugs.
Their food is usually similar to that of the adults, and in the predatory species they're often important as pest controls.
Before becoming adults, they go through an immobile stage with a shell-like skin. They shed this pupal case to emerge as adults.
Many species gather in large numbers to hibernate. Some gather along lake shores, particularly in the spring and fall

Remarks
Identification within the family (at least for adults) often depends on patterns in the pronotum (the area in front of the wings/"shell", but behind the head). A view of your ladybird from the front will help with ID.
Some lady beetles, particularly
Harmonia axyridis , serve as hosts to parasitic Laboulbeniales fungi, resulting in this appearance (click on thumbs to see comments):
