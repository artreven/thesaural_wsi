How to Infuse Liquor
Strawberry-infused Vodka
For those who have never
infused liquor
before, leaving porous substances (i.e. sliced fruit, meat, etc.) in alcohol for long durations of time (i.e. more than 72 hours) changes the texture of the liquid, thickening it.
Citrus fruit and herbs are exempt from this, but bacon and sliced strawberries are great examples of porous substances.
Infusing liquor is very easy. To make an absolutely amazing
berry-infused vodka
or
berry-infused rum , follow these simple steps:
Take a large container that can be sealed air-tight and add a bottle of your liquor of choice and whole berries (rinsed and patted dry) - do not cut the stems or greens off the berry.
Then seal the container and leave it to infused for 4 to 6 weeks. Yes, I said 4 to 6 weeks.
Open the container and strain the
berry-infused liquor
into a glass bottle. Serve over ice and enjoy!

Fat Washing Process for Bacon-Infused Liquor
Fat washing process for bacon-infused Vodka
Fat washing
is a method used to instill the flavor of a fatty substance, such as
bacon
or
ham , into
liquor . The meat is added to liquor and
infused
for a time, then the liquid is chilled and the fatty portion, which floats to the top, is then removed.
Alcohol
bonds to
fat
and
sugars
easily and
fat washing
is fairly simple. Though keep in mind that
low-sodium bacon
doesn’t work as well. When executed properly,
fat washing
leaves behind the taste of the
bacon , but doesn’t retain a greasy taste or texture.
Here is a step by step
fat washing process for bacon-infused liquor :
Bacon Fat Washing
Ingredients: 5 Thick Slices of
Applewood Smoked Bacon .
1 750 ml bottle of the
liquor
of your choice (we recommend
rum ,
bourbon
or
vodka ).
Preparation: 1.    Cook the bacon in the oven until it is crispy on the outsides but still chewy in the center. 2.    Place cooked bacon in a large glass jar (that can be sealed air-tight) with one 750 ml bottle of liquor and allow it to infuse for 24-36 hours (no more than 72 hours) at room temperature.
3.    Remove the bacon and then place the jar in the freezer until the bacon fat solidifies at the top. 4.    Using a cheese cloth or paper coffee filter, strain the fat from the liquor. 5.    Repeat the freezer step if needed and strain again. 6.    Refrigerate until ready for use.
Now you're ready to make your
bacon-infused
cocktails . Here are a couple of
savory cocktails  that we recommend:
The Bloody Heffer
Bacon Apple Martini
