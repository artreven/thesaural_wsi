Bloody Mary (No, Not the Drink)
When I was young enough to be scared of the dark, my brother told me about the sign of the cross. You know, you cross your index fingers in front of your face . . . that way, when the monsters jump out you're ready to flick 'em in the eye and run away. Neat trick, right? But it doesn't work on ghosts, Big Brother. Your fingers just go right through them. He didn't have a trick for them.
And that's my childhood in a nutshell. I wasn't too afraid of burglars or serial killers 'cause there were statistics on them and I could strategize and prepare for the rare occasion I might meet one. But ghosts and demons? No one had any hard data, which means no one had a realistic plan for keeping them from devouring my soul, which scared me spitless.
Which means I was way too scared to play games like Bloody Mary, and I wouldn't actually touch the ouija board at sleepovers. No evil spirit was gonna get me! And then, sometime in my early college years, I realized evil spirits were bullshit and learned to
love
horror
movies . And then, sometime after my college years, I learned that the supernatural part was still bullshit but the psychology was kind of totally real.
Bloody Mary
is a real thing, in that staring at yourself for too long in dim light can make you see
weird things , like crazy
facial distortions
or the faces of other people. And
ouija boards
run not on spiritual energy, but
urban legends
and the
idiomotor effect . The ouija board as we know it today is just a board game, but it's based on real fake
spiritualist stuff . The idiomotor effect is also what causes table tipping during seances. Well, that and fakery. Lots of times it's
fakery . Soooo much fakery.
Even ghosts themselves might have
some science
behind them. Well, not so much actual ghosts as a grab bag of optical illusions, misheard noises, and other totally non-scary stuff that we think are ghosts. Which is actually way more interesting (to me, anyway) than plain old ghost stories. Plus, I can strategize and prepare for weird noises and optical illusions. And for monsters, well, I'm passing along that flicking thing to my kids. Just in case.
