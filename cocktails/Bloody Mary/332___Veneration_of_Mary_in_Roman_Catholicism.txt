Ololiúqui
Rivea corymbosa
(common synonym:
Turbina corymbosa ), is a species of
morning glory
plants, native throughout
Latin America
from
Mexico
in the North to
Peru
in the South and widely naturalised elsewhere. It is a
perennial
climbing
vine
with white flowers, often planted as an
ornamental plant . This plant also occurs in
Cuba , where it usually blooms from early December to February. Its flowers secrete copious amount of nectar, and the
honey
the bees make from it is very clear and aromatic. It is considered one of the main honey plants from the island. Known to natives of
Mexico
as
Ololiúqui
(also spelled
ololiuhqui
or
ololiuqui ), its seeds, while little known outside of
Mexico , were perhaps the most common
hallucinogenic drug
used by the natives. In
1941 ,
Richard Evans Schultes
first identified ololiuhqui as
Rivea corymbosa
and the chemical composition was first described on
August 18 ,
1960 , in a paper by
Dr. Albert Hofmann . The seeds contain
ergine
(LSA), an
ergoline
alkaloid
similar in structure to
LSD . The
Nahuatl
word
ololiuhqui
means "round thing", and refers to the small, brown, oval seeds of the morning glory, not the plant itself, which is called
coaxihuitl , "snake-plant", in Nahuatl, and
hiedra
or
bejuco
in the
Spanish language . The seeds, in Spanish, are sometimes called
semilla de la Virgen
(seeds of the
Virgin Mary ). The seeds are also used by Native curers in order to gain knowledge in curing practices and ritual, as well as the causes for the illness.
