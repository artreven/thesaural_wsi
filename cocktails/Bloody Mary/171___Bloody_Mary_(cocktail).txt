The Pros: Great for your health. More flavorful than tomato juice. Convenient when you can't get your daily vegetable consumption.
The Cons: Contains a large amount of sodium. Some dislike the taste.
The original V8 is made mainly from  tomatoes  and the juices from seven  vegetables , specifically:  beets ,  celery ,  carrots ,  lettuce ,  parsley , watercress , and  spinach .

Campbell V8 Juice by PriceGrabber.com
[ 1 ]   Tomato juice  comprises around 87% of the total drink. Campbell's makes several varieties of the drink, such as Original, Spicy Hot, Lemon, Picante, Low-Sodium, and Organic.
Two spin-offs of the V8 brand, "V8 Splash", and "V8 V•Fusion", are blends of fruit and vegetable (specifically carrot) juices. V8 Splash is sweetened with  high-fructose corn syrup   and   Sucralose  or just  Splenda  in Diet V8 Splash, while V•Fusion is made from 100% juice and contains a daily serving of both fruits and vegetables per 8 fl oz (240 mL) glass.
[ edit ] History
V8 Vegetable Juice was developed by W.G. Peacock (1896–1948), the founder of the  New England  Products Company, which manufactured individual vegetable juices under the brand name Vege-min. Having had only mediocre sales success, in 1933 Peacock began blending the Vege-min juices into one product and selling this new concoction as "Vege-min 8." A grocer in  Evanston, Illinois  recommended that he shorten the name to simply "V-8." In 1948, the  Campbell Soup Company  acquired the brand, and has maintained continuous production of the beverage through the present day.
[ edit ] Derivative beverages
A few  cocktail  drinks use V8, most famously the "bloody eight" or "eight ball", which is a  Bloody Mary  with V8 instead of  tomato juice [ 2 ] . Vi-8 otherwise known as a Vimal 8 is a combination of V8 and  orange  flavored soda.

#campbell_v8_juice
I hoped to obtain a phone number. I want to know if anybody in Eugene, Oregon or Springfield, carries V8 juice with extra fiber. I found it one time so I know you make it, but I don't know where I got it.I called Campbell once and was told Fred Meyer carries it. The store I went to for it did not. Can you tell me which Fred Meyers so I don't have to drive for miles to check out each of them? Or is there someplace else? I would buy it if you will let me know where I can obtain it. Maybe my eyes are worse, but I can't read the phone number on a bottle I have because it is so small. Even glasses don't help. Maybe you could print your info a little larger so it can be read.
