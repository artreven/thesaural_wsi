POPULAR
CULTURE
Tequila is a common topic of popular culture, ranging from films
that simply use the name, such as
Tequila Sunrise
(1988) to songs
about the drink. According to
Tom Robbin's
book
Still Life with
Woodpecker
tequila is the preferred drink of outlaws.
Sandra Lee of the Food Network refers to tequila as "her friend."
In song, tequila is diversely portrayed, ranging from
Jimmy Buffet's
semi-serious
Margaritaville
to
The
Eagle's
maudlin
Tequila Sunrise.
Tequila even enters the popular news media. For example,
Mel Gibson's
anti-Semitic outburst when arrested for drunk driving was attributed
to tequila consumption.

Hagar,
rock star (singer of the bar anthem "Mas Tequila") [27]
and original owner of
Cabo
Wabo.
Tequila described tequila's stigma as, "the stuff
that you go, "I will never drink that as long as I live," and you
have gotten sick in college on rot-gut tequila." This image of tequila
as the instigator of particularly egregious intoxication and hangovers
is pervasive in references to the drink in popular culture.

In music, singer-songwriter
Alanis Morissette
wrote an ode to tequila entitled "On The Tequila" for the Flavors
of Entanglement sessions, and says tequila has helped her balance
things out in her life.

The English rock band
Terrorvision
had a UK No. 2 hit in 1999 with their song "Tequila."
Tequila plays a role in the climactic scene of "Funhouse", the season
two finale of the HBO TV series
The Sopranos.
In this episode, the character Sal "Big Pussy" Bonpensiero asks
several members of the crew if there is any good tequila available,
knowing that he is about to be killed and wanting a final drink
with his longtime friends. [30]
In the United States , National Tequila Day is July 24.

In the Mexican telenovela,
Destilando Amor,
the production of Tequila, and how it is made, plays a role of the
storyline. Part of the show takes place on agave fields.
