Shultzy's Euro 2008 "Bracket" Contest
You've heard of March Madness, this is Shultzy's Euro 2008 June Madness! We've become a bunch of soccer fans, and figured that the only way to make the Euro 2008 tournament more fun is to let our staff and customers compete, as well.
So, we've created a contest where you pick the winners to the tournament's games. We're still working on the scoring rules (thank goodness NCAA basketball doesn't have round robin rounds or ties), and we'll let you know as soon as we're done. The good news is that there's no entry fee. More good news: there are prizes. We're still figuring those out. Even better news, Shultzy's will have specials during the games, so you can root on your picks with food and beverages close at hand. Good luck to all of you! Submit your Entry to Shultzy's Euro 2008 "June Madness" contest. If you're just interested in the Euro 2008 Tournament Bracket (schedule),

Soccer and Baseball on TV today
Seminfinals of the tournament are on TV today.
Unfortunately, the USA didn't make it, losing all three of their games (74 more days 'til the USA's first game in 2008 Olympic Soccer vs. Japan). Chile vs Ivory Coast Japan vs Italy The first game is at 9am and the second is on at lunch (11:30 am). Or, if your preference is baseball, the Red Sox take on the Seattle Mariners at 7:10pm -- Dice-K, Ichiro, and more Japanese sports photographers than you can shake a stick at.

The agony of a typo.
Yes, I know. I've screwed up our first poll ever. "VOTE for your favorite Shultzy's Server?" What's with the question mark?
Well, I started the poll as "Who is your favorite Shultzy's Server?" And, as with most things, I should have left it well enough alone.
But, I didn't.
So, I wanted to change it to "VOTE for your favorite Shultzy's server."
And that would have been fine.
But I messed up the capitalization of "server" and left in the original question mark. And that's when the agony set in... For, unlike most web actions, this one is irreversible for practical purposes.
The clever people at Google decided an author can't edit a poll once it's started to collect votes.
I can't fix the header without starting the poll over again.
And since we already have votes and a bunch of competitive employees, I'd be foolhardy to try a "do-over". So, it is my penalty to have to look at this error each day for the next month or so.
Aaargh! My apologies to our readers.

Democracy in Action - The Battle is On!
Shultzy's always loves a little competition, so we have a chance for you to participate. We're asking who's your favorite server at Shultzy's.
If you look on the right sidebar, you'll see our poll.
We'll soon have pictures up, so you can match names with faces.
Our servers are competing to see who can get the most votes -- the winner gets bragging rights (and a few bucks).
Losers get taunted.
It's the Shultzy's way. Like any good election, you can vote as many times as you want, and a moderate level of cheating is both expected and encouraged. Good luck to all the participants and thank you for your help!

Beer changes and Schedule Notes for Memorial Day Weekend
Lots of shuffling today... Boddington's Pub Ale (UK) replaces Hale's Cream Ale on the nitro tap Hacker-Pschorr Weisse Dark (Germany) replaces Franziskaner Weisse Dinkel Acker Dark (Germany) replaces Warsteiner Dunkel Bayern Dancing Trout (Missoula, MT) replaces Einbecker Mai-Ur-Bock I got to try the Hacker-Pschorr Weisse Dark this morning, and it's a great beer.
It's full-flavored yet refreshing on its own, and it goes great with the spicy items on our menu (I had mine with one of our Chorizo Breakfast Burritos).
If you're having a
Spicy Italian Sausage Burger , this would be a great choice to go with it. Schedule Note: Shultzy's will be *CLOSED* on Monday for Memorial Day. We may also close Sunday of this weekend if business is slow tomorrow (indicating that all our customers have left town for Memorial Day).
Check the blog tomorrow to find out what Don has decided.
If we don't see you, have a fun and safe weekend!

The UEFA final was great!
Lunch was hopping at Shultzy's today with the finals of the UEFA Champions League (Manchester United vs. Chelsea) on TV.
One side of the restaurant was for watching and listening to the game, while the other had the TVs on mute for the more conversationally oriented diners.
The game was fantastic (going to overtime, penalty kicks, and then extra penalty kicks) and the fans were riveted by the action. To help set the mood, we featured Bangers and Mash today, the British pub classic with a mild pork sausage over buttermilk mashed potatoes.
And you could wash it down with a Boddington's Pub Ale (from the UK) or a Budweiser (the official beer of Manchester United). I don't know whether we'll still have Bangers and Mash tomorrow, but if you're an Anglophile, you might want to check it out.

New Hours and Beer Changes
One small change to our schedule -- we're now open from 9am to 10pm Sundays.
It seems that many of our customers and employees like to sleep in on Sundays, so there's no reason in getting up too early. Also, for those fans of Weltenburger Kloster Barrock Hell, it's back on tap.
We're working on making it a part of our regular rotation.
We also added Warsteiner Dunkel today, replacing Dinkel Acker Dark.
And for those HB fans, Hofbrauhaus Lager should make an appearance on tap later this week.

Shultzy's mentioned in Seattlest
Seattlest , a city blog for Seattle has a nice recent mention of Shultzy's in a
recent post, "Whut We Did on R Summer Vakashun" . ...From there, we walked up to "the ave" for a surprising breakfast at Shultzy's Sausage ("Seattle's Wurst Restaurant"--ha ha ha). We say "surprising" only because the only information we'd been given was that we were headed to a sausage place. We didn't care, we just wanted food--any food--at that point. When we got there, however, and saw the breakfast menu, our tired feet wanted to do the happy dance. We enjoyed an awesome chorizo omelet with home fries, toast, and a cup of tasty Caffe Vita coffee. If you haven't been in for breakfast yet, check out our
menu .

U-District Street Fair
The
U-District Street Fair

Shultzy's will be open its regular weekend hours (8-midnight Saturday and 8-10pm Sunday).

Sauza Gold Margaritas with Fresh Lime will be $3.99 all weekend. Amber Bock will be $2.99/pint all weekend. And of course, we'll be serving our usual variety of draft beers, cocktails, and lemonade, too, so stop in and take a cooling break from your fun at the fair.
And the patio will be open out back for those who want to keep working on their tans.

The wait is over for one beer lover
A customer was shocked when he saw
Einbecker Mai-ur-Bock
on tap here today. Apparently he's been a fan of the beer for a long time and has been waiting 25 years to be able to get it in Seattle.
The last time he found it anywhere was at an Oktoberfest event in Tokyo, Japan last year. Luckily he came in today. We've only got one keg and it won't be on long. Einbecker's got a pretty cool testimonial on their website.
In 1521, Martin Luther said, "The best drink known to man is called Einbecker Beer." Now, that's a spokesman!

New Menu Item: Spicy Italian Burger
This one is an old favorite of mine from the early days of Shultzy's. The Novie Wedge (Sweet Italian Sausage Burger with melted provolone cheese, marinara sauce, grilled onions & peppers, and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese on a crusty italian roll) has been a staple on the Shultzy's menu since the very beginning.
I like it because it's like a sausage pizza, but with much better sausage than any pizza place I've been to. If there's one thing missing from the Novie Wedge, it's a touch of heat.
I'm a pepperhead, and I like a little spiciness in my sausage.
that's where the Spicy Italian Burger comes in.
It's a Novie Wedge, but instead of the mild Sweet Italian Sausage Burger, it has a spicy Hot Italian Sausage Burger.
In the old days, you could get one made custom for you if the grill wasn't too busy (the cook would "de-link" a Hot Italian into a patty).
But now, for a limited time, it's on the menu for you to enjoy any time. If you like the Hot Italian, give the Spicy Italian Burger a try.
And if you really want to be an insider, you can call it a "Vesuvius" (the staff's nickname for it) or a "Muzzino's Masterpiece" (how it shows up on the POS system -- named after Andy Muzzino, our in-house Sausage maker).

Everything I Needed to Know, I Learned in Shultzy's
Maybe that's a slight exaggeration, but it's interesting what you do learn at Shultzy's. I was talking with Doug, our bar manager, about beers this morning. We were tasting the Weltenburger which we agreed was surprisingly effervescent -- it will be especially tasty if the weather gets as warm as they're predicting for the rest of this week. Doug then admitted that he's become a big fan of dark lagers (he's been enjoying the Roslyn and Dinkel Acker Dark Lagers we've had on tap lately).
Doug was a lager guy before he came to Shultzy's, but after coming here and tasting a variety of dark lagers, he found a new favorite.
When I asked him why, he said that the maltiness of the dark lagers appeals to him.
And what does he like to eat with his favorite beer?
A Tim's Steak (Thin sliced Rib Eye Steak smothered in Melted Cheddar Cheese with Hickory Smoked Bacon, Grilled Onions and BBQ Sauce on an Amoroso Roll). If you're like me, you tend to order your favorites automatically when you sit down at Shultzy's, but Doug has encouraged me to be more adventurous and try some new combinations -- maybe they'll become my new favorites.

Alterations done while you drink...
... though I wouldn't necessarily trust him with anything valuable. Chris, one of our bartenders, is multitalented.
Not only is he the singer, songwriter, and driving creative force behind
Other Desert Cities ,
he's an amateur avant-garde fashion designer. During the 10-11 am hour when we're closed to get important work done, Chris managed to turn our bar mats into dubiously trendy apparel. Rory, our Grill Manager, modeled Chris' creation to absolutely no critical acclaim at all.

And you thought our menu was a little crazy...
Your Shultzy's correspondent is on the road again.
This time, I headed down to Los Angeles and had the opportunity to eat at
Pink's . Pink's is an L.A. institution since 1939 that serves up a variety of hotdogs and burgers to the 15-20 million non-vegans left in Southern California.
As you can see, it's a place with modest decor and an even more modest dining area (who needs a roof over your head when it never rains). From their giant menu, I chose a Millenium dog (not shown in their
online menu ) that was a jalapeño-flavored footlong hotdog topped with chili, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions and guacamole and my wife opted for the basic stretch chili dog. They were both pretty tasty.
And very filling.
Even 8 hours later, neither of us were very hungry. In the interest of culinary adventure, I wish I had tried their Pastrami Burrito (Big flour tortilla wrapped around 2 hot dogs, Grilled Pastrami, Swiss cheese, chili & onions) or their Bacon Burrito Dog (Big flour tortilla wrapped around 2 hot dogs, 2 slices of cheese, 3 slices of bacon, chili & onions), but I had other plans that day and couldn't resist succumbing to a food-induced coma. Overall, it was pretty tasty and worth a visit if you're in LA, but sadly there's no beer served.
I'm ready to get back to Seattle for a Junkyard Dog and a Weltenburger Barrock Hell (if the keg holds out 'til I get back).

FRESH Squeezed Orange Juice!
We cut 'em... We squeeze 'em... You
drink 'em... Who Doesn't love fresh-squeezed ORANGES? [Editor's note] Tim is the coolest!
He's our General Manager at Shultzy's and was resourceful enough to figure out how to post to the blog while I was out of town.
I never told him how, but he managed to do it all on his own.
The bad part for Tim is that now I'm going to expect him to fill in for me, since I know he knows how to do it.
DOH! Sorry, Tim... Back to the serious topic of orange juice. Shultzy's is offering a 12 oz. Glass (about 3 full oranges!) worth of fresh-squeezed Orange Juice is only $3.
I had one for breakfast last week myself and was wowed. And to put that in perspective, you can't even buy a gallon of gas for $3 any more and that wouldn't taste as good anyway! Or, maybe you're not an early riser; how about fresh-squeezed orange juice in your favorite cocktail for only $1 more? From personal experience, a
Screwdriver
with fresh-squeezed orange juice is a clearly superior concoction.
Or how about a
Tequila Sunrise
(do people still drink those)? Or an Orange Blossom (orange juice, gin and sugar)? I've clearly forgotten my bartending class of long ago. Thanks to a harmonic convergence of circumstances including delicious oranges, an FSA rep (Andrew) who used to squeeze oranges at
Wild Ginger
as a bartender there, and a bunch of fresh-squeezed orange juice fans working at Shultzy's, we added a new toy.
Just like any proud parent, we have to show you a picture of our new "baby". It doesn't have a name yet, but I'm sure it will (after all, our paper cutter is named "Ryan", but that's another story). It's a dee-luxe fruit squeezin' machine, and it's all ours.
And when you add fresh oranges, you get fresh-squeezed orange juice.
And that's NOT the "fresh-squeezed" orange juice that some people pour out of a brightly-labeled plastic jug and that was squeezed and flash-pasteurized in
Dinuba, California
by robots!
OK, maybe they don't employ robots, but it's still not freshly squeezed in front of you by Tim, Emily or one of our other all-human/no-robot waitstaff! So, come in for breakfast or happy hour, and we'll be glad to squeeze you some fresh orange juice to make your day a little sweeter.

Delicious and hard-to-find beers coming soon: Weltenburger Barrock Hell & Bayern Maibock
Our two kegs of
Weltenburger Kloster Barrock Hell
just arrived today (along with matching beer glasses).
That may not mean much to you now, but it's a big deal to us.
Don got a chance to try this German lager in bottled form about 18 months ago, and enjoyed it so much that he has been trying to get it on draft ever since. And we waited.
And waited.
And now it's finally here.
We think there are two kegs west of the Mississippi and we have them both. Muahahahaha! It's an expensive beer, so it will be at a higher price than our regular German lagers ($6.50/½ liter), but Don says the taste is well worth it.
It should be on tap this weekend, so keep your eyes on the "What's on Tap" list here on the blog's sidebar or you can subscribe to our
Twitter feed
and get our beer change updates via the web or even via SMS on your mobile phone! In a similar vein, the brewmaster from
Bayern Brewing , Missoula's oldest brewer, stopped by last week.
He talked with Don and enjoyed sampling much of the Shultzy's menu while talking about his beers.
We're lucky to have secured the last two kegs of Bayern's current year's production of
Bayern Maibock , and it should also be on tap this weekend. Hopefully, well get some nice beer drinking weather this weekend to complement these two great beers.

A cautionary tale...
Mike's finished. He's out of here.
He's given his two-week customer notice. He's taking his wife and moving to Virginia.
Just to buy some gigantic house for the price of 3 days of U-District parking.
And where is he going to get his Sweet Tea, Baked Beans, and Kosher Beef Frank?
He didn't think about that, did he? Let that be a lesson.
Never leave Shultzy's. OK, maybe I'm overstating things just a bit.

Breakfast to Go started this morning
With the introduction of our new Breakfast Burritos, Shultzy's now serves Hot Breakfast to Go. You can choose between three varieties, Spicy Chorizo, Bacon, or Vegetarian, all with egg, cheddar cheese, and home-fried potatoes rolled up to go in a warm tortilla.
I had one this morning (spicy chorizo) and it's a warm, tasty and filling way to start the day.
For the next few days (during the
5 Days of Cinco de Mayo ), we'll also be offering them during non-breakfast hours until we run out of them each day. And if you like coffee with your burrito, we have a great deal for you: a cup of
Caffe Vita coffee
and the breakfast burrito of your choice for only $4.71!
So, you can be out the door with a delicious hot breakfast in under 5 minutes for just $5 (the after-tax price).

5 Days of Cinco de Mayo
OK, the obvious question: where did we come up with this idea?
This year, Cinco de Mayo falls on a Monday, and Monday's not exactly a party day for many folks.
So, in the interest of mirth and general merriment, we decided to start our Cinco de Mayo specials over the weekend.
And if partying on the weekend's a good idea, it's even more fun to enjoy Friday night, so Friday got added too. And if there's a 12 days of Christmas, why can't we have a 5 days of Cinco de Mayo?
And that's how it happened. Cinco de Mayo (or "CdM" to its friends) features food and drink specials for the whole five days. Nacho Cheesesteak Served with grilled onions & peppers and sliced jalapeños.
7.99 “All-Day” Breakfast Burritos Try our new Chorizo, Bacon, or Veggie breakfast burritos with egg, cheddar cheese, and potatoes.
Served hot each day, while they last.
4.00 Nacho Cheese Fries Our irresistible fries topped with gooey nacho cheese and sliced jalapeños.
4.49 Sauza Gold Margarita
$3.99 Sauza Gold Shot
$2.99 ½ Liter of El Bitburger Mexicano
(Bitburger with a lime wedge)
$4.95 Mexican Beers (bottles)
$3.00
Negro Modelo, Bohemia, Corona, & Corona Light
“El Rey de Cervezas”
(Budweiser in bottles)
$2.50
