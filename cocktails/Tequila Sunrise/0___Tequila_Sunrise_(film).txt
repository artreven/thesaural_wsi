They released one album ‘So Red The Rose’, which went Platinum, and reached #30 in the UK & #23 in the US. The album featured four singles, ‘Goodbye Is Forever’, ‘The Promise’, ‘The Flame’, and UK/US Top 10 hit, ‘Election Day’. Along with three Duran Duran members, there was also a wide range of famous guests on ‘So Red The Rose’ including; David Gilmour, Sting (backing vocals on ‘The Promise’), Herbie Hancock & Grace Jones (spoken word on ‘The Flame’ & ‘Election Day’). The additional DVD was originally released on VHS in 1987. It follows the filming of five clips from the album ‘So Red The Rose’ & the fascinating combination of directors, locations, behind the scene footage & photographic montages which come together to give an insight into the world of video production. The collection of videos including Arcadia’s first single ‘Election Day’ are shown in full, including Dean Chamberlain’s rarely seen interpretation of the song ‘Missing’.

Nick’s Art & Duran Favourites of 2009
December 28th, 2009
Here are my Art & Duran favourites of 2009:
Art highlights:
The Surrealist Photo exhibit at the Pompidou Center in Paris
The Ed Ruscha exhibit at the Hayward, Southbank Centre, London
Anish Kapoor exhibit at the Royal Academy, London
The Pop Life exhibit featuring Haring, Koons, Warhol and more at the Tate Modern, London
The John Baldessari show at Tate Modern
The Tim Burton retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City
The John Galliano fashion show in Paris, which was exquisitely beautiful.
The Giles Deacon fashion show in Paris. I’ve seen all his UK shows, this was his first one in Paris, and it was great.
Duran Highlights:
Our summer shows including Edinburgh Castle (just beautiful), The Lovebox Music Festival in Victoria Park, London (very special, our first big outdoor event in London), and the West Coast Dates (fun to play, despite the fact that I had a broken foot!)
Our first tour where we used lasers – so much fun, they will definitely be back…
And working with Mark Ronson – he is a joy to work with and we’re making a record that has the real Duran Duran sound.
Hopefully we will be seeing a lot of you next year when we finally finish the album and we do some tour dates. This one is going to be fun to play live.
I wish you all a very happy shopping season for whatever denomination you are from, or supporting, and hope you have a great holiday… we will see you next year! Nic

Update: "Rio" special edition / "Live at Hammersmith '82"
DURAN DURAN - 2-CD & Special Edition release of 'Rio' - LP & 12" Vinyl Special Edition of 'Rio' - Previously Unreleased concert DVD/CD, 'Live At Hammersmith 82!' Release date: 7th Sept 2009 (UK)/ 22nd Sept 2009 (US) EMI is proud to announce the release of a 2-CD and Vinyl Special Edition of Duran Duran's classic 1982 album, 'Rio', and a previously-unreleased live DVD/CD concert, 'Live At Hammersmith '82!' 'Rio' was Duran Duran's second album and is as representative of the 1980s as it gets, at its best. A fusion of style and substance ensures that even two decades after its release it remains as listenable and danceable as ever. Through the sheer quality of its singles – Rio, Hungry Like The Wolf, Save A Prayer – and their accompanying, ground-breaking videos - which were heavily rotated on MTV - 'Rio' saw the band break the U.S., with the album spending a staggering 129 weeks on the Billboard 200 Chart. The 'Rio' 2 CD Special Edition is made up of the UK release of the album, the original U.S. album remixes (enabling U.S. listeners to programme their CD to be able to listen to the original version), EMI Manchester Square demos, B-Sides, remixes and other surprises (see below for tracklisting). The digital download version has 2 extra tracks. The LP & 12" vinyl special edition is the original UK album on LP and US album remixes on the 12". LIVE AT HAMMERSMITH 82! is a much anticipated release among followers of the band. Previously unreleased, it will come as a double DVD and CD pack, allowing fans to both enjoy the visual spectacle of the concert and CD audio, too. Filmed and recorded in the latter part of 1982 as Duranmania was sweeping the UK, the performance at London's Hammersmith Odeon includes 'Rio', 'Hungry like the Wolf', 'Girls on Film', fan favourite 'Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)' and more. The release also includes 'Rio' era videos and two previously unreleased 'Top of the Pops' performances. The concert is also available as an audio digital download.

NICK RHODES
Nick Rhodes
(born Nicholas James Bates on June 8,1962) is the keyboardist for
Duran Duran . Rhodes and singer
Simon Le Bon
are the only members to have been with the band throughout its 29-year professional career (beginning in 1980). Furthermore, Rhodes is the youngest band member and the only member that has been with the band since its creation in 1978.
He has also released albums with
Arcadia
in 1985 (a Duran Duran side-project), as well as
The Devils
in 2002 with
Stephen Duffy
who was the singer of Duran Duran when they formed in 1978.
Early history
Nick Bates was the only child of well-off parents, the owners of a
Birmingham
toy store. In 1978, Bates left school at the age of sixteen, and founded Duran Duran with his art school friend
John Taylor . At about the same time as the name Duran Duran was chosen for the band, he decided to change his name, allegedly due to being taunted by classmates with the moniker "Master Bates", to
Rhodes
after the
Greek island . He attended Woodrush High School in Hollywood Birmingham.
As the band coalesced into its final lineup in 1979-80, Duran Duran started playing at a local
Birmingham
club called " The Rum Runner ". The club owners became the band's managers, and
Rhodes
began working at the club as a
disc jockey .
Contributions to Duran Duran
The band achieved rapid success, and Rhodes was a driving force throughout. An unschooled musician, he loved experimenting with the sounds his
analog synthesizers
were capable of, but shied away from the "novelty" sounds of some other early synth bands. The distinctive warble of " Save A Prayer ," the keyboard stabs of " A View to a Kill ," and the string sounds of " Come Undone " and " Ordinary World " are some of his most recognizable creations. He also popularized the
Crumar
Performer on the early records.
Rhodes was also quick to recognize the potential of the
music video , and pushed the band to put more effort into their early videos than seemed warranted at the time (before the advent of MTV). His contributions to the band were sometimes underestimated by contemporaries and critics. Barely twenty when the band hit major stardom, he cultivated an androgynous and sometimes flamboyant image, wore heavy makeup, and changed his hair colour at whim. As the band "grew up" in the public eye, however, Rhodes's intelligence, determination, and incisive dry humour became well-known to fans and fellow musicians. He is known as the holder of the Duran Duran flame and in fact owns the rights to the Duran Duran name.
By the late 1990s, Rhodes had begun writing lyrics for Duran Duran, as well as music. His digitally altered voice is heard on the title track to the 1997 album
Medazzaland .
In 2001, the original five members of Duran Duran reunited to record new music; see
Duran Duran
for details.
Record production
Rhodes studied production techniques while in the studio with Duran Duran, eventually helping to mix several tracks on the
Rio
album, and was a co-producer on many of the band's later albums.
In early 1983, he discovered the band
Kajagoogoo
and co-produced their debut single
Too Shy
which became a UK no.1 (prior to any of Duran's singles reaching no.1).
Rhodes and
Warren Cuccurullo
wrote and produced three tracks for the
Blondie
reunion album in 1996; the tracks were not used, but one song called "Pop Trash Movie" was later recorded by Duran Duran for the 2000 album
Pop Trash .
In 2002, Rhodes co-produced and played additional synthetizers in nine tracks of the album
Welcome To The Monkeyhouse
by
The Dandy Warhols . In 2004 he produced British-based pop group
Riviera F
for their debut EP
International Lover , published on Pop Cult/Tape Modern (Rhodes & Stephen Duffy’s label).
Side projects
With his bandmates
Simon Le Bon
and
Roger Taylor , Rhodes formed the side project
Arcadia
while Duran was on hiatus in 1985. The band had a moody, keyboard-heavy sound, far more atmospheric than Duran Duran (or the hard rock of the other Duran splinter group of 1985,
Power Station ). The band scored a major hit with "Election Day" and the band's only album,
So Red The Rose , went platinum in the US but was less successful in their native UK. The band never toured and was dissolved when Duran Duran regrouped in 1986.
Throughout the 1990s, Rhodes worked on a side project called
TV Mania
with Duran bandmate Cuccurullo. They created a self-described "social junk culture triptych opera" composed of music, dialogue, samples, and "found sound," and hoped to make it into a Broadway play. The music and packaging have reportedly been finished, but they have not found a label to release it.
In 1999, Rhodes reunited with Duran Duran's original vocalist,
Stephen Duffy , to create new music based on some of the earliest Duran music the two had written together. The result was the album
Dark Circles,
released under the name
The Devils .
Also in 1999, Rhodes had a small guest appearance (in voice only) as a Canadian bomber pilot in
South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut .
Personal life
Rhodes met
Julie Anne Friedman
(heiress to the Iowa, USA
Younkers Department Store
fortune) at a yacht party while on an American tour in 1982, and married her on 18 August 1984. They have one daughter together, Tatjana Lee Orchid (born 23 August 1986). After a brief separation and an attempt to reconcile, they filed for divorce in 1992. Since his divorce, he has been in three long-term relationships. He dated British photographer/filmmaker
Madeleine Farley
from late 1992 - November 1999. From February 2000 - July 2001, he was romantically linked to American model
Mary Gray . He dated American actress/model/artist
Meredith Ostrom
from July 2001 - February 2009. He also had a brief relationship with British Socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson (from November 1999 - February 2000).
Rhodes became enamoured of the art world early in his career, making friends with
Andy Warhol
and
The Factory
crowd, and attending exhibitions worldwide. At the end of 1984, he released his own book of abstract art photographs called
Interference . Many of the photos were displayed at an exhibition at the Hamilton Gallery in
London .
Rhodes became a
vegetarian
in 1988, following an incident where he was cutting into a rare steak and blood spurted onto his shirt.
Rhodes's father, Roger Bates, to whom Nick was very close, died in 2008. Duran Duran's July 7, 2008 concert at the Birmingham NIA was dedicated to Nick's father.

ANDY TAYLOR
Andy Taylor
(born 16 February 1961) is an
English
guitarist ,
singer , and
songwriter , best known as a member of
Duran Duran
and
The Power Station . He has also performed as a solo artist, and served as a
record producer
for
C.C.Catch
and several other artists.
He was born and raised in
Cullercoats ,
Tyne and Wear , North East England, and attended
Marden High School . He began playing guitar at the age of eleven, and was soon playing with local bands, even producing one at the age of sixteen. He dropped out of school early to tour England and Europe with several different bands, playing working men's clubs and air force bases.
Duran Duran and Power Station
Taylor joined Duran Duran in 1980 (easily the most experienced musician in the band), and enjoyed their rise to fame over the next five years. He married Tracey Wilson, one of Duran Duran's hairstylists, in 1982. The couple have four children. Taylor invested his royalties in real estate, and once owned a wine bar in
Whitley Bay
named "Rio" after one of Duran Duran's biggest hit singles and albums.
In the mid eighties Taylor grew dissatisfied with the band's keyboard-heavy
synth pop , however, and longed to stretch out his rock muscles. During a hiatus in Duran's schedule, he joined forces with bassist
John Taylor ,
Chic
drummer
Tony Thompson , and singer
Robert Palmer
to create the band
The Power Station , which had three hit singles and played the
Live Aid
concert in 1985. The band was a distinct break from the
New Romantic
Duran Duran material as they pursued a hard-rock music style.
Taylor would later rejoin Power Station bandmates Palmer and Thompson for Palmer's first solo album since the band's formation. The resulting album,
Riptide
proved to be a massive success for Palmer.
After The Power Station, Taylor allowed Duran Duran to believe he would be returning to record a new album, even as he was signing contracts for a solo career in
Los Angeles . Another Capitol Records group,
Missing Persons , was disbanding at the same time, and Andy hired
Terry Bozzio
and
Patrick O'Hearn
to work with him. This caused ex-Missing Persons guitarist
Warren Cuccurullo
to approach Duran Duran to fill Andy's position -- a vacancy no one in Duran Duran knew existed. Eventually Duran Duran sued Taylor to force him in to the studio to complete the album
Notorious , but he ended up playing on only a few tracks before departing the band completely. He later countersued to claim some of the royalties from that album.
Solo career
In the meantime, Andy Taylor hooked up with ex- Sex Pistols
guitarist
Steve Jones
and recorded the hit single "Take It Easy" (US #24), which was used as the theme song to the movie
American Anthem . Ex-Missing Persons members
Terry Bozzio
and
Patrick O'Hearn
lent drums and bass, respectively, to the song and video. Two other songs by Taylor/Jones also appeared on the album: "Wings of Love" and the instrumental "Angel Eyes". Andy Taylor also contributed to the
Miami Vice II
soundtrack with the song "When The Rain Comes Down" (US #73). This was followed by his first solo album,
Thunder
(1987). O'Hearn again played bass for him on the album and during the following tour.
Taylor also contributed a cover of "Dead on the Money" to the
Tequila Sunrise
soundtrack in 1988. Taylor's former band Duran Duran would also allow one of their own songs, " Do You Believe In Shame? " to be included on the album. Also in 1988, Andy helped produce Rod Stewart's album "Out of Order" along with Chic members Bernard Edwards and Tony Thompson.
A second solo album, this one consisting of entirely
cover versions , entitled
Dangerous , was released in 1990.
Taylor played as a
backing musician
for several other stars, including
Belinda Carlisle
(on her single "Mad About You"),
Robert Palmer ,
Rod Stewart ,
C.C.Catch
and
Thunder . He then moved on to producing full time, working with several moderately successful bands throughout the 1990s.
His most recent venture is the album "Burger Kingdom" which was recorded at his Ibiza studio in April 2008.
His new band consists of the following members:
Andy Taylor - Guitar & Vocal
Liam Keenan - Vocals & Piano
Joe Breban - Drums
Miky Dunn
- Bass
Reunions
Taylor participated in the 1996 reunion of The Power Station, and in 2001 reunited with the other original members of Duran Duran to record their first new music together since 1985. Their ensuing album,
Astronaut , featured a blend of Taylor's heavy guitar with the synth hooks of the classic Duran Duran sound.
In 2006, Taylor again parted ways with
Duran Duran , leaving the band a second time, in the middle of the recording of
Reportage , which was scrapped by the band after his departure. More recently, Taylor strongly hinted in his blogs that Duran Duran's management company, Magus Entertainment, were partly responsible for his departure.
This was confirmed on the 4th of May 2008 when (following legal action) The Sunday Times(UK) printed the following retraction -
"Andy Taylor
An article about Duran Duran (Wild boys always shine, Culture, November 4, 2007), referring to Andy Taylor's departure, said he had failed to turn up for a recording session in New York and had sent a "blunt message . . . that he was leaving the band, with immediate effect". It was suggested that his departure was "still unexplained". Andy Taylor's departure from the band is the subject of continuing legal proceedings, but we wish to make clear that he was unable to get a US working visa to attend the New York recording session because of administrative failures by the band's management. His departure was not unexplained and he did not leave the band — the Duran Duran partnership was dissolved by the other members. We apologise and are happy to correct the record."
[ 1 ]
Taylor also wrote in his autobiography that in addition to the problems recording
Reportage , old conflicts between Nick Rhodes and Simon LeBon resurfaced. He also suggests that he was suffering from clinical depression during that period, following the death of his father.
Andy Taylor Studios Ibiza
Work on Andy Taylor Studios Ibiza (ATSI) was completed in 2006, a state of the art recording facility in
Ibiza . In 2007 Taylor created three MySpace profiles and an official website to showcase the new music he has recorded with singer
Liam Keenan . Tracks from artists which Taylor has produced are also featured, including
Hungover Stuntmen ,
Sonny J Mason ,
Juke
and
Veil Cassini
RockAffairs
Founded in November 2007 and launched in April 2008, Taylor provided the seed money and helped co-found RockAffairs.com, a website developed to allow unsigned artists to sell MP3s, sell merchandise, promote their band and keep 100% of the profit. It also pioneers a new Profit Share Scheme where 100% of income from listener signups is distributed amongst bands who sign up for the profit share scheme.
In June 2008, Taylor handed control of the company over to Sarah Eaglesfield, former webmistress at duranduran.com.
"Wild Boy: My Life In Duran Duran"
On September 9th, 2008, an autobiography by Andy Taylor was released. It covers a backstage look of Duran Duran's rise, an album by album look at how the band became synonymous with early MTV, the drug and alcohol habits of the band, and delves into Taylor's other works, both solo and with other artists, such as his bandmates in The Power Station, Steve Jones and even Rod Stewart. Above all else, it is Taylor's own accounts of his life, from the strong family ties raised in him by his father and extended family to the experiences of starting a family of his own with his wife Tracey.
Personal life
Andy Taylor married his long-time girlfriend, Tracey Wilson, in 1982. They have four children, Andrew James, born August 20, 1984; Georgina, born August 12, 1987; Bethany, born in September 1991; and Isabelle, born in May 1996.
