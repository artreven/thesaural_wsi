Dream Chaser
There’s a story to how Dream Chaser come about and why it meant so much to me,
but I will tell you all about it in the next posting.
In the meantime, this section is all about the drink, how it makes you feel and how tastes.
Here’s how I make my Dream Chaser.
PLEASE DO TRY   THIS AT HOME , and do let me you know what you think (this drink has never failed me before)……….
If you are privileged enough to have professional bar choices at home, then I would serve Dream Chaser in a Martini Glass, but as you
Are
Trying This At Home , you may need to improvise.  Dream Chaser can be adapted to a highball (tall) glass.
Improvisation is the key to innovative cocktails – the only thing it must have is
balance .  The aromas, the look, and of course the taste must blend together to make one drink – otherwise you may as well order your Gin separate from your Vermouth, etc.
So, when a recipe says 30mls of CnH2n+1OH (alcohol), 15mls of Vitamin A-Z, what it means is that the two key ingredients balance when one is twice the strength.  Balance is affected by everything from the size of the glass, the batch of limes, the weather and what you are eating.  All I’m saying is make this to taste good with the ingredients and equipment you have – and then it’s a perfect Dream Chaser for you!
This cocktail must be ice cold, so take time to chill it by filling both the glass and the shaker with ice to the top.
Put the ingredients below in the shaker (that still has ice in it):
1/5 part of Apple Juice
dash of Peach Schnapps
dash of Pineapple Juice
1/5 part of Passionfruit Liqueur
1/5 part of Passionfruit pulp
1/5 part of Passionfruit Vodka
2 – 4 wedges of fresh Lime Juice
1/5 part of Mango Liqueur
Now caps on, shake it about 10 – 15 times; tip out the ice in the highball glass; strain the cocktail into the glass.
Wait, wait, wait………not finished yet…….
Grab the Grenadine Syrup and carefully drip 4 – 8 drops in the middle of the cocktail and it will sink to the bottom of the glass.
Dream Chaser - Up Close & Personal
Wait, wait, wait……take look at the Dream Chaser, use your eyes before your taste buds, then take a little sip, and now tell me what you think……
Any questions, fire them through the comments section (button on your left hand screen), and I will get back to you!

Cocktails are like a dream in a glass, every one is different! Cocktails open a door to a world that is full of possibilities, a world where anything is possible.
If you were going to choose a cocktail to represent your ultimate dream in life, what would it be?
Perhaps, like James Bond, you would choose the absolute classics with a slight twist –
Martini :
shaken not stirred (and I have to go with him on the superiority of shaken over stirred);
Perhaps, like Sonny from Miami Vice, you would choose
a more classy contemporary cocktail–
Mojito
(again, my preference – shaken); or
Maybe even a more modern and innovative cocktail from the
Liquid Kitchen
by Woody.
What ever it might be, as long as it is made with absolute passion like my  Dream Chaser,
it is price less.

So tell me what your favorite cocktail is and how it inspires you!
This blog will be about how a creative and innovative cocktail can be much, much more than different alcohols mixed together.
For me, the most exciting thing about cocktails is when you put a little bit of CnH2n+1OH (alcohol), vitamins A-Z, palm sugar and a few surprising little extras, well shaken (or stirred), you experience flavors beyond imagination, sensations that impact on your taste buds, your mood and your life.
Now friends no matter where you are and who you are, as long as you enjoy cocktails, want to learn more about innovation cocktails, and want to be part of a little civilization that loves and appreciates innovation cocktails, please join me and share your thoughts……..
I will introduce you to my
Dream Chaser
in the next posting, watch closely.
Now it’s your turn!
