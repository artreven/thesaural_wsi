The Masters Martini is Here!

We did our research as promised, and this is what we learned about the favored
drink
for the
Master’s Tournament
at
Augusta National Golf Club . The signature drink is the
Azalea . We created our version,
Martini -style! Be sure to check our recent post on
how to properly shake a martini
for details on this important step.
Shake together the following ingredients: 1 part
pink lemonade
1 part canned
pineapple juice
3 parts   Skyy
Pineapple Vodka Enough Grenadine to color pink You can also add  in 2 parts
heavy whipping cream
for a creamier drink for a variety.
Again, shake with approximately 5 – 6 ice cubes per drink.  Garnish with a pineapple slice and 2  maraschino cherries
on an extra-long
golf tee
– of course!
You can see the results of both martinis below. The martini on the left is without cream, and the martini on the right does contain the cream. You’ve been warned, though. . . This isn’t your mom’s Strawberry Quik!!

Excellent recipe ladies!
I mixed a batch of your Azalea for some friends, and they were a huge success.
Keep the ideas coming!

Thank you! Glad you enjoyed it! If you fix it without the heavy cream, it is very low-calorie. We are going to start listing some low-calorie options in the future. We are already gearing up for our next one, so keep watching. Thanks again!

Very nice…although I’m tempted to replace the cream with egg white – you’ll get the same creaminess with the extra sweetness of the cream.

Interesting twist and far healthier! Great thought. Thanks for the suggestion!

Thank you so much! We think the presentation of the drink is important, just like the taste and aroma. Glad you noticed!
