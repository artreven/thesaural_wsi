Who is Eva Gaëlle Green?
Who is Eva Gaëlle Green ?[ 1 ]
Green is know as a French actress, raised in Paris and living
partly in London. She has been noted by
Vogue
for her “killer looks, intelligence and
modesty”, [ 2 ]
and described by
The Independent
as “ gothic , quirky, and sexy”. [ 3 ]
The daughter of actress
Marlène Jobert , Green performed in theatre before making her
film debut in
The Dreamers
(2003), which generated
controversy over her numerous nude scenes. She achieved greater fame for
her parts in
Kingdom of Heaven
(2005), and
in the 2006
James Bond film
Casino Royale , for which she
won a
BAFTA . She has also modeled for numerous brands.
Eva Green was
born 5 July 1980 in
Paris , the daughter of French actress
Marlène Jobert
and Swedish
dentist
Walter Green. She grew up in the
16th arrondissement of Paris .
She is of
Algerian ,
Turkish ,
Swedish ,
and
Spanish
descent. [ 4 ]
Green has a
fraternal twin
sister
named Joy, who was born two minutes earlier than she was. [ 5 ]
Green described her family as “ bourgeois “, [ 6 ]
and says that her sister is very different from her. [ 7 ]
Green is a natural dark
blonde ; she dyed her hair black
aged 15. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
French-Swedish actress
Marika
Green
is her aunt.
Green was raised in France, went to the
American School of Paris
where she
graduated, and spent some time in
Ramsgate ,
London
and
Ireland . [ 10 ]
Her school was English-speaking. [ 8 ]
Green was quiet at school, [ 7 ]
and developed an interest in
Egyptology
when she visited the
Louvre
at age seven. [ 11 ]
Green aspired to become an actress at age fourteen, when she saw
Isabelle Adjani
in
The Story of Adele H. . Jobert initially
feared the effect an acting career would have on her sensitive daughter,
but she soon supported her ambitions. [ 10 ]
At 17, [ 12 ]
Green enrolled at Eva St. Paul Drama School in
Paris
for
three years, and then spent 10 weeks at
Webber Douglas Academy
of Dramatic Art
in
London . [ 1 ]
Green stated that at drama school, “I always picked the really evil
roles. It’s a great way to deal with your everyday emotions.” [ 13 ]
Green trained at
New York University ‘s
Tisch School of the Arts
in New
York City, [ 2 ]
before she returned to Paris, where she performed in several plays. [ 10 ]
Green was nominated for a
Molière Award
for her performance in
Jalousie en Trois Fax . [ 14 ]
Director
Bernardo Bertolucci
discovered Green in
2002, and found her “so beautiful, it’s indecent”. She accepted his
invitation to star in
The Dreamers
(2003),
despite her parents’
initial objections because of
Maria Schneider ‘s accounts of
being
traumatized
while filming Bertolucci’s
Last Tango in Paris . [ 10 ]
Green performed extensive nude scenes, which she said felt natural on
set, [ 15 ]
although she was embarrassed when her family saw the film. [ 10 ]
Her performance was well received, with some comparing her to
Liv
Tyler . [ 2 ]
Green expressed surprise when a minute was cut from the film for the
American market, as “there is so much violence, both on the streets and
on the screen. They think nothing of it. Yet I think they are frightened
by sex.” [ 10 ]
Green followed up
The Dreamers
with
Arsène Lupin
(2004), in the
light-hearted part of a love interest which she said she had fun
playing, even though she generally prefers more complex parts. [ 14 ]
Her performance in
The Dreamers
convinced
Ridley
Scott
to cast Green in
Kingdom of Heaven
(2005), a
film about the
Crusades
where she played
Sibylla of Jerusalem . Green performed six screen
tests, and was hired with only a week before
principal photography
began. [ 1 ]
Green found the atmosphere of coming onto a film so late tense and
exciting, and also liked the film’s ambiguity in approaching its subject
matter. [ 13 ]
To her disappointment, much of her screen time was cut. [ 1 ]
Stephanie Zacharek of
Salon.com
praised her performance: “She doesn’t quite know what to do with her
character’s stilted dialogue, but she carries herself so regally that
you barely notice.” [ 16 ]
Nev Pierce of the
BBC , however, called her character “limp”. [ 17 ]
Green was satisfied when her character’s complex subplot was restored
in the
director’s cut . [ 18 ]
Total
Film
noted the new scenes completed her performance: “In the
theatrical cut, Princess Sibylla sleeps with Balian and then, more or
less, loses her mind. Now we understand why. Not only does Sibylla have a
young son, but when she realises he’s inflicted with
leprosy
just like her brother
Baldwin , she decides to take
his life shortly after he’s been crowned king.” [ 19 ]
Green was considered for parts in
The Constant Gardener
(a
role which went to
Rachel Weisz ) and
The Black Dahlia . [ 10 ]
She was cast at the last minute in the role of
Vesper
Lynd
in the
James Bond film
Casino Royale
(2006). [ 11 ]
Green was approached in mid-2005 but turned it down. [ 18 ]
Principal photography
was already
underway, and director
Martin Campbell
noted casting the role was difficult
because “we didn’t have the final script and a
Bond
girl
always had the connotation of tits ‘n’ ass.” Campbell saw
Green’s performance in the
director’s cut
of
Kingdom of Heaven , [ 20 ]
and Green was approached again. She read the script, and found the
character of
Vesper
far deeper than most Bond girls. [ 18 ]
Green’s performance was well received:
Entertainment Weekly
called her the
fourth best Bond girl of all time; [ 21 ]
IGN
named
her the best
femme fatale , stating “This is the girl
that broke — and therefore made — James Bond”; [ 22 ]
and she won a
BAFTA
and an
Empire
award for her performance. Both were voted
for by the British public. [ 23 ]
Green portrayed the witch
Serafina Pekkala
in the 2007 film
adaptation of
The Golden Compass
(coincidentally, it also starred
Casino Royale’ s
Daniel
Craig ,
although they did not have any scenes together). She found
it difficult being flown on a harness because of her fear of heights,
which led her to refuse to reshoot a scene on her last day of filming. [ 9 ]
Green hoped the religious themes of the book would be preserved, [ 18 ]
but references to
Catholicism
were removed from the film. [ 24 ]
Green next appears in
Franklyn ,
playing Emilia, [ 25 ]
a schizophrenic woman. [ 26 ]
One personality she portrays is a tormented artist (which she compared
to real-life figures
Sophie Calle
and
Tracey
Emin ) [ 27 ]
and Green described the other personality as “full of life, very witty,
big sense of humor”. [ 26 ]
She also filmed
Cracks , the directorial debut of Jordan Scott,
Ridley
Scott ‘s daughter, where she plays a mysterious teacher at a girls’
school named Miss G, who falls in love with one of her pupils. [ 9 ]
In March 2009 she begins filming
Womb , where she plays a woman
who clones her dead husband. It is a collaboration between actor
Matt Smith
and director
Benedek Fliegauf . [ 28 ]
In addition to her acting career, Green has modeled for Breil,
Emporio Armani ,
Lancôme ,
Heineken , [ 11 ]
and
Christian Dior SA ‘s
“Midnight Poison”
perfume, in an advert directed by
Wong
Kar-wai . [ 8 ]
She followed in her mother’s footsteps by supporting
Unicef . [ 9 ]
She has also expressed interest in returning to the theatre, [ 15 ]
and has no plans to go to work in Hollywood because, “The problem with
Hollywood is that the studios are super powerful, they have far more
power than the directors. My ambition at this moment is just to find a
good script.” [ 29 ]
She added she would probably just get typecast as a
femme fatale
there. [ 9 ]
Green considers herself
nerdy : [ 11 ]
“When people first meet me, they find me very cold. I keep myself at a
distance, and I think that’s why I’m so drawn to [acting]. It allows me
to wear a mask.” [ 12 ]
She moved to
Primrose Hill , London in mid-2005, [ 5 ]
She prefers the “village-like” atmosphere of the London neighbourhood:
“I feel more centred when I’m [there].” [ 10 ]
She lives alone, jokingly referring to her
border terrier , Griffin, as her
“husband”. [ 11 ]
She is an
atheist , having not been raised
to follow any religion. [ 30 ]
She has dated New Zealand actor
Marton
Csokas
since she met him on the set of
Kingdom of Heaven .
[ 31 ]
She has no particular fitness regimen, because, “I’m French and I’m
lazy, which means I
smoke
and I don’t exercise”, [ 32 ]
though she does run and she practices
pilates .
Green finds dieting too stressful. [ 29 ]
She thinks of herself as an international actress: [ 14 ]
she can speak both her native French and English fluently, [ 10 ]
and is also learning Japanese [ 33 ]
as well as perfecting an American accent. [ 14 ]
Green’s favourite film is
Cries and Whispers , and she is a fan of directors
François Truffaut , [ 34 ]
Ingmar Bergman , [ 11 ]
Tim
Burton , [ 34 ]
Lars von Trier , [ 11 ]
David
Lynch , [ 35 ]
and
David Fincher . [ 35 ]
She admires the actresses
Lauren
Bacall , [ 11 ]
Marlene Dietrich , [ 11 ]
Bette
Davis , [ 11 ]
Jeanne Moreau , [ 7 ]
Cate Blanchett , [ 7 ]
Juliette Binoche , [ 7 ]
and
Helena Bonham Carter . [ 7 ]
She credits Blanchett and
Kirsten
Dunst
as her fashion influences, describing her own taste as,
“bright pink lipstick, hot pink or
geisha
colors. Make up is allowed to be a bit weird, I feel.” [ 29 ]
Her favourite artists are
Gustav
Klimt
and
Egon Schiele , [ 2 ]
and she is a keen museum visitor; [ 36 ]
she particularly likes Chinese and Indian architecture, and framed
displays of butterflies and other insects. [ 31 ]
Green enjoys music, listening to
film soundtracks
and
classical music
when preparing for roles, [ 37 ]
and she plays the piano. [ 38 ]
