Yellow Curried Tofu
We can thank my Aunt Treva for this delicious curry recipe and for turning me on to cooking Thai food.
Makes 4 servings .
4 cups cooked brown rice
1 14-ounce can coconut milk
1 tablespoon palm sugar (or brown sugar)
1 to 2 tablespoons Thai yellow curry paste
1/4 cup chopped mint
1/2 lime
2 cups broccoli florets
1/2 cup sliced carrots
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 12-ounce package firm or extra firm tofu
2 to 3 kaffir lime leaves chopped (optional)
Stir-fry the broccoli and carrots in oil for 3 to 4 minutes, but make sure they stay firm, since they will continue to cook in the sauce later. Set aside.
Combine coconut milk, sugar, yellow curry paste and lime leaves in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Cook for 5 minutes or until the coconut milk begins to thicken.
Add chopped mint, juice of 1/2 lime, broccoli, carrots and tofu. Cook at a low simmer for 5 to 10 minutes to let the flavors blend together.
Serve with brown rice and additional lime wedges.

Add 1/2 cup chopped pineapple when you add the tofu. If you use pineapple, you might want to reduce or eliminate the sugar.
Experiment with other vegetables.
Pre-bake the tofu if you want it to be a little more firm.
Can easily be made gluten-free.

Grilled Vegetable and Tofu Dagwood
These can be made fresh for dinner as a variation on the
Grilled Vegetables and Tofu meal , or you can make the sandwich the next day using leftover grilled vegetables and tofu. Be prepared for a huge sandwich that will barely fit in your mouth!
Makes 1 sandwich.
1 hearty sandwich sized ciabatta roll sliced in half (or any other thick, hearty bread)
1 slice grilled tofu (about the size of the roll or 2 small slices)
1 slice grilled eggplant
2 slices grilled zucchini
1 slice grilled bell pepper
3 – 4 sun-dried tomato slices (reconstituted)
4 – 5 whole basil leaves
olive oil for brushing the bread
salt and pepper to taste
Brush the cut side of the bread with olive oil and briefly grill or place it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to lightly toast the bread.
If you aren’t making this with freshly grilled vegetables, heat the grilled tofu, eggplant, bell pepper and sun-dried tomato in the microwave or oven until warm.
Pile all of the ingredients in layers in between the roll for a huge Dagwood sandwich.
Buy the  What Dawn Eats: Vegan food that isn’t weird  cookbook for more recipes like this one.
Variations
For a regular sandwich that can be consumed by mere mortals without unhinging your jaw to bite into it, limit the sandwich to tofu, 1 grilled vegetable, sun-dried tomato and basil.
Experiment with any variety of grilled vegetables or tempeh instead of tofu.
If your grilled vegetables seem a little dry, you might want to brush the bread with a little extra olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
Make a low-sodium or gluten-free version by choosing an appropriate type of bread.

Mexican-style mocha – the Mexicano
This recipe builds on the
cardamom coffee recipe
I wrote about, not only instructions but also in how I came to discover the drink in the first place.
As with much of my cooking, I go with inspiration based on experience and love of ingredients and preparation styles. I invent many dishes this way, but it’s hell on my ability to repeat something – I’m not yet a disciplined recipe maker. That’s one reason I am writing these down now, to capture more of the process and result, to freely share the ideas, and to encourage myself to become a better recipe writer.
So the idea for this recipe just came to me one day when preparing cardamom coffee. The ingredients were all present in my cupboard, and I think they remain the best choices for this drink. In particular, the use of raw cacao nibs is essential in making the best version of this drink you can. I’ve tried it with high-quality cocoa powder, and it settles to the bottom of the drink in a very unsatisfying way. Using the raw nibs and grinding them with the coffee means they pass all their chocolate-y goodness in to the brew juice with none of the bean matter. Working from the whole bean means you have a fresh ingredient (instead of heavily processed), cocoa butter included with the cocoa flavor, and every other flavonoid/antioxident awesomeness is present, not stripped out in processing.
I call this a Mexicano mocha as it combines flavors I like in a
Mexican hot chocolate
(chocolate, cinnamon, cardamom – recipes vary, these are what I like) with espresso-style coffee and extra hot water (aka an
Americano .)
In your coffee grinder put your measure of roasted coffee beans, quantity to taste.
Take one to three green cardamom pods and crush them on the counter. Separate the seeds from the green skin, put the seeds in the grinder with your beans. (I found three pods works for me, some people prefer two pods, use one pod if you want a lighter taste or just as starting place to work up from. For me, four pods per cup was too much, but I can see people who would prefer more pods. For a taste more like original Mexican hot chocolate, omit the cardamom entirely.)
Add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon chips. I keep this form of cinnamon because it is small enough to easily grind, but large enough to have many flavorful oils trapped in the unground parts.
Add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon raw cacao nibs.
Grind the coffee beans, cardamom seeds, cinnamon chips, and cacao nibs together until the coffee is the grind level you want to work with.
Brew the coffee
the way you prefer.
The resulting brew will be very bitter because of the raw, unsweetened cocoa from the cacao nibs. You might like it if you like extreme bitterness, but I want a more balanced flavor than that. Other than a big dose of cream or milk to lighten and sweeten, I also use an equal amount of honey to the amount of cacao nibs in the original recipe. (If you split your mocha to two cups, don’t add the equal amount of honey to each cup unless you want it too sweet.) If using a different sweetener, adjust amount to taste.
I have used cocoa powder when I was out of cacao nibs, so a tip: add the cocoa powder
after
the drink has been filtered entirely. The very small powder will clog any filtering mechanism, slowing or stopping any brewing. (In a French press, I reckon it would just sink to the bottom.) Cocoa powder clogged my
Bialetti moka
and made it whistle from the escape steam valve.

Elderflower lemonade (cocktail)
My wife is a
big
fan of a
St. Germaine and champagne
cocktail. Recipes
vary , ours is (dry) champagne, St. Germaine’s elderflower liquer, lemon (I’ve seen some use limoncello, but
ick , give me real lemon anytime), and a lemon twist. Our
local
favorite
cocktail houses serve it in a flute or wide (martini) cocktail glass.
But when we want a bubbly lift without all the alcohol, we might make an elderflower lemonade cocktail:
Fill a tall glass 2/3rds with ice.
Fill glass 3/4ths with plain sparkling water.
Use a zester or peeler to make a long lemon zest twist, then cut the lemon in half.
Cover the lemon with a cloth before squeezing or squeeze through a screen to catch seeds, then squeeze entire lemon in to glass.
Add 1+ ounce St. Germain’s elderflower liquer, or to taste. You are looking for the point where the sweet just cuts the tart enough to be drinkable, but it still makes you want to pucker a bit – tart, not too sweet.
Rub twist around glass rim, squeeze to bruise the skin to release more oils, and top drink.
Days must be getting warmer, eh?

Cardamom coffee
(If you like this recipe, try out the next evolution, the
Mexicano, a Mexican-style mocha .)
When I first read about the
idea of putting cardamom in coffee , I was intrigued. I’ve always appreciated the effects of fresh, green cardamom pods in cooking, and the idea of an old Arabic tradition for welcoming a guest with hot cardamom coffee was too cool to not figure out.
But all the recipes I found didn’t treat the coffee beans, cardamom seeds, or resulting brew in a way I liked. I think many relied upon an older way of making coffee, where you simmer chunky-ground beans and seeds in a pot, then strain and sweeten. I’m more of a modern, fresh-ground coffee type of person. So I built a recipe that worked for me. This is the recipe for a single cup, increase proportions for more brew, adjusting the quantity of cardamom seeds to taste.
In your coffee grinder put your measure of roasted coffee beans, quantity to taste.
Take one to three green cardamom pods and crush them on the counter. Separate the seeds from the green skin, put the seeds in the grinder with your beans. (I found three pods works for me, some people I’ve gave this to prefer two pods, use one pod if you want a lighter taste or just as starting place to work up from. For me, four pods per cup was too much, but I can see people who would prefer more pods.)
Grind the coffee beans and cardamom seeds together until the coffee is the grind level you want to work with.
Brew the coffee
the way you prefer.
The resulting brew may be more bitter than you like. As I usually use a touch of cream or milk to lighten and sweeten my coffee, I also use a touch of honey in this cardamom coffee.

Coffee brewing
Look, there are a million ways to brew a cup of coffee. (If not a literal million, it often feels like it.)
This tip is for when you are doing any kind of brewing where you manually add hot water to the grinds, such as for pouring through a paper filter. It gives the grounds a chance to bloom in the water, surrounding each coffee granule with near-boiling water to extract the maximum bean juices.
Put the ground coffee in to a clean glass jar or cup with at least 8 oz of volume.
Pour boiling water in to the coffee cup you will use for making coffee. This heats the cup and cools the water slightly to  brewing temperature.
Pour 4+ oz slightly-cooled water over the grounds in the jar/cup, then stir until fully moistened.
Wait 15 to 30 seconds, but not much longer than 1 minute so it doesn’t cool down too much.
Pour the water and grounds over your filter, finish brewing as usual.
You can use this method to prepare coffee for a large coffee maker.
At
one cafe I go to , I noticed they do a similar thing. They put the grounds in a French press, let it sit, then press it, and pour the resulting brew through a paper or gold filter. Functionally the same was what I do at home, with more to clean-up.

Homemade barbecue sauce
I asked
my wife
if she wanted a classic red tomato sweet-tangy sauce for barbecue, and of course the answer was yes. Sure, a
Hoisin sauce-style
would go well, too, but some things just scream “BBQ SAUCE!”
Rather than having a secret family recipe, I prefer to create one from scratch each time and savor the process and result. I suppose one day I’ll cook up something with bourbon and bourbon vanillla, but for now today’s sauce went something like this. All ingredients used are organic and/or from
our own urban farm .
Filled a two-quart pot more than half-way with frozen cherry tomatoes – from last Summer’s garden. I poured in about two tablespoons of white vinegar, then put a lid on and ran them on medium heat until they were heated through. Once soft, I mashed them down with a potato masher.
Chopped and added to the tomatoes: one small mild green pepper, one-quarter of a big red bell pepper, and one medium yellow onion. I put the lid back on and simmered it until the veggies were all cooked through.
Put the whole mess in to the blender, put on a lid with the center hole open and covered that
loosely
with a towel. There will be a burst up of hot blending matter when the blender starts, and it is much less explosive when there is an easy vent (the towel) for the heated air to escape.
Blended until smooth, knowing the skins and seeds won’t really blend so don’t bother. Ran this all through a fine-mesh sieve, using a silicone spatula to rub the sauce back, forth, around in circles until all the juices ran through the sieve. Scrapped the bottom of the side, and fed the tomato skins and seeds to the chickens.
This sauce base now needs flavor balancing with a focus on sweet-tangy. I put in more salt to taste (less than a teaspoon, we want this sauce to go with salty/savory foods), a few grinds of black pepper, a few shakes of hot sauce, a tablespoon of sweet red paprika (basically roasted and ground sweet red peppers), then the tart and sweet: just less than  1/4 cup of
coconut sugar crystals
(works like brown sugar), 1/4 cup honey, and just a bit more than 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar with a few shakes of white vinegar and blood-orange balsamic vinegar. Adjust the sweet-tangy to taste and preference; I ended up shaking in a bit more red wine vinegar, too.
Put a screen lid on top of the sauce and reduced it to almost half of the original volume (very messy). Rebalanced flavors, and it’s done.

Linuxchefs.org planet using OpenShift
After
Jason Brooks
made an
OpenShift quickstart for Venus , the blog feed aggregator known as a
planet , I knew it was time to finally get
linuxchefs.org
off the ground.
I registered this domain years ago as a community project identity for getting free expo passes to LinuxWorld. It was just an idea for a domain name that came to my head at the moment of registration, as a crossover of my interests in free and open software and cooking.
So I am kicking off this idea, with myself as Chef de Cuisine, and inviting folks who are involved in free/open source software and who like to cook to be on the planet. All these folks need to do is provide me with a feed link. For example, when I write for something to appear on the Linuxchefs planet, I’ll use the tag ‘linuxchefs’ for the post, and it will automatically appear on the Linuxchefs planet.
Interested?

Roasted Root Vegetables
This is a great fall and winter meal when you can find a wide variety of fresh and interesting root vegetables at the local market. This recipe is really flexible and forgiving on both ingredients and cooking times, which makes it a great side dish since you don’t have to worry about having it done at exactly the same time as everything else.
Makes 4 servings .
2 lbs root vegetables, peeled and cut into 1-2 inch pieces (potatoes, carrots, parsnips, turnips, celeriac, beets*, etc.)
1 medium onion, peeled and cut into 1/3 inch wedges
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon rosemary
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (more or less to taste)
salt & pepper to taste
1 head garlic, separated into cloves and peeled
Heat oven to 400 degrees.
Combine the olive oil, balsamic, rosemary, salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl.
Toss the vegetables and onion (but not the garlic) with the oil and spices in the large mixing bowl. Remove from the bowl and place the root vegetables and onion in a roasting pan or cookie sheet, but do not crowd or stack the vegetables. Try to get everything in a single layer if possible, which might require an extra sheet or pan.
Roast the mixture for a total of 45-50 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes. After the first 15 minutes, scatter the garlic cloves in with the vegetables. Continue stirring every 15 minutes until the vegetables are tender and evenly browned.

which goes over the history which eventually lead to this book being written.
This is my first impressions as I begin to immerse myself in this six volume tome.
The first thing that strikes me is that the books are huge, beautifully illustrated works of art.
Except for the last volume, which is more of a quick kitchen reference, each book is in itself a coffee table book which can be left out for guests to leaf through and admire.
This is where the first fault becomes evident.
In its attempt to be a work of art it forgets that its utilitarian purpose is to be read.
This is made difficult by the size and weight of each volume (the whole set weighed in around 47lbs.) which requires a coffee table or desk to read.
While not a deal breaker it does put a crimp on being able to read a couple of pages before I go to bed each night.
The book more than makes up for this short coming by sporting easy to read text and an easy to follow writing style.
As I had stated, the first section revolves around the history of cooking leading up to the modernist style.
While very well written and packed full of informational tidbits such as short exposes on most of the important figures in modernist cooking today, it does show the inherent short comings of history being written by an impassioned insider instead of an objective historian.
The text often comes off as defensive, lamenting on how the movement is often misunderstood and then aggrandising itself by drawing comparisons to the Impressionist art movement.
This would be a completely valid comparison if done by an impartial observer but comes off a bit self serving when written by someone who can be considered a participant in said history.
To the author’s credit, he does acknowledge it is a history as far as he saw it and others may have different versions to tell.
The text also seems schizophrenic at times.
At one point it seems to lament on the lack of legal protections for recipes but then tells us that a good modernist chef rejects secrets and instead seeks to share their knowledge with others.
A more objective writer might have balanced the discussion of intellectual property by musing on whether or not the lack of legal protections has in fact fueled the creativity that is the hallmark of the modernist movement.
Once past these few glaring injections of the author’s ideologies, the book is actually shaping up to be a great read and a good start to what could be the seminal cookbook on modernist cuisine.
It will also probably be the first one I read cover to cover instead of just rifling through to find some ideas for dinner.
The next few chapters consist of a microbiology primer and fundamentals of food safety.
I will post another review when I am done with those.

A day of eating
It’s been a while, so here’s the main meals we ate today – breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert.
Breakfast: Vegan Tofu ‘Egg’ Scramble
Ingredients
1 package mori-nu organic silken tofu (firm)
1 medium onion (we used a red onion)
1 package mixed frozen bell peppers
Soy sauce (tamari) (1 tbsp)
Nutritional yeast (2 Tbsp)
Garlic powder (1 tsp)
Onion powder (1 tsp)
Cilantro (1tsp dry, as much as you like fresh)
Turmeric ground (1/2 tsp)
1/2 Tbsp Earth Balance vegan buttery stick
Chop the onion. Open up the tofu package and slice it up, then crumble with your hands. Sautee the onion, tofu, and peppers for 3-5 minutes using the vegan butter. Turn heat down to medium and add the rest of the ingredients – cook for 5-7 minutes more.
We served this with some slices of homemade seitan we pan-fried with some fennel seeds and cumin seeds for a sausage-y flavor.

Lunch: Ethiopian Lentil Stew & Roasted Cauliflower
Ingredients
2 cups dry lentils, rinsed (we used red lentils)
1 onion, chopped
2 teaspoons of berebere paste
2 cloves crushed garlic
water
salt (to taste)
1 large head of cauliflower
Olive oil spray
First, get the lentils cooking. Measure out and rinse the lentils. Place into a crockpot. Chop the onion and crush the garlic, and put these in the crockpot as well. Measure out 2 teaspoons of berebere paste, mix them well with the rest of the ingredients in the crockpot. Pour enough water to cover the mixture and cook on high for 2 hours.
After the lentils have cooked for about an hour, prepare the cauliflower. Turn oven up to 450F. Break the cauliflower head into small florets. Place florets in a roasting pan and spray lightly with some olive oil (or other oil of choice), mixing the florets to make sure all are lightly coated. Roast for 45 minutes.
Once everything’s done, serve the lentils poured on top of the cauliflower.

1 Tbsp Tamari
1 Tbsp ketchup
1/4 tsp powdered ginger
1/2 tsp salt
1.5 Tbsp arrowroot
Fire up the broiler! Dice the tofu up into biteable chunks and arrange in a grid (no tofu pieces touching!) on a lightly-oiled pan. Spray some oil on top of the pieces when done arranging. Stick pan in the broiler, 4 minutes the first side, 4 minutes the second.
While the tofu’s going, mix and heat all the other ingredients in a small sauce pot, stirring occasionally. When your tofu’s ready to go, stir it into the pot to coat in sweet & sour sauce. We served it on top of some vermicelli / rice noodles. Enjoy!

First we’ll make a compote of the peaches. Put the peaches in a pot at a low temperature. It’ll take about 10-15 minutes but they’ll eventually turn into an applesauce like delicious peachy mixture. While the peaches are cooking, spoon out 1/2 cup each of the cottage cheese in two dessert bowls. Once the peach compote is done, distribute it between the two dessert dishes.

Beet Pickles!
So we have a lot of beets lately. I’m not really sure what to do with them. I’ve roasted them and sliced them before but I’m just not that into them prepared that way. Sigh. Since we just did cucumber pickles this weekend, we were thinking, why not pickle the beets? So tonight I searched for a pickled beets recipe and found this one from
beetrecipes.org :
Tangy Pickled Beets
by Kim Stakal
We followed the recipe pretty much as written except we didn’t have tarragon so we used rosemary. I took pictures so I’ll rewrite the recipe as we prepared it.
Pickled Beets
5 medium beets (roughly 1 pound)
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup sugar
2 Tbsp salt
1 tsp dried rosemary
1 tsp mustard seeds
Chop the greens off of the top of the beets, and trim the bottom root off as well. Rinse them, scrubbing them with a vegetable brush under the tap, cleaning off all of the dirt. Then, slice them very thin – you can use a mandolin like we did or slice them very thinly with a knife.
Grab a large jar (we used an old tomato sauce jar) and sterilize it by submerging it in boiling water for 5 minutes. Place all of the sliced beets into the jar, pushing down on them if needed to fit them in.
Combine the water, apple cider vinegar, sugar, salt, rosemary, and mustard seeds in a pot, and set it to boil on high. Once it starts bubbling, remove it from heat and let it cool for 2-3 minutes.
Pour the liquid on top of the beets – we used a funnel to keep things neat. Completely submerge the beets. If there isn’t enough liquid, top it off with some extra water and apple cider vinegar.
Refrigerate for 3 days and then they will be ready to enjoy!
Servings:
I’m going to guess that it’s 7 servings.

Pickles!
We cleaned the refrigerator out today and discovered we had 10 cucumbers. A lot more than we thought we had, for sure! What to do? We decided to make pickles.
This recipe is very heavily based on Mark Bittman’s recipe from his
How to Cook Everything Vegetarian
cookbook with minor changes based on our taste.
Pickling Spice
3 cinnamon sticks
2 small dried red chilis
1/4 cup mustard seeds
2 Tbsp allspice (whole)
2 Tbsps dill weed
2 Tbsp coriander seeds
1 Tbsp black peppercorns
2 tsps cloves (whole)
2 tsps cardamom seeds
1 tsp white peppercorns
1 tsp green peppercorns
Crush the cinnamon sticks; break them into small bits. You can roll a jar or can on top of them to help break them up. Place the pieces in a bowl.
Chop the dried chilis up into small bits – if you are sensitive to spiciness, leave out the seeds. If you like a little spice, leave only 1/4 to 1/2 of the seeds. If you love heat, leave ‘em all. Add the chili pieces to the bowl.
Measure out all the other ingredients and add them to the bowl. Crush the ingredients in the bowl lightly – I used the bottom of a clean jar and pressed down on them. Crush them enough so you can smell the aroma but you don’t want to completely crush or grind them into a powder.
Pour the spices into an air-tight container and store. This makes roughly 1/2 cup of pickling spice.
Pickles
2 pounds cucumbers (we used a mix, including a lemon cucumber!)
6 Tbsp salt
3 cups white vinegar
2 cups water
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup pickling spice
Grab a large bowl. Wash and scrub your cucumbers, and slice them up. You can slice them into quarters for spears, or you can slide them into rounds, depending on which type of pickle you prefer. If you have a mandolin, you can use it, but all you really need is a knife.
Set a large colander out. Take 1/3 of your sliced cucumbers and layer them on the bottom of the colander. Sprinkle roughly 1 Tbsp of salt evenly on top of this layer of cucumbers. Take another 1/3 of sliced cucumbers, place them in the colander, and repeat, sprinkling roughly 1 Tbsp of salt on the layer of cucumbers. Place the rest of the cucumbers in the colander and sprinkle one last tablespoon of salt evenly on the cucumbers. Place the colander inside of the large bowl you took the sliced cucumbers from. Stir up the cucumbers in the colander with a spoon or with clean hands to make sure the salt is evenly distributed, and allow the cucumbers to sit for about 2 hours to sweat water into the larger bowl.
Mix the 3 cups of vinegar, 2 cups of water, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 of pickling spice, and 3 Tbsps of salt in a pot. Heat the mixture to a boil, then remove it from heat and allow to cool for at least 10 minutes.
Remove the colander with cucumbers from the large bowl, and pour out the water in the large bowl. Move the sliced cucumbers from the colander to the large bowl. Then, pour the cooled-off pickling brine over the cucumbers in the large bowl and let it cool to room temperature (we waited about 45 minutes.)
Sterilize some glass jars – it took us 3 jars, two empty peanut butter jars and one empty tomato sauce jar – by pouring boiling water into the glass jars and letting it sit for at least 5 minutes. Transfer the cucumbers along with the brine into the jars – we used a soup ladle, and seal them tightly. Let them sit in the refrigerator for at least 3 days, after which they will be ready-to-eat.
Servings:
Hard to say! It’s 3 jars of pickles!
Let’s say it’s 12 servings.

GUADEC is Almost Here!
Are you getting excited?
GNOME’s
flagship conference,
GUADEC , is taking off in a little over a week in Den Haag, The Netherlands.  I’ve got my bags packed and a draft of my talk written.
With one more concert tonight in New York City, I set off tomorrow evening for a much needed vacation in Macon, France where I will be learning classic French cooking at
Robert Ash’s
cooking school.  The first lesson happens on my birthday, when I will be turning a nice and ripe 33.  Fresh fare such as bar à la crème de fenouil avec ses pommes dauphinoises, confit de canard, and profiteroles au chocolat, among others are set to be learned.  I’ve been playing with the idea of having a fund raising dinner with all the proceeds going to the GNOME Foundation during this year’s Boston Summit.  Perhaps after the course I will feel confident enough to trade donations for my cooking.
Afterwards there are a couple of days of layover in Amsterdam between when the course ends and GUADEC begins.  At GUADEC I am going to be devoting most of my time to whipping
PyGObject
into glorious introspection shape.   Please join us at the
BOFs
to learn more, help us hack or get help porting your apps to utilize the power of introspection.  There will be a BOF on general GObject Introspection on Monday the 26th between 14:00-16:00 and on PyGObject(PyGI) on Thursday the 29th between 14:00-18:00.  Otherwise you can find myself or any of the other introspection and GNOME python hackers any time during GUADEC.  If you are a newbie developer looking for something to hack on to get your name out there while learning some core GNOME technologies,  there are some really easy bits to sort of take control of and run with.  There is a lot of detail work such as fixing annotations or doing simple overrides that would take little effort to get up to speed with but make a huge impact on the final quality of the introspected bindings.  Heck, find me over a glass of beer at one of the after parties and I will wax poetic on the thing needed to be done to finish the last mile of our Python plans.
After GUADEC, Colin Walters and I will be travelling to Berlin, both to save airfare by flying out on a weekday and to decompress after a week of non-stop hacking.   I’m looking forward to seeing many old friends and making new ones.  Let’s make GUADEC rock and continue to push GNOME to continue to excel at excellence.  With this year’s focus on GNOME 3 and the underlying technologies that support it there will be a lot of exciting things to see and hack on.

The Road to GUADEC
I’ll be heading to GUADEC this year thanks to the generous support the GNOME Foundation Travel Committee but that won’t be my first stop in my mega marathon travelling month of July.
I will first be travelling to NY around the 8th for the God Street Wine reunion concerts and will be making a pit stop at the Long Island Linux Users Group to give a dry run of my GUADEC talk entitled “The Future is JavaScript” which will continue with my theme from last year of continuing to meld the GNOME Desktop with the web platform (this year focusing on what JavaScript brings to the table)
I fly out of JFK Airport on the 17th for Lyon France where I am taking the week long Robert Ash cooking course at Rue du Lac in Macon, Burgundy
The class ends on the 23rd and my Hotel is booked for the 25th in The Hague so I am not quite sure if I will stay in Lyon or start my way up.  I know I have some GNOME friends living between Lyon and The Hague so I am offering to cook dinner for anyone who will let me crash at their place for a couple of days before GUADEC.
And then there is the main event – GUADEC.  My talk is on Wednesday the 28th at noon.  It shouldn’t be missed.
To relax a bit more, save money on airfare and because I love Germany, I am heading to Berlin for a couple of days before flying back to the US
If anyone is going to be in any of the areas I will be in and wants to hang out.  Let me know and I’ll see if I can make time.

Espresso Machine
Mo and I finally decided to a get an espresso machine a couple of weeks ago.
We ended up on a used Pasquini Livia 90 that we found on craigslist.
Turns out the girl who used to own it lives right up the road from us, so it was easy to pick up.
We’re still trying to figure latte art out, but so far it’s been a lot of fun.
Here’s a video of me playing with the new toy.

The Durian Experience
An
H-mart
opened up nearby, so we took a trip yesterday and ended up picking up a Durian fruit. We’d never had it before and were up for an adventure! The Durian came frozen – we let it thaw overnight so that its shell was a bit more pliable, and opened it up.
I have to say – the smell was not like dead bodies or stinky gym socks like some folks have written online. To me, it had a very heavy sulfuric / rotten eggs smell. It tasted good to me, but only if I held my nose. If I let the smell penetrate my noise, I simply could not enjoy it in my mouth at all. When I ate it, it felt like it stunk up my whole mouth – I had to drink something to rinse it out with every mouthful. It’s a savory kind of fruity taste. It was mild so I’m guessing it wasn’t super ripe.
The smell doesn’t let loose as soon as you open it – it took a few minutes for us to fully absorb it. Note that Ray enjoyed the durian a whole lot more than me – the smell didn’t really bother him at all!
We made some videos of the opening of the durian and the aftermath:

Butternut & mushroom soup and yummy crusty bread
So we attempted the ‘Butternut Squash and Duxelles Casserole’ in the latest
Vegetarian Times
print magazine but it came out a bit of a disaster. The problem? We used butternut squash we had chopped and frozen from our bi-weekly share and didn’t bother to defrost it first. Whoops, look at those frost crystals:
So, hopefully we won’t make that mistake again. I mean it came out *looking* pretty great:
But the butternut was lukewarm-to-cold. We kept it in the oven double the time Vegetarian Times recommended, still not much improvement. So we decided to make it into a soup! With crusty bread on the side to go with it!
Butternut Squash, Mushroom, and Spinach Soup
Ingredients
8 oz mushrooms with stems
2 shallots
1 tsp butter
Parsley (we used dried flakes, 2 tsp)
Black pepper
1 cup skim milk
2 Tbs all-purpose flour
3 cloves minced garlic
2 oz munster cheese, shredded
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1 butternut squash, peeled and chopped – and DEFROSTED
10 oz frozen spinach (a little over a cup)
8 cups vegetable broth
1 tsp dried minced onion
1 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp nutritional yeast
3 dried chilis
Directions
Pull the stems from the caps of your mushrooms, and stick them in a food processor in batches until you’ve got mushroom paste. Put the mushroom paste in a large bowl.
Before:
After:
Peel the shallots, chop them roughly (no need to be precise or pretty), and food process them into a paste as well. Add that to the bowl with the mushroomy paste.
Before:
After:
Warm up a skillet (we use cast-iron) and melt the butter. Add the bowl of mushroom and shallot paste, and cook it for 5-10 minutes. It’ll get really fragrant and delicious smelling.
Towards the end add the parsley and salt and pepper to taste:
Preheat the oven to 350 F.
Grate 3/4 of the munster cheese into a bowl and keep it next to the stove. Whisk the milk, flour, and garlic together in a small saucepan on low, simmering. Whisk until it gets thick – it’ll happen fairly quickly – and then add in the grated cheese. Add the nutmeg now too, and remove the saucepan from the heat.
Layer 1/3 of your squash chunks in a casserole dish. Glop 1/3 of your cheesy sauce on top with half the mushroom-shallot mix. Add another layer of squash. Layer another 1/3 of the cheesy sauce and the rest of the mushroom-shallot mix. Add one final layer of squash, the rest of the cheese sauce, and shred the rest of the cheese on top of it all.
Bake in the oven for about 50 minutes:
At this point you should have a delicious casserole. We goofed, so ours was not quite delicious. In either case, you may have a couple of servings of this
8-serving
casserole and be at a loss as to what to do with the leftovers. Fear not! You can make a yummy soup.
We used 6 servings of the casserole above, and put them in a cast iron pot. We added 8 cups of
our homemade veggie broth , and a 10 oz package of frozen spinach. We seasoned it with 3 dried whole chilis, 1 tsp dried minced onion, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 2 tablespoons of nutritional yeast. Bring this all to a boil, then simmer for 5-10 minutes until you’re ready to eat!
Crusty Bread
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 packet of dry active yeast (or 2 packets of old dry active yeast as in our case
)
2 tsp kosher salt
1 Tbsp sugar
2 Tbsp Butter (we used Earth Balance vegan butter)
2 eggs
3/4 cup skim milk
1 Tbsp minced rosemary
Sesame seeds (~1-2 tsp)
We used a stand mixer, but you can mix by hand as well, it’s just more work! Add the all-purpose flour, wheat flour, yeast, salt, sugar, and butter in a large bowl and mix well. Add the two eggs. Mix well. Add the milk and mix at least 30 seconds more with the mixer.
At this point the flour may be quite sticky – if so add some more wheat flour until it’s reasonable to handle. Toss the 1 Tbsp of rosemary in and work it into the dough using your hands. Then, pull the dough out of the bowl and pat it (it should not be sticky! If so, flour as needed) into a nice round ball, then place it back in the bowl and cover it with cling wrap.
Let the dough rise. We gave it three hours, and it doubled in size. It may take less if you’ve got more active yeast than we did. You could also leave it to rise in the fridge over night or while you’re out at work.
Once the bread has risen sufficiently, preheat the oven to 350 F and lightly flour a 9″ x 5″ loaf pan – we used a silicon one. Pat the dough into a rectangle a bit bigger than the loaf pan. Lengthwise, fold the left and right sides of the rectangle to meet in the center, then pinch them together. Fold the short sides under so that the loaf is the right length to fit into the loaf pan. Set the loaf into the loaf pan and pat it down, and sprinkle the top with sesame seeds. We made diagonal cuts along the top of the dough as well for decoration.
Bake the bread for 40 minutes. The smell of the bread and the rosemary is going to make it hard to wait the full 40 minutes. But once the 40 minutes are up and the top of the bread is nice and golden, you’re in for more torture – you’ve got to let the bread cool.
Pull the loaf pan out of the oven, place a cutting board on top and flip it over. The loaf should come out without much trouble. Now let it cool on a wire rack at least 10 minutes and try not to eat it whole.

Stretch Your Veggies!
Tonight was the first time we made homemade veggie stock!
It’s so convenient to buy stock at the store, isn’t it? We love the little single-serve tetra packs… just grab one and you’re done, it’s about a cup of broth per pack which is what recipes typically call for so you don’t even have to worry about using up a half-used open veggie broth later in the week before it goes bad.
I have always felt a little bad though, using the pre-packaged veggie broths. Tetrapacks are made of composite materials making them trickier to recycle. Plus, it’s extra money.
What we’ve done over the past couple month is to save our food scraps – that last little bit from the end of a carrot or onion, or the dark green ends of leeks and scallions – and dump them in containers in the freezer. This week I noticed we had five containers full of scraps so I decided to try my hand at making some broth with them.
We started out with scraps from some of the following:
Carrots
Leeks
Potatoes
Onions
Scallions
Broccoli
Cauliflower
Eggplant
Bell Peppers
Kale Stalks
We stuck them in a stock pot, filled it almost to the very top with water, added some salt & pepper and a tablespoon of oil, and brought it to a boil. (It took a while in such a big stock pot!) Then, after it boiled, we simmered it for a good hour or so.
Next, I strained all the veggies out using my silicon strainer, and dumped them into a bowl.
In the spirit of using what you’ve got to its full extent, sustainability, and just plain hippy-ness, Ray took the strained scraps a stuck them in our bokashi to help make nutrient-rich soil for our garden.
I’m now letting the broth cool down. Once it’s cool, I’m going to pour some into ice cube trays so we’ll have convenient little cubes we can melt down as needed. Any excess that doesn’t fit in the trays I will pour into glass jars to also stick in the freezer.
This was so easy. I will probably not have to buy broth ever again. All it takes is a little discipline to wash your veggies really well and to save the scraps!

Tofu Pad Thai
It’s been a while since we’ve posted.
Sorry about that. Enough folks have mentioned that they miss the blog such that we decided to start this back up again! It’s a shame though – we missed the entire summer produce season.
This recipe is adapted from a
Weight Watchers recipe
– and it’s even lighter than theirs. We substituted broiled tofu strips for the chicken, which when broiled with a light spray of oil, results in a nice crispy fried-like texture that mixes well with the noodles and veggies.
We used some apartment-grown produce in this recipe, by the way. Not a huge yield, no, but from a single pot placed in our kitchen windowsill, which doesn’t get so much light, we’re pretty pleased. They were very sweet and crisp, and made the meal more special!
Ingredients
4 oz firm tofu
1 medium carrot
1 large head of broccoli (enough for 2 cups of florets)
2 Tbsps soy sauce
2 Tbsps lime juice
2.5 Tbsps sugar
3 oz dry rice noodles
1.5 tsps minced ginger
1 Tbsp minced peanuts
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp red pepper flakes
1.5 cups bean sprouts
First, set one pots of water on the stove to boil. You’ll need enough water to cover the dry rice noodles in a medium-sized bowl.
Turn the broiler on. Press the tofu and pat dry if you like, and slice it into long thin cutlets. Cover a broiler pan with tin foil, place the tofu cutlets on it, and spray lightly with the oil of your choice (we used canola oil.) Stick the tofu in the broiler for a few minutes, and make sure to watch it so it doesn’t burn – let it crisp & brown, though. You’ll need to flip the tofu and broil some more to crip the other side. When the tofu’s set, pull it out and set aside.
Pour the boiling water over the noodles in a medium-sized bowl, enough to cover them, and let them sit for 20 minutes. Set some more water to boil for steaming the broccoli and carrots. As it boils, chop the broccoli into florets and the carrots into rounds, and steam for 8-10 minutes in a steamer basket in the covered pot.
Next, mince the ginger. Mix the soy sauce, sugar, lemon juice, and minced ginger in a bowl and set aside. (This is your fakin’ fish sauce.) Crush the garlic cloves and mince them, and drain the nodles.
Time to pull out the wok! Spray lightly with oil and let it warm on medium high. When the oil is hot enough, toss the minced garlic and red pepper flakes in and sautee until the garlic is fragant after about a minute or so. Next, toss in the drained rice noodles and fakin’ fish sauce. Stir and cook until blended maybe 4-5 minutes. We added 1/4 cup of water and added the broiled tofu strips and cooked an additional 3 minutes or so. Toss the carrots and broccoli in, stir to combine for maybe 1-2 minutes more, and you’re almost there. Garnish with the peanuts and you’re ready to eat!

Sweet Rhubarb Compote Tarts
Lately we are crazy about rhubarb, which is in season in New England right now. We bought 4 huge stalks, unable to resist the tangy & sweet temptation, and that night found out that you have to use them quickly after purchase before the stalks start to get soft. We decided a quick & easy compote used as a filling for little tarts would be the perfect solution.
This recipe is super, super quick. It looks and sounds more complicated than it is. Of course, if you went with plain phyllo dough and shaped the cups yourself then it would indeed be more time-consuming and complicated. You can save yourself the trouble with pre-made though! (We found
Athens Mini Fillo Shells
at our local supermarket in the freezer section by the pre-made pie crusts.)
Because this recipe is so quick, and because it doesn’t tend to store so well (we noticed the leftovers got soggy in the fridge after just one night) you’ll want to make this the day of the occasion (doesn’t have to be special
) you’re making them for. Any leftover compote can be stored in a jar or container in the fridge and eaten applesauce-style (yum!) You’ll need a large pan with a lid for this one.
Ingredients
4 stalks of rhubarb (a little over 1 pound)
1 large apple (we used a Braeburn)
4 teaspoons organic granulated sugar
4 teaspoons brown sugar
Small pre-made phyllo tart shells (we used 2 packages, 30 pieces total)
First step – if your phyllo cups were stored in the freezer like ours were, you’ll want to pull them out now to let them defrost a bit. Next, wash and brush your rhubarb stalks. Chop off either end of each stalk and dice. To avoid the awkwardness of the curve of the stalk, we first halved the stalks, then quartered each half length-wise and chopped from there. (See photo below.) Wash and dice the apple as well. We’re talking a fine dice here, a cubed inch or less.
Heat a large lidded pan (lid off) at medium high. When the pan gets hot, spoon your diced rhubarb and apple mixture into the pan. Add 4 teaspoons of organic granulated sugar and stir well. Turn the heat down to medium low, and cover. Let it cook for five minutes.
While you give the compote some time to cook, pre-heat the oven to 350 for the phyllo cups. After the compote’s five minutes are up, pull the lid off and check it out. You should start to see at least some progress towards the mixture starting to look a little bit like applesauce! Stir some more, cover up again and depending on doneness you may need to give it 5 more minutes more and check back. (We cooked ours until there were just a few solid chunks of rhubarb and apple left, and it was mostly applesauce-y.) Once turn, turn the burner off and remove the compote from the heat.
Line a baking sheet with foil or with silicon baking sheets and arrange your phyllo cups out on the sheet. Spoon the compote into the cups – we put about 1 1/2 tablespoons or so in each cup. Once you’ve filled the cups, take 4 teaspoons of brown sugar in a little bowl and sprinkle a little bit of brown sugar on top of each cup until you’ve gotten a little bit into each one. Place the phyllo cups in the oven, and bake for about 10 minutes. Wasn’t that easy? Enjoy!
You can make as many or as few tarts as you’ve got shells for. The leftover compote stores easily and makes a nice fruity cold dessert.
Servings : Depends on how many tart shells you’ve got. With 30 shells, we figure 3 tarts is a serving, so that’s 10 servings, plus we had 2 cups of compote leftover, and we figure 1 cup of compote is a serving as well, so 12 servings total.
Nutrition : 3 shells is 2 Weight Watchers points. 1 cup of compote alone is only 1 Weight Watchers point. Yay for rhubarb!

Rhubarb, Apple, and Pear Crisp
Rhubarb is one of those early spring treats I’ve been dying to try after reading Barbara Kingsolver’s
Animal, Vegetable, Miracle
this past winter. Not ever having used rhubarb before and not exactly sure what I’d do with it, I picked up 4 stalks at our food coop. When trying to decide what kind of menu we should cook for our friend’s party, I thought a dessert might be nice. In the past we’d all cooked the Weight Watchers
Apple Cranberry Crisp
recipe, and we knew our friend liked that recipe a lot. So Ray and I modified the recipe to accommodate the rhubarb. In our
Boston Organics
box this week, we had an apple and a pear, so we used those along with the four stalks of rhubarb. We did top with cranberries we’d frozen from the fall. You may want to garnish with some simple apple slices.
Ingredients
4 stalks rhubarb, diced into 1-2 inch cubes
1 medium apple, sliced very thinly and diced
1 medium pear, sliced very thinly and diced
1 Tbsp lemon juice
2 Tbsp granulated sugar
2 Tbsp brown sugar
2 Tbsp light butter (we used the vegan Earth Balance brand)
2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 cup whole grain rolled oats
Preheat oven to 350 F. Slice and dice up the rhubard, apple, and pear, tossing into a medium-size glass baking dish and squirting with lemon juice as you go along to prevent the fruits from browning. Mix the 2 Tbsp of granulated sugar in with the diced fruits and rhubarb.
In a bowl combine the brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, and oats. Mash and combine them with your fingers to make sure they are a uniform, crumbly mixture (see photo below.) Top the glass dish of fruit and rhubarb evenly with the crumbly mixture.
Bake until the topping has browned, about 50 minutes. The wonderful sweet smell will give you plenty of warning. We mixed ours together and served in small dishes

Quick substitutions
Substituting stone ground corn meal for flour when dredging fish you are going to fry is great as it give it a even tastier crunch.
Can you figure out why it may not go over well some people?

On Today’s Todo List – Pick Up 10lbs. of Meat
Thanks to
Joe Shaw’s recommendations
five months ago I joined the
Chestnut Farm’s meat CSA .   Today, fighting Cambridge/Arlington rush hour traffic I picked up my first monthly 10lbs. share.  It was kind of funny finding a mail in my inbox stating that I had signed up some time ago and oh ya you need to go pick up your share this Wednesday.  I almost skipped the mail but after looking at the quality of the meat I’m glad I read it.
It looks really tasty, unfortunately I spent last night cooking up 3lbs. of chuck beef stew which means I can’t justify cooking anything up just this minute.  I will however be taking some of it to my parents house for the holidays and cooking some for them.
At $8 a pound it is pretty expensive but I am treating it like a learning expense.  Since I don’t know what type of meat I will get each month I have to learn to cook almost any type thrown at me.  I figure during the colder months I will stick with soups, stews and brazing while during the warmer months I will switch to grilling and slow roasting.  If I like what they are sending me I may even get adventurous and see if they can send me the more exotic bits like sweetbreads though I suspect they sell those at a premium to restaurants.
Once I figure out my budget I may just start one of the vegetable CSA’s too.

The perfect French Onion Dip
Many French Onion dips are made out of powdered French Onion soup mix.  The thing is, real French Onion dip is just as easy to make with onions, olive oil, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce and beef broth.  Basically you make a pan French Onion soup and let most of the liquids evaporate and then incorporate the results into some sour cream.  I came up with this recipe after having some sour cream left from the icing I was making for my pumpkin cheese cake.
1 cup sour cream
2 small yellow onions
1 tablespoon of olive oil
1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup beef broth
salt and pepper to taste
Chop onion into half moons.  Add olive oil to pan and put over medium low heat.  Add onions and a pinch of salt.  Sauté for a bit and then cover with lid to sweat.  Once onions are translucent add beef broth and Worcestershire sauce.  Add salt and pepper to taste and boil down the liquids until there is very little left.  Let mixture cool down a bit and then add to sour cream, mixing thoroughly.  Add more salt as needed.
Refrigerate for at least an hour and then serve with potato chips.  So much better than the mix stuff and just a tiny bit more work.

Orange Tilapia in a Spicy Mushroom Cream Sauce w/ Sautéed String Beans
I threw together this dish a couple of days ago after sneaking out on Ty to go to the pet store and supermarket.
I knew I wanted to make a mushroom cream sauce and when I passed by the Tilapia on sale at Whole Foods I thought it would be perfect.
As all seafood needs some sort of acid to bring out the flavours, and since citric always works well, I was going to pick up a lemon when I remembered I had unused oranges at home.
That would prove to be a great choice for this dish.
I also chose string beans as a side because they are easy and are 99 cents a pound around here.  Warning, I love cream and butter (I cook mostly French style) so you can reduce and substitute to make the dish healthier but in reality when fresh, non-processed ingredients are used, health is more about portions than any one component.
Ingredients
Sauce:
2 cups of baby bella (cremini) mushrooms sliced
1/4 cups of onions diced
1 clove of garlic diced
2Tbsp. butter
1/4 cup of white wine
1/2 pint of heavy cream
1 bay leaf
1tsp. powdered cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)
salt and pepper to taste
Side:
olive oil (enough to coat beans)
handful of string beans per serving
a clove or two of garlic sliced
salt and pepper liberally
Main:
olive oil  (coat bottom of pan)
1 tilapia fillet per serving
1/2 orange per fillet (juice and zest)
a small sprig of fresh rosemary (reserve some for garnish)
fresh parsley for garnish
salt and pepper liberally
Instructions
Prepare the fish by marinading the fillets in fresh squeezed orange juice and dusting the sides with salt, pepper,  shaved zest from the orange rind and rosemary leaves.  Set aside.  Make sure not to leave it marinading too long (5-10 minutes is good) as we are not making cevice and don’t want the acid to cook the fish.
Start the sauce by sautéing the onions in a small pot with 1Tbsp. of butter.  Add a pinch of salt.  After a few minutes add the rest of the butter and the mushrooms and some pepper.  Sauté until the onions are translucent and the mushrooms soft.   Add the garlic towards the end of the sautéing process being careful not to burn them. Next add the wine and boil off the alcohol.  Finally stir in the rest of the ingredients and adjust the seasoning.  Let the sauce reduce and thicken on the stove.
Next start on the string beans.  In a bowl coat them with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Drop into a hot pan and sauté them until cooked but still crunchy.  Getting a sear on one side of the beans will enhance the texture and flavour.  At the last minute add the garlic slivers.  Put this mixture in tin foil to keep them warm.
In the same pan, wiped with a clean dish towel, put enough olive oil to coat the bottom.  Make sure the oil is hot and place the tilapia fillet in the pan.  Cook until the fish becomes flaky and delicate (3-6 minutes per side).
On a plate place the string beans to one side and the tilapia on the other.  Top the tilapia with the sauce making sure to include a heaping of mushrooms.  Garnish with rosemary and parsley.
The contrast between the heavy cream sauce and the light taste of the orange and flakiness of the fish was amazing.
There was a good balance of spiceyness and sweetness with a little bitterness provided by the parsley and string beans.
About the only thing I would add would be a bed of rice.
I even used the sauce to great effect on a pan fried chicken breast the next day.
Ty even hangs around when I cook.
And the truth is now that I have to feed, wait an hour and walk him at night I have a set hour in which to relax and cook every day.
Go figure.

Mmm, surprise dinner goodness
Before leaving for GUADEC I had purchased a pound of frozen shrimp because they were on sale.  Last night I needed to figure out what to eat so I decided to make some shrimp scampi over pasta.  I pulled out some of the shrimp and proceeded to defrost them by putting them in a bag and running cold water over them.  When I went to reach for the garlic I noticed they were all rotten.  I quickly rummaged around my kitchen and found a frozen ginger root and some green onions (also known as scallions).  The resulting mix was amazing as the ginger had carmalized on the surface leaving little bits of crunchy flavour explosions.  Here is the recipe for one serving.
Ingredients:
Pasta
5 large shrimp, shelled
1 sliver of ginger root,
brunoise
1 Tbls. of fresh sliced scallions
1 Tbls. Sweet Cream/unsalted butter
1 leaf of fresh sage
salt and pepper to taste
Cook the pasta in boiling water.
When the pasta is almost done start the sauce.
Melt the butter in a sauté pan and add the ginger, scallions and fresh sage.
Add a pinch or two of salt and sauté until the butter just starts to turn brown.
Add shrimp with some more salt and pepper and cook on both sides until orange to the eye and firm to the touch.
You need to manage your heat here as you don’t want to burn the butter and you don’t want to move the shrimp except to turn them once.
This will also allow the ginger to start to caramelize.
Toss the finished pasta in the pan and get it coated with the butter sauce.
Take off the heat, let it sit for a minute and then plate and serve.
Sprinkle some fresh scallion on for colour.
I would have taken pictures but it was so good it was gone before I remembered I had a camera.

Here’s to BEER
Fudcon is great but when I like to unwind I go to the American Craft Beer Fest.
Right now I’m getting ready for the beer and food pairing seminar.
Like wine, beer is very versatile as an ingredient (if you have ever had a beer can roasted chicken you would understand).
In any case we are about to start
.
In other related news Gravity of Debian X fame was here.
Great minds think alike and Linux hacker’s minds often think of beer.
Update
I tried to sneak off with the cutting board the food for the tasting was served on but to my dismay they let us just take them.
Way to take the thrill out of the equation.
I was however happy enough to get a high quality cutting board with the phrase “Here’s to BEER” branded on the top, and here is the proof:

GNOME Beer Summit 2007
I won’t be at the Gnome Summit on Saturday because of prior engagements (literally, I am going to a wedding).  We were however fortunate to get money from Google to host a
Beer Summit
on Sunday night starting at 7:00pm at
Flat Top Johnny’s .  There are a couple of pool tables reserved and free beer available so hackers can exchange ideas, build friendships and hustle each other in an enjoyable setting.
Now for a small update on the Cookbook.  I haven’t had much progress since a large number of unexpected distractions have popped up.  The good news is Lulu.com updated their site and one of the options is a wizzard for cookbooks.  Of the three designs for page layout submitted by,  Vinicius Depizzol, Silvia Miranda, and Diego Escalante Urrelo, I liked them all and they all fit very well with each other so you all are going to be the first to get a book, payed for by me, once it is published.
As for my name on
this list , I would like to thank the Acadamy, my Mom – hi Mom – Roderick’s Mom, and…what I don’t get to make a speech for being on the “B” list and I still have to wait in line at Spagos?  That’s it, I’m firing my agent.
