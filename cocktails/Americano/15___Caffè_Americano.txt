Hawaiian Isles Kona Coffee Company Kona Sunrise
Review - Hawaiian Isles Kona Coffee Company Kona Sunrise When you first smell this coffee, it has a nice smoky aroma.
After grinding it to espresso grind, the aroma has a bit of what I would call sharpness to it.
With an unusual aroma like this, I was curious about what this blend would taste like. When brewed as an
Americano ,
Kona Sunrise
has a very smooth mouth feel and taste.
The finish on this coffee is very clean.
It is the type of coffee that anyone, including those who prefer sweetened coffee, could easily drink black.
As the coffee cooled, there was only a slight bitterness that developed.
The roasters at Hawaiian Isles really know what they are doing. The folks at Hawaiian Isles classify it as a full/ dark roast coffee .
I agree. The resulting brew is nice and dark. It is a full bodied coffee without the bitterness that seems to be so common in dark roasted blends.
This coffee is ten percent kona coffee , the remainder being quality arabica beans from around the world. One of my favorite features of this company's coffee is the clip that is included for re-sealing the bag.
it is a lot more convenient and effective than the usual wire and plastic strip that comes with most coffee. I am going to have to get some of this coffee in bean form
- the "general purpose grind" stuff that my wife got from her co-worker is so good that I just have to get some coarse grind made up for my french press. For a 10 ounce package of their general purpose grind, it will cost around fifteen dollars, shipped.
Not bad for a great quality coffee, delivered right to your door. May your next cup be your best!
