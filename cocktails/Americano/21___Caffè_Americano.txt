We all know that living a healthy lifestyle is beneficial to our bodies and minds. However, when work and other obligations keep us away from the gym, yoga classes and the swimming pool, living a healthy lifestyle may seem an unachievable objective. Below are some easy solutions you can incorporate into your daily routine.
Take frequent breaks at work. It does not mean that you should stop working and watch a movie but leave your cubicle for a few minutes, look out the window, get some water and come back to your desk. Your body will thank you for the water, your muscles for the short walk, and your brain for the break.
If you need coffee, drink espresso or black
Americano . Forget about the flavored syrups, since they add unnecessary sugar to your diet. Do not add either cow's milk or soy milk. They both are processed and hard to digest, which means that the energy you could be spending on a task has to be spent on digestion. The slow digestion and sugar spikes caused by the syrups will make you feel tired.
Drink water and
coconut water , not sodas or fruit drinks. Water helps to eliminate toxins while coconut water replenishes the minerals in your body.
If you feel you need a snack, opt for a healthy one. Have a handful of nuts (ideally soaked ones for easier digestion). Fresh fruits and veggies are fantastic choices as well. If you feel you need more than that, dip them in almond butter. Try sliced apple, celery or orange and your taste buds will rejoice. If that is not satisfying, have an almond milk smoothie with fruits or super foods like cacao,
chia seeds ,
acai berry
, etc.
Choosing a healthier lifestyle is not only good for your body but also for your mind. You will feel happier and more empowered knowing that you have a great impact on how you look and feel.
