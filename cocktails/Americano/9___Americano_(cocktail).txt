It's still sunny!
Off we head to
St Valery Sur Somme
which I last visited
a year ago . This is one of my favourite places in the world so I have been itching to get back.
Due to being a house full of people, me not feeling well and 3 children to get up and dressed, we're late leaving and don't actually arrive until around 5pm. But the sun is still out and we head to the waterside to watch the children play in the water whilst we continue our regime of sitting and chatting.
The sand here is very fine and clay-like. Myself I'm not convinced its sand at all but I'm assured it is. Unfortunately it is also very slippy and when I inevitably fall down on on and get a much closer look I am even firmer in my conclusion that it is just mud.
Muddy, and sore of knee, I return to our umbrella shaded table and immediately order an
Americano cocktail . Its delightful bitterness just about consoles me.
We end up sitting at the table, ordering frites and more drinks, until we realise the sun has gone in, the shops are all closed and we need more sustenance than just hot potatoes and alcohol.
Off we head looking for nice food and on the way pass the macaroon shop I posted photos of last time. Weirdly they had thrown away a huge bag of macaroons. What had happened? Were they expecting a run on them but the hoardes of macaroon wanting tourists had failed to appear?
Dinner is different varieties of fish before heading home with the plan to return tomorrow and spend the whole day doing a basic variation on today with added mini-golf, shopping and playing on swings.
