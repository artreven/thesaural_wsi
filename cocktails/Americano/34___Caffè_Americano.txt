I stumbled across this
primitive dwelling
while exploring the rain forests of North County Dublin. The hut appeared to be built in the classic style as described in the essays of
Marc-Antoine Laugier
and I think it may have dated back to the
4th century B.C .
I had hoped to meet one of the aboriginal people from that area but there was none to be found so I explored further, found a  coffee shop and ordered an
Americano
and a slice of cake.

the rainforests of Dublin… who are you kidding?

Get to Australia already and enjoy a long black and lamington in a cafe!

The National Botanic Gardens is about as close as we get to tropical. It can be great on a cold miserable day. They have an onion exhibit that is world class and is helping with my ongoing research.
My wife thinks my favorite part is the coffee shop….

an onion exhibit – that certainly does sound entertaining
;)
I love visiting the cafes in museums and galleries – I always feel like I need to rest my feet after an hour. Go figure.

Museums and galleries have that affect on me but It is not so much my feet that need a rest as I need to “digest” what I have been looking at. I find a few breaks and I can spend a whole day in a gallery. We went to Florence last year and I had the Uffizi for a full day. Very rewarding but I needed lots of short coffee and cake breaks…

believe me, resting the feet does wonders for the eyes and mind

I was expecting something a bit more tropical from the first picture.

Sorry to disappoint, if it is any consolation I wish it was more tropical…

I am at the stage where I have been to the gardens so often I know what cake will be on the menu depending on where we are in the month.

Very fun! Looks like a wonderful place to visit. I love a good conservatory, especially if it happens to have a nice coffee shop attached in any way. And the architecture of the typical glasshouse is anything but dull, even when the plants aren’t in peak season. Great for shooting, as you demonstrate here!

This place is fantastic, during the winter it was great because it was warm in the glass houses – which are huge. But now everything has started to flower again the ground are spectacular.
It has a great selection of cakes in the cafe also which is another draw…….
