Part 1: Bow Tie Lover in the Flesh!
Part 1: Bow Tie
Lover
in the Fle sh!
Meet Tyler! A.K.A. Spiffy! The bow tie l o vi ng a pprentice bartender at the Boston bar
Drink.
Originally a West Coaster from the warm and sunny land of
San Diego, California, Tyler has learned to
make
snow hell
Boston his new home. A jack-of-all tr ades entertainer, Tyler came to the Northeast with hopes
of making a name for himself in the world of musical theater while attending the
Boston Conservatory,
only to develop a strong interest in bartending while working as the lead bartender at a local Sushi restaurant. Putting off going to theater auditions in New
York to make more time for bartending opportunities, Tyler decided to follow his passion and transferred to the
New England Culinary Institute
in Montpelier, Vermont. As a student, Tyler found that he was less driven to become a chef and more focused on educating himself on the art of bartending, and on earning a d egree in Hospitality and Management. After graduating, Tyler returne d to Boston in hopes of becoming a bartender on a more professional level, and earned himself a spot at one of Boston's chicest bars, appropriately named
Drink.
Going from musical theater to bartending might seem like quite a jump to some people. Do you find that there
are overlapping aspects between the two areas? There's definitely an
entertainment quality that both things possess. When you're in a show, the focus is all about the
character you're portraying and how to make the audience think your
entertaining enough to keep watching you. When you're bartending, there's still
that idea of performance when someone watches you as you make his or her drink, and if you try to have a conversation about the history behind the cocktail the guest is drinking. The difference between being the actor and being the bartender is that when I'm the bartender its not about me, it's really about the guest and trying to give them an experience when they're at
Drink.
There's no magic trick about bein g
behind the bar, but there is a real difference between hospitality that can be se en as
related to performing on a sta ge and just serving a drink and/or food that I think is an important distincti on to make. What's your least fav orite drink to make? Is there a such thing as a drinking faux pas?
In other words, what shouldn't we ask for at the bar? That's a tou gh question. I think that partly goes into that idea of hospitality vs. serving. For instance, if you want
some ridiculous or time consuming
tiki cocktail , and that's going to make you happy and your experience at the bar better, than I'm happy to make
it for you.
But if I had to choose a least favorite drink to make, I'd say anything with an erotic name; for example,
Sex on
the beach,
Blow job,
etc. I don't like to make anything too sweet or sugary. I guess it's not so much as they're a faux pas, but they're just annoying. Actually, sex on the beach was retired, so bartenders can't serve that anymore. Every year in New
Orleans they have this thing
called the
Tales of the Cocktail
where they have a funeral procession for the drinks th ey've decided to retire that year. Most recently they retired the
Appletini
and the
Redheaded Slut. But I guess a faux pas at a bar might be more alo ng the lines of snapping your fingers at the bartender to get their attention, or someone not knowing the proper
protocol at a bar. Don't interrupt the people next to you or call for me if I'm
talking to
another guest. I know you're there and I know you want another d rink.
Do you have a favorite cocktail to make? Anything fun. Lately I've been having a lot of fun with cocktail history. For insta nce the
Hearst
isn't a complex cocktail; it's just gin, vermouth, and bitters. But there's a great story behind it involving the "hoo ligans" who worked for
William Randolf Hearst.
Do you have a favorite drink? It really depends on my
mood. I would say all spirits; when I go out I usually have something along the lines of an
Americano
or an
Old Fashioned (no fruit!),
and I've had a lot of
sparkling wine
lately. I mean, I love everything about alcohol; I love drinki ng, I love making drinks, their history, their trends, but oddly enough I don't drink to get
drunk. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but that's never
my goal. For instance, I like
High Life
and
PBR,
but I'm not trying to get drunk off of it. I'm drinking it because it's refreshing and delicious. It kind of reminds me of a real simple but delicious cocktail called the
Bees Knees.
If you aren't familiar with the cl assics and you just want a nice refreshing citrusy c ocktail ask for a
Bees Knees.
You won't be disappointed.
What's a good bow tie friendly bar in the Boston area? Definitely
Drink.
I'm
trying to mak e some waves in the bartending world and rock the bow tie four to five nights a w eek at work. Then outside of work I always say collared shirts before t-shirts, and that gives me even more chanc es to wear bow ties. But I'd also have to say the
Citizen Public House and Oyster Bar
in the Fenway. I have some friends there that I've been trying to get into bow
ties and have slowly started to wear them. I think everyone should ask the ir bartender why they
don't wear bow ties. I mean, if that's what the paying p ublic wants... How can you rock a bow tie in a bar scene? And have you experienced positive or negative feedback when wearing bow ties out or working at the bar? Well, that's easy . I've always loved dressing well. I want to look good and put-together. My staples would probably be a plain colored shirt, a vest, a matching bow tie , perhaps a scally cap and nice pair o f jeans. I also like rocking the untied bow tie. It starts out tied, but towards the end of the night I leave it untied around my neck, who's to say how it gets untied but it's always a good time. But when I'm at work I like to tie my bow tie to a point where people come up and ask if it's real or a clip on, and then I BLOW THEIR MIND! When I was in culinary school I was known as the suit guy, because I really enjoyed wearing suits. But
w hen I moved back to Boston and started wearing bow ties
at the bar I became known as the bow tie gu y and/or bartender. And I love that! I've ALWAY S experienced good feedback from wearing a bow tie.
I actually haven't had a night at the bar when someone hasn't complimented me about my bow tie. People love it! ****Stay tuned for part 2 of our featured bow tie lover in the flesh Tyler, later this week!
