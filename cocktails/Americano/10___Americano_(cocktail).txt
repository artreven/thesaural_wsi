Part 2: Bow Tie Lover in the Flesh!
Part 2: Bow Tie
Lover
in
the
Fl esh! Are bow ties more like the centerpiece to a look or are they more like the icing? Right now, I think t hey're the centerpiece but I want them to be more like the icing. I want them to be like cufflinks,
they might not be the
first thing you notice but they really help pull a look together. Describe your style? Vintage-inspir ed,
o r my friends might s ay "newsie." It's dressed up without pretension. As I said,
usually I wear a s cally cap, bow tie, vest, plain collared shirt, and
jeans. Sometimes I carry around some papers, what's the big deal?! If I'm going to some event I'll to wear a nice suit, but if I'm cruising around town
I'm looking newsie- chic. Why do you rock a bow tie? Because they're awesome! Do you have
a favorite
bow tie wearer? There
are two gentlemen that come into
Drink
that always come in very well
dressed and wear bow ties. But as for celebrity bow tie wearers, it's all about
Huckleberry Hound,
Magilla Gorilla,
and a dozen other
Hanna-Barbera
characters. Also
Fred Astaire,
Bill Nye,
Charli e Chaplin,
Groucho Marx,
and
Joseph Gord on-L evitt.
I'm not sure if I really want to be associated with him, but I need
to throw out props to
Pee- wee.
He rocked it forever.
What would you say to people who were hesitant about wearing bow t ies? Shut up! If you do n't want to wear
a bow tie, then don't. Be boring. Bow ties are all about personality,
not taking yourself too seriously, a nd showing you're a fun
person to be
around. Is there any fashion era that you admire? Or does your wardrobe show any influence from any particular time period? I
really like classics.
There aren't a lot of patterns in my closet.
I'm really all ab out simplicity. I like how men used to dress up in the
'50s. I think the term dapper describes it all. I always want to look dapper. OoOTie Picks:
Favorite
of a ll time was a black and white dalmatian-patterned c ustom made bow tie
OoOTie
ma de
for m y special bar competition in New Orleans. (P.S.
DRINK WON! ) I also really
like
The Black
Tie
with the paisley inlay. They used to have a silver
one with a crosshatch gold and blue plaid that I also really liked.
Curren tly I really love the
Yellow a nd Blue,
it's a textured look
without being blaring. It's a really well made bow tie.
Southern
Inspiration
is also a really fun looking bow tie. But overall they're
all great for specific o r multiple occasions!
****Remember:
Make
sure to plan your next big night out at
Drink!
Have Ty ler, the bow tie
guy make you a really great cocktail! Be sure to say that
OoOTie
sent
you;) CHEERS!!!! ****If you or one of your bow tie wearing friends are interested in being featured on

Part 1: Bow Tie Lover in the Flesh!
Part 1: Bow Tie
Lover
in the Fle sh!
Meet Tyler! A.K.A. Spiffy! The bow tie l o vi ng a pprentice bartender at the Boston bar
Drink.
Originally a West Coaster from the warm and sunny land of
San Diego, California, Tyler has learned to
make
snow hell
Boston his new home. A jack-of-all tr ades entertainer, Tyler came to the Northeast with hopes
of making a name for himself in the world of musical theater while attending the
Boston Conservatory,
only to develop a strong interest in bartending while working as the lead bartender at a local Sushi restaurant. Putting off going to theater auditions in New
York to make more time for bartending opportunities, Tyler decided to follow his passion and transferred to the
New England Culinary Institute
in Montpelier, Vermont. As a student, Tyler found that he was less driven to become a chef and more focused on educating himself on the art of bartending, and on earning a d egree in Hospitality and Management. After graduating, Tyler returne d to Boston in hopes of becoming a bartender on a more professional level, and earned himself a spot at one of Boston's chicest bars, appropriately named
Drink.
Going from musical theater to bartending might seem like quite a jump to some people. Do you find that there
are overlapping aspects between the two areas? There's definitely an
entertainment quality that both things possess. When you're in a show, the focus is all about the
character you're portraying and how to make the audience think your
entertaining enough to keep watching you. When you're bartending, there's still
that idea of performance when someone watches you as you make his or her drink, and if you try to have a conversation about the history behind the cocktail the guest is drinking. The difference between being the actor and being the bartender is that when I'm the bartender its not about me, it's really about the guest and trying to give them an experience when they're at
Drink.
There's no magic trick about bein g
behind the bar, but there is a real difference between hospitality that can be se en as
related to performing on a sta ge and just serving a drink and/or food that I think is an important distincti on to make. What's your least fav orite drink to make? Is there a such thing as a drinking faux pas?
In other words, what shouldn't we ask for at the bar? That's a tou gh question. I think that partly goes into that idea of hospitality vs. serving. For instance, if you want
some ridiculous or time consuming
tiki cocktail , and that's going to make you happy and your experience at the bar better, than I'm happy to make
it for you.
But if I had to choose a least favorite drink to make, I'd say anything with an erotic name; for example,
Sex on
the beach,
Blow job,
etc. I don't like to make anything too sweet or sugary. I guess it's not so much as they're a faux pas, but they're just annoying. Actually, sex on the beach was retired, so bartenders can't serve that anymore. Every year in New
Orleans they have this thing
called the
Tales of the Cocktail
where they have a funeral procession for the drinks th ey've decided to retire that year. Most recently they retired the
Appletini
and the
Redheaded Slut. But I guess a faux pas at a bar might be more alo ng the lines of snapping your fingers at the bartender to get their attention, or someone not knowing the proper
protocol at a bar. Don't interrupt the people next to you or call for me if I'm
talking to
another guest. I know you're there and I know you want another d rink.
Do you have a favorite cocktail to make? Anything fun. Lately I've been having a lot of fun with cocktail history. For insta nce the
Hearst
isn't a complex cocktail; it's just gin, vermouth, and bitters. But there's a great story behind it involving the "hoo ligans" who worked for
William Randolf Hearst.
Do you have a favorite drink? It really depends on my
mood. I would say all spirits; when I go out I usually have something along the lines of an
Americano
or an
Old Fashioned (no fruit!),
and I've had a lot of
sparkling wine
lately. I mean, I love everything about alcohol; I love drinki ng, I love making drinks, their history, their trends, but oddly enough I don't drink to get
drunk. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but that's never
my goal. For instance, I like
High Life
and
PBR,
but I'm not trying to get drunk off of it. I'm drinking it because it's refreshing and delicious. It kind of reminds me of a real simple but delicious cocktail called the
Bees Knees.
If you aren't familiar with the cl assics and you just want a nice refreshing citrusy c ocktail ask for a
Bees Knees.
You won't be disappointed.
What's a good bow tie friendly bar in the Boston area? Definitely
Drink.
I'm
trying to mak e some waves in the bartending world and rock the bow tie four to five nights a w eek at work. Then outside of work I always say collared shirts before t-shirts, and that gives me even more chanc es to wear bow ties. But I'd also have to say the
Citizen Public House and Oyster Bar
in the Fenway. I have some friends there that I've been trying to get into bow
ties and have slowly started to wear them. I think everyone should ask the ir bartender why they
don't wear bow ties. I mean, if that's what the paying p ublic wants... How can you rock a bow tie in a bar scene? And have you experienced positive or negative feedback when wearing bow ties out or working at the bar? Well, that's easy . I've always loved dressing well. I want to look good and put-together. My staples would probably be a plain colored shirt, a vest, a matching bow tie , perhaps a scally cap and nice pair o f jeans. I also like rocking the untied bow tie. It starts out tied, but towards the end of the night I leave it untied around my neck, who's to say how it gets untied but it's always a good time. But when I'm at work I like to tie my bow tie to a point where people come up and ask if it's real or a clip on, and then I BLOW THEIR MIND! When I was in culinary school I was known as the suit guy, because I really enjoyed wearing suits. But
w hen I moved back to Boston and started wearing bow ties
at the bar I became known as the bow tie gu y and/or bartender. And I love that! I've ALWAY S experienced good feedback from wearing a bow tie.
I actually haven't had a night at the bar when someone hasn't complimented me about my bow tie. People love it! ****Stay tuned for part 2 of our featured bow tie lover in the flesh Tyler, later this week!

2011 Golden Globes Bow Tie Recap!
2011 Golden Globes Bow Tie Recap ! This year at the
Golden Globes , bow tie wearing gentlemen strutted their stuff down the red carpet as hard as some of the best- dressed ladies of the night. Including lit-up marquee worthy names such as
De Niro,
Gyllenhaal,
and
Pitt,
these fellas seemed more than willing to share the spotlight with some sophisticated neck wear. Although most Hollywood native bow tie wearers went with the classic black bow tie,
True Blood
star,
Ryan Kwanten , totally rocked an awesomely sweet, deep red, crushed velvet bow tie. But regardless of color, bow ties prove that they will always do formal wear flawlessly. Why choose a bow tie over a regular tie for formal occasions?
The grand poobah of
Bieber Fever
is a fan of
'wow how much more uncreative can I be'
the regular neck tie. Need we say more? Check out
this link
to see how a simple bow tie can instantly give personality to any standard black tux.

Turn a Non-Believer into a Believer
Turn a Non -Believer in to a Believer We've all met them. Those who are
unsure
about the bow tie's awesome wardrobe powers. They may be
sca red
to stand out of the crowd, or even feel
incompetent
when it comes to their bow tie tying skills, but
as your southern bell e, prim and proper grandmother might say, "AWW... HOOEY!" Put away your excuses, and dus t off your self-confidence, your new motto is,
"YES, I CAN TOTALLY ROCK A BOW TIE!" Recently I spoke with some strapping,
y ou ng, college-aged lads about why they
and their friends didn't wear, or even like bow ties? Here are some popular excuses they gave
for people not being able to live up to their bow tie wearing potential: "They're
too
hard to tie." (Good style
ta ke s practice;) "Aren't the y just for proms and
weddin g s ?" "I think when you have to wear a cumm b er bund, it's fair to say that you have t o wear a
bow tie." "No one
else wears them." (See wee kly section on bow tie lovers of the week for the rebuttal). "People will think I'm a tool if I wear
o ne." "People wouldn't take me seriously." "I swear if I gave a business presentation with one on, the professor would mark me do wn automatically." (Yeah, okay bu ddy.) "I feel like once someone had
on e
on, then everyone would wear one. They just woul dn't be unique anymor e."
(But you don't f eel that way when you wear a
regula r tie? Right...) "I don't feel like I could just chill with
it on. Ya
know what I mean?" (Actually...no. ). "You have to be like REALLY confident to wear one, I mean like REALLY..."(Relax! It's not like anyone's asking you parade arou nd in a
speedo). "Does it count if I've seen one on so m eone' s T-shirt at a party?" "I don't even think I own a shirt that I could wear one with. [LAUGHTER] No, I'm like legit serious right now."
As you can see, bow tie stereotypes D O
still
e xist! Sadly.
But this post isn't about provin g them right. No, it's about proving them w rong!
After shari ng a couple beers and some light discussion about bow
ti es, and why bow ties ARE cool
(more on my part), I decided to interp ret their reluctance against adding the bow tie to their closet as a challenge. This is about showing those who are on the fence about wearing bow t ie s, that yo u can keep your swag intact and still be comfortable. That is
an
OoOTie bow tie guarantee;) One Bow Tie, Five L ooks. It's that simple. Start with OoOTie's

Meet
OoOTie's
featured bow tie model Eric, or a.k.a DJ Mickey Robin Hood! A Boston native and double ma jor in business and economics. Sneakerhead, beer connoisseur, record scratching, aspiring Boston Marathon runner, an d bow tie wearer, Eric brings both the tunes and the style to any party. Let the good times roll when you hang with this bow tie lover! Describe y our style? " Hmm...that's a tough question. I wear what I like and I like what I wear. But I would also say I aspire to be modern-refined, with a tip of the hat to the past."
Why do you rock bow ties? What do you like about them? " I think bow ties add a sense of personality that can't be conveyed with just any old hat and/or regular necktie.They really help create a
sense of presence." Do you have a favorite bow tie wearer? And why? "Definitely
Andre 3000.
I'll be the first to admit that it's not always easy to pull together a look with a bow tie, but
Andre
just does it flawlessly every time." When do you think it's appropriate to wear a bow tie? "Anytime is a good time to wear a bow tie! I think one of the easiest ways to make it a part of both your formal and street wear is with a white collared shirt. It's like having a blank canvas, you can add as much or as little color from that point on, with the help of jackets, sweaters, and/or even bow ties. Bow ties are also excellent pieces to add to your look for when you're in a situation where you want to make yourself known.You don't really have to worry about coming up with some lame icebreaker, you can just sit back and let the bow tie do all the heavy work for you. People DEFINITEL Y notice you more when you wear one." Are bow ties the centerpiece to a look or are they more like the icing? "I tend to think of them like a really nice watch or pair of sneakers, if you pull it off right, it can be both subtle and apparent at the same time."
What would you say to people who were hesitant about wearing a bow tie? "Some peopl e may say that bow ties 'aren't really manly,' or that they harken back to bad childhood memories of
Pee-wee Herman ...ugh. But in all seriousness, is there anything in a man's wardrobe that can be so bold or outspoken other than a bow tie? A bow tie is able to create a kind of attitude behind a look that says, 'I'm here, I'm refined, and I'm confident. Deal with it!' On a personal note, football is my favorite sport, my two favorite adult beverages are dark beer and whiskey neat with a drop of water, I've been an avid boxer for almost three years now, and in no way do I think that wearing a bow tie inhibits my masculinity. But on the other hand, I can understand some people's hesitation towards wearing them. It takes a lot of s tyle confidence to be that guy at a bar, function, or party to wear a bow tie."
Who are your style icons? " Andre 3000 ,
Steve McQueen,
Miles Davis,
and
Bob Dylan. "
OoOTie Bow Tie Picks? " Do the Polka
obviously! But I also really like
The Black Tie,
The Gatsby,
Lucky Star, and I don't remember the name, you carried it a while ago. You know though, the on e with the old school bicycles all over it. It was so rad looking!"
