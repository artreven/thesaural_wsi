Stay in beautiful
Pismo Beach
and take a zip lining tour through the canopies of Santa
Margarita .  This package for 2 is one full of adventure! Enjoy an OceanView Room and a
Zip Line
Adventure tour for 2 with
wine tasting
at the end!
Why not have some adventure this time of year!  Take a long walk on the beach, then come back to your ocean view room and sip on a bottle of wine.  In the morning make your way to Santa Margarita and enjoy zip lining through the canopies!
With clear days and mild temperatures, Fall is the perfect time to visit Pismo Beach. The  SeaCrest is the perfect place to make your home base from which you explore the area’s many Fall Festivals and
Farmers Markets
that take place this time of year. Then retreat to our 5-acre oceanfront bluff with unique beach access and enjoy the most beautiful of sunsets. We offer stylish retro-modern guestrooms, super friendly service, free
WiFi
Internet , and a complimentary
continental breakfast
with seasonal cider.
We are just minutes away from award-winning golf courses, the best wine tasting, and a butterfly grove to which thousands of
Monarch butterflies
migrate October through February. In the evening, walk downtown to Pismo’s Restaurant Row and Pier shops, or cozy up next to one of our many fire pits and enjoy a fresh-baked cookie.
This package is great and includes:
1 Night ocean view room on a Friday or Saturday Night
Zip line tour for 2 in beautiful Santa Margarita Start
( The tour is offered on Fridays and Saturdays at 8am, 10:30am, 1pm, and 3:30pm all lasting around 2.5 hours
)
&
Wine tasting
to finish of a great adventure!
All this from $357
