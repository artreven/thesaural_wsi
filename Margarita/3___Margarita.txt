Under the Volcano: Food for The Mexican Day of the Dead
© Tomas Castelazo,  www.tomascastelazo.com
The Mexican Day of the Dead ( Dia de Muertos ) takes place from October 31st to November 2nd. Mexican families gather to honour the departed souls of their loved ones. To us, this may seem macabre, but, in reality, the festival is the exact opposite: it's a joyful occasion with much feasting, dancing and merry-making. Private altars are set up laden with colourful sugar skulls, fruit, marigolds, paper cut-outs and presents. It's an extraordinary, spectacular- and fascinating- carnival.
If you're interested in finding out more, there was a marvellous exhibition at the British Museum,
The Skeleton at The Feast , and the accompanying book is still available. Malcom Lowry's neglected minor masterpiece, "Under the Volcano" is worth adding to your reading list. There was also an 'iffy' film starring Albert Finney, Jacqueline Bisset and Anthony Andrews.
I've had a thing about Mexican food now for several years. My first authentic taste was at a drive-in gas station in San Deigo. You paid your money, and a tanned hairy arm shot out of a hole in the wall with your food. I seem to remember e mpadanitas . Utterly, utterly delicious.
So for this year's Day of the Dead, I've dug out two authentic- and simple- Mexican recipes that could be cooked at home. I'm aware that getting hold of Mexican ingredients, in England at least, can be next to nigh impossible, unless you buy from an online Mexican food supplier. But then that's all part of the fun, isn't it? Both recipes are taken from Marilyn Tausend's excellent
Mexican .
Shrimp in Chipotle Sauce
Take 20 raw
shrimps ( in England,
prawns)
and marinade them in 8 cloves of
minced garlic ,
1/4 cup of lime juice , sea
salt
and
pepper . Toss, until well-coated and let them stand for five minutes.
Heat olive oil in a frying pan and add a
finely chopped onion . Fry for a few minutes until golden. Add two tins of
chopped tomatoes
to the pan and let them bubble away. Transfer the lot to your Magimix and whizz. Add two tins of
chiles chipotles en adabo , 1/2 cup of
Coca-Cola
and a pinch or two of
dried oregano . Whizz. That's your sauce.
Remove the prawns from the marinade and pat dry. Fry them in olive oil (in batches so that they fry rather than steam) and cook until opaque. You'll find that this happens very quickly. Only takes a minute or so. Try not to over-cook them. Return the sauce to the pan and cook to taste- until the sauce thickens. Add the cooked prawns and toss through. Again, you just want to warm through the prawns, you don't want to over-cook them. That's it. Serve with rice.
Coca-Cola may seem like an odd ingredient, but apparently, since the 1940's, the Mexicans have been using it to replace
piloncillo - after all, it's really just a caramelised syrup when you think about it. Mexican ingredients are available online from the award winning:
http://www.mexgrocer.co.uk
Watercress Salad with Orange, Apple and Avocado
The original recipe used
Jicama,
rather than apple. Jicama is the Mexican Turnip, although, just to confuse you, it's not related to the turnip family. It looks a bit like a potato. It has a crunch. The chances of finding Jicama in Britain are remote. It just ain't going to happen- so I've substituted apple.
First, you make the vinaigrette. In a small bowl whisk together
lime juice,
a thinly sliced
green chili ,
sea-salt
and
white pepper . Pour in
1/2 cup of olive oil , whisking as you go.
Secondly, the salad. This is just slices of
orange ,
fresh watercress
and crisp, peeled
apple , cut into thin strips. Dress the salad with the vinaigrette, and carefully fold in sliced
hass avocados . Adjust the seasoning with
sea-salt , if you feel it needs it, and serve.

The Mexican Day of the Dead
I think I first became aware of the
Mexican Day of the Dead
after reading
Malcolm Lowry 's novel, " Under the Volcano ". There was also a film with Albert Finney and the She-Who-Can-Do-No-Wrong Jacqueline Bisset, in which Finney plays a drunken British diplomat.
Mexicans celebrate the Day of the Dead on November 2nd. It's an extraordinary festival: families pray for the souls of the departed, and death is celebrated with dancing, sugar skulls, flowers, colourful altars and carnival.
I love authentic Mexican food, and it's only recently that the proper thing has begun to arrive in London. Up until now, we've had to put up with Tex-Mex restaurants (as beloved by students and the disenfranchised); the sort of places where they make you wear silly hats and pour Margaritas down your throat; not the same deal at all. Incidentally, I once had a fantastic
chivichangas
(fried burritos) at a drive-in gas station in San Diego, a few miles from the Mexican border. You paid a dollar or so through a grill, and then a few minutes later a tanned hairy hand appeared through a hole in a wall with your hot food. Fast Food in the best sense.
We're going to cook something Mexican tonight. I like Elizabeth Lambert Ortiz's book "The New Complete Book of Mexican Cooking". "Fish in Almond and Coriander Sauce" ( Pescado en Salsa de Almendra Verde ) is on the menu.
First, you simmer some
non-oily white fish ( cod?) in stock. Normally, I would place the fish in the
cold water
or
fish stock , and then bring to the boil. Once it's simmering, I immediately turn off the heat and put on the lid, and then leave the fish to "cook" in the hot water for about five to ten minutes. You'll find this is an excellent way to cook fish, and will give you perfect results every time.
Remove the fish, and set aside. Pour the hot fish stock into a jug. In a small frying pan, heat up a few tablespoons of
olive oil , and fry a clove of
garlic
with a slice of
white bread,
until the bread is golden on both sides. Remove the garlic and chop up the fried bread, coarsely. In your food processor, whizz up the chopped fried bread, 50g (2oz)
finely ground almonds , two
jalapeno chillies
(de-seeded and chopped) and half a cup of fresh chopped
coriander leaves ; and then thin it out with the reserved stock. Heat, check the seasoning and pour over the fish. Serve with rice.
I've got no idea what this is going to be like, but it sounds interesting, and the cooking techniques are relatively simple.

New Year's Day Chili
I think there's nothing better than tucking into a satisfying and hearty bowl of cowboy chili on a raw New Year's Day. It just seems so right. After all that Christmas over-indulgence, you want something simple, yet, if you're greedy like me, a limp bit of lettuce ain't going to pass muster. You're also probably feeling a trifle frazzled after the New Year's Eve revels.
Regrettably,
Chili con carne
is often nothing more than stewed mince, kidney beans and a bit of chili powder. Here's my idea for a
more sophisticated version:
Sauté some
chopped onions ,
garlic
and chopped
red chilis
in oil and butter.  Stir in some good
chili powder, oregano ,
cumin,
and paprika. Now add the
beef
(or
pork ); or a combination of the two. You can either chop the meat into chunks, or put it through a mincer (if you've got one). Cook for a bit until the meat is sealed and coloured.
Next, add some
stock ,
beer
(the Mexican beer, Corona, is excellent), and a splash of
Tabasco . Let the chili simmer slowly at a low heat, until the meat is cooked. You want the sauce to be reasonably thick. When the meat is nearly done, add some
tomato purée,
or even better,
sun-dried tomato paste,
and grate in some
bitter chocolate - the sort of quality chocolate (high in cocoa solids) you can buy in delis and specialist shops. Season with
salt
and
pepper
to taste.
Finally, stir in some cooked beans (Kidney, Haricot, or Black Beans are fine, I'm not really that fussed). Serve with some
grated cheese
on top,
sour cream , and
saltine crackers .
To all the readers of The Greasy Spoon: A Very Happy New Year!

Caesar Salad
Caesar Salad
is one of those classic dishes that has been over-tweaked, bastardised, and generally ruined by self-indulgent chefs over the years. The best Caesar Salad is the original Caesar Salad.
It was invented by Caesar Cardini in 1924. Cardini was a chef working at the Hotel Comerical in Tijuana- the Mexican town a few miles from the Californian border. During Prohibition, large parties of Americans used to cross the border in search of booze. The story goes that Cardini created the salad when a large party of hungry Americans turned up for the Fourth of July celebrations. He had run out of food, so made do with what he had left over.
Julia Child, the great food writer, apparently telephoned Cardini's daughter to get the authentic recipe- and came up with this. And who are we to argue with either of them?
First, you need two small heads of
Romaine lettuce,
preferably organic. Tear the lettuce into large shreds. Add
two coddled eggs.
Coddling is a technique where you only boil the eggs in their shell for one minute, so that you end up with a runny yolk. Add half a teaspoon of
sea salt,
and freshly ground
black pepper ; the juice of
two lemons,
ten drops of Lea & Perrins'
Worcestershire Sauce,
half a cup of
fresh grated
Parmesan
cheese ,
and half a cup of
garlic oil.
Garlic oil is just a good quality Virgin or Extra Virgin olive oil, infused by some garlic cloves for a day or so.
Toss the salad, so that the ingredients combine with the runny egg yolk, and lettuce leaves are well coated. Finish off the dish with some freshly prepared
croutons.
This is just deep-fried bread- cut into cubes. For some reason, slightly stale bread makes better croutons. You've probably noticed that I haven't added anchovies to my Caesar Salad. I have a strong hunch that the original recipe didn't include them, and I've tried to keep it authentic.

Eggnog
Oh crikey, I'm not even sure if I like
eggnog .  You see, in England, we hardly ever have it. To be entirely honest with you, until I started writing this post, I didn't really know what it was. Okay, I knew it had egg in it, perhaps a splash of cognac too, but that was about it. Even thought it might have had something to do with
Advocaat , which in a sense, it has, as they're made from similar ingredients. There's an interesting article on
the history of eggnog
on the net. It originated in England, apparently, and then became popular in the United States, especially at
Christmas . I found a recipe for a Mexican version of eggnog in Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz's excellent little book,
The Festive Food of Mexico :
Ponche de Leche y Emas y
Cognac .   Her recipe will make 4.5 litres of the stuff. Beat 15
egg yolks
with 450g
caster sugar
in a large bowl until light and lemon coloured. Whisk in 2 litres of
milk .  Pour the mixture into the top of a double boiler set over hot water and cook.  Stir at a very low heat until the mixture is thick enough to coat a spoon.  Remove from the heat and stir in a tablespoon of
grated orange peel . Whisk in a bottle of
cognac
(or other brandy). Serve in tots or small punch cups topped with a little grated
cinammon , and one or two   wafer thin strips of
orange peel
for decoration .  If you're in the mood, you can also put a cinnamon stick into each cup. Convinced by all this? I'm not entirely sure...

Avocado
I don't think I've yet written about the ubiquitous
avocado .
It's hard to remember, but not that long ago, avocados were seen as exotic and sophisticated and usually known as
avocado pears .
Nowadays, of course, they're all over the shop, and probably seen as a little bit passe; the staple fodder of dubious bistros and pretentious, second-rate restaurants.
So, I've decided to have a closer look and see if there's more to them than initially meets the eye.
The avocado (Persea americana) (from Nahuatl Aguacatl: agua-kah-tl), is native to Mexico, Central and northern South America, and classified in the flowering plant family Lauraceae.
Avocado trees were cultivated in pre-Incan settlements with archeological evidence dating to 750 B.C.
The avocado of choice is the
Hass
variety, which grows in California.
That's the one with the dark green knobbly skin (pictured above).
It has a lovely, creamy, nutty taste and is, in my opinion, superior to the smooth skinned varieties.
Avocados are full of fat, but the good news is that this fat is a
monounsaturated
fat, which is supposed to be good for you.
One of the best things you can do with avocados is to make
guacamole .
Originally an Aztec dish, it's easy to make, and goes brilliantly with things Mexican.
Here's my own recipe for it.
I prefer the texture to be a bit chunky, rather than completely smooth.
In a bowl, half-mash up some
hass avocados
and then gently fold in
red tomatoes
(chopped into small pieces), a minced
red onion ,
lime juice , finely chopped
red chili ,
sea salt , a dash of
Tabasco
sauce,
paprika ,
black pepper
and some chopped
fresh coriander .
And finally, a useful tip: when preparing avocados, immediately sprinkle the exposed flesh with lemon juice.
This will stop the avocado turning brown.

Margarita
I picked up a taste for the
Margarita Cocktail
when I was in California.
I would argue that it is one of the three greatest cocktails of all time alongside the Dry Martini, and the Bloody Mary.
There are various theories as to when and how the
Margarita
was first born. Carlos "Danny" Herrera is said to have first mixed a concoction of white tequila, lemon juice, and
Triple Sec
in 1938.
He was the barman at the Rancho La Gloria in Tijuana, the Mexican border town where the Caesar Salad had been invented by Caesar Cardini.
Essentially, the Margarita is a mix of
Tequila
(Silver or
Blanco
tequilas are preferable to the gold),
Triple Sec
(ie Cointreau), and
Lime Juice
(or possibly Lemon Juice).
The rim of the glass is moistened with lime juice, and then dipped into
salt .
Some Margarita afficinados claim that salt was only used to hide the taste of a low-budget tequila, but I have to put up my hand and say that I like the contrast between the salt and the sweetness of the tequila and the Triple Sec.
I trawled the net for authentic Margarita recipes and found this one from "Drink of the Month" in the December 1953 issue of Esquire Magazine:
1 ounce tequila Dash of Triple Sec Juice of 1/2 lime or lemon Pour over crushed ice, stir. Rub the rim of a stem glass with rind of lemon or lime, spin in salt—pour, and sip.
Again, simplicity rules ok?
Nothing frozen.
No cocktail umbrellas.
No extra ingredients.
A Margarita is a Margarita.
Got it?

Mexican Prawn Ceviche
The 1st and 2nd of November are celebrated in Mexico as the Festival of the
Day of the Dead . It does, of course, co-incide with our
Hallowe'en , but the emphasis is on joy and celebration, rather than the macabre. The Mexicans believe that death is not the end, but instead the beginning of a new stage of life, and celebrate the lives of former loved ones with colourful parades, papier-mache skeletons, bright pink sugar skulls and anarchic carnival. I haven't been yet, but one day I would love to fly over there and join in the fun.
Well, it had to be a Mexican recipe today, didn't it? As it's The Greasy Spoon, I've adapted a Mexican version of Prawn Cocktail, although I think it originally came from Peru. It's called Ceviche. The raw prawns are "cooked" in lime juice. It's delicious. For my American readers, we say "prawn", you say "shrimp". So let's call the whole thing off.
In a mixing bowl combine
fresh prawns,
lime juice ,
salt
and
pepper . Your prawns will need to be extremely fresh.  Mix it all together. Cover and stick in the 'fridge for twelve hours. The acid in the lime juice will "cook" the protein in the fish. You will know when the mixture is ready, when the prawns have turned pink. In case you were wondering, they start off a grey colour in their natural state. Now it's time to add the other ingredients.
In the meantime, you've cut up
red peppers, red onions, plum tomatoes , and
yellow peppers
into
julienne
(which is a cheffy term for thin strips). Add these to the bowl. Next add a finely chopped
jalapeno chili,
a teaspoon of
sugar , and a dash of
wine vinegar .
Finish the whole thing off, by garnishing with a thinly sliced or diced
avocado,
and roughly chopped
coriander.
You could get away with serving this as a first course in a wine glass, though in the photograph above, it's presented on a serving plate. Very retro, and slightly different. I like it.

Venison Chili
When I'm in Manhatten, there's nothing better I like to doing then hailing a cab and heading straight for P. J. Clarke's at 55th and 3rd, where you can order a bowl of chili with
saltine crackers . I've been hesitant to write about chili, because I know how seriously Americans take it, and that battle reigns between the Texas Red version (meat-rich and without beans), and other recipes from other States. Some have tomatoes, others don't. Some have black beans, some kidney beans, and the Texan cowboy version quite definitely doesn't.
In Britain,
chili con carne
is often nothing more than stewed mince with kidney beans and a bit of chili powder. Here's my idea for a richer more authentic venison chili.
Saute some
chopped onions ,
garlic
and chopped
red chilis
in some
oil
and
butter . Stir in some good
chili powder ,
oregano ,
cumin , and
paprika . Now add the
venison . You can either chop the meat into chunks, or put it through a mincer (if you've got one). Cook for a bit until the meat is sealed and coloured. Now add some
stock ,
beer
(the Mexican beer, Corona, is excellent), and a splash of
Tabasco . Let the chili simmer slowly at a low heat, until the meat is cooked. You want the sauce to be reasonably thick. When the meat is nearly done, add some
tomato puree , or even better,
sun-dried tomato paste , and grate in some
bitter dark chocolate - the sort of quality chocolate (high in cocoa solids) you can buy in delis and specialist shops. Season with
salt  and
black pepper
to taste.
Finally, stir in some
cooked beans
(Kidney, Haricot, or Black Beans are fine, it doesn't really matter). Serve with
grated cheese
on top,
sour cream , and
saltine crackers .
