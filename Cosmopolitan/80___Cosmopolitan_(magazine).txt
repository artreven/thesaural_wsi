Whitney Elizabeth Houston  (August 9, 1963 – February 11, 2012) was an American recording artist, actress, producer, and model. In 2009, the Guinness World Records  cited her as the most-awarded female act of all-time. Houston was also one of the world’s  best-selling music artists , having sold over 170 million albums, singles and videos worldwide. She released seven studio albums and three movie soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, multi-platinum, platinum or gold certification. Houston’s crossover appeal on the popular music charts, as well as her prominence on  MTV , starting with her video for “ How Will I Know “, influenced several African-American female artists to follow in her footsteps.
Houston is the only artist to chart seven consecutive No. 1  Billboard  Hot 100  hits. She is the second artist behind  Elton John  and the only female artist to have two number-one  Billboard  200  Album awards (formerly “Top Pop Album”) on the  Billboard  magazine year-end  charts. Houston’s 1985 debut album  Whitney Houston  became the best-selling debut album by a female act at the time of its release. The album was named  Rolling Stone ‘s best album of 1986, and was ranked at number 254 on  Rolling Stone ‘s list of the  500 Greatest Albums of All Time . Her second studio album  Whitney  (1987) became the first album by a female artist to debut at number one on the  Billboard  200 albums chart.
Houston’s first acting role was as the star of the feature film  The Bodyguard  (1992). The film’s original soundtrack won the 1994  Grammy Award for Album of the Year . Its lead single “ I Will Always Love You “, became the  best-selling single  by a female artist in music history. With the album, Houston became the first act (solo or group, male or female) to sell more than a million copies of an album within a single week period under  Nielsen SoundScan  system. The album makes her the top female act in the top 10  list of the best-selling albums of all time , at number four. Houston continued to star in movies and contribute to their soundtracks, including the films  Waiting to Exhale  (1995) and  The Preacher’s Wife  (1996).  The Preacher’s Wife  soundtrack  became the best-selling gospel album in history.
On February 11, 2012, Houston was found dead in her guest room at the  Beverly Hilton Hotel , in  Beverly Hills, California , of causes not immediately known. News of her death coincided with the  2012 Grammy Awards  and featured prominently in American and international media.
Life and career
1963–1976: Early life
Whitney Houston was born in what was then a middle-income neighborhood in  Newark, New Jersey , the second child of Army serviceman and entertainment executive John Russell Houston, Jr. (September 13, 1920 – February 2, 2003), and gospel singer  Cissy Houston  (née Emily Drinkard). [13]  She was of African American, Native American and Dutch descent. Her mother, along with cousins  Dionne Warwick  and  Dee Dee Warwick , godmother  Darlene Love [15]  and honorary aunt Aretha Franklin were all notable figures in the gospel, rhythm and blues, pop, and  soul  genres. [17] She met her honorary aunt at age 8, or 9, when her mother took her to a recording studio. [18]  Houston was raised a  Baptist , but was also exposed to the  Pentecostal  church. After the  1967 Newark riots , the family moved to a middle-class area in  East Orange , New Jersey, when she was four. [19]
At the age of 11, Houston began to follow in her mother’s footsteps and started performing as a soloist in the junior gospel choir at the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, where she also learned to play the piano. [20]  Her first solo performance in the church was “ Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah “. [21]  When Houston was a teenager, she attended  Mount Saint Dominic Academy , a Catholic girls’ high school in  Caldwell , New Jersey, where she met her best friend Robyn Crawford, whom she described as the “sister she never had”. [22]  While Houston was still in school, her mother continued to teach her how to sing. [5]  In addition to her mother, Franklin, and Warwick, Houston was also exposed to the music of  Chaka Khan ,  Gladys Knight , and  Roberta Flack , most of whom would have an impact on her as a singer and performer. [23]
1977–1984: Early career
Houston spent some of her teenage years touring nightclubs where her mother Cissy was performing, and she would occasionally get on stage and perform with her. In 1977, at age 14, she became a backup singer on the  Michael Zager Band ‘s single “Life’s a Party”. [24]  In 1978, at age 15, Houston sang background vocals on  Chaka Khan ‘s hit single “ I’m Every Woman “, a song she would later turn into a larger hit for herself on her monster-selling  The Bodyguard  soundtrack album. [25] [26]  She also sang back-up on albums by  Lou Rawls  and  Jermaine Jackson . [25]
In the early 1980s, Houston started working as a fashion model after a photographer saw her at  Carnegie Hall  singing with her mother. She appeared in  Seventeen [27]  and became one of the first women of color to grace the cover of the magazine. [28]  She was also featured in layouts in the pages of  Glamour ,  Cosmopolitan ,  Young Miss , and appeared in a  Canada Dry  soft drink TV commercial. [29]  Her striking looks and girl-next-door charm made her one of the most sought after teen models of that time. [29]  While modeling, she continued her burgeoning recording career by working with producers Michael Beinhorn,  Bill Laswell  and  Martin Bisi  on an album they were spearheading called  One Down , which was credited to the group  Material . For that project, Houston contributed the ballad “ Memories “, a cover of a song by  Hugh Hopper  of  Soft Machine . Robert Christgau of  The Village Voice  called her contribution “one of the most gorgeous ballads you’ve ever heard”. [30]  She also appeared as a lead vocalist on one track on a  Paul Jabara  album, entitled  Paul Jabara and Friends , released by  Columbia Records  in 1983. [31]
Houston had previously been offered several recording agencies (Michael Zager in 1980, and  Elektra Records  in 1981), however her mother declined the offers stating her daughter must first complete high school. [24] [32]  In 1983, Gerry Griffith, an A&R representative from  Arista Records , saw her performing with her mother in a New York City nightclub and was impressed. He convinced Arista’s head Clive Davis  to make time to see Houston perform. Davis too was impressed and offered a worldwide recording contract which Houston signed. Later that year, she made her national televised debut alongside Davis on  The Merv Griffin Show . [33]
Houston signed with Arista in 1983, but did not begin work on her album immediately. [1]  The label wanted to make sure no other label signed the singer away. Davis wanted to ensure he had the right material and producers for Houston’s debut album. Some producers had to pass on the project due to prior commitments. [34]  Houston first recorded a duet with  Teddy Pendergrass  entitled “ Hold Me ” which appeared on his album,  Love Language . [35]  The single was released in 1984 and gave Houston her first taste of success, becoming a Top 5 R&B hit. [36]  It would also appear on her debut album in 1985.
1985–1986: Rise to international prominence
With production from  Michael Masser ,  Kashif ,  Jermaine Jackson , and  Narada Michael Walden , Houston’s debut album  Whitney Houston  was released in February 1985.  Rolling Stone  magazine praised Houston, calling her “one of the most exciting new voices in years” while  The New York Times  called the album “an impressive, musically conservative showcase for an exceptional vocal talent”. [37] [38]  Arista Records promoted Houston’s album with three different singles from the album in the US, UK and other European countries. In the UK, the dance-funk “Someone for Me”, which failed to chart in the country, was the first single while “ All at Once ” was in such European countries as the  Netherlands  and  Belgium , where the song reached the top 5 on the singles charts, respectively. [39]
In the US, the soulful ballad “ You Give Good Love ” was chosen as the  lead single  from Houston’s debut to establish her in the black marketplace first. [40]  Outside the US, the song failed to get enough attention to become a hit, but in the US, it gave the album its first major hit as it peaked at No. 3 on the US  Billboard  Hot 100  chart, and No. 1 on the  Hot R&B  chart. [34]  As a result, the album began to sell strongly, and Houston continued promotion by touring nightclubs in the US. She also began performing on late-night television talk shows, which were not usually accessible to unestablished black acts. The jazzy ballad “ Saving All My Love for You ” was released next and it would become Houston’s first No. 1 single in both the US and the UK. She was then an opening act for singer  Jeffrey Osborne  on his nationwide tour. “Thinking About You” was released as the promo single only to R&B-oriented radio stations, which peaked at number ten on the US R&B Chart. At the time, MTV had received harsh criticism for not playing enough videos by black, Latino, and other racial minorities while favoring white acts. [41]  The third US single, “ How Will I Know “, peaked at No. 1 and introduced Houston to the MTV audience thanks to its video. Houston’s subsequent singles from this, and future albums, would make her the first African-American female artist to receive consistent heavy rotation on MTV. [28]
By 1986, a year after its initial release,  Whitney Houston  topped the  Billboard  200  albums chart and stayed there for 14 non-consecutive weeks. [42]  The final single, “ Greatest Love of All “, became Houston’s biggest hit at the time after peaking No. 1 and remaining there for three weeks on the Hot 100 chart, which made her debut the first album by a female artist to yield three No. 1 hits. Houston was No. 1 artist of the year and  Whitney Houston  was the No. 1 album of the year on the 1986  Billboard  year-end charts, making her the first female artist to earn that distinction. [42]  At the time, Houston released the best-selling debut album by a solo artist. [43]  Houston then embarked on her world tour,  Greatest Love Tour . The album had become an international success, and was certified 13× platinum (diamond) in the United States alone, and has sold a total of 25 million copies worldwide. [44]
At the  1986 Grammy Awards , Houston was nominated for three awards including  Album of the Year . [45]  She was not eligible for the  Best New Artist  category due to her previous hit R&B duet recording with  Teddy Pendergrass  in 1984. [46]  She won her first  Grammy  award for  Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female  for “Saving All My Love for You”. [47]  Houston’s performance of the song during the Grammy telecast later earned her an  Emmy Award  for  Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program . [48]
Houston won seven  American Music Awards  in total in 1986 and 1987, and an  MTV Video Music Award . [49] [50]  The album’s popularity would also carry over to the  1987 Grammy Awards  when “Greatest Love of All” would receive a  Record of the Year  nomination. Houston’s debut album is listed as one of  Rolling Stone ‘s  500 Greatest Albums of All Time  and on  The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ‘s Definitive 200 list. [51] [52]  Houston’s grand entrance into the music industry is considered one of the 25 musical milestones of the last 25 years, according to  USA Today . [53]  Following Houston’s breakthrough, doors were opened for other African-American female artists such as  Janet Jackson  and  Anita Baker  to find notable success in popular music and on MTV. [54] [55]
1987–1991:  Whitney ,  I’m Your Baby Tonight  and “The Star Spangled Banner”
With many expectations, Houston’s second album,  Whitney , was released in June 1987. The album again featured production from Masser, Kashif and Walden as well as  Jellybean Benitez . Many critics complained that the material was too similar to her previous album.  Rolling Stone  said, “the narrow channel through which this talent has been directed is frustrating”. [56]  Still, the album enjoyed commercial success. Houston became the first female artist in music history to debut at number one on the  Billboard  200 albums chart, and the first artist to enter the albums chart at number one in both the US and UK, while also hitting number one or top ten in dozens of other countries around the world. The album’s first single, “ I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me) “, was also a massive hit worldwide, peaking at No. 1 on the  Billboard  Hot 100 chart and topping the singles chart in many countries such as Australia, Germany and the UK. The next three singles, “ Didn’t We Almost Have It All “, “ So Emotional “, and “ Where Do Broken Hearts Go ” all peaked at number one on the US Hot 100 chart, which gave her a total of seven consecutive number one hits, breaking the record of six previously shared by  The Beatles  and  The Bee Gees . [57] [58]  Houston became the first female artist to generate four number-one singles from one album.  Whitney  has been certified 9× Platinum in the US for shipments of over 9 million copies, and has sold a total of 20 million copies worldwide. [59]
At the  30th Grammy Awards  in 1988, Houston was nominated for three awards, including Album of the Year, winning her second Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for “I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)”. [60] [61]  Houston also won two American Music Awards in 1988 and 1989, respectively, and a  Soul Train Music Award . [62] [63] [64]  Following the release of the album, Houston embarked on the  Moment of Truth World Tour , which was one of the ten highest grossing concert tours of 1987. [65]  The success of the tours during 1986–87 and her two studio albums ranked Houston No. 8 for the highest earning entertainers list according to  Forbes  magazine. [66]  She was the highest earning African-American woman overall and the third highest entertainer after  Bill Cosby  and  Eddie Murphy . [66]
Houston was a supporter of  Nelson Mandela  and the anti-apartheid movement. During her modeling days, the singer refused to work with any agencies who did business with the then-apartheid South Africa. [67] [68]  On June 11, 1988, during the European leg of her tour, Houston joined other musicians to perform a set at  Wembley Stadium  in London to celebrate a then-imprisoned  Nelson Mandela’s 70th birthday . [67]  Over 72,000 people attended Wembley Stadium, and over a billion people tuned in worldwide as the rock concert raised over $1 million for charities while bringing awareness to apartheid . [69]  Houston then flew back to the US for a concert at  Madison Square Garden  in New York City in August. The show was a benefit concert that raised a quarter of a million dollars for the United Negro College Fund . [70]  In the same year, she recorded a song for  NBC ‘s coverage of the  1988 Summer Olympics , “ One Moment in Time “, which became a Top 5 hit in the US, while reaching number one in the UK and Germany. [71] [72] [73]  With her world tour continuing overseas, Houston was still one of the top 20 highest earning entertainers for 1987–88 according to  Forbes magazine. [74] [75]
Houston performing “ Saving All My Love for You ” on the Welcome Home Heroes  concert in 1991
In 1989, Houston formed The Whitney Houston Foundation For Children, a non-profit organization that has raised funds for the needs of children around the world. The organization cares for homelessness, children with cancer or AIDS, and other issues of self-empowerment. [76]  With the success of her first two albums, Houston was undoubtedly an international crossover superstar, the most prominent since  Michael Jackson , appealing to all demographics. However, some black critics believed she was “ selling out “. [6]  They felt her singing on record lacked the soul that was present during her live concerts. [27]
At the  1989 Soul Train Music Awards , when Houston’s name was called out for a nomination, a few in the audience jeered. [77] [78]  Houston defended herself against the criticism, stating, “If you’re gonna have a long career, there’s a certain way to do it, and I did it that way. I’m not ashamed of it”. [27]  Houston took a more urban direction with her third studio album,  I’m Your Baby Tonight , released in November 1990. She produced and chose producers for this album and as a result, it featured production and collaborations with  L.A. Reid  and  Babyface ,  Luther Vandross , and  Stevie Wonder . The album showed Houston’s versatility on a new batch of tough rhythmic grooves, soulful ballads and up-tempo dance tracks. Reviews were mixed.  Rolling Stone  felt it was her “best and most integrated album”. [79]  while Entertainment Weekly , at the time thought Houston’s shift towards an urban direction was “superficial”. [80]
The album contained several hits: the first two singles, “ I’m Your Baby Tonight ” and “ All the Man That I Need ” peaked at number one on the  Billboard  Hot 100 chart; “ Miracle ” peaked at number nine; “ My Name Is Not Susan ” peaked in the top twenty; “ I Belong to You ” reached the top ten of the US R&B chart and garnered Houston a Grammy nomination; and the sixth single, the Stevie Wonder duet “ We Didn’t Know “, reached the R&B top twenty. The album peaked at number three on the  Billboard  200 and went on to be certified 4× platinum in the US while selling twelve million total worldwide.
Houston met with President George H. W. Bush in the Oval Office in 1990, while in Washington, D.C., to participate in the Youth Leadership Forum
In 1990, Houston was the spokesperson for a youth leadership conference hosted in Washington, D.C. She had a private audience with President George H. W. Bush in the Oval Office to discuss the associated challenges.
With America entangled in the  Persian Gulf War , Houston performed “ The Star Spangled Banner ” at  Super Bowl XXV at  Tampa Stadium  on January 27, 1991. [81]  Due to overwhelming response to her rendition, it was released as a commercial single and video of her performance, and reached the Top 20 on the US Hot 100, making her the only act to turn the national anthem into a pop hit of that magnitude ( Jose Feliciano ‘s version reached No. 50 in November 1968). [82] [83]  Houston donated all her share of the proceeds to the  American Red Cross Gulf Crisis Fund . As a result, the singer was named to the Red Cross Board of Governors. [81] [84] [85]
Her rendition was considered the benchmark for singers and critically acclaimed. [86]   Rolling Stone  commented that “her singing stirs such strong patriotism. Unforgettable”, and the performance ranked No. 1 on the 25 most memorable music moments in NFL history list. VH1 listed the performance as one of the greatest moments that rocked TV. [87] [88]  Following the attacks on 9/11, it was released again by Arista Records, all profits going towards the firefighters and victims of the attacks. This time it peaked at No. 6 in the Hot 100 and was certified platinum by the  Recording Industry Association of America . [89]
Later in 1991, Houston put together her  Welcome Home Heroes  concert with  HBO  for the soldiers fighting in the Persian Gulf War and their families. The free concert took place at  Naval Station Norfolk  in  Norfolk , Virginia in front of 3,500 servicemen and women. HBO descrambled the concert so that it was free for everyone to watch. [90]  Houston’s concert gave HBO its highest ratings ever. [91]  She then embarked on the  I’m Your Baby Tonight World Tour .
1992–1994: Marriage to Bobby Brown and  The Bodyguard
Throughout the 1980s, Houston was romantically linked to  American football  star  Randall Cunningham  and actor  Eddie Murphy , whom she dated. [92]  She then met R&B singer  Bobby Brown  at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards. After a three-year courtship, the two were married on July 18, 1992. [93]  On March 4, 1993, Houston gave birth to their daughter Bobbi Kristina Houston Brown, her only child, and his fourth. Brown would go on to have several run-ins with the law, including some jail time. [93]
With the commercial success of her albums, movie offers poured in, including offers to work with  Robert De Niro ,  Quincy Jones , and  Spike Lee ; but Houston felt the time wasn’t right. [92]  Houston’s first film role was in  The Bodyguard , released in 1992 and co-starring  Kevin Costner . Houston played Rachel Marron, a star who is stalked by a crazed fan and hires a bodyguard to protect her.  USA Today listed it as one of the 25 most memorable movie moments of the last 25 years in 2007. [94]  Houston’s mainstream appeal allowed people to look at the movie color-blind. [95]
Still, controversy arose as some felt the film’s advertising intentionally hid Houston’s face to hide the film’s interracial relationship. In an interview with  Rolling Stone  in 1993, the singer commented that “people know who Whitney Houston is – I’m black. You can’t hide that fact.” [23]  Houston received a  Razzie Award  nomination for Worst Actress.  The Washington Post  said Houston is “doing nothing more than playing Houston, comes out largely unscathed if that is possible in so cockamamie an undertaking”, [96]  and  The New York Times  commented that she lacked passion with her co-star. [97] Despite the film’s mixed reviews, it was hugely successful at the box office, grossing more than $121 million in the U.S. and $410 million worldwide, making it one of the top 100 grossing films in film history at its time of release, though it is no longer in the top 100 due to rising ticket prices since the time the film was released. [98]
The film’s soundtrack also enjoyed big success. Houston executive produced and contributed six songs for the motion picture’s  adjoining soundtrack album .  Rolling Stone  said it is “nothing more than pleasant, tasteful and urbane”. [99]  The soundtrack’s lead single was “ I Will Always Love You “, written and originally recorded by  Dolly Parton  in 1974. Houston’s version of the song was acclaimed by many critics, regarding it as her “signature song” or “iconic performance”.  Rolling Stone  and  USA Today  called her rendition “the tour-de-force”. [100] [101]  The single peaked at number one on the Billboard  Hot 100 for a then-record-breaking 14 weeks, number one on the R&B chart for a then-record-breaking 11 weeks, and number one on the Adult Contemporary charts for five weeks, thus becoming the first single to top those three charts simultaneously for five weeks. [102]
The single was certified 4× platinum by the  RIAA , making Houston the first female artist with a single to reach that level in the RIAA history and becoming the best-selling single by a female artist in the US. [103] [104] [105]  The song also became a global success, hitting number-one in almost all countries, and one of  the best-selling singles of all time  with 12 million copies sold. [106]  The soundtrack topped the  Billboard  200 chart and remained there for 20 non-consecutive weeks, the longest tenure by any album on the chart in the Nielsen SoundScan era, and became one of the fastest selling albums ever. [107]  During Christmas week of 1992, the soundtrack sold over a million copies within a week, becoming the first album to achieve that feat under  Nielsen SoundScan  system. [108] [109] With the follow-up singles “ I’m Every Woman “, a  Chaka Khan  cover, and “ I Have Nothing ” both reaching the top five, Houston became the first female artist to ever have three singles in the Top 11 simultaneously. [110] [111] [112]  The album was certified 17× platinum in the US alone, [113]  with worldwide sales of 44 million, [114]  making  The Bodyguard  the biggest-selling album by a female act on the list of the world’s Top 10 best-selling albums , topping  Shania Twain ‘s 40 million sold for  Come On Over . [115]
Houston won three Grammys for the album in 1994, including two of the Academy’s highest honors,  Album of the Year  and  Record of the Year . In addition, she won a record 8 American Music Awards at that year’s ceremony including the Award of Merit, [116]  11  Billboard Music Awards , 3  Soul Train Music Awards  in 1993–94 including  Sammy Davis, Jr. Award as Entertainer of the Year , [117]  5 NAACP Image Awards  including  Entertainer of the Year , [118] [119] [120]  a record 5  World Music Awards , [121]  and a  BRIT award . [122]  Following the success of the project, Houston embarked on another expansive global tour,  The Bodyguard World Tour , in 1993–94. Her concerts, movie, and recording grosses made her the third highest earning female entertainer of 1993–94, just behind  Oprah Winfrey and  Barbra Streisand  according to  Forbes  magazine. [123]  Houston placed in the top five of  Entertainment Weekly ‘s annual “Entertainer of the Year” ranking [124]  and was labeled by  Premiere  magazine as one of the 100 most powerful people in Hollywood. [125]
In October 1994, Houston attended and performed at a state dinner in the  White House  honoring newly elected South African president Nelson Mandela. [126] [127]  At the end of her world tour, Houston performed three concerts in South Africa to honor President Mandela, playing to over 200,000 people. This would make the singer the first major musician to visit the newly unified and apartheid free nation following Mandela’s winning election. [128]  The concert was broadcast live on HBO with funds of the concerts being donated to various charities in South Africa. The event was considered the nation’s “biggest media event since the inauguration of Nelson Mandela”. [129]
1995–1997:  Waiting to Exhale ,  The Preacher’s Wife , and  Cinderella
In 1995, Houston starred alongside  Angela Bassett ,  Loretta Devine , and  Lela Rochon  in her second film  Waiting to Exhale , a motion picture about four African-American women struggling with relationships. Houston played the lead character Savannah Jackson, a TV producer in love with a married man. She chose the role because she saw the film as “a breakthrough for the image of black women because it presents them both as professionals and as caring mothers”. [130]  After opening at number one and grossing $67 million in the US at the box office and $81 million worldwide, [131]  it proved that a movie primarily targeting a black audience can cross over to success, while paving the way for other all-black movies such as  How Stella Got Her Groove Back  and the  Tyler Perry  movies that have become popular in the 2000s. [132] [133] [134]  The film is also notable for its portrayal of black women as strong middle class citizens as opposed to stereotypes. [135]  The reviews were mainly positive for the ensemble cast.  The New York Times  said “Ms. Houston has shed the defensive hauteur that made her portrayal of a pop star in ‘The Bodyguard’ seem so distant.” [136]  Houston was nominated for an  NAACP Image Award  for “Outstanding Actress In A Motion Picture”, but lost to her co-star Bassett.
The film’s accompanying soundtrack,  Waiting to Exhale: Original Soundtrack Album , was produced by Houston and Babyface. Though Babyface originally wanted Houston to record the entire album, she declined. Instead, she “wanted it to be an album of women with vocal distinction”, and thus gathered several African-American female artists for the soundtrack, to go along with the film’s strong women message. [130]  As a result, the album featured a range of contemporary R&B female recording artists along with Houston, such as  Mary J Blige ,  Aretha Franklin ,  Toni Braxton ,  Patti Labelle , and  Brandy . Houston’s “ Exhale (Shoop Shoop) ” peaked at No. 1, and then spent a record eleven weeks at the No. 2 spot and eight weeks on top of the R&B Charts. “Count On Me”, a duet with  CeCe Winans , hit the US Top 10; and Houston’s third contribution, “ Why Does It Hurt So Bad “, made the Top 30. The album debuted at No. 1, and was certified 7× Platinum in the United States, denoting shipments of seven million copies. [59]  The soundtrack received strong reviews as  Entertainment Weekly  said “the album goes down easy, just as you’d expect from a package framed by Whitney Houston tracks…. the soundtrack waits to exhale, hovering in sensuous suspense” [137]  and has since ranked it as one of the 100 Best Movie Soundtracks. [138]  Later that year, Houston’s children’s charity organization was awarded a VH1 Honor for all the charitable work. [139]
In 1996, Houston starred in the holiday comedy  The Preacher’s Wife , with  Denzel Washington . She plays a gospel-singing wife of a pastor ( Courtney B. Vance ). It was largely an updated remake of the 1948 film “ The Bishop’s Wife ” which starred Loretta Young, David Niven and Cary Grant. Houston earned $10 million for the role, making her one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood at the time and the highest earning African American actress in Hollywood. [140]  The movie, with its all African-American cast, was a moderate success, earning approximately $50 million at the U.S. box offices. [141]  The movie gave Houston her strongest reviews so far.  The San Francisco Chronicle  said Houston “is rather angelic herself, displaying a divine talent for being virtuous and flirtatious at the same time” and that she “exudes gentle yet spirited warmth, especially when praising the Lord in her gorgeous singing voice”. [142]  Houston was again nominated for an  NAACP Image Award  and won for Outstanding Actress In A Motion Picture.
Houston recorded and co-produced, with Mervyn Warren, the film’s accompanying gospel soundtrack.  The Preacher’s Wife: Original Soundtrack Album  included six gospel songs with  Georgia Mass Choir  that were recorded at the Great Star Rising Baptist Church in Atlanta. Houston also duetted with gospel legend  Shirley Caesar . The album sold six million copies worldwide and scored hit singles with “ I Believe in You and Me ” and “ Step by Step “, becoming the largest selling gospel album of all time. The album received mainly positive reviews. Some critics, such as that of  USA Today , noted the presence of her emotional depth, [143]  while  The Times  said “To hear Houston going at full throttle with the 35 piece Georgia Mass Choir struggling to keep up is to realise what her phenomenal voice was made for”. [144]
In 1997, Houston’s production company changed its name to BrownHouse Productions and was joined by  Debra Martin Chase . Their goal was “to show aspects of the lives of African-Americans that have not been brought to the screen before” while improving how African-Americans are portrayed in film and television. [145]  Their first project was a made-for-television remake of  Rodgers & Hammerstein ‘s  Cinderella . In addition to co-producing, Houston starred in the movie as the Fairy Godmother along with  Brandy ,  Jason Alexander ,  Whoopi Goldberg , and  Bernadette Peters . Houston was initially offered the role of Cinderella in 1993, but other projects intervened. [146]  The film is notable for its multi-racial cast and nonstereotypical message. [147]  An estimated 60 million viewers tuned into the special giving ABC its highest TV ratings in 16 years. [148]  The movie received seven  Emmy  nominations including Outstanding Variety, Musical or Comedy, while winning Outstanding Art Direction in a Variety, Musical or Comedy Special. [149]
Houston and Chase then obtained the rights to the story of  Dorothy Dandridge . Houston was to play Dandridge, who was the first African American actress to be nominated for an Oscar. She wanted the story told with dignity and honor. [145]  However,  Halle Berry  also had rights to the project and she got her version going first. [150]  Later that year, Houston paid tribute to her idols such as  Aretha Franklin ,  Diana Ross , and Dionne Warwick by performing their hits during the three-night HBO Concert  Classic Whitney , live from Washington, D.C. The special raised over $300,000 for the Children’s Defense Fund. [151]  Houston received  The Quincy Jones Award  for outstanding career achievements in the field of entertainment at the  12th Soul Train Music Awards . [152] [153]
1998–2000:  My Love Is Your Love  and  Whitney: The Greatest Hits
After spending much of the early and mid 1990s working on motion pictures and their soundtrack albums, Houston’s first studio album in eight years, the critically acclaimed  My Love Is Your Love , was released in November 1998. Though originally slated to be a greatest hits album with a handful of new songs, recording sessions were so fruitful that a new full-length studio album was released. Recorded and mixed in only six weeks, it featured production from  Rodney Jerkins ,  Wyclef Jean  and  Missy Elliott . The album debuted at number thirteen, its peak position, on the  Billboard  200 chart. [154]  It had a funkier and edgier sound than past releases and saw Houston handling urban dance,  hip hop , mid-tempo  R&B ,  reggae ,  torch songs , and ballads all with great dexterity. [155]
From late 1998 to early 2000, the album spawned several hit singles: “ When You Believe ” (US No. 15, UK No. 4), a duet with Mariah Carey for 1998’s  The Prince of Egypt   soundtrack , which also became an international hit as it peaked in the Top 10 in several countries and won an  Academy Award for Best Original Song ; [156]  “ Heartbreak Hotel ” (US No. 2, UK No. 25) featured  Faith Evans  and Kelly Price , received a  1999 MTV VMA  nomination for  Best R&B Video , [157]  and number one on the US R&B chart for seven weeks; “ It’s Not Right But It’s Okay ” (US No. 4, UK No. 3) won Houston her sixth  Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance ; [158]  “ My Love Is Your Love ” (US No. 4, UK No. 2) with 3 million copies sold worldwide; [159]  and “ I Learned from the Best ” (US No. 27, UK No. 19). [160] [161]  These singles became international hits as well, and all the singles, except “When You Believe”, became number one hits on the  Billboard  Hot Dance/Club Play  chart. The album sold four million copies in America, making it certified 4× platinum, and a total of eleven million copies worldwide. [44]
The album gave Houston some of her strongest reviews ever.  Rolling Stone  said Houston was singing “with a bite in her voice” [162]  and  The Village Voice  called it “Whitney’s sharpest and most satisfying so far”. [163]  In 1999, Houston participated in  VH-1’s Divas Live ’99 , alongside  Brandy ,  Mary J. Blige ,  Tina Turner , and  Cher . The same year, Houston hit the road with her 70 date  My Love Is Your Love World Tour . The European leg of the tour was Europe’s highest grossing arena tour of the year. [164]  In November 1999, Houston was named Top-selling R&B Female Artist of the Century with certified US sales of 51 million copies at the time and  The Bodyguard Soundtrack  was named the Top-selling Soundtrack Album of the Century by the  Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). [165]  She also won The Artist of the Decade, Female award for extraordinary artistic contributions during the 1990s at the  14th Soul Train Music Awards , and an  MTV Europe Music Award  for Best R&B . [166] [167] [168] [169] [170]
In May 2000,  Whitney: The Greatest Hits  was released worldwide. The double disc set peaked at number five in the United States, reaching number one in the United Kingdom. [161] [171]  In addition, the album reached the Top 10 in many other countries. [172]  While ballad songs were left unchanged, the album features  house / club  remixes of many of Houston’s up-tempo hits. Included on the album were four new songs: “ Could I Have This Kiss Forever ” (a duet with  Enrique Iglesias ), “ Same Script, Different Cast ” (a duet with  Deborah Cox ), “ If I Told You That ” (a duet with  George Michael ), and “ Fine “, and three hits that had never appeared on a Houston album: “One Moment in Time”, “The Star Spangled Banner”, and “If You Say My Eyes Are Beautiful”, a duet with Jermaine Jackson from his 1986  Precious Moments  album. [173]  Along with the album, an accompanying VHS and DVD was released featuring the music videos to Houston’s greatest hits, as well as several hard-to-find live performances including her 1983 debut on  The Merv Griffin Show , and interviews. [174]  The greatest hits album was certified 3× platinum in the US, with worldwide sales of 10 million. [175] [176]
2000–2005:  Just Whitney , and personal struggles
Though Houston was seen as a “good girl” with a perfect image in the 1980s and early 1990s, by the late 1990s, her behavior changed. She was often hours late for interviews, photo shoots and rehearsals, and canceling concerts and talk-show appearances. [177] [178]  With the missed performances and weight loss, rumors about Houston using drugs with her husband circulated. On January 11, 2000, airport security guards discovered marijuana in both Houston’s and husband Bobby Brown’s luggage at a Hawaii airport, but the two boarded the plane and departed before authorities could arrive. Charges were later dropped against them, [179]  but rumors of drug usage between the couple would continue to surface. Two months later, Clive Davis was inducted into the  Rock & Roll Hall of Fame . Houston had been scheduled to perform at the event, but failed to show up. [180]
Shortly thereafter, Houston was scheduled to perform at the Academy Awards but was fired from the event by musical director and long time friend  Burt Bacharach . Her publicist cited throat problems as the reason for the cancellation. In his book  The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards , author Steve Pond revealed that “Houston’s voice was shaky, she seemed distracted and jittery, and her attitude was casual, almost defiant”, and that while Houston was to sing “ Over the Rainbow “, she would start singing a different song. [181]  Houston later admitted to having been fired. [182]  Later that year, Houston’s long-time executive assistant and friend, Robyn Crawford, resigned from Houston’s management company. [180]
In August 2001, Houston signed the biggest record deal in music history with Arista/ BMG . She renewed her contract for $100 million to deliver six new albums, on which she would also earn royalties. [183] [184] [185]  She later made an appearance on  Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special . Her extremely thin frame further spurred rumors of drug use. Houston’s publicist said, “Whitney has been under stress due to family matters, and when she is under stress she doesn’t eat.” [186]  The singer was scheduled for a second performance the following night but canceled. [187]  Within weeks, Houston’s rendition of “The Star Spangled Banner” would be re-released after the  September 11 attacks , with the  proceeds donated  to the  New York Firefighters 9/11 Disaster Relief Fund  and the  New York Fraternal Order of Police . [188]  The song peaked at No. 6 this time on the US Hot 100, topping its previous position. [160]
In 2002, Houston became involved in a legal dispute with John Houston Enterprise. Although the company was started by her father to manage her career, it was actually run by company president Kevin Skinner. Skinner filed a  breach-of-contract   lawsuit  and sued for $100 million (but lost), stating that Houston owed the company previously unpaid compensation for helping to negotiate her $100 million contract with Arista Records and for sorting out legal matters. [189]  Houston stated that her 81-year-old father had nothing to do with the lawsuit. Although Skinner tried to claim otherwise, John Houston never appeared in court. [190]  Houston’s father later died in February 2003. [191]  The lawsuit was dismissed on April 5, 2004, and Skinner was awarded nothing. [192]
Also in 2002, Houston did an interview with  Diane Sawyer  to promote her then-upcoming album. The interview was the highest-rated television interview in history. [ citation needed ]  During the prime-time special, Houston spoke on topics including rumored drug use and marriage. She was asked about the ongoing drug rumors and replied, “First of all, let’s get one thing straight.  Crack  is cheap. I make too much money to ever smoke crack. Let’s get that straight. Okay? We don’t do crack. We don’t do that. Crack is wack.” [182]  The line was from Keith Haring’s mural which was painted in 1986 on the handball court at 128th Street and 2nd Avenue. [193]  Houston did, however, admit to using other substances at times, including cocaine. [182]
In December 2002, Houston released her fifth studio album,  Just Whitney… . The album included productions from then-husband Bobby Brown, as well as Missy Elliott and Babyface, and marked the first time that Houston did not produce with  Clive Davis  as Davis had been released by top management at BMG. Upon its release,  Just Whitney…  received mixed reviews. [194]  The album debuted at number 9 on the  Billboard  200  chart and it had the highest first week sales of any album Houston had ever released. [195]  The four singles released from the album, didn’t fare well on the  Billboard  Hot 100, but became  Hot Dance Club Play  hits.  Just Whitney…  was certified  platinum  in the United States, and sold approximately three million worldwide. [196]
On a June 2003 trip to  Israel , Houston said of her visit, “I’ve never felt like this in any other country. I feel at home, I feel wonderful.” [197]
In late 2003, Houston released her first Christmas album  One Wish: The Holiday Album , with a collection of traditional holiday songs. Houston produced the album with  Mervyn Warren  and Gordon Chambers. A single titled “ One Wish (for Christmas) ” reached the Top 20 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and the album was certified gold in the US. Having always been a touring artist, Houston spent most of 2004 touring and performing in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and  Russia . In September 2004, she gave a surprise performance at the  World Music Awards  in a tribute to long time friend  Clive Davis . After the show, Davis and Houston announced plans to go into studio to work on her new album. [198]
In early 2004, husband Bobby Brown starred in his own reality TV program,  Being Bobby Brown  (on the  Bravo network ), which provided a view into the domestic goings-on in the Brown household. Though it was Brown’s vehicle, Houston was a prominent figure throughout the show, receiving as much screen time as Brown. The series aired in 2005 and featured Houston in, what some would say, not her most flattering moments. The  Hollywood Reporter  said it was “undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television.” [199]  Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot and continued Houston’s successful forays into film and television. [200]  The show was not renewed for a second season after Houston stated that she would no longer appear in it, and Brown and Bravo could not come to an agreement for another season. [201]
2006–2012: Return to music,  I Look to You , tour and film comeback
After years of controversy and turmoil, Houston separated from Bobby Brown in September 2006, filing for divorce the following month. [202]  On February 1, 2007, Houston asked the court to fast track their divorce. [203]  The divorce was finalized on April 24, 2007, with Houston granted custody of the couple’s daughter. [204]  On May 4, Houston sold the  suburban Atlanta  home featured in  Being Bobby Brown  for $1.19 million. [205]  A few days later, Brown sued Houston in  Orange County , California court in an attempt to change the terms of their custody agreement. Brown also sought child and spousal support from Houston. In the lawsuit, Brown claimed that financial and emotional problems prevented him from properly responding to Houston’s divorce petition. [206]  Brown lost at his court hearing as the judge dismissed his appeal to overrule the custody terms, leaving Houston with full custody and Brown with no spousal support. [207]  In March 2007, Clive Davis of Arista Records announced that Houston would begin recording a new album. [208]  In October 2007, Arista released another compilation  The Ultimate Collection  outside the United States. [209]
Houston performing “ My Love Is Your Love ” with her daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown on  Good Morning America , September 1, 2009
Houston gave her first interview in seven years in September 2009, appearing on Oprah Winfrey’s season premiere. The interview was billed as “the most anticipated music interview of the decade”. [210]  Whitney admitted on the show to using drugs with former husband Bobby Brown, who “laced marijuana with rock cocaine”. [211]  By 1996, she told Oprah, “[doing drugs] was an everyday thing… I wasn’t happy by that point in time. I was losing myself.” [212]
Houston released her new album,  I Look to You , in August 2009. [213]  The album’s first two singles are “I Look to You” and “Million Dollar Bill”. The album entered the  Billboard 200  at No. 1, with Houston’s best opening-week sales of 305,000 copies, marking Houston’s first number one album since The Bodyguard , and Houston’s first studio album to reach number one since 1987’s  Whitney . Houston also appeared on European television programs to promote the album. She performed the song “I Look to You” on the German television show  Wetten, dass..? . Three days later, she performed the worldwide first single from I Look To You,  Million Dollar Bill , on the French television show Le Grand Journal. Houston appeared as guest mentor on  The X Factor  in the United Kingdom. She performed “Million Dollar Bill” on the following day’s results show, completing the song even as a strap in the back of her dress popped open two minutes into the performance. She later commented that she “sang [herself] out of [her] clothes”.
The performance was poorly received by the British media, and was variously described as “weird” and “ungracious”, [214]  “shambolic” [215]  and a “flop”. Despite this reception, “Million Dollar Bill” jumped to its peak from 14 to number 5 (her first UK top 5 for over a decade), and three weeks after release “I Look to You” went gold. Houston appeared on the Italian version of  The X Factor , performing the same song “Million Dollar Bill” to excellent reviews. [216]  She was awarded the Gold Certificate for achieving over 50,000 CD sales of “I Look To You” in Italy. [217]  In November, Houston performed “I Didn’t Know My Own Strength” at the 2009 American Music Awards in Los Angeles, California. Two days later, Houston performed both songs on the Dancing With The Stars season 9 finale. As of December 2009, “I Look to You” has been certified platinum by the RIAA for sales of more than one million copies in the United States. [218]  On January 26, 2010, her  debut album  was re-released in a special edition entitled  Whitney Houston – The Deluxe Anniversary Edition . [219]
Whitney Houston at the  O2 Arena , April 28, 2010, as part of her  Nothing but Love World Tour
Houston later embarked on a world tour, entitled the  Nothing but Love World Tour . It was her first world tour in over ten years and was announced as a triumphant comeback. However, some poor reviews and rescheduled concerts brought some negative media attention. [220] [221]  Houston canceled some concerts due to illness and received widespread negative reviews from fans who were disappointed in the quality of her voice and performance. Some fans reportedly walked out of her concerts. [222]
In January 2010, Houston was nominated for two NAACP Image Awards, one for Best Female Artist and one for Best Music Video. She won the award for Best Music Video for her single “I Look to You”. On January 16, she received  The BET Honors  Award for Entertainer citing her lifetime achievements spanning over 25 years in the industry. The 2010 BET Honors award was held at the  Warner Theatre  in Washington, D.C. and aired on February 1, 2010.  Jennifer Hudson  and  Kim Burrell  performed in honor of her, garnering positive reviews. Houston also received a nomination from the Echo Awards, Germany’s version of the Grammys, for Best International Artist. In April 2010, the UK newspaper  The Mirror  reported that Houston was thinking about recording her eighth studio album and wanted to collaborate with  will.i.am  (of  The Black Eyed Peas ), her first choice for a collaboration. [223]
Houston also performed the song “I Look to You” on the 2011  BET   Celebration of Gospel , with  gospel –jazz singer  Kim Burrell , held at the Staples Center, Los Angeles. The performance aired on January 30, 2011. Early in 2011, she gave an uneven performance in tribute to cousin Dionne Warwick at music mogul Clive Davis’ annual pre-Grammy gala. In May 2011, Houston enrolled in a rehabilitation center again, as an out-patient, citing drug and alcohol problems. A representative for Houston said that it was a part of Houston’s “longstanding recovery process”. [224]
In September 2011,  The Hollywood Reporter  announced that Houston would produce and star alongside  Jordin Sparks  and  Mike Epps  in the remake of the 1976 film  Sparkle . In the film, Houston portrays Sparks’ “not-so encouraging mother”. Houston will have executive producer credits on top of acting credits according to Debra Martin Chase, producer of  Sparkle . She stated that Houston deserved the title considering she had been there from the beginning in 2001, when Houston obtained  Sparkle  production rights. R&B singer  Aaliyah  – originally tapped to star as Sparkle – died in a 2001 plane crash. Her death derailed production, which would have begun in 2002. [225] [226] [227]  Houston’s  remake of  Sparkle  was filmed in the fall of 2011, [228]  and is set for release by  TriStar Pictures  in August 2012. [229]
Death
The  Beverly Hilton Hotel , where Houston’s body was found
Wikinews has related news: American pop star Whitney Houston dies at 48
On February 9, 2012, Houston visited singers  Brandy  and  Monica , together with  Clive Davis , at their rehearsals for Davis’ pre-Grammy Awards party at the Beverly Hilton Hotel  in  Beverley Hills . [230] [231]  That same day, she made her last public performance, when she joined  Kelly Price  on stage in  Hollywood, CA and sang “ Jesus Loves Me “. [232] [233]
On February 11, 2012, Houston was found dead in suite 434 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, submerged in the bathtub. [234] [235]  The cause of death was not immediately known. [236] [237]  Beverly Hills paramedics arrived at approximately 3:30 p.m. and found the singer unresponsive and performed  CPR . Houston was pronounced dead at 3:55 p.m.  PST . [236] [238]  Local police said there were “no obvious signs of criminal intent.” [239]
Houston had an invitation-only memorial on Saturday, February 18, 2012, at the New Hope Baptist Church in  Newark, New Jersey . The service was scheduled for two hours, but lasted for four hours. [240]  Among those who performed at the funeral were  Stevie Wonder  (rewritten version of “ Ribbon in the Sky ,” and “ Love’s in Need of Love Today “),  CeCe Winans  (“ Don’t Cry ” and “Jesus Loves Me”),  Alicia Keys  (“ Send Me an Angel “),  Kim Burrell  (rewritten version of “ A Change Is Gonna Come “) and  R. Kelly  (“I Look to You”), interspersed with hymns by the church choir and remarks by  Clive Davis , Houston’s record producer;  Kevin Costner ;  Ricky Minor  her music director; her cousin  Dionne Warwick  and Ray Watson, her security guard for the past 11 years. Aretha Franklin  was listed on the program and was expected to sing, but was unable to attend the service. [241] [242]   Bobby Brown , Houston’s ex-husband, was also invited to the funeral but he left before the service began. [243]  Houston was buried on Sunday, February 19, 2012, in  Fairview Cemetery , in Westfield, New Jersey  next to her father, John Russell Houston, who died in 2003. [244]
Reaction
The Clive Davis’ pre-Grammy party that Houston was expected to attend, and that featured many of the biggest names in music and movies, went on as scheduled although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston’s death at the evening’s start: “By now you have all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney’s passing. I don’t have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn’t scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.” [245]
Tony Bennett  spoke of Houston’s death before performing at Davis’ party. He said, “First, it was  Michael Jackson , then  Amy Winehouse , now, the magnificent Whitney Houston”. Bennett sang “ How Do You Keep the Music Playing? ” and said of Houston, “When I first heard her, I called Clive Davis and said, ‘You finally found the greatest singer I’ve ever heard in my life.'” [246]
Some celebrities opposed Davis’ decision to continue on the party while a police investigation was being conducted in Houston’s hotel room and her body was still in the building. Chaka Khan, in an interview with  CNN ‘s  Piers Morgan  on February 13, 2012, shared that she felt the party should have been canceled, saying “I thought that was complete insanity. And knowing Whitney I don’t believe that she would have said ‘the show must go on.’ She’s the kind of woman that would’ve said ‘Stop everything! Un-unh. I’m not going to be there.’ […] I don’t know what could motivate a person to have a party in a building where the person whose life he had influenced so enormously and whose life had been affected by hers. They were like… I don’t understand how that party went on.” [247]   Sharon Osbourne , on February 15 episode of  The Talk , also condemned the Davis party, declaring “I think it was disgraceful that the party went on. I don’t want to be in a hotel room when there’s someone you admire who’s tragically lost their life four floors up. I’m not interested in being in that environment and I think when you grieve someone, you do it privately, you do it with people who understand you. I thought it was so wrong.” [248]
Several other celebrities released statements responding to Houston’s death.  Dolly Parton , whose song “ I Will Always Love You ” was covered by Houston, said, “I will always be grateful and in awe of the wonderful performance she did on my song and I can truly say from the bottom of my heart, ‘Whitney, I will always love you. You will be missed’.”  Aretha Franklin  said, “It’s so stunning and unbelievable. I couldn’t believe what I was reading coming across the TV screen.” [249]   Mariah Carey  said, “Heartbroken and in tears over the shocking death of my friend … She will never be forgotten as one of the greatest voices to ever grace the earth.” [250]  Oprah Winfrey, who did an in-depth interview with Houston in 2009, wrote on  Twitter  “To me Whitney was THE VOICE. We got to hear a part of God every time she sang. Heart is heavy, spirit grateful for the GIFT of her.” [251]   Quincy Jones  said, “I am absolutely heartbroken at the news of Whitney’s passing. Ashford & Simpson first made me aware of Whitney when she was just sixteen, and I always regretted not having had the opportunity to work with her. She was a true original and a talent beyond compare. I will miss her terribly.” [250]
Moments after news of her death emerged,  CNN ,  MSNBC  and  Fox News  all broke from their regularly scheduled programming to dedicate time to non-stop coverage of Houston’s death. All three featured live interviews with people who knew Houston including those that have worked with her, interviewed her along with some of her peers in the music industry.  Saturday Night Live  displayed a photo of a smiling Houston, alongside  Molly Shannon , from her 1996 appearance. [252] [253]  MTV and VH-1 interrupted their regularly scheduled programming on Sunday February 12 to air many of Houston’s classic videos with MTV often airing news segments in between and featuring various reactions from fans and celebrities.
Houston’s former husband,  Bobby Brown , was reported to be “in and out of crying fits” since receiving the news. He did not cancel a scheduled performance and within hours of his ex-wife’s sudden death, an audience in Mississippi observed as Brown blew kisses skyward, tearfully saying: “I love you, Whitney”. [254]
Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the  54th Grammy Awards  announced that  Jennifer Hudson  would perform a tribute to Houston at the February 12, 2012, awards. He said “event organizers believed Hudson – an Academy Award-winning actress and Grammy Award-winning artist – could perform a respectful musical tribute to Houston”. Ehrlich went on to say: “It’s too fresh in everyone’s memory to do more at this time, but we would be remiss if we didn’t recognize Whitney’s remarkable contribution to music fans in general, and in particular her close ties with the Grammy telecast and her Grammy wins and nominations over the years”. [255]  At the start of the awards ceremony, a footage of Houston performing “I Will Always Love You” from 1994 Grammys was shown following a prayer read by host,  LL Cool J . Later in the program following a montage of photos of musicians who died in 2011 with Houston singing “Saving All My Love for You” at the 1986 Grammys, Hudson paid tribute to Houston and the other artists by performing “I Will Always Love You”. [256] [257]
Houston was honored in the form of various tributes at the 43rd NAACP Image Awards, held on February 17. A image montage of Houston and important black figures who died in 2011 was followed by video footage from the 1994 ceremony, which depicted her accepting two Image Awards for outstanding female artist and entertainer of the year. Following the video tribute,  Yolanda Adams  delivered a rendition of “I Love the Lord” from  The Preacher’s Wife Soundtrack . In the finale of the ceremony,  Kirk Franklin  and The Family started their performance with “Greatest Love of All.” [258]  The  2012 BRIT Awards , which took place at London’s  O2 Arena  on February 21, also paid tribute to Houston by playing a 30-second-video montage of her music videos with a snippet of “One Moment in Time” as the background music in the ceremony’s first segment. [259]  New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie  said that all  New Jersey state flags  would be flown at  half-staff  on Tuesday, February 21 to honor Houston. [260]  Accompanied by  Esperanza Spalding  belting out “ What a Wonderful World ” along with the Southern California Children’s Choir, Houston was featured in the In Memoriam montage alongside other cinema greats at the  84th Academy Awards , held at the  Hollywood and Highland Center  on February 26, 2012.

Artistry and legacy
Voice
“I Will Always Love You” (1992)
One of Houston’s best selling singles worldwide and recognized songs, “I Will Always Love You” prominently uses melismas .
Problems listening to this file? See  media help .
Houston was a  mezzo-soprano , [263] [264]  and was commonly referred to as “The Voice” in reference to her exceptional vocal talent. [265]  Her  vocal range  extended from G below  middle C  (G 3 ) to high B- flat  (B♭ 5 ); she could  belt  out to treble F (F 5 ). [266]  She was third in MTV’s list of 22 Greatest Voices, [267]  and sixth on  Online Magazine COVE ‘s list of the 100 Best Pop Vocalists with a score of 48.5/50. [268]  In 2008,  Rolling Stone  listed Houston as the thirty-fourth of the 100 greatest singers of all time, stating, “Her voice is a mammoth, coruscating cry: Few vocalists could get away with opening a song with 45 unaccompanied seconds of singing, but Houston’s powerhouse version of Dolly Parton’s ‘I Will Always Love You’ is a tour de force.” [100]  Matthew Perpetua from  Rolling Stone  also eulogized Houston’s vocal, enumerating ten performances, including “How Will I Know” from the 1986 MTV VMAs and “The Star Spangled Banner” at the 1991 Super Bowl. “Whitney Houston was blessed with an astonishing vocal range and extraordinary technical skill, but what truly made her a great singer was her ability to connect with a song and drive home its drama and emotion with incredible precision,” he stated. “She was a brilliant performer, and her live shows often eclipsed her studio recordings.” [269]
Jon Caramanica of  The New York Times  commented, “Her voice was clean and strong, with barely any grit, well suited to the songs of love and aspiration. […] Hers was a voice of triumph and achievement, and it made for any number of stunning, time-stopping vocal performances.” [270]   Mariah Carey  stated, “Whitney has a really rich, strong mid-belt that very few people have. She sounds really good, really strong.” [271]  While in her review of  I Look to You , music critic Ann Powers of the  Los Angeles Times  writes, “[Houston’s voice] stands like monuments upon the landscape of 20th century pop, defining the architecture of their times, sheltering the dreams of millions and inspiring the climbing careers of countless imitators”, adding “When she was at her best, nothing could match her huge, clean, cool mezzo-soprano”. [264]
Lauren Everitt from  BBC News Magazine  commented on  melisma  used in Houston’s recording and its influence. “An early ‘I’ in Whitney Houston’s ‘I Will Always Love You’ takes nearly six seconds to sing. In those seconds the former gospel singer-turned-pop star packs a series of different notes into the single syllable,” stated Everitt. “The technique is repeated throughout the song, most pronouncedly on every ‘I’ and ‘you’. The vocal technique is called melisma, and it has inspired a host of imitators. Other artists may have used it before Houston, but it was her rendition of Dolly Parton’s love song that pushed the technique into the mainstream in the 90s. […] But perhaps what Houston nailed best was moderation.” Everitt said that “[i]n a climate of reality shows ripe with ‘oversinging’, it’s easy to appreciate Houston’s ability to save melisma for just the right moment”. [272]
Houston’s vocal stylings have had a significant impact on the music industry. She has been called the “ Queen of Pop ” for her influence during the 1990s, commercially rivaling Mariah Carey and  Celine Dion . [273]   Stephen Holden  from  The New York Times , in his review of Houston’s  Radio City Music Hall  concert on July 20, 1993, praised her attitude as a singer highly, writing, “Whitney Houston is one of the few contemporary pop stars of whom it might be said: the voice suffices. While almost every performer whose albums sell in the millions calls upon an entertainer’s bag of tricks, from telling jokes to dancing to circus pyrotechnics, Ms. Houston would rather just stand there and sing.” With regard to her singing style, he added: “Her [Houston’s] stylistic trademarks – shivery melismas that ripple up in the middle of a song, twirling embellishments at the ends of phrases that suggest an almost breathless exhilaration – infuse her interpretations with flashes of musical and emotional lightning.” [274]
Elysa Gardner of the  Los Angeles Times  in her review for  The Preacher’s Wife Soundtrack  praised Houston’s vocal ability highly, commenting, “She is first and foremost a pop diva – at that, the best one we have. No other female pop star – not Mariah Carey, not Celine Dion, not  Barbra Streisand  – quite rivals Houston in her exquisite vocal fluidity and purity of tone, and her ability to infuse a lyric with mesmerizing melodrama.” [275]
Influence
A  Barbie doll  inspired by Houston’s appearance in the music video for “ I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me) ” (1987). Houston became one of the few black female artists whose music videos received heavy rotation on MTV and other music video channels.
During the 1980s, MTV was coming into its own and received harsh criticism for not playing enough videos by black artists. With  Michael Jackson  breaking down the color barrier for black male artists, Houston did the same for black female artists. She became the first black female artist to receive heavy rotation on the network following the success of the “How Will I Know” video. [276]  Following Houston’s breakthrough, other African-American female artists, such as  Janet Jackson  and  Anita Baker , were successful in popular music. [54] [55]  Baker commented that “Because of what Whitney and  Sade  did, there was an opening for me… For radio stations, black women singers aren’t taboo anymore.” [277]
Allmusic  noted her contribution to the success of black artists on the pop scene, commenting, “Houston was able to handle big adult contemporary ballads, effervescent, stylish dance-pop, and slick urban contemporary soul with equal dexterity” and that “the result was an across-the-board appeal that was matched by scant few artists of her era, and helped her become one of the first black artists to find success on MTV in Michael Jackson’s wake”. [278]   The New York Times stated that “Houston was a major catalyst for a movement within black music that recognized the continuity of soul, pop, jazz and gospel vocal traditions”. [279] Richard Corliss  of  Time  magazine commented on her initial success breaking various barriers:
Of her first album’s ten cuts, six were ballads. This chanteuse [Houston] had to fight for air play with hard rockers. The young lady had to stand uncowed in the locker room of macho rock. The soul strutter had to seduce a music audience that anointed few black artists with superstardom. […] She was a phenomenon waiting to happen, a canny tapping of the listener’s yen for a return to the musical middle. And because every new star creates her own genre, her success has helped other blacks, other women, other smooth singers find an avid reception in the pop marketplace. [280]
Stephen Holden of  The New York Times  said that Houston “revitalized the tradition of strong gospel-oriented pop-soul singing”. [281]  Ann Powers of the  Los Angeles Times  referred to the singer as a “national treasure”. [264]  Jon Caramanica, other music critic of  The New York Times , called Houston “R&B’s great modernizer,” adding “slowly but surely reconciling the ambition and praise of the church with the movements and needs of the body and the glow of the mainstream”. [270]  He also drew comparisons between Houston’s influence and other big names’ on 1980s pop:
She was, alongside Michael Jackson and Madonna, one of the crucial figures to hybridize pop in the 1980s, though her strategy was far less radical than that of her peers. Jackson and Madonna were by turns lascivious and brutish and, crucially, willing to let their production speak more loudly than their voices, an option Ms. Houston never went for. Also, she was less prolific than either of them, achieving most of her renown on the strength of her first three solo albums and one soundtrack, released from 1985 to 1992. If she was less influential than they were in the years since, it was only because her gift was so rare, so impossible to mimic. Jackson and Madonna built worldviews around their voices; Ms. Houston’s voice was the worldview. She was someone more to be admired, like a museum piece, than to be emulated. [270]
The Independant ‘s music critic Andy Gill also wrote about Houston’s influence on modern R&B and singing competitions, comparing it to Michael Jackson’s. “Because Whitney, more than any other single artist ― Michael Jackson included ― effectively mapped out the course of modern R&B, setting the bar for standards of soul vocalese, and creating the original template for what we now routinely refer to as the ‘soul diva’,” stated Gill. “Jackson was a hugely talented icon, certainly, but he will be as well remembered (probably more so) for his presentational skills, his dazzling dance moves, as for his musical innovations. Whitney, on the other hand, just sang, and the ripples from her voice continue to dominate the pop landscape.” Gill said that there “are few, if any, Jackson imitators on today’s TV talent shows, but every other contestant is a Whitney wannabe, desperately attempting to emulate that wondrous combination of vocal effects – the flowing melisma, the soaring mezzo-soprano confidence, the tremulous fluttering that carried the ends of lines into realms of higher yearning”. [282]
Houston was considered by many to be a “singer’s singer”, who had an influence on countless other vocalists, both female and male. [100] [283]  Similarly, Steve Huey from Allmusic wrote that the shadow of Houston’s prodigious technique still looms large over nearly every pop diva and smooth urban soul singer – male or female – in her wake, and spawned a legion of imitators. [278]   Rolling Stone , on her biography, stated that Houston “redefined the image of a female soul icon and inspired singers ranging from Mariah Carey to  Rihanna “. [284]   Essence  ranked Houston the fifth on their list of 50 Most Influential R&B Stars of all time, calling her “the diva to end all divas”. [285]
A number of artists have acknowledged Houston as an influence, including  Celine Dion , [286]   Mariah Carey , [100]   Toni Braxton , [287]   Christina Aguilera , [288]   LeAnn Rimes , [289]   Jessica Simpson , [290]   Nelly Furtado , [291] [292]   Kelly Clarkson ,  Britney Spears , [293]   Ciara , [294]   P!nk , [293] Ashanti , [295]   Robin Thicke , [296]   Jennifer Hudson ,  Stacie Orrico ,  Amerie , [297]  and  Destiny’s Child . [293] [298]  Mariah Carey, who was often compared to Houston, said, “Houston has been a big influence on me.” [299]  She later told  USA Today  that “none of us would sound the same if Aretha Franklin hadn’t ever put out a record, or Whitney Houston hadn’t.” [300]  Celine Dion who was the third member of the troika that dominated female pop singing in the 1990s, did a telephone interview with  Good Morning America  on February 13, 2012, telling “Whitney’s been an amazing inspiration for me. I’ve been singing with her my whole career, actually. I wanted to have a career like hers, sing like her, look beautiful like her.” [301] Beyoncé  told the  Globe and Mail  that Houston “inspired [her] to get up there and do what [she] did”. [302]  She also wrote on her website on the day after Houston’s death, “I, like every singer, always wanted to be just like [Houston]. Her voice was perfect. Strong but soothing. Soulful and classic. Her vibrato, her cadence, her control. So many of my life’s memories are attached to a Whitney Houston song. She is our queen and she opened doors and provided a blueprint for all of us.” [303]
Mary J. Blige  said that Houston inviting her onstage during  VH1 ‘s  Divas Live  show in 1999 “opened doors for [her] all over the world”. [304]   Brandy  stated, “The first Whitney Houston CD was genius. That CD introduced the world to her angelic yet powerful voice. Without Whitney, half of this generation of singers wouldn’t be singing.” [305]   Kelly Rowland , in an  Ebony ‘s feature article celebrating black music in June 2006, recalled that “[I] wanted to be a singer after I saw Whitney Houston on TV singing ‘Greatest Love of All’. I wanted to sing like Whitney Houston in that red dress.” She added that “And I have never, ever forgotten that song [Greatest Love of All]. I learned it backward, forward, sideways. The video still brings chills to me. When you wish and pray for something as a kid, you never know what blessings God will give you.” [306]
Alicia Keys , in an interview about her album  The Element of Freedom  with  Billboard  magazine, also said “Whitney is an artist who inspired me from [the time I was] a little girl”. Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson  cites Houston as her biggest musical influence. She told  Newsday  that she learned from Houston the “difference between being able to sing and knowing how to sing”.  Leona Lewis , who has been called “the new Whitney Houston”, also cites her as an influence. Lewis stated that she idolized her as a little girl.

Penyebaran Injil Awal di Tanah Batak
Beberapa sumber mencatat bahwa pengabaran Injil di tanah Batak dimulai semenjak Pendeta Ward dan Pendeta Barton dari Gereja Baptis Inggris meyebarkan injil. Usaha pengabaran
Injil
di tanah Batak dimulai kembali di tahun
1834
dengan diutusnya Pdt Samuel Munson dan Pdt Henry Lyman dari badan Zending di
Boston . Usaha ini mengalami kegagalan di saat kedua missionaris tersebut mati
martir
di
Lobu Pining
( Tapanuli Utara ). Usaha menginjili tanah Batak sempat terhenti sampai berita mengenai tanah Batak terdengar lagi di
Eropa
dari hasil ekspedisi seorang Ilmuwan yang bernama Junghun pada tahun
1840 . Akibatnya pada tahun
1849
Lembaga
Alkitab
Belanda
mengirim Van der Tuuk untuk mempelajari
Bahasa Batak
dan hasilnya adalah diterjemahkannya sebagian Alkitab ke dalam bahasa Batak menggunakanaksara Batak. Setelah melihat hasil karya Van der Tuuk, Badan Zending Rheinshe (RMG) mengalihkan konsentrasinya dalam menyebarkan Injil ke daerah Batak degan mengutus Pendeta D.R. Fabri ke sana, sebagian sumber menyebutkan bahwa hal ini disebabkan terhalangnya usaha RMG di
Kalimantan .
Kelahiran HKBP
Setelah sekian lama melakukan pengabaran
Injil , pada tanggal
31 Maret
1861
di
Sipirok , akhirnya Pendeta
Van Asselt
mengadakan
Baptisan Kudus
pertama bagi orang Batak, yaitu pada Simon Siregar dan
Jakobus Tampubolon . Karena wilayah penginjilan yang mulai meluas, pada tanggal
7 Oktober
di tahun yang sama di Sipirok diadakan pertemuan antara 4 Missionaris yang membicarakan pembagian wilayah Penginjilan. Hari ini kemudian diperingati sebagai hari kelahiran HKBP. Mereka yang mengadakan rapat itu adalah :Pdt. Heine, Pdt. J.C. Klammer, Pdt. Betz dan Pdt. Van Asselt. Seringkali banyak orang menghubungkan nama HKBP dengan akronim nama mereka, pada hal nama HKBP baru dipakai tahun 1929.

Elvis Aaron Presley
(8 Januari 1935–16 Agustus 1977) adalah seorang penyanyi
rock ‘n’ roll
legendaris Amerika Serikat. Ia juga adalah seorang produser musik dan aktor. Julukannya adalah “Raja Rock ‘n’ Roll”. Berkat lagu-lagunya yang memadukan irama
rock ‘n’ roll
dengan lagu-lagu
ballad , dunia
rock ‘n’ roll
memperoleh fondasi komersial yang selanjutnya dapat dikembangkan musisi
rock ‘n’ roll
penerusnya. Pada masa kejayaannya, konser-konser Elvis dihadiri massa (kebanyakan remaja) dalam jumlah yang sangat besar. Gaya, sifat, serta cara berpakaiannya menjadi simbol bagi musik
rock ‘n’ roll
dan banyak ditiru penggemarnya.
Awal Hidup dan karier
Lahir di East Tupelo, Mississippi, dari pasangan Vernon Elvis Presley dan Gladys Love Smith, Elvis tumbuh besar di Memphis, Tennessee. Ia mulai bermain gitar dan bermain di beberapa acara di pusat-pusat perbelanjaan. Saat duduk di bangku sekolah menengah, ia bekerja menjadi sopir truk bagi sebuah perusahaan listrik.
Pada musim panas pada tahun 1953, Elvis membayar $4 untuk merekam dua buah lagu di perusahaan rekaman
Sun Studios
sebagai hadiah ulang tahun bagi ibunya. Pendiri
Sun , Sam Phillips, tertarik pada suaranya dan memanggilnya pada Juni 1954 untuk mengisi posisi penyanyi ballad yang sedang kosong. Sesi rekaman tersebut, yang dilakukan bersama dua musisi setempat, Scotty Moore dan Bill Black, awalnya tidak produktif, namun saat sedang istirahat dalam sebuah sesi rekaman pada 5 Juli 1954, Elvis mulai menyanyikan lagu
blues
karya Arthur Crudup berjudul
That’s All Right . Versi Elvis disukai Phillips dan diputarkan di radio di Memphis dan segera menjadi
hit
di daerah tersebut. Sejak itu ia mulai melakukan tur ke berbagai tempat, termasuk ke luar Tennessee.
Manajemen Baru
Pada 16 Oktober 1954, ia tampil dalam siaran radio
Louisiana Hayride
dan menjadi
hit
bagi pendengar dalam jumlah yang besar. Ia kemudian menandatangani sebuah kontrak satu tahun dan bertemu dengan Tom Parker, yang kelak menjadi manajernya. Hampir setahun kemudian, Tom Parker mengambil alih seluruh tugas sebagai manajer Elvis dan tak lama kemudian, berhasil mendapatkan persetujuan kontrak dengan RCA Records bagi Elvis. Elvis juga menandatangani kontrak Hollywood. Melalui syarat-syarat dalam kontrak, Parker membangun nilai komersial serta citra Elvis yang menguntungkan, contohnya melalui lisensi penggunaan citra Elvis dalam segala macam produk, dari peralatan dapur hingga gitar.
Militer dan Kematian Ibu
Pada Desember 1957, Elvis dipanggil untuk ikut tugas militer dengan Angkatan Bersenjata AS. Ia resmi masuk Angkatan Bersenjata pada 24 Maret 1958, kemudian ditugaskan di Jerman. Sementara pelatihan karate dalam panggilan militernya, ibunda dari Elvis didiagnosis menderita hepatitis dan keadaannya semakin memburuk. Akhirnya sang ibu meninggal pada usia 46 tahun. Setelah itu, Elvis kembali dari militer dan dilepas tugaskan dengan hormat dua tahun kemudian. Sekembalinya dari wajib militer, karya Elvis mengalami penurunan dari segi kesuksesan, di mana salah satu penyebabnya adalah bangkitnya musik Britania/Inggris ( British Invasion ; The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, dan lain-lain).
Comeback Tour dan Kematian
Ia melakukan
comeback
Tour yang sukses melalui penampilan televisi pada 3 Desember 1968 berjudul ‘ 68 Comeback Special . Karier musiknya yang sempat meredup akibat “diganggu” profesi lainnya sebagai aktor dan juga hilangnya peranan dia dalam memilih jenis lagu yang ia mainkan, kembali bersinar setelah ia mendapatkan kesempatan dalam acara tersebut untuk bermain dalam jalur yang paling ia sukai,
rock ‘n’ roll . Pada tahun berikutnya, ia memulai penampilan
live
yang laris di berbagai tempat, diawali dari Las Vegas dan kemudian berlanjut ke sepanjang negara. Antara tahun 1969 dan 1977, ia tampil dalam 1.000 acara yang tiketnya terjual habis.
Akibat kecanduan obat-obat dokter seperti obat tidur, kesehatannya dan penampilannya mengalami penurunan pada sekitar pertengahan 1970-an. Ia tampil untuk terakhir kalinya dalam sebuah konser di Market Square Arena di Indianapolis, Indiana pada 26 Juni 1977.
Pada 16 Agustus 1977, Elvis ditemukan meninggal dunia di rumahnya di Graceland di Memphis akibat serangan jantung. Saat itu ia berusia 42 tahun.
