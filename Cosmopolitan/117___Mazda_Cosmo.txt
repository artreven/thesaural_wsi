The
Mazda Tribute
( Code J14 ) is a
Crossover (automobile)
made by
Japanese
automaker
Mazda
since 2001. It is jointly developed with
Ford Motor Company
and based on the
front-wheel drive
Mazda 626
platform, which is in turn the basis for the similar
Ford Escape
on the
CD2 platform . The Tribute is priced below the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner in Ford's CD2 SUV lineup.
The Tribute and Escape debuted in 2001, offering front and
all wheel drive
and a choice of a 2.0 L Ford Zetec
4-cylinder
or
Ford Duratec
3.0 L
V6 . Ford Escape was also sold as the Ford Maverick in
Europe
with a Ford 2.0 L
I4
Zetec engine with
manual transmission , or 3.0 L Duratec coupled to
automatic transmission .
One main difference between the Tribute and the Ford Escape/Maverick is that the Tribute's suspension is tuned for a firmer ride than the Escape/Maverick, in order to correspond with Mazda's sporty image. It is also Mazda's oldest SUV still in production.

The Tribute made its debut at the 2000
Los Angeles Auto Show . In the
United States , it somewhat filled the gap left by the
Mazda Navajo , a rebadged Ford Explorer, (which was retired in 1994), while in most other countries it was the first Mazda-badged
SUV
ever sold. Also, in
Japan , Mazda had an SUV called the
Mazda Proceed Levante , a rebadged
Suzuki Escudo
prior to the SUV's debut. The Ford plant in
Claycomo, Missouri
assembled Tribute for the North American market, alongside Ford Escape. The
Mazda plant
in
Hofu ,
Japan
and the
Ford Lio Ho
plant in
Taiwan
assembled Tribute for their respective markets.

North American
built models, a floor mounted
automatic transmission
shifter replaced the column shifter. However, Japanese-built models continued with a column shifter. Mazda decided to halt production after the 2006
model year
for the Tribute, and a
hybrid
version of the Tribute has been introduced alongside the next generation Tribute as a 2008 model.

A significantly face-lifted version of the Tribute was released in the second half of 2006 for
Asia Pacific
markets. The updated Tribute featured a larger, bolder grille, with an enlarged Mazda emblem, as well as restyled front bumper and headlights. Side mirrors featured integrated indicators.
On the inside, changes included a new floor mounted automatic transmission shifter, in place of the old column shifter (Asia-Pacific model only;
US -built Tribute gained the floor shifter in 2005). The dash was updated with a brand-new radio and automatic climate control with digital read-out, on certain models.
Mechanically, the rear drum brakes was replaced by disc brakes.
Engines remain the same, but the
V6
has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by over 10%, while the
4-cylinder
has improved mid-range torque and an electronic throttle. Both engines had been certified to meet
Euro III
emission regulations.
Starting with model year 2007, Mazda stopped selling and producing Tribute in Japan, and replaced it with similar sized
CX-7 , later on in 2007, Mazda Australia also discontinued the Tribute, the absence of the Tribute being filled by the Mazda CX-7. For other Asia-Pacific markets, the production of Tribute was shifted to the
Ford Lio Ho
plant in
Jhongli ,
Taiwan , which also produces Tribute's twin,
Ford Escape , for the Asia-Pacific markets.

For the 2008 model year, the Tribute was significantly revamped, like its sibling
Ford Escape
and
Mercury Mariner , with a new look. Originally set to be renamed the
Mazda CX-5 , the vehicle kept the Tribute name.
The changes are significant, but fall short of "clean sheet" redesign, as the vehicles remained on the old
CD2 platform , and kept the old 2.3l
MZR
I4 , and 3.0l
AJ
V6
engines. As a cost saving measure, the rear brake was reverted back to
drum brake . Also, the firmer "sporty" suspension is gone and both the Tribute and Escape ride much more soflty, with noticeably worse handling than earlier models.
The 2009 Model is expected to receive an engine upgrade in the 4 cylinder, the 2.5 that will be used in the Mazda 3s and the Mazda 6i for 2009 will be carried over to the Tribute.
Visible changes include all new sheet metal and interior. Unlike the first generation of the Tribute, which had unique exterior and interior from its siblings, the new model only differs from its siblings in the "nose" (front fenders, hood, and front fascia), tail lights and detailing. Notable changes to the exterior include higher belt line, and more pronounced wheel arches. Overall the car was to look larger and more substantial than the previous model. The interior was upgraded using all new components and higher quality materials.
A new addition was the Hybrid model which was previously only available on the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner.
The 2008 Mazda Tribute (non-hybrid) was first unveiled at the 2007
Montreal
auto show, and the 2008 Mazda Tribute went on sale in March 2007.

Mazda Sentia
Mazda Sentia
Manufacturer
Mazda
Production
1991–1999
Predecessor
Mazda Luce
Class
Luxury car
Platform
FR
HE
The
Mazda Sentia
was a large
rear wheel drive
luxury car
sold in Japan in the 1990s. It replaced the
Mazda Luce
nameplate on the
Mazda H platform
cars for Japan in 1991 and was retired in 1999 after two generations.
1991
The Sentia has been developed with the future Mazda flagship, the Amati 1000 in mind. Anticipating that The Amati would take over the role of formal-use vehicles (i.e. chauffeur-driven transport for executives) in the product line, the first Sentia is considerably geared towards private owners in its focus. This is very evident in its Jaguar-inspired stance, relatively low roofline, as well as using more of its dimensions for styling as opposed to improving interior space.
The Sentia was marketed by Mazda as having a "front midship" layout: the V6 engine sits behind the front axle, while the fuel tank rests above the rear axle. This iteration of the Sentia also debuted Mazda's speed-sensitive four-wheel steering system. At speeds of lower than 35kph, the rear wheels steer in an opposite (toe out) direction from the front wheels, in order to reduce the turn radius. At higher speeds they steer in the toe in direction to improve stability.
Solar ventilation system is a setup where amorphous solar cells in the sunroof panel powers small ventilation fans located in the trunk area, in order to cool the cabin while the car's parked in the sun. This setup would later be found on the Eunos800/Millenia.
There are two engines available. Both have their roots in prior Mazda V6s, and have no relation to the aluminum KL series found in the 626-platformed Mazdas. The 3-liter JE-ZE receives a new variable intake manifold to boost its power rating to 200PS. The 2.5-liter J5-DE is also available, rated at 160PS.
1995
The 1995 Sentia used Mazda's updated
HE platform , and was the last large RWD sedan from Mazda.
The mechanical underpinnings are largely carried over from the previous Sentia. The exterior and interior received a mild redesign to make the car more stately, and suitable for formal corporate use. This includes a larger grille, taller roofline for improved rear headroom, as well as large expanses of woodgrain panelling. Some sources have said that the car incorporates a number of styling cues from the stillborn Amati 1000.
The advertising campaign featured
Sean Connery
saying the car is "...striking!".
Engines:
3.0 L
JE-ZE
V6
The second-generation Sentia drops the 2.5-liter engine, and uses the 3-liter unit in two different tuning for 200PS and 160PS respectively.

The
Mazda RX-8
is a
sports car
manufactured by
Mazda Motor Corporation . It first appeared in 2001 at the
North American International Auto Show . It is the successor to the
RX-7
and, like its predecessors in the RX range, it is powered by a
rotary engine . The RX-8 began
North American
sales as 2004 model year car.
Design
The RX-8 was designed as a
front mid-mounted, rear-wheel drive
2+2
coupé . The car has a near 50:50
weight distribution , achieved by mounting the engine behind the front axle and the fuel tank ahead of the rear axle. The front wheels feature independent
double wishbone
suspension, while the rear are independent
multi-link . Weight is trimmed through the use of materials such as
aluminium
(hood & rear doors), and a
carbon fiber
composite driveshaft on the manual gearbox car, designed to reduce rotational mass (Moment of Inertia) connected to the engine. The rest of the body is steel, save for the plastic front and rear bumpers.
The car features a pair of rear-hinged "freestyle" doors (similar to
suicide doors ) in order to provide easier access to the rear seats. The RX-8 has no
B-pillar
between the front and rear doors, with the leading edge of the rear door acting as a "virtual pillar" to maintain structural rigidity. Because of the overlapping design, the rear doors can only be opened when the front doors are open.
First generation (SE3P)
SE
Production
2003–2008
The first version of the RX-8, the SE3P, produced from model years 2003 to 2008, is powered by the "RENESIS" 13B-MSP (multi side port)
Wankel
rotary engine
displacing 1.3 litres (twin 654 cc rotors) which, when coupled with a six-speed
manual transmission , will typically produce 237 hp (177 kW) at 8,200 rpm and 211 Nm (ECE) of torque at 5,500 rpm.
The multi side port engine improves on fuel efficiency and emissions over the
RX-7 's engine
The RX-8 is available in various models in different markets around the world. Standard models include:
6-speed manual "High Power" with an output of between 170 kW (231 hp) and 184 kW (247 hp) (250 PS) and a 9,000 rpm redline.
5-speed manual "Standard Power" tuned to 141 kW (192 hp) with the redline reduced to 7,500 rpm.
4-speed automatic tuned to 141 kW (189 hp) in some markets, while the U.S. automatic is stated to deliver 197 SAE net hp (158 kW).
6-speed automatic (available in the U.S. market as of 2006) developing 212 hp (158 kW) and 159 lb·ft (216 N·m) of torque with a redline at 7,500 rpm.
PZ
In May 2006 Mazda released the RX-8 PZ for the UK market. The car was jointly developed with motorsports company
Prodrive . Only available in six-speed manual, it featured custom 10-spoke alloy wheels supplied by Italian F1 team supplier
OZ Racing
in "Dark Silver" finish, mirrors developed to reduce drag, front and rear black mesh grilles, and a rear spoiler to provide more stability at higher speeds. Both the wheels and rear wing are badged in carbon fibre with "Prodrive". Significant revisions were also made to the suspension to improve the handling—dampers from
Bilstein
and coil springs from
Eibach
are used in addition to reducing the ride height by 15 mm (0.6 in) and an increase in spring rate of 60%. Finally the car was supplied with a unique upgraded twin exhaust system, with exhaust tailpipes branded "Prodrive". Only 800 were made at an
MSRP
of
£ 25,995 ( $ 51,990). It was available in two colours, Galaxy Grey (320) and Brilliant Black (480).
Hydrogen RE
At the 2004
North American International Auto Show , Mazda unveiled the
RX-8 Hydrogen RE
concept car, designed to run on either hydrogen or gasoline. In February 2006, Mazda revealed that it would start leasing a dual fuel RX-8 to commercial customers in Japan, and in March 2006 announced its first two customers, claiming the first fleet deliveries of a dual hydrogen/gasoline production car. In 2008 30 RX-8 HRE were delivered to
Hynor .

40th Anniversary
2007 saw the release of a special edition to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Mazda's rotary engine.
[ edit ]
2009 Mazda RX-8
Production
starting 2009
The new revision of the Mazda RX-8 debuted at the 2008
Detroit Motor Show , with production model year starting in 2009. Meaningful changes have been described by
Autoblog
as being:
Some additional chassis bracing increases rigidity, along with a trapezoidal strut tower brace and new suspension geometry that keep things planted out back.
Additionally some minor cosmetic changes have been made most notable in the front fascia, fenders, and tail lights. No changes to the engine's power output have been made, though the manual transmission models will see a lower final drive ratio of 4.777 from the previous standard of 4.444. [3]
The updated version is slightly slower than the previous model (0-100km/h in 6.4s from 6.2).
[ edit ]
R3
At the 2008
Detroit Motor Show
information was given regarding the optional R3 package.
This includes the rear spoiler, 19-inch forged aluminum wheels, side sills and fog lamps. The stock seats are swapped out for stunning thrones from Recaro and Bilstein was tapped by Mazda to provide the shocks. [3]
[ edit ]
Warranty Extension Program
According to an article listed on
Autoblog , Mazda of America has extended the warranty on the RX-8 for models built from 2004-2008 Renesis engine. [4] . An article found on RX8club.com displayed an actual letter from Mazda declaring exactly what was being covered and the extended warranty particulars. [5]

Further information might be found on the

(October 2008)
Mazda RX-8 MS
This is the
Mazdaspeed
version of the RX-8 the R3 it adds a sport-tuned suspension with Bilstein shock absorbers and front suspension crossmembers filled with urethane foam. Filling the crossmembers makes for a smoother ride, minimized NVH and greater suspension control.
On the visual side of the package, a rear spoiler, side sills, fog lights and sporty front bumper are added to give an aggressive appearance, along with 19-inch forged aluminum-alloy wheels with high performance tires. Inside, the R3 adds a 300-watt Bose® audio system with Centerpoint® surround sound and AudioPilot® noise compensation technology, Bluetooth hands-free phone system, front Recaro sport seats with leather side bolsters, leather-wrapped parking brake handle and Mazda advanced keyless entry and start system.
[ edit ]
Future revisions
A second generation Renesis engine is currently under development, with a planned release by 2010. [6]
[ edit ]
Ireland and the R3
Due to new tax regulations it is extremely doubtful that there will be any R3's in Ireland. This new system means that it will cost €2000 per year to pay for road tax. Nothing has been done by Mazda or the Irish government to combat this problem.
[ edit ]
Awards
As of October 2006 the RX-8 has won at least 37 international motoring awards including 2003 International Engine of the Year, the 2003 Japanese Car of the Year, Australia's
Wheels
magazine's Car of the Year for 2003, the 2004 Singapore Car of the Year, the 2004 U.S. Best Sports Car, and several
UK
Best Car Awards. It was named on
Car and Driver
magazine's
Ten Best list
for 2004, 2005, and 2006. It also took home 1st place on
Car and Driver's
"Four of a Kind" comparison test.

The
Rotary Pickup
( REPU ) from
Mazda
was the world's first and only
Wankel engined
pickup truck . It was sold from 1974 to 1977 and appears to have been available only in the
United States
and
Canada . Toyo Kogyo (Mazda) made trucks for
Ford
in the
Courier
as well as its own
Mazda B-Series . These trucks shared many of the same parts, but the Rotary Engined Pickup (REPU) had a 4-port
13B
4-barrel carbureted engine, flared fenders, a different dash, front grille, and round taillights.
It is estimated that just over 15,000 total units were built. Most were made for the 1974 model year, due to the
energy crisis
putting a damper on sales, Mazda restamped many of the 1974 models with a prefix "S" designating it as a "1975" model. Approximately 700 units were built for the 1976 model year. Mazda invested in a moderate redesign for the 1977 model, updating electrical systems, adding an additional 4 inches cab stretch for more comfort, and adding a 5-speed manual transmission with different differential gearing. However, after about 3,000 units, the REPU was discontinued due to poor sales.
Road & Track
magazine was impressed with the "smooth, quiet power" and the "nice" interior. Price at the time was about US$3500, and observed fuel economy was 16.5 miles per US gallon (7.0 km/l/19.8 mpg -imp ).
Most of the trucks are found on the west coast of the US, and they continue to be sought out by enthusiasts.
Racing
Like many of the other Mazda rotary vehicles, the REPU was raced. Its most notable finish was an overall victory at the 1975
SCCA
Mojave 24 Hour Rally
at the hands of drivers
Malcolm Smith
and
Jack Sreenan .

The
Mazda Roadpacer
was a full-size sedan sold by
Mazda
Motor Corp. of
Japan
between 1975 and 1977. It was based on the
Australian
Holden Premier . Premiers were shipped to Japan without engines, and Mazda fitted a 1.3 L
13B
Wankel engine
into the bay. Although the engine produced 135 hp (100 kW) and 101 ft·lbf (138 Nm) of torque, the Roadpacer weighed 3,500 lb (1,575 kg).
While the 13B produced more power than the 6 cylinder engine fitted to the car as a Holden, the lack of torque meant performance was restrained with a 103 mph (166 km/h) top speed, poor acceleration and terrible fuel consumption. Contemporary reports suggest 9 mpg (26 L per 100 km).
While the
Holden Premier
itself was well endowed with items, Mazda decided to add many more, including some people had likely never heard of. Gadgets of note include a central locking system that activated when the car hit 10 km/h (6 mph), a chime system that activated at 90 km/h (56 mph), a dictation system and a stereo able to be controlled from both front and back seats.
The price was also not a bargain at 3.8 million yen (US$10,000) in 1975. This was about twice the price of a contemporary
Mazda Cosmo . Originally intended as transport for high-ranking government officials, the car was sold in the wake of the first
fuel crisis
and was not a commercial success. Production ceased in 1977 with only 840 units sold.
The Roadpacer has the sole distinction of a General Motors product being fitted for production with a rotary engine.
Most were sold to government departments and were later crushed, meaning Roadpacers are rare nowadays; their counterpart model, the
Holden Premier
is considered a
classic car
in
Australia ; but the Roadpacer remains largely unheard of, or is believed to be a rumour.

>>Mazda RX-792P
Mazda RX-792P
The
Mazda RX-792P
was a
racing car
built for the
IMSA GT Championship 's GTP category for
Mazda . Its career was short lived, with only two cars running in
1992
before the project was abandoned.
The car's name would be a combination of Mazda's
RX-7
road car, the year the car raced, and the fact that it was a prototype.
Development
Following many successful years running the
RX-7
in IMSA's GTO class and
MX-6
in the GTU class, Mazda chose to take on a new challenge. Although Mazda has supported the use of their
rotary
engines in GTP prototypes in the past, Mazda wished to compete with the likes of
Porsche ,
Nissan ,
Jaguar , and
Toyota
with a full factory effort. This would coincide with Mazda's continued running of the
World Sportscar Championship
in Europe, as well as the
All Japan Sports Prototype Championship
at home.
After Mazda's success in winning the
1991 24 Hours of Le Mans , a change in engine rules by the
FIA
would force Mazda to abandon their
R26B
4-rotor in the World Sportscar Championship. However IMSA rules continued to allow the use of rotaries, which led Mazda to bring the R26B to North America, with refinements to better suit the shorter races and circuits.
For a chassis, Mazda would use the expertise of Crawford Composites to construct their tub, while Fabcar would assist in the project. Due to the different style of racing, the new car would not share much from Mazda's previous effort, the
787B
and it's predecessors. The tub would be built from
carbon fiber , while the bodywork designed by Lee Dykstra would feature new sweeping lines, including a large exposed vent flowing out from the front wheel well.
A total of three RX-792Ps would be built by Crawford for Mazda before the project was cancelled.
Racing history
Managed by Mazda Motorsports, the first RX-792P would be completed shortly before the 1992 season would begin. The team would consist of drivers
Price Cobb
and
Pete Halsmer . Opting to skip the
24 Hours of Daytona , the first chassis would appear at the Grand Prix of Miami. Unfortunately, a fire caused by the hot exhaust touching the car's bodywork would force the car to be withdrawn before the race even took place. This problem continued at the
12 Hours of Sebring , where the car caught fire once again just prior to the race.
By the next round at
Road Atlanta , the second RX-792P chassis would be completed. Both cars were entered in the event, but an accident in practiced forced the second car to not run. The lone remaining RX-792P would manage to take the green flag, finishing in a distant 15th place, nearly twenty laps behind the winner. With the second chassis repaired, Mazda moved to
Lime Rock Park , where the cars would finally show their potential. After qualifying in the middle of the grid, the pair would come home in third and fourth places, only three laps behind the winning
Toyota . At
Mid-Ohio
the RX-792Ps would finish sixth and ninth.
Problems crept up once again as the series moved to New Orleans, with one entry managing a mere 16th. However the Mazda team would quickly rebound to take their best finish of the season, with a second place at
Watkins Glen , even though this was actually five laps behind the winner. A follow-up seventh place at
Laguna Seca
would unfortunately be followed by a double DNF at
Portland .
A quick rebound would see fourth and fifth places at
Road America
before the team once again failed to finish either car at
Phoenix . This trend would continue at the final race of the season, as neither car would make it to the checkered flag. This string of bad results would leave Mazda a distant sixth in the constructor's championship, although Price Cobb would be able to finish eighth in the driver's championship.
Cancellation
Following the 1992 season, sports car racing throughout the world was greatly altered. Both the
World Sportscar Championship
and
All Japan Sports Prototype Championship
would be cancelled, leaving Mazda's expensive
MXR-01
nowhere to race. At the same time, IMSA announced plans to abandon the GTP category after the 1993 season, turning instead to a new category of open-cockpit prototypes. This meant that Mazda would only have one more year to be able to use the RX-792P in North America only before they would have to construct an all new car.
This problem, mixed with the economic troubles of Mazda at the time, lead to the company cancelling the entire RX-792P project. Mazda would instead return to running their RX-7s in the production-based categories of IMSA. However the R26B 4-rotor that had been used in the RX-792P would continue to be used as the GTO class was altered to allow for more custom-built elements.

The
Mazda RX-7
is a
sports car
produced by the Japanese automaker
Mazda
from 1978 to 2002. The original RX-7 featured a twin-rotor
Wankel rotary engine
and a sporty
front-midship ,
rear-wheel drive
layout. The RX-7 was a direct replacement for the
RX-3
(both were sold in Japan as the Savanna) and subsequently replaced all other Mazda rotary cars with the exception of the
Cosmo .
The original RX-7 was a
sports coupé . The compact and light-weight
Wankel engine
or rotary engine is situated slightly behind the front
axle , a configuraton marketed by Mazda as "front mid-engine". It was offered in
America
as a two-seat coupé, with optional "occasional" rear-seats in
Japan ,
Australia , and other parts of the world.
The RX-7 made
Car and Driver

( GSL-SE )
1983 Mazda RX-7
Series 1 (1979–1980) is commonly referred to as the "SA22C" from the first alphanumerics of the
vehicle identification number . This series of RX-7 had exposed steel bumpers and a high-mounted indentation-located license plate, called by Werner Buhrer of
Road & Track
magazine a "Baroque depression."
In 1980 Mazda released 3000 special models known as the LS (Leather Sport). This package added an LS badge, full leather upholstery, sunroof, and gold-colored alloys. This model was only available in three different colors Aura White (1250 made), Brilliant Black (1250 made) and Solar Gold (500 made).
Series 2 (1981–1983) had integrated plastic-covered bumpers, wide black rubber body side moldings, wraparound taillights and updated engine control components. The GSL package provided optional 4-wheel disc brakes, front ventilated (Australian model) and clutch-type rear
limited slip differential
(LSD). Known as the "FB" in North America after the
US Department of Transportation
mandated 17 digit Vehicle Identification Number changeover. Elsewhere in the world, the 1981-1985 RX-7 retained the 'SA22C' VIN prefix. As a result, enthusiasts outside North America never picked up the "FB" nickname. The license-plate surround looks much like Buhrer's "Styling Impressions."
Series 3 (1984–1985) featured an updated lower front fascia. North American models received a different instrument cluster (the NA S3 RX-7 is the only rotary-engined car to not have a centrally mounted tachometer). GSL package was continued into this series, but Mazda introduced the GSL-SE sub-model. The GSL-SE had a
fuel injected
1.3 L
13B RE-EGI
engine producing 135 hp (101 kW) and 135 lb·ft (183 N·m). GSL-SEs had much the same options as the GSL (clutch-type rear LSD and rear disc brakes), but the brake rotors were larger, allowing Mazda to use the more common lug nuts (versus bolts), and a new bolt pattern of 4x114.3 (4x4.5"). Also, they had upgraded suspension with stiffer springs and shocks. The external air-oil
oil cooler
was reintroduced, after being dropped in the 1983 model-year for the controversial "beehive" water-oil heat exchanger.
The 1984 RX-7 G has an estimated 29 highway miles per gallon (8.11 litres per 100km) /19 estimated city miles per gallon (12.37 l/100km). According to Mazda, its rotary engine, licensed by NSU-Wankel allowed the RX-7 G to accelerate from 0 to 50 (80 km/h) in 6.3 seconds.
Kelley Blue Book , in its January-February 1984 issue, noted that a 1981 RX-7 G retained 93.4% of its original sticker price.
The handling and
acceleration
of the car were noted to be of a high caliber for its day. This generation RX-7 had "live axle"
4-link
rear
suspension
with
Watt's linkage , a
50/50 weight ratio , and weighed under 2600
lb
(1180
kg ). It was the lightest generation of RX-7 ever produced.
12A -powered models accelerated from 0–60 mph in 9.2 s, and turned 0.779 g
(7.64 m/s²) laterally on a skidpad. The
12A
engine produced 100 hp (75 kW) at 6000 rpm, allowing the car to reach speeds of over 120
mph
(190
km/h ). Because of the smoothness inherent in the
Wankel rotary engine , little vibration or harshness was experienced at high rpm, so a buzzer was fitted to the
tachometer
to warn the driver when the 7000
rpm
redline was approaching .
The 12A engine has a long thin shaped combustion chamber, there is a large surface area in relation to its volume. So combustion is cool, giving few oxides of nitrogen. However, the combustion is also incomplete, so there are large amounts of partly burned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The exhaust is hot enough for combustion of these to continue into the exhaust. An engine driven pump supplies air into the exhaust to complete the burn of these chemicals. This is done in the "thermal reactor", chamber where the exhaust manifold would normally be on a conventional engine. Under certain conditions the pump injects air into the thermal reactor and at other times air is pumped through injectors into the exhaust ports. This fresh air is needed for more efficient and cleaner burning of the air/fuel mixture.
Options and models varied from country to country. The gauge layout and interior styling in the Series 3 was only changed for
North American
versions. Additionally, North America was the only market to have offered the first generation RX-7 with the fuel injected
13B . A
turbocharged
(but non- intercooled )
12A
engine was available for the top-end model of Series 3 in Japan.
Sales were strong, with a total of 474,565 first generation cars produced; 377,878 were sold in the United States alone. In 2004,
Sports Car International
named this car #7 on its list of
Top Sports Cars of the 1970s . In 1983, the RX-7 would appear on
Car and Driver
magazine's Ten Best list for the first time.

producing 146 hp (108 kW). An optional
turbocharged
model, known as the Turbo II in the American market, had 189 hp (135 kW).
Series 5 (1989–1992) featured updated styling and better engine management, as well as lighter rotors and a higher
compression ratio , 9.7:1 for the naturally aspirated model, and 9.0:1 for the turbo model. The Turbo II moniker was dropped, and the turbocharged model was simply dubbed Turbo. The naturally aspirated Series 5 FC made 160
hp
(119
kW ), while the Series 5 Turbo made 200 hp (147 kW).
The second generation RX-7 ("FC", VIN begins JM1FC3 or JMZFC1), still known as the "Savanna RX-7" in Japan, featured a complete restyling reminiscent of the
Porsche 928 . Mazda's stylists, lead by Chief Project Engineer Akio Uchiyama, actually focused more on the Porsche 944 for their inspiration in designing the FC because the new car was being styled primarily for the American market, where the majority of first generation RX-7's had been sold. This strategy was chosen after Uchiyama and others on the design team spent time in the United States studying owners of earlier RX-7's and other sports cars popular in the American market. The
Porsche 944
was selling particularly well at the time and provided clues as to what sports-car enthusiasts might find compelling in future RX-7 styling and equipment. While the SA22/FB was a purer sports car, the FC tended toward the softer sport-tourer trends of its day. Handling was much improved, with less of the
oversteer
tendencies of the FB. Steering was more precise, with
rack and pinion
steering
replacing the old
recirculating ball
steering of the FB.
Disc brakes
also became standard, with some models (S4: GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS)in the 2nd generation RX-7. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. Mazda also introduced Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The system changed damping characteristics according to the road and driving conditions. The system compensated for camber changes and provided anti-dive and anti-squat effects.
Though about 80 lb (36 kg) heavier and more isolated than its predecessor, the FC continued to win accolades from the press. The FC RX-7 was
Motor Trend ' s
Import Car of the Year
for 1986, and the Turbo II was on
Car and Driver
magazine's Ten Best list for a second time in 1987.
In the Japanese market, only the turbo engine was available; the naturally-aspirated version was allowed only as an export. This can be attributed to insurance companies penalizing turbo cars (thus restricting potential sales). This emphasis on containing horsepower and placating insurance companies to make RX-7's more affordable seems ironic in retrospect. Shortly after the discontinuance of the second generation RX-7's in 1991, an outright horsepower "arms race" broke out between sports car manufacturers, with higher and higher levels of horsepower required to meet buyer demands.
Mazda sold 86,000 RX7's in the US alone in 1986, its first model year, with sales peaking in 1988.
Australian Motors Mazda released a limited run of 250 'Sports' model Series 4 RX-7's; each with no power steering, power windows or rear wiper as an attempt to reduce the weight of the car.
Convertible
Mazda introduced a convertible version of the RX7 in 1988 with normally aspirated and turbocharged engines — introduced to the US market with ads featuring Hollywood actor
James Garner , at the time featured in many of Mazda's television advertising.
The convertible featured a removable rigid section over the passengers and a folding textile rear section with heatable rear glass window. Power operated, lowering the top required unlatching two header catches, power lower the top halfway, exiting the car, folding down the rigid section manually, and then further power-lowering the top. Mazda introduced with the convertible the first integral
windblocker , a rigid panel that folded up from behind the passenger seats to block unwanted drafts from reaching the passengers — thereby extending the driving season for the car in open mode. The convertible also featured optional headrest mounted audio speakers and a folding vinyl snap-fastened
tonneau cover . The convertible assembly was precisely engineered and manufactured, and dropped into the ready body assembly as a complete unit — a first in convertible production.
Several leading car magazines at the time also selected the convertible as the best rag-top available on the market . Mazda exported approximately five thousand convertibles to the United States in 1988 and fewer in each of the next three model years, although it is difficult to confirm these figures, as Mazda USA did not keep RX-7 import records by model type. Production ceasing in October 1991 after Mazda marketed a limited run of 500 example for 1992 for the domestic market only. In Japan, the United Kingdom, and other regions outside the US, a turbocharged version of the convertible was available.

Series 6 (1992–1995) was exported throughout the world and had the highest sales. In Japan, Mazda sold the RX-7 through its
Efini
brand as the
Efini RX-7.
Only the 1993–1995 model years were sold in the
U.S . and
Canada . Series 6 came with 255 PS (188 kW/252 hp) and 294 N·m (217 lb·ft). In the UK only 124 examples of this model were sold through the official Mazda network, Only one spec. was available and this included twin oil-coolers, electric sunroof, cruise control and the rear storage bins in place of the back seats.
Series 7 (1996–1998) included minor changes to the car. Updates included a simplified vacuum routing manifold and a 16-bit ECU allowing for increased boost which netted an extra 10 PS (7 kW). In Japan, the Series 7 RX-7 was marketed under the Mazda brand name. The Series 7 was also sold in
Australia ,
New Zealand
and the
UK . Series 7 RX-7s were produced only in right-hand-drive configuration.
Series 8 (January 1999– August 2002) was the final series, and was only available in the Japanese market. More efficient turbochargers were installed, while improved intercooling and radiator cooling was made possible by a revised frontal area. The seats, steering wheel, and front and rear lights were all changed. The rear spoiler was modified and gained adjustability. The top-of-the-line " Type RS " came equipped with a Bilstein suspension and 17" wheels as standard equipment, and reduced weight to 1280 kg (2822 lb). Power was 280 PS (206 kW/276 hp), with 313.8 N·m (231 lb·ft) of torque as per the maximum Japanese limit. The
Type RZ
version included all the features of the Type RS, but at a lighter weight (at 1270 kg). It also featured custom gun-metal colored BBS wheels and a custom red racing themed interior. Further upgrades included a new 16-bit ECU and ABS system upgrades. The improved
ABS
system worked by braking differently on each wheel, allowing the car better turning during braking. The effective result made for safer driving for the average buyer. Easily the most collectible of all the RX-7s was the last 1,500 run-out specials. Dubbed the " Spirit R ", they combined all the "extra" features Mazda had used on previous limited-run specials. They still command amazing prices on the Japanese used car scene years later.
- There are three kinds of "Spirit R": the "Type A", "Type B", and "Type C". The "Type A" has a 5-speed manual transmission, and is said to have the best performance of the three models. The "Type B" has a 2+2 seat configuration and also sports a 5-speed manual transmission. The "Type C" is also a 2+2, but has a 4-speed automatic transmission. Clarification of the build number breakdown for each type is sought as Mazda hasn't publicly published the production figures.
There is also a "Touring Model" which includes a
sun roof , and Bose stereo system. Compared to the R1 and R2 which both don't have a
moon roof , and they have an extra front oil cooler in the front bumper, and other race modification equipment
The third and final generation of the RX-7,
FD
(with FD3S for the JDM and JM1FD for the USA VIN), was an outright, no-compromise sports car by Japanese standards. It featured an aerodynamic, futuristic-looking body design (a testament to its near 11-year lifespan). The 13B-REW was the first-ever mass-produced
sequential twin-turbocharger
system to export from Japan, boosting power to 255 PS (188 kW/252 hp) in 1993 and finally 280 PS (206 kW/276 hp) by the time production ended in Japan in 2002.
The FD RX-7 was
Motor Trend 's Import\Domestic Car of the Year. When
Playboy
magazine first reviewed the FD RX-7 in 1993, they tested it in the same issue as the [then] new
Dodge Viper . In that issue, Playboy declared the RX-7 to be the better of the two cars. It went on to win
Playboy 's Car of the Year for 1993. The FD RX-7 also made
Car and Driver
magazine's Ten Best list for 1993 through 1995, for every year in which it was sold state-side. June, 2007 Road&Track magazine proclaimed "The ace in Mazda's sleeve is the RX-7, a car once touted as the purest, most exhilarating sports car in the world.
The sequential twin turbocharged system was a very complex piece of engineering, developed with the aid of
Hitachi
and previously used on the domestic
Cosmo
series (JC Cosmo=90–95). The system was composed of two small turbochargers, one to provide torque at low RPM. The 2nd unit was on standby until the upper half of the rpm range during full throttle acceleration. The first turbocharger provided 10 psi (69 kPa) of boost from 1800 rpm, and the 2nd turbocharger was activated at 4000 rpm and also provided 10 psi. The changeover process, between 3500 rpm and 4000 rpm, provided 8 psi (55 kPa), was incredibly smooth, and provided linear acceleration and a very wide torque curve throughout the entire rev range.
Handling in the FD was regarded as world-class, and it is still regarded as being one of the finest handling and best balanced cars of all time. The continued use of the front-midship engine and drivetrain layout, combined with an 50:50 front-rear weight distribution ratio and low center of gravity made the FD a very competent car at the limits.
In North America, three models were offered; the "base", the touring, and the R models. The touring FD had a sunroof,
leather seats , and a complex
Bose
Acoustic Wave system. The R (R1 in 1993 and R2 in 1994–95) models featured stiffer suspensions, an
aerodynamics
package, suede seats, and Z-rated
tires .
Australia had a special high performance version of the RX-7 in 1995, dubbed the
RX-7 SP . This model was developed as a
homologated
road-going version of the factory race cars used in the 12hr endurance races held at
Bathurst, New South Wales , beginning in 1991 for the 1995 event held at Eastern Creek, Sydney, New South Wales. An initial run of 25 were made, and later an extra 10 were built by Mazda due to demand. The RX-7 SP produced 204 kW (274 hp) and 357 N·m (263 lb·ft) of torque, compared to the 176 kW (236 hp) and 294 N·m (217 lb·ft) of the standard version. Other changes included a race developed carbon fibre nose cone and rear spoiler, a carbon fibre 120 L fuel tank (as opposed to the 76 L tank in the standard car), a 4.3:1-ratio rear differential, 17 in diameter wheels, larger brake rotors and calipers. An improved intercooler, exhaust, and modified
ECU
were also included. Weight was reduced significantly with the aid of further carbon fibre usage including lightweight vented bonnet and Recaro seats to reduce weight to just 1218 kg (from 1310 kg). It was a serious road going race car that matched their rival
Porsche 911
RS CS for the final year Mazda officially entered. The formula paid off when the RX-7 SP won the title, giving Mazda the winning 12hr trophy for a fourth straight year. A later special version, the
Bathurst R , was released in 2001 to commemorate this, in Japan only.
In the United Kingdom, for 1992, customers were offered only one version of the FD which was based on a combination of the US touring and base model. For the following year, in a bid to speed up sales, Mazda reduced the price of the RX-7 to £25,000, down from £32,000 and refunded the difference to those who bought the car before that was announced. The FD continued to be imported to the UK till 1995. In 1998, for a car that had suffered from slow sales when it was officially sold, with as surge of interest following its appearances in videogames such as
Gran Turismo
and the benefit of a newly introduced
SVA
scheme, which meant an influx of inexpensive Japanese imported cars, the FD would become so popular that there were more parallel and grey imported models brought into the country than Mazda UK had ever imported.

Motorsport
Racing versions of the first-generation RX-7 were entered at the prestigious
24 hours of Le Mans
endurance race. The first outing for the car, equipped with a
13B
engine, failed by less than one second to qualify in 1979. The next year, a
12A -engine car not only qualified, it placed 21st overall. That same car did not finish in 1981, along with two more 13B cars. Those two cars were back for 1982, with one 14th place finish and another DNF. The RX-7 Le Mans effort was replaced by the
717C
prototype for 1983. In 1991, Mazda became the first Japanese manufacturer to win the 24 hours of Le Mans. The car was a 4-rotor prototype class car, the
787B . The FIA outlawed rotary engines shortly after this win. To this day the rotary powered Mazda is the only Japanese manufacturer to have ever won the prestigious 24 hour Le Mans race outright.
Mazda began racing RX-7s in the
IMSA
GTU
series in 1979. That first year, RX-7s placed first and second at the
24 Hours of Daytona , and claimed the GTU series championship. The car continued winning, claiming the GTU championship seven years in a row. The RX-7 took the
GTO
championship ten years in a row from 1982. The RX-7 has won more IMSA races than any other car model.
The RX-7 also fared well at the
Spa 24 Hours
race. Three Savanna/RX-7s were entered in 1981 by
Tom Walkinshaw Racing . After hours of battling with several
BMW 530i
and
Ford Capri , the RX-7 driven by
Pierre Dieudonné
and
Tom Walkinshaw
won the event. Mazda had turned the tables on
BMW , who had beaten Mazda's
Familia Rotary
to the podium eleven years earlier at the same event. TWR's prepared RX-7s also won the
British Touring Car Championship
in 1980 and 1981, driven by
Win Percy .
Canadian/Australian touring car driver
Allan Moffat
was instrumental in bringing Mazda into the Australian touring car scene. Over a four year span beginning in 1981, Moffat took the Mazda RX-7 to victory in the 1983
Australian Touring Car Championship , as well as a trio of
Bathurst 1000
podiums, in 1981 (3rd with
Derek Bell ), 1983 (second with
Yoshimi Katayama ) and 1984 (third with former motorcycle champion
Gregg Hansford ). Australia's adoption of international
Group A
regulations, combined with Mazda's reluctance to homologate a Group A RX-7, ended Mazda's active participation in the touring car series at the end of the 1984 season.
The RX-7 even made an appearance in the
World Rally Championship . The car finished 11th on its debut at the
RAC Rally
in
Wales
in 1981.
Group B
received much of the focus for the first part of the 1980s, but Mazda did manage to place third at the 1985
Acropolis Rally , and the
Familia 4WD
claimed the victory at
Swedish Rally
in both 1987 and 1989.
The RX-7 is considered as a popular choice in import drag racing, during the late nineties toward 2004
Abel Ibarra
raced a spaceframe FD which averaged no less than high 6 seconds passes, until he replaced it with a spaceframe RX-8, the FD was later to shipped and sold to an Australian.
The FC and FD is considered a popular choice for
drifting
contests, given the long wheelbase and an average of 450 bhp (336 kW).
Youichi Imamura
won the
D1 Grand Prix
title in
2003
and
Masao Suenaga
narrowly lost his in
2005 , both in FDs.
The RX-7 is a popular choice among
autocross
drivers.
In Japan, the RX-7 has always been a popular choice in domestic events, competing in
Group 5
based
Formula Silhouette
to its modern day incarnation, the
Super GT
series from when the Japan Sport Sedan series would become the GT300 category which it had been competing in. Its patience would pay off as in 2006,
RE Amemiya
Racing Asparadrink FD3S won the GT300 class championship.
In New Zealand a large and growing motorsport class called
Mazda Pro7 Racing
makes use of the series 1, 4 and 6 RX-7s for one make circuit racing. They run an average of 8 x 2 day meetings a season and racing can see up to 30 RX-7s on the track at any one time.
Notes
Recently, Mazda has revived the rotary engine in the form of the
RX-8 . It produces approximately 232 hp (173 kW) naturally aspirated, while the Japanese market version also produces around 232 hp (173 kW).
It's also been said by Automobile Magazine that a new generation of RX-7s will be returning in
2011.
Popular culture appearances
Ever since its debut on
Full Throttle
in 1987,
the RX-7 has appeared on numerous motoring-based
video games
and other popular media appearances, most notably on games such as Road & Track Presents: The Need for Speed, Kaido Racer I & II ( Tokyo Xtreme Racer ),
Enthusia Professional Racing ,
The Fast and the Furious
movie and its sequels [2] ,
Initial D
(in the
anime
,videogame and Movie), the
Forza Motorsport
series, the
Gran Turismo
series,
Need for Speed: Underground
and its sequels,
Project Gotham Racing 2 , as well being the first appearance of the SA22 on
Sega GT 2002
and on the cover of
Auto Modellista
and the PS2 version of
Battle Gear 3 .
In
Initial D , the Takahashi brothers both drive RX-7s, hence their other moniker,
The Rotary Brothers.
The older brother Ryosuke drives a white FC, and the younger brother Keisuke drives a yellow twin-turbo FD. There was another character, Kyoko Iwase, who drove a single-turbo FD.
The RX-7 FB was also featured in the
tokusatsu
show
Uchuu Keiji Shaider , as Annie's yellow-colored civilian patrol vehicle.
Another appearance in popular culture is the inclusion of the RX-7 as a
Transformer . Unlike the RX-8 however, the character is very obscure, being the toy-only
Autobot
known as
Camshaft , an ironic choice of name considering the RX-7 has no camshafts. It was part of a group of three Autobots called the
Omnibots . The toys were only ever available in the West as mail away premiums. Camshaft's team mates were
Overdrive
and
Downshift . An early version of "Zoom-Zoom", a replicant of the Autobot
Jazz , was used to launch the Mazda RX-8.
