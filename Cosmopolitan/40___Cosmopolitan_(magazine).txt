Elie Tahari
Elie Tahari
is a designer of woman's clothing. He has evolved a $500 million business, with a presence on five continents, in more than 600 US stores and in five free-standing boutiques.
Tahari grew up in an Israeli orphanage and immigrated to the United States in the 1970s with little money. After his arrival in New York, he was desperate for work and went from showroom to showroom in looking for employment. Things turned around for him when he learned about retail. His position selling clothing from a boutique was an introduction to his first love – designing women’s fashion. Tahari’s determination to learn and his auspicious attraction to New York’s famed
club scene , inspired the designs that propelled him into the ‘who’s who’ of fashion.
Elie Tahari survived the
‘70s
and stayed focused on fashion. His designs were so well received, he was one of the first
fashion designers
who opened a boutique on
Madison Avenue
in 1974.
Parlaying his keen ability to predict what a woman wants from fashion before she even knows it, he turned his attentions in the
80’s
to the tailored suit — a design effort that redefined a decade. Today, Elie Tahari continues to empower women with designs inspired by his belief that smart women can look sexy.
Even with these accomplishments, Elie Tahari felt something was missing. Just after he blew out the candles on his 46th birthday he met his wife. In his own words, “Rory is my greatest love, and therefore, my greatest inspiration.” In a truly collaborative effort, this unique husband-wife team has tripled the size of the company in the last five years, injecting the brand with new meaning and vigor with the launch of the Elie Tahari Collection.
Women have been drawn to Elie Tahari designs for over three decades, and this devoted following continues to revel in the feminine embellishments, sensual fabrics, and subtle textures that have come to define the Elie Tahari collection.
In the United States, Tahari has boutiques in
New York ,
Boston ,
East Hampton ,
Atlanta , and
Las Vegas . In the 2007 movie
Enchanted , two characters are shown shopping at Tahari's New York City store. New York fashion mogul Elie Tahari, is one of the many very successful individuals in the world hailing from an Iranian Jewish heritage. Even though he was born in Israel and came to New York 35 years ago without a penny to his name, Tahari now 55, commands a $500-million sportswear empire. In a recent
interview
with the online fashion magazine,
Portfolio.com
he revealed the reasoning behind his family leaving Iran in the 1950's after the late Shah of Iran was temporarily deposed.

Adrian Pasdar
Adrian Pasdar
was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, but at the age of 2, his father , His father, Homayoun Pasdar, was a cardiac surgeon who was born in Iran and moved to the United States, working as a surgeon near Philadelphia. His mother, Rosemarie Sbresny, was born in Königsberg, Germany, and worked as a nurse before becoming an English teacher in France. In high school, he excelled at football, eventually leading to a football scholarship at the University of Florida in 1983. Football may have been a promising future, had it not been for a terrible accident during his freshman year that left his face scarred and his legs badly injured. A very driven Adrian finished his freshman year in a wheelchair, doing intensive physical therapy and turning his attention to campus stage productions and redicovering a childhood interest in writing and acting. No longer able to play football, he dropped out of school and returned home, taking a job with a theater group People's Light and Theatre Company. Here he worked on sound and lighting and also did set construction. One day, while constructing a set, he cut off the end of his left thumb. Adrian, having the ability to turn tragedy into triumph, used his medical compensation to pay for attendance at the famous "Lee Strasberg Theater Institute". At the age of 19, he auditioned for a role in
Top Gun
(1986). Director
Tony Scott
was so impressed that he wrote the part of "Chipper" just for him. This led to bigger roles in
Solarbabies
(1986),
Streets of Gold
(1986), and
Kathryn Bigelow 's 1987 cult vampire movie
Near Dark
(1987), with Adrian in the lead role of Caleb Colton. Other major roles include
Vital Signs
(1990). Adrian has always been an actor ahead of his time, opting for roles in independent and cable movies long before they were considered fashionable for feature actors to do. In 1992, feeling completely out-of-touch with reality, Adrian left Hollywood and returned to New York. He worked as a cashier for room and board, while taking the occasional small part, such as Frankie in 'Brian De Palma''s
Carlito's Way
(1993). Another major break came in 1995, when Adrian was cast as the title character on the short-lived Fox series _Profit (1996)_. He continues to act in supporting roles and has now added directing to his already impressive body of work. He wrote and directed the short film Beyond Belief and also directed a feature film
Cement
(1999).

Marjan Satrapi
Satrapi grew up in
Tehran
in a communist family who was involved with the
communist
and
socialist
movements in Iran, prior to the Islamic
Iranian Revolution . She attended the Lycée Français there and witnessed, as a child, the growing oppression of civil liberties and the everyday-life consequences of Iranian politics, including the
fall of the Shah , the early regime of
Ayatollah Khomeini , and the first years of the
Iran-Iraq war .
Satrapi is a great-granddaughter of
Nasser al-Din Shah ,
Shah of Persia
from 1848 until 1896. However, Satrapi points out that "the kings of the
Qajar
dynasty...had hundreds of wives. They made thousands of kids. If you multiply these kids by generation you have, I don't know, ten to fifteen thousand princes and princesses. There's nothing extremely special about that." [4]
In 1983, at the age of 14, Satrapi was sent to
Vienna ,
Austria , by her parents in order to flee the Iranian regime. According to her autobiographical graphic novel,
Persepolis , she lived there during her high school years, returning to Iran for college. At college, she met a man named Reza, whom she married at age 21 and divorced roughly a year later. She then studied Visual Communication, eventually obtaining a Master's Degree in Visual Communication from the School of
Fine Arts
in
Tehran
Azad University . Satrapi then moved to
Strasbourg , France. She currently lives in
Paris , where she works as an illustrator and an author of children's books.
Satrapi's career began in earnest when she met
David B. , a French
comics
artist. She adopted a style similar to his, especially in her earliest works. Satrapi became famous worldwide because of her critically acclaimed autobiographical graphic novels
Persepolis
and
Persepolis 2 , which describe her childhood in Iran and her adolescence in
Europe .
Persepolis
won the
Angoulême Coup de Coeur
Award
at the
Angoulême International Comics Festival . Her later publication,
Broderies
( Embroideries ) was also nominated for the Angoulême Album of the Year award in 2003, an award which was won by her most recent novel,
Poulet aux prunes . [5] [6]
She has also contributed to the
Op-Ed
section of
The New York Times . [7]
Persepolis
was adapted into an
animated film
of the same name , which debuted at the
Cannes Film Festival
in May 2007 and shared a Special Jury Prize with
Still Light
(Luz silenciosa) by Carlos Reygadas. Co-written and co-directed by Satrapi and
Vincent Paronnaud , the French-language picture stars the voices of
Chiara Mastroianni ,
Catherine Deneuve ,
Danielle Darrieux , and
Simon Abkarian . The English version, starring the the voices of
Gena Rowlands ,
Sean Penn , and
Iggy Pop , was nominated for an
Academy Award
for
Best Animated Feature
in January 2008.

Shohreh Aghadashloo
Shohreh Aghdashloo was born in Tehran Iran on May 11 1952. In the 1970s at age 20 she achieved nationwide stardom in her homeland Iran starring in some prominent pictures such as "The Report" directed by the renowed Abbass Kiarostami which won critics
award s at the Moscow Film Festival. In 1978 she won wider acclaim and established herself as one of Iran's leading ladies with "Sooteh Delan" (Broken Hearts) directed by the late Ali Hatami. During the 1978 Islamic revolution, Aghdashloo left Iran for England, completing her education. Her interest in politics and her concern for social injustice in the world, led her to earn a B.A. degree in International Relations. She continued to pursue her acting career, which eventually brought her to Los Angeles in 1987. She went on to marry actor/playwright Houshang Touzie, performing in a number of his plays, successfully taking them to national and international stages. However it was not easy getting work in Hollywood as a middle eastern actress with an accent, she had roles in some decent though not great films including "Twenty Bucks" "Surviving Paradise" and "Maryam". She had to wait quite some time to get a "Hollywood" break. And finally, years after having read the acclaimed novel "House of sand and fog", Dreamworks were in the making of bringing the story to the big screen. After having cast Ben Kingsley as Massoud Amir Behrani and Jennifer Connelly in the lead roles, they were looking for a relatively unknown Iranian actress to play Kingsley's wife, Nadi. Shohreh Aghdashloo was duly cast. She stole the limelight and earned herself an Academy
award
nomination as best supporting actress amongst many other prestigious
award s, including the Independent spirit
award
as best supporting actress in a feature film, The New York and Los Angeles film critics
award
and others.

Andre Agassi
Andre was born on April 29, 1970, to Mike and Betty Agassi. His father, a former boxing champ and Olympian from Iran, settled in Las Vegas taking work as a tennis instructor. And as soon as little Andre could walk, Mike taped a racket to his son's hand and hung a tennis ball over his crib. ''He was convinced that if my eyes are going to move around as a little baby, I might as well be looking at a tennis ball,'' says Andrew. By the age of 10, Andre was beating fellow up-and-coming US players including Pete Sampras, Jim Courier and Michael Chang. Aged 13, he'd simply learned all he could from his dad. Mike shipped his son off to legendary coach Nick Bollettieri's famed tennis boot camp in Bradenton, Florida. But Andre didn't take to the rigors of the tennis academy and began to rebel, growing out his hair and even wearing denim jeans to tournaments. In 1986 he left the training camp, but retained Nick as his coach, turning pro aged just 16. And he never looked back. ''I always planned on being a professional, and I figured I might as well just get out there and do it,'' says Andre. His bad boy image proved popular with both corporate sponsors and the ladies. Millions of dollars worth of endorsement deals rolled in and he was seen on the arm of a bevy of women, including Barbra Streisand. In 1992, he jetted off to Wimbledon at the last minute after nearly deciding to skip the All England lawn event entirely. Smart move. He shocked even himself, defeating Goran Ivanisevic in the finals and claiming his first major title. When his relationship with Nick soured, Andre turned to fellow American and pro Brad Gilbert to coach him and over the next couple of years he claimed two Grand Slam trophies and an Olympic gold medal. In 1993 he started dating Suddenly Susan star Brooke Shields and the two eventually married in California on April 19, 1997. ''I was playing a lot of golf, going out a lot, enjoying Brooke's world,'' says Andre. ''It was awesome...It was nice not to have the responsibility I've known since I was a child.'' However, the charms of Hollywood soon wore thin and the couple divorced amicably just ten days shy of their two-year wedding anniversary. ''Love is not enough for a marriage to work,'' he says. Realising he missed playing competitive tennis, Andre started on a much-chronicled weight training programme and diet and began training with a purpose. With his 1999 win at the French Open he became the first man since Rod Laver in the Sixties to win all four grand slam events in his career and the only player besides German tennis star Steffi Graf to win all four plus an Olympic gold medal for singles. Fittingly, he and Steffi soon began dating - and two years later the couple announced they were expecting their first child. ''He's always tried to walk this balance between his life and his tennis, and here's someone that supports both,'' says Perry Rogers, Andre's manager. ''So there is this complete balance. It just funnels right down together.'' The high-profile pair wed on October 22, 2001, in a private ceremony in Las Vegas. Steffi gave birth to a baby boy, Jaden Gil, just four days later. In October 2003 the happy couple announced the birth of their second child, a girl whom they have called Jaz Elle.
