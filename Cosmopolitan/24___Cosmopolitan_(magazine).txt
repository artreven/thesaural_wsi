Romain de Tirtoff
(( Erté) November
23, 1892 – April 21, 1990) was born
Russian -in
Saint
Petersburg , to a distinguished family
with roots tracing back to 1548. His father, Pyotr Ivanovich Tyrtov,
served as an admiral in the
Russian Fleet .
As
French
artist
and designer known by the
pseudonym
Erté ,
the
French
pronunciation of his initials,
R.T.
He was a diversely-talented 20th century artist and designer who
flourished in an array of fields, including
fashion ,
jewelry ,
graphic
arts ,
costume / setdesign
(film, theatre, opera) and
interior decor .
In 1910–12, Romain moved to Paris, France,
to pursue a career as a designer. He made this decision over strong
objections from his father, who wanted Romain to continue the family
tradition and become a naval officer. Romain assumed his pseudonym to
avoid disgracing the family. In 1915, he secured his first substantial
contract with
Harper's Bazaar
magazine, and thus
launched an illustrious career that included designing costumes and
stage sets. Ultimately between 1915–1937, Erte designed over 200
covers for
Harper's
Bazaar , and his illustrations would
also appear in such publications as
Illustrated London News ,
Cosmopolitan ,
Ladies' Home Journal ,
and
Vogue .
