Who is Theodore
Roosevelt Lilly III?
Theodore Roosevelt Lilly III ? The
Major League major league Baseball world   knows him by
Ted Lilly , he was
starting pitcher
for the
Chicago
Cubs . He bats and throws
left-handed . Lilly attended
Yosemite High School
in
Oakhurst, California , and
Fresno City College .
Professional career   Early years Lilly was born January 4, 1976, in
Lomita, California . He broke into the majors with the
Montreal Expos
in 1999, pitching in only nine games that year
before being traded to the
New York Yankees
as part of a trade involving
Hideki
Irabu .
Lilly played for more than two years for the Yankees before being dealt
to the
Oakland Athletics
in a three team deal
that included pitchers
Jeff
Weaver
heading to New York and
Jeremy Bonderman
going to the
Detroit Tigers . Lilly was in the starting rotation for
Oakland, and pitched in the American League Division Series in both 2002
and 2003.
2004 season Lilly was traded from the Athletics to the Blue Jays for
Bobby
Kielty .
He made the
American League All-Star
team in 2004 as the Jays' lone representative that year.
The highlight of his career as a Blue Jay was a start on August 23,
2004 against the
Boston Red Sox . He pitched a complete-game
shutout and struck out 13 batters in a three-hit 3–0 victory.
2006 season Lilly was 15–13 with a 4.31 ERA and 160 strikeouts in 2006, exceeding
his previous career-high for wins (12). He also equaled a career high
for starts (32) and nearly matched his career highs in strikeouts and
innings pitched. This season, he ranked first among the Jays' pitching
staff in strikeouts and second only to
Roy
Halladay
in wins (Halladay had a 16–5 record before a recurring
elbow injury ended his season in late September).
On August 21, 2006, in a game against the
Oakland Athletics , Lilly was surrendering an early 8-0
lead in the 3rd inning when manager
John
Gibbons
took him out of the game. With the score 8-5 and runners on
1st and 3rd, Lilly refused to give him the ball. Eventually, he
reluctantly left the mound and later feuded with Gibbons in the locker
room, though Gibbons maintained no punches were thrown.
Lilly filed for free agency at the end of the 2006 season, and
alongside
Barry Zito ,
Jason
Schmidt
and
Jeff Suppan , was one of the most sought-after
free agent pitchers, partially due to the thin market for starting
pitching. On the morning of December 6, 2006, he informed the Blue Jays
that he would not be returning to the club, thus rejecting a four year,
$40 million deal. He cited a "change in scenery" as his reasoning. Later
on
that day, Lilly agreed to an identical four year, $40 million deal
with the Chicago Cubs, officially ending his tenure with the Blue Jays.
2007 season In his first start for the Cubs, Lilly defeated the Cincinnati Reds
in a strong outing, taking a no hitter into the fifth inning, and only
yielding one earned run over seven innings.
Lilly then was the starting pitcher for the Cubs home opening game at
Wrigley
Field
on April 9, 2007. Lilly gave up three runs in six innings,
but did not factor into the decision.
Lilly pitched well in April, lasting at least six innings in each of
his five starts while never giving up more than three runs in a game
posting a 2.18
ERA . Lilly was prominent in a contentious series in Atlanta between the
Cubs and the
Atlanta Braves . In game one of the series,
Alfonso Soriano
hit three home runs in his first three
at-bats as part of a Cubs 9-1 victory.
In the next game,
Tim Hudson
hit Soriano with a first-pitch
fastball triggering home-plate umpire
Tim
Tschida
to issue warnings to both teams.
On the final game of the series, Lilly hit
Edgar Rentería
in the first inning, and was promptly
thrown out of the ballgame by
Jim Wolf .
Lilly was not suspended for his actions in the game.
2009 World
Baseball Classic Lilly was the starting pitcher in two games for Team USA in the 2009
World Baseball Classic .
In the first game he faced Venezuela but was pulled after 36 pitches.
Manager
Davey Johnson
wanted to get work for starter
Jeremy Guthrie
and as many relievers as possible. Lilly
left with the United States trailing 1-0, thanks to the homer he served
up to his former Cubs batterymate,
Henry
Blanco .
His second start was against Puerto Rico, a game that Team USA would
win with a
David Wright
two-run single in the
bottom of the ninth. For his part Lilly gave up two home runs, the only
two hits he gave up in his 3 1/3 innings.
2009 Season As of September 2, Lilly was 10-8, had thrown 150.1 innings,
surrendered 133 hits and 29 walks for a 1.08 WHIP, with 123 strikeouts
and a 3.17 ERA. Opponent were hitting .238 off him. He had also been
named to his second all-star game, as the Cubs lone representative.
2010 season On June 13, 2010, Lilly took a
no-hitter
into the 9th against the
Chicago White Sox . In the ninth, he gave up a lead off
single to
Juan Pierre , then was lifted for relief pitcher
Carlos Mármol , who got the save, getting out of a bases
loaded jam, for a 1-0 Cub victory. This was the longest outing that
Lilly held a team hitless. The no-hitter would have been the first
pitched at
Wrigley Field
since
Milt
Pappas
in
1972 .

Who is David Seth Kotkin?
Who is
David Seth Kotkin ? The entertainment world know him as Illusionist
David Copperfield .
is a world-famous
American
illusionist , described by
Forbes
in
2006 as the most commercially successful
magician
in history.
Best known for his combination of storytelling and illusion,
Copperfield
has so far sold 40 million tickets and grossed over
$ 1
billion.
Early years Copperfield
was born  September
16, 1956 in
Metuchen, New Jersey ,
the son of Jewish parents, Rebecca, an insurance adjuster, and Hyman
Kotkin, who owned and operated a men's haberdashery in Metuchen called
Korby's.
Copperfield's mother was born in Jerusalem,
Palestine ,
formally known today as
Israel , while his paternal grandparents were Jewish
immigrants from Russia
(present-day
Ukraine ).
When Copperfield was 10, he began practicing magic as
"Davino the Boy
Magician" in his neighborhood,and at the age of 14, became the youngest person ever admitted to the
Society of American Magicians .Shy and a loner, the young Copperfield saw magic as a way of fitting in
and, later, as a way to get girls.
As a teenager, Copperfield became fascinated with Broadway and
frequently sneaked into shows, especially musicals featuring
Stephen Sondheim
or
Bob
Fosse .
By age 16, he was teaching a course in magic at
New York University .
Career and
business interests
David Copperfield signing his program after a performance. At age 18, he enrolled at
Fordham University , and was cast in the lead role of the
Chicago-based musical
The Magic Man
(written by Barbara D'Amato
and directed by Holland, MI's John Tammi) three weeks into his freshman
year,
adopting his new stage name "David Copperfield" from the
Charles Dickens
book of the same name . At age 19,
he was headlining at the
Pagoda Hotel
in
Honolulu, Hawaii .
Copperfield's career in television began in earnest when he was
discovered by Joseph Cates, a producer of
Broadway
shows and television specials.
Cates produced a magic special in 1977 on
ABC
called "The Magic of ABC"
hosted by Copperfield,
as well as several of the "The Magic of David Copperfield" specials on
CBS
between
1978 and 1998.
There have been
20 Copperfield TV
specialsbetween
1977 and 2001.
Copperfield played the character of "Ken the Magician" in the 1980
horror film
Terror Train .
He also made an uncredited
appearance in the 1994 film
Prêt-à-Porter .
Most of his media
appearances have been through television specials and guest spots on
television programs. His illusions have included making the Statue of
Liberty
disappear ,
flying ,
levitating over the
Grand Canyon , and walking through the
Great Wall of China .
In 1996, Copperfield joined forces with
Dean
Koontz ,
Joyce Carol Oates ,
Ray
Bradbury
and others for
David Copperfield’s Tales of the
Impossible ,c  an anthology of original fiction set in the world of
magic and illusion. A second volume was later published in 1997, called
David
Copperfield's Beyond Imagination . In addition
to the 2 books, David
also wrote an essay as part of the " This I Believe " series from
NPR
and the This I Believe, Inc.
Also during 1996, in collaboration with
Francis Ford Coppola ,
David
Ives , and
Eiko Ishioka ,Copperfield's Broadway show
"Dreams & Nightmares" broke box office records.
Copperfield notes that his role models were not magicians and that
"My idols were
Gene Kelly
and
Fred
Astaire
and
Orson Welles
and
Walt
Disney
... they took their individual art forms and they moved
people with them ... I wanted to do the same thing with magic. I wanted
to take magic and make it romantic and make it sexy and make it funny
and make it goofy ... all the different things that a songwriter gets to
express or a filmmaker gets to express ...."
On 7 May 2009, Copperfield was dropped by
Michael Jackson
from Jackson's residency at the
O2 Arena
after an alleged
row over money. Copperfield wanted $1 million (£666,000) per show.
Copperfield denied the reports of a row, saying "don't believe
everything you read.
News of Copperfield's collaboration with Jackson first surfaced on
April 1, 2009, and has since been reported by several websites as a
possible April Fool's prank.
In August 2009, Copperfield brought his show to Australia.
International
Museum and Library of the Conjuring Arts Copperfield owns the International Museum and Library of the
Conjuring Arts, which houses the world's largest
collection of historically significant magic memorabilia, books and
artifacts. Begun in 1991 when Copperfield purchased the Mullholland
Library of Conjuring and the Allied Arts, which contained the world's
largest collection of Houdini memorabilia,
the museum comprises 5,000 cubic feet and approximately 80,000 items of
magic memorabilia, including Houdini's Water Torture Cabinet and his
Metamorphosis Trunk, Orson Welles' Buzz Saw Illusion and
automata
created by
Robert-Houdin .
The museum is not open to the public; tours are reserved for
"colleagues, fellow magicians, and serious collectors".
Located in a warehouse at Copperfield's headquarters in
Las Vegas , the museum is entered
via a secret door in what was described by actor
Hugh
Jackman
as a "sex shop" and by
Forbes
as a "mail-order lingerie warehouse".
"'It doesn't need to be secret, it needs to be respected,' he said. 'If
a scholar or journalist needs a piece of magic history, it's there.'"
Musha Cay and the
Islands of Copperfield Bay In 2006 Copperfield bought eleven Bahamian islands called
Musha
Cay .
Rechristened "The Islands of Copperfield Bay,"
the islands are a private resort.
Guests have reportedly included
Oprah
Winfrey
and
John Travolta , and
Google
co-founder
Sergey Brin
was married there.
"Magic
Underground" restaurant David Copperfield's Magic Underground
was planned to be a
restaurant based on Copperfield's magic.There was a sign on
Hollywood Boulevard
during the late 90s indicating the
restaurant was coming soon. Signs were also located around
Pleasure Island
and signs outside
Disney-MGM Studios .
A Magic Underground restaurant was also going to open in New York's
Times Square.
Plans also included eventual expansion into Disneyland in Anaheim,
California, as well as Paris and Tokyo.
The restaurants were to have magic props and other items on the walls
of the restaurants while magicians would go around to tables doing
sleight of hand
tricks. There was also to be a larger stage
for larger stunts.
The restaurant in Times Square was 85 percent completed,
but, amid disputes between the creative team and the financial team,
and enormous cost overruns, finances dried up from the investors, so the
project was cancelled, and Disney cancelled the lease.
Copperfield was not an investor in the project; the investors
reportedly lost $34 million on the project, and subcontractors placed
$15 million in
liens .
Accidents and injuries On March 11, 1984, while rehearsing an illusion called "Escape from
Death" where he was shackled and handcuffed in a tank of water,
Copperfield became tangled in the chains and started taking in water and
banging into the sides of the tank.
He was pulled from the water after 1 minute 20 seconds,
hyperventilating
and in
shock , and taken to a
Burbank
hospital, and found to have pulled
tendons
in arms and legs. He was in a
wheelchair
for a week and used a cane for a period thereafter.
Doing a rope trick, Copperfield accidentally cut off the tip of his
finger with sharp scissors.
He was rushed to hospital and the fingertip was re-attached.
On December 17, 2008, during a live performance in Las Vegas, one of
Copperfield's assistants was sucked into the spinning blades of a
12 feet (3.7 m) high industrial fan that Copperfield walks through.
The assistant sustained multiple fractures to his arm, lacerations that
required stitching, and severe bleeding.
Copperfield canceled the rest of the performance and offered the
audience members refunds.
Litigation On July 11, 1994, Copperfield sued magician and author
Herbert L. Becker
in order to prevent publication of
Becker's book which reveals how magicians perform their illusions.
Becker won the law suit.
However, the book was published without exposing any of Copperfield's
secrets.
Because of a secrecy agreement Becker had signed with Copperfield, and
an independent finding that Becker's
description of Copperfield's
methods was inaccurate, the publisher removed the section on Copperfield
from the book before publication.
In 1997, Becker sued Copperfield and
Lifetime Books
for US$50
million for causing
breach of contract
between himself and
Lifetime Books ,
the publisher of his book
All the Secrets of Magic Revealed .
In 1997, Copperfield and
Claudia Schiffer
sued
Paris
Match
for US$30 million after the magazine claimed their
relationship was a stunt,
that Schiffer was paid for pretending to be Copperfield's fiancée and
that she didn't even like him.
In 1999, they won an undisclosed sum and a retraction from Paris Match.
Copperfield's publicist confirmed that while Schiffer had a contract to
appear in the audience at Copperfield's show in Berlin where they met,
she was not under contract to be his "consort".
On August 25, 2000 Copperfield unsuccessfully sued
Fireman's Fund Insurance
Company
for reimbursement of a $506,343 ransom paid to individuals
in Russia who had commandeered the entertainer's equipment there, in 2004, John Melk, co-founder of
Blockbuster Inc. , and previous owner of
Musha
Cay , sued Copperfield for
fraud
after
Copperfield's purchase of the island chain, alleging that Copperfield
had deliberately obscured his identity during the purchase and that he
would not have sold the island to Copperfield.
Copperfield claimed that Melk had agreed to sell the property to
Copperfield's
Imagine Nation Company , and that Copperfield
negotiated the deal through a third party because he feared Melk was
"seeking to exploit" Copperfield's celebrity status by demanding an
unrealistic price.
The case was settled in 2006. The terms of the settlement are
undisclosed.
On November 6, 2007,
Viva Art International Ltd
and
Maz
Concerts Inc.
sued Copperfield for nearly $2.2 million for
breach of contract
and the
Indonesian
promoter of David Copperfield's
canceled shows in
Jakarta
held on to $550,000 worth of Copperfield's
equipment in lieu of money paid to Copperfield that had not been
returned.
Copperfield countersued.
The dispute was resolved in July 2009.
Copperfield was accused of sexual assault in 2007 by Lacey L.
Carroll.
A
federal grand jury
in
Seattle
closed the investigation in January 2010 without bringing charges
against Copperfield.
In January 2010 the Bellevue City Prosecutor's Office brought
misdemeanor charges against Carroll for
prostitution
and allegedly making a false accusation of rape in another case.
Carroll filed a civil lawsuit against Copperfield,
which was dropped in April 2010.
Personal life Copperfield was engaged to
supermodel
Claudia Schiffer
for six years, but the couple separated
in 1999 citing work schedules.
In April 2006, Copperfield and two female assistants were robbed at
gunpoint after a performance in
West Palm Beach, Florida .
His assistants gave the robbers their money, passports and a cell
phone. According to his police statement, Copperfield did not hand over
anything, claiming that he used
sleight of hand
to hide his possessions.
One of Copperfield's assistants wrote down most of the license plate
number, and the suspects were later arrested, tried and sentenced.

Who is Miranda May Kerr?
Who is Miranda May Kerr ? The entertainment and  modeling world knows her as Miranda Kerr. Kerr is an Australian
model
best known as one of the
Victoria's Secret Angels
since mid-2007.
She is the first Australian to participate in the
Victoria's Secret
campaign, and also
represents Australian fashion chains
Portmans
and
David Jones Limited . Kerr began modeling
in the
fashion
industry
when she was 13, starting at Chaay's Modelling Agency, and
soon after winning a 1997 Australian nationwide model search hosted by
Dolly
magazine
and
Impulse
fragrances.
She is married to actor
Orlando
Bloom .
Early life and family Kerr was born 20 April 1983 in
Sydney , but raised in the small town of
Gunnedah, New South Wales .
Her
parents are Therese and John Kerr, and she has a younger brother
named Matthew. In an interview, Kerr stated she is of English, French
and Scottish descent.
Dolly
magazine At age 13, Kerr entered and won the 1997 annual
Dolly
Magazine/Impulse Model Competition. She was flown to Sydney a week
before her 14th birthday to shoot for the magazine. The
controversy raised concerns about the glorification of young girls
within the
fashion ,
beauty ,
and
entertainment
industries.
Some conservative media outlets claimed her
Dolly
shoot (including images of a
14-year-old Kerr in bathing suits) constituted a form of
child pornography . Of the press, Kerr said: "In the
media at the time they were trying to cling on to anything remotely to
do with paedophilia. Dolly is a magazine for teenage girls, not for old
men. And I was fully clothed! Doing a winter shoot! They just made
something out of nothing."
Kerr signed to Chic Management's
Sydney
division. She received considerable commercial exposure after a series
of beachwear ads predominantly for Australian surf chain
Billabong , in which Kerr modeled surf
brands
Tigerlily ,
Roxy ,
Billabong Girls , and One Teaspoon. This
increased her profile in the Australian and Asian markets, after which
Kerr relocated to
New York .
Career
Once in Paris, in 2003, Kerr signed with the Madison Agency. She did
an advertising campaign for Ober Jeans with photographer Erick
Seban-Meyer.
Once in New York, Kerr had a multitude of
runway
appearances and then signed with Next model agency
in early 2004. From there, she was booked for runway and print
campaigns for major labels, including
Alex
Perry ,
Ayyıldız ,
Baby
Phat ,
Lisa
Ho ,
Voodoo Dolls ,
Levi's ,
Bettina Liano ,
Nicola Finetti ,
L.A.M.B. ,
Heatherette ,
Betsey Johnson ,
Trelise Cooper , Jets,
John Richmond ,
Blumarine
Swimwear,
Neiman
Marcus ,
Seafolly
Swimwear ,
Anna Molinari ,
Rock and Republic , and
Roberto Cavalli .
She was also booked for print in magazines such as
Elle , Australian
Vogue
and
Harper's Bazaar , and was featured in television
advertisements for brands like
Portmans ,
Bonds , and
Veet .
In early 2006, Kerr appeared in the finale episode of the TV show
Project Runway , modeling clothes for contestant
Daniel Vosovic 's final collection. She was the first woman
to walk down the catwalk.
In 2006, Kerr broke into the United States market when she signed a
lucrative cosmetics contract with
Maybelline
New York . The campaign ran in a series of internationally sold
women's beauty magazines, including
Cosmopolitan ,
CLEO , and
Elle , and was eventually featured in
Victoria's Secret
catalogues.
Following her success with Maybelline,
Kerr became the first
Australian
model to be
offered a contract with
Victoria's Secret
in 2007, replacing
Gisele Bündchen . Upon her acceptance, the first ever
Australian
Victoria's Secret
Angel ,
joining the stable of models already signed to the lingerie giant,
including
Alessandra Ambrosio ,
Karolína Kurková ,
Adriana
Lima ,
Selita Ebanks ,
Izabel Goulart , and
Heidi
Klum . Before becoming an Angel in 2007, Kerr was already picked to
become the successor of Alessandra Ambrosio as the face of
PINK
in 2006. Kerr's popularity continued to
increase as one of the globally recognized Angels when she appeared in
the Victoria's Secret 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 televised runway shows,
which aired on four continents.
From this success, Kerr has been featured in
V Magazine ,
FHM , Dolly
Magazine,
Harper's Bazaar Australia
and Madison
Magazine.
By 2007, Kerr had signed on as the face of Californian fashion
retailer
Arden B.
After debuting in their
Spring and
Summer ad campaigns, Kerr returned for their Fall 2007 campaign, shot by
fashion photographer Diego Uchitel.
She has also become the new face of
Clinique
Happy and signed a lucrative six-figure deal to be the new face of
Australian department store
David Jones , replacing model
Megan
Gale .
In 2008, having earned an estimated $3.5 million in the past 12 months,
Forbes
placed Kerr tenth in the list of the world's top-earning models.
Kerr (along with several other Victoria's Secret and Next agency
models) was featured in a music video for the American
hip-hop
single
Number
One
by artists
Kanye West
and
Pharrell .
Following her modeling success with Victoria's Secret, Kerr made a
small guest appearance in the
CBS
sitcom
How I Met Your Mother
alongside fellow Angels:
Adriana
Lima ,
Marisa Miller ,
Alessandra Ambrosio ,
Heidi
Klum , and
Selita Ebanks .
Since 2009, Kerr has been featured on the cover of
Rolling Stone Australia magazine ,
Harper Bazaar Australia, CS magazine, Sunday Magazine, Tempo magazine
Turkey, Cosmopolitan magazine Spain and
GQ
Germany
magazine.
Kerr has also been featured in the
Pirelli Calendar
2010 and editorials for
XOXO
Spring/Summer 2009 collection,
V Magazine ,
Vogue
Japan, Russian
Vogue ,
Glamour magazine Germany
and
Harper's Bazaar Australia .
In October 2009, Kerr launched an organic skincare line, Kora, in
Australia with co-founder George Moskos.
Kerr also made an appearance in the spring/summer runway show for
Balenciaga ,
her first designer fashion show, aside from
Victoria's Secret , since 2007.
She is currently signed with
IMG
Models , Next
Model Management Paris ,
Traffic Models
and Chic Management
In early February 2010, Kerr inadvertently became the subject of
headlines when David Kiely, a Sydney-based banker, was caught viewing
"racy" photos of the model on his computer while in the background of a
colleague's live television interview. Within days, a clip of the
interview uploaded onto
YouTube
received over 1.3 million hits.
When Kiely was suspended and an internet campaign launched on his
behalf, Kerr herself gave him her backing: "I am told there is a
petition to save his job, and of course I would sign it." The episode
prompted a 100% increase in the number of Google searches for Kerr's
name.
A few days after the incident, it was announced that Kiely would be
able to keep his job at
Macquarie .
In 2010, Kerr walked for design company
Prada
for
their Fall 2010 collection in
Milan
Fashion Week
alongside fellow Angels
Doutzen
Kroes
and
Alessandra Ambrosio
and subsequently got booked for the Prada Fall/Winter-campaign
alongside
Angela Lindvall .
In May 2010, Kerr was listed number 9 on the
Forbes
Top
10 Earning Models.
Kerr is pursuing an acting career.
Public image Kerr has been called "the next
MacPherson ". Kerr's model trademark are her
dimples .
Celebrity photographer
Russell
James
said of Kerr, "The US has fallen in love with her. We love
her because she has the most incredible girl-next-door look and she's
also insanely beautiful. It means women are not intimidated by her looks
and guys think they might be able to talk to her. It's a fantastic
combination ... people want to be around her; she's fun on a shoot … and
she's not stupid, which can be a very annoying trait among some
models." Model agent Ursula Hufnagl described Kerr as "the perfect
endorsement", citing her ability to "truly sell a product."
Kerr's charitable work includes
Wildlife Warriors Worldwide
and
Children International .
In June 2009, Kerr posed naked, chained to a tree, for the Australian
issue of
Rolling Stone
magazine, in order to
attract public attention for the
koala .
Personal life Kerr practices
Nichiren Buddhism
and believes "we have a responsibility
to bring peace and harmony to our lives and the world." As part of her
Nichiren beliefs, Kerr reportedly chants every morning and night for 20
minutes, practices yoga, meditates, and reads widely on spirituality. According to a Victoria's Secret profile on Kerr, posted on the
CBS
YouTube
page, Kerr described her take on life as "enjoying wherever it is [I am]
and trying to be in the moment as much as possible". As reported in
2007, Kerr was writing an inspirational self-esteem self-help book
called
Treasure Yourself
aimed at the female teenage demographic.
Kerr says, "Basically, it's a whole lot of information that I've found,
that has helped me. If I can help one girl by doing this then I've
completed my purpose."In 2003, Kerr began dating finance broker Adrian Camilleri. Following
an
Australian
Securities and Investments Commission
investigation, Camilleri was
found guilty on five counts of
fraudulent
behaviour
from February 2003 to February 2004. Kerr subsequently
ended the relationship. A 2007 newspaper report claims that Kerr
suffered financially "after taking her boyfriend's financial advice" but
chose not to take legal action.
She was formerly in a long-term relationship with
Jay Lyon
(formerly known as Brent Tuhtan), the lead singer of the band Tamarama,
who has made appearances on season one of the
MTV
series
The City . Kerr was featured in
Tamarama's video clip for "Everything To Me".
The two dated for
approximately four years but ended on mutual terms in mid-2007.
In late 2007, Kerr began dating actor
Orlando
Bloom .
Orlando Bloom is also an
SGI
member. The couple's engagement was announced on June 21, 2010.
Kerr released a statement on July 22, 2010, announcing that she and
Bloom had married in "an intimate ceremony."
Kerr maintains her physique through daily yoga, light jogging, and a
diet of steamed vegetables, fresh fruit, and fish.
