Who is Solange Piaget Knowles?
Who is Solange Piaget Knowles?
, The acting and singer world knows Solange Knowles as an entertainment. Solange is an American recording artist, actress and model. Knowles was born and raised in
Houston, Texas
along with her older sister singer
Beyoncé , a former member of R&B group
Destiny’s Child .
Showing an interest in music recording at an early age, she eventually
broke into the music scene at 16. She has released two studios albums:
Solo Star
in 2003 and
Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams
in 2008, which peak at number nine in the US
Billboard
200
chart.
Aside from recording, Knowles has ventured into film, modeling, and
entrepreneurship. She co-launched the junior apparel collection Deréon, a
sister line to
House of Deréon
that was established by her mother and sister. Knowles has been
compared to her sister by the media, but she dismisses the notion,
saying they are artistically different.
Early life
Knowles was born on June 24, 1986, [1]
in
Houston, Texas , to
Mathew
and
Tina Knowles . Solange is the second child of Mathew and Tina, and the younger sister of
Beyoncé . Her father is
African American
and her mother is
Creole
(of
African American ,
Native American , and
French
descent). [2]
Her maternal grandparents are Lumis Beyincé and
Agnéz Deréon , (a
seamstress ).
As a child, Knowles studied dance and theater. At the age of five, she
made her singing debut at an amusement park. She began writing songs at
the age of nine. [3]
At 13, she decided to pursue recording, but her parents initially advised her to wait. [1]
At the age of 15 Knowles replaced a departed dancer and performed with her sister’s group
Destiny’s Child
on tour. [4]
During the group’s opening stint for American pop singer
Christina Aguilera ‘s tour, Knowles temporarily replaced Destiny’s Child member
Kelly Rowland
after Kelly broke her toes backstage during a costume change. [5]
When Knowles was 16, her father, who was then also her manager, signed her to his recording company, Music World Entertainment. [1]
Music career
2001–2003: Early career and
Solo Star
Managed by her father Mathew, Knowles’ first foray into the music
business was in 2001 as the lead singer, backed with Destiny’s Child, on
the title theme song for the animated television series
The Proud Family . [6]
She also was a featured performer on “Hey Goldmember” for the soundtrack to the 2002 film
Austin Powers in Goldmember , [6]
as well as a backup singer on the track “Little Drummer Boy” on her sister’s group’s 2001 holiday album
8 Days of Christmas . [7]
In 2002, she was featured on
Lil Romeo ‘s second studio album
Game Time , singing portions of
Luther Vandross -penned “So Amazing” on the single “True Love”, and on Rowland’s debut solo album
Simply Deep , for which she also wrote the title track and “Alone”. In 2001 she also appeared as
Lil’ Bow Wow’s
date in the music video for his single “ Puppy Love “. [8]
In June 2003, Mathew Knowles excitedly announced that he was
considering adding Solange to Destiny’s Child when the group reunited in
2004, thus turning them into a quartet for the first time since
short-lived member
Farrah Franklin
left in 2000. Mathew Knowles said he was testing the reactions, and, judging by what he had heard, “it seems like a good idea”. [9]
Later in August, however, Beyoncé said it was only a rumor and
Destiny’s Child would remain a trio. Rowland added, “She’s a Solo Star,”
namedropping Knowles’ debut album. [10]
At the age of 14, Solange Knowles started working on her debut album
Solo Star , [11]
which involved American producers such as
Jermaine Dupri ,
The Neptunes ,
Linda Perry
and
Timbaland
among others. The album is primarily uptempo
R&B , although Knowles said there are
pop ,
rock ,
reggae
and
hip hop
influences. [6] [7]
Knowles co-wrote and co-produced some of the 15 tracks in the album, [12]
including its
lead single , “ Feelin’ You (Part II) “. The song failed to enter the
Billboard
Hot 100 , but reached number three on both the
Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles Sales
and
Hot Dance Singles Sales
chart. [13] [14]
Solo Star
was released on January 21, 2003 in the United States, where it debuted at number 49 on the
Billboard
200
and reached number 23 on the
Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums
chart. [15] [16]
Solo Star
had a mixed critical reception: William Ruhlmann of
Allmusic
called it a “state-of-the-art contemporary R&B album”, but deemed Knowles “lost somewhere in the mix”. [17]
As of mid-2008, the album had sold 112,000 copies domestically according to
Nielsen Soundscan . [16]
2004–2008: Career break and
Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams
After the release of her debut album, Knowles started acting in films followed by a career break. [18]
When she was married, her family moved to
Idaho , and, while staying there, resumed writing songs including the singles “ Get Me Bodied “
and “ Upgrade U “
off her sister’s second solo album,
B’Day . [18] [19]
Knowles earned the R&B and Hip-Hop Song accolade for “Get Me Bodied” at the 2008
ASCAP Awards . [20]
She had also written songs for Destiny’s Child, and members Rowland and
Michelle Williams . [4]
In 2004, while pregnant with son Daniel, she made a
cameo appearance
in Destiny’s Child’s
music video
for “ Soldier “. [21]
After the divorce, Knowles returned to Houston to began working on
her second album. Knowles renewed her management, signing a record deal
with
Geffen
and a publishing deal with
EMI . [22] [23]
Knowles finished working on her second studio album in 2008 and titled the project
Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams . It includes production by
Cee-Lo Green ,
Soulshock & Karlin
and
Mark Ronson
as well as an appearance by
Bilal . A collection of 1960s- and 1970s-influenced songs, [24]
it is seen as a departure from her pop-oriented debut, [25] [26]
with what
Billboard
magazine called “more of a modern twist on hip-hop and R&B flecked with tinges of blues and jazz”. [16]
The album was released on August 26, 2008 in the United States. By
December 2008, the album had sold over 114,000 copies according to
Nielsen Soundscan . [27]
The album was positively received by critics, [28]
some of whom considered it far better than her debut. [29]
The album’s lead single, “ I Decided “, was released in April 2008, and reached the top of the
Billboard
Hot Dance Club Play ; [27]
Rolling Stone
magazine labelled it her breakthrough single. [30]
In support of the album, Knowles began the
Solange Presents Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams Tour
in Britain in November 2008. [31]
Knowles announced, via her blog HadleyStreetJournal.com, that she will be releasing a series of
mixtapes ,
to coincide with the album. The first mixtape, “I Can’t Get
Clearance…”, includes the leaked track “Fuck the Industry (Signed
Sincerely)”. On this record, Knowles expresses her views on the current
state of the music industry. The lyrics to the song name check some
major artists such as
Mary J. Blige ,
Ashanti ,
Keyshia Cole , and Beyoncé, although she made a point of stating that it does not have “a negative light to any of [them]”. [32]
2009–present: Third studio album
In an interview with MTV in 2009, Knowles revealed that she was determining the type of sound for the follow up to
Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams . [33]
Knowles also parted ways with the
Interscope-Geffen-A&M
record label group. She will now release her third studio album independently. [34]
Early in 2010, Knowles traveled to
Australia
to work with Australian rock band,
Midnight Juggernauts
on her third studio album [35]
Knowles plans to release the album in summer as revealed on her official twitter account in 2009 [36]
She also revealed on her twitter account that she rented a house in
Santa Barbara, California
to get into a certain state of mind while writing and making music [37]
On 7 May 2010, Knowles made a guest appearance on the popular children show,
Yo Gabba Gabba!
for a “Mothers Day Special” where she performed an original song called, “Momma Loves Baby”. [38] [39] [40]
In an interview with
Vibe
on 7 July 2010, Knowles said she suffered “a little bit of a
breakdown ”
while recording her new album: “I literally gave up my sanity for a
while to do this record. […] We literally were waking up in the
morning and just making music all day and all night. […] It just
started to wear on me in so many different ways. I started having these
crazy
panic attacks .”
Knowles explained how she made sacrifices “mentally, emotionally and
financially”, and continued, “It’s more than an album to me. It’s a
transitional time in my life.” Regarding the musical direction of the
album, she said the inspiration came from
New Wave music
and stated, “This is a
dance
record, but the lyrics can get pretty dark at times.” [41] . She recorded a charity song called “Kenya” with Chris Taylor.
Other ventures
Aside from recording, Knowles ventured into film, modeling, and
entrepreneurship. According to her father Mathew Knowles, her goal of
merging music and film was part of the overall plan for her career. [42]
Knowles appeared as a nubile teenager in the 2004
comedy film
Johnson Family Vacation , starring alongside American actors
Cedric the Entertainer ,
Vanessa Williams
and
Bow Wow . [10]
She provided a song for its soundtrack—” Freedom “, a collaboration with the Houston-based funk-jazz band
Drop Trio . Although the reviews were generally negative, Knowles earned praise from
Variety
magazine: “Solange Knowles is nearly as dazzling as big sister Beyoncé
and does little more than smile winningly in her first bigscreen
outing.” [43]
In 2006, she starred as a cheerleading captain in the film
Bring It On: All or Nothing , the third installment of the
Bring it On
series, alongside American actress and singer
Hayden Panettiere . What little critical reaction the low-budget,
direct-to-DVD
movie got was negative, [44]
and Knowles was described as an “affordable young starlet”. [45]
Knowles uses her full name for her acting, rather than just the first name she uses when singing; for
Bring It On: All or Nothing , she was billed as Solange Knowles-Smith, [46]
reflecting her married state at the time.
Knowles also appeared in several television series. In 2002, she lent
her voice for the character Chanel, the cousin of the protagonist
Penny Proud , in the episode “Behind Family Lines” to the
animated television series
The Proud Family . [47]
In 2004, she guest starred in the episode “The Catch” to the
sitcom
One on One .
Knowles and sister Beyoncé model for their families’ clothing line,
House of Deréon ,
named after their grandmother, Agnéz Deréon. She also helped launch
Deréon, a junior apparel collection and a sister line to House of
Deréon. [48]
Both sisters model for Deréon, and are featured in most of Deréon’s marketing campaigns. They were featured in a “ Got Milk? ” campaign ad, while still wearing House of Deréon. In 2008, Knowles was named as ambassador for
Giorgio Armani ‘s
younger diffusion line, Armani Jeans. Armani said Knowles epitomizes
the style, which is a “vision of a young, independent, casual lifestyle
with a strong and cool, fashion sensibility”. [49]
Knowles has been promoting Baby Jamz, a
hip hop -styled toy line for pre-schoolers. [19] [50]
It was inspired by her son, Julez, who is fond of hip hop music. [23]
She is the executive producer of the CD, composed of updated hip hop
inspired nursery rhymes, which is featured in all of the toys. [19]
Also, Knowles has been known for her work in the award-winning children’s TV show,
Yo Gabba Gabba! . She performed “When I Hear Music” during the live performance when it toured the
Dallas/Ft. Worth
area. She also performed “Mama Loves Baby” during a 2010 episode called “Baby”.
Personal life
Knowles, at age 17, married Daniel Smith in February 2004. Knowles
met Smith at a high school party through mutual friends. He was in high
school at the time and Knowles was 13 and in middle school; they called
themselves high school sweethearts. [23]
On October 18, 2004, Knowles gave birth to their son, Daniel Julez Smith, Jr. [51]
Knowles has partly expressed regret that she bore a child at an early
age, but calls her son the greatest unplanned blessing. A song she wrote
for her baby, “An Ode to Marvin”, was included on
Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams . [52]
After Daniel Julez’ birth, the family moved to
Moscow, Idaho , where Knowles’ husband continued studying in college. [26]
In October 2007, Solange confirmed in an interview with
Essence
magazine that she and Smith had divorced. Both of them co-parent the child. [4] [23]
After the divorce, Knowles and her child moved to
Hollywood, Los Angeles, California , where they established their new home. [25]
Artistry
Knowles cites as her influences
Motown
girl groups
such as
The Supremes
and
The Marvelettes , and
Martha Reeves , lead singer of
Martha and the Vandellas . [4]
She also listened to the music of English
pop
singer
Dusty Springfield ,
and according to Knowles, her “greatest music influence” is her mother,
Tina Knowles, who was a one-time member of the 1960s harmony group The
Veltones. [4]
Knowles says her first passion is writing songs. She has been doing
this since she was nine years old, and has collaborated with a number of
songwriters and producers. [3]
On her debut album, Knowles had no control over which kinds of music to
produce, because “when you’re 14, everyone else is older and more
seasoned and you trust their decisions”. [11]
Knowles was more concerned with pleasing her record label by submitting to their desires. [23]
Her musical influences were better expressed on
Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams ,
when she considered herself mature and was able to write and produce
songs as she wished, without worrying about the expectations of others. [11]
Knowles’ lyrics tackle relationships, world issues, and deceased friends, [23] [52]
with her second album focusing on events in her life, such as marriage, divorce, and parenthood. [23]
Aside from recording, Knowles occasionally paints as her hobby: “I
think that painting, for me, is such an affirmative expression in that
sometimes you don’t know what the outcome is gonna be and each stroke
and each brush for me is an emotion and, in the end, it comes out as a
piece which is the most amazing thing. … It definitely provides a
different outlet.” [25]
Public image
Knowles has always been compared by the media to her sister,
Beyoncé ,
whom she considers one of her role models. She has expressed her
opinion of the comparison in the lyrics to “God Given Name”: “I’m not
her and never will be” [11] [53]
— which was purposely set as the album’s opening track to show their differences. [54]
In her review for the album, Jody Rosen of
Rolling Stone
magazine referred to the lyrics a declaration of independence. [55]
In an interview with the
Daily Mail ,
Knowles commented: “People think there should be this great rivalry
between us, but there’s never been any competition. There’s a big age
gap and we are two very different characters.” [4]
In another interview, Knowles said that she would not live by her
sister’s level of stardom, stressing that she and Beyoncé are
artistically different, even stating that blogger Teddy Birmingham was
“disrespectful” for saying she was living in her sister shadow on his
website “Teddytalks” in June 2009. [23]
Beyoncé was unwilling to bring her sister into the recording industry,
reasoning that it “involves a lot of pressure”. Knowles countered by
saying, “It’s good to have her advice, but we really have different
goals”. [11]

Who is Carré Otis?
Who is Carré Otis? The modeling and entertainment world knows Carrie Otis as an American model and actress.
Biography
Carre Otis was born September 28, 1968  in
San Francisco , and raised in
Marin County ,
California
along with her older sister Chrisse and her younger brother Jordan. She attended
Marin Academy
in
San Rafael, California
and the
John Woolman School
in
Nevada City, California . [1]
Early modeling career
Otis began modeling at age 16. Discovered in San Francisco, she was initially signed to
Elite Model Management
by John Casablancas. She first achieved fame while working for Elite in Paris, when she appeared on the cover of French
Elle
in April 1986. Over the next several years, she appeared on covers in the American and foreign editions of
Vogue ,
Harper’s Bazaar ,
Cosmopolitan ,
Allure ,
Mirabella , and Marie Claire.
Otis appeared in ads for
Guess
jeans (1988),
Calvin Klein
jeans (“biker chick” look, 1991), appeared in the 1996
Pirelli
calendar, and also posed for the
Sports Illustrated
swimsuit edition (2000). Otis was also featured in 1990 and 2000 issues of
Playboy
magazine.
Acting career
In 1990, Otis made her acting debut in the film
Wild Orchid . The film became notorious due to unsubstantiated rumors that she and co-star
Mickey Rourke
filmed an
unsimulated sex scene . Stills from the film’s climactic sex scene were sold to
Playboy , and were the subject of a lawsuit filed by Otis. [2]
Otis would later appear in another Rourke film,
Exit in Red .
Marriage to Mickey Rourke
Otis started dating Mickey Rourke not long after the release of
Wild Orchid .
The couple married in 1992, and had one of the most celebrated and
stormy celebrity marriages of the 1990s. In 1994, Rourke was arrested
for spousal abuse, but the charges were later dropped. Otis battled
anorexia and drug dependency, addictions that had tormented her since
her adolescence. With Rourke’s help, Otis was able to get clean from
heroin in 1994, but her struggles with other substances continued until
1996. In 2001, Otis said that she had mixed everything, including
“alcohol, anti-depressants, uppers, downers and diet pills”. She noted
in that same interview that she and Rourke “had equally explosive
personalities” (and she had) her own depression. We were both drama
addicts.” [3]
For several years before and during their marriage, Rourke refused to
allow Otis to model, forcing her to turn down lucrative opportunities
and threatening photographers and agents with whom she had worked. The
couple eventually divorced in 1998.
Later modeling career
After the end of her marriage to Rourke, Otis gradually resumed
modeling. In 2000, she became one of the oldest models to appear in the
Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Shortly thereafter, she began an
enduring recovery from anorexia. As part of that recovery, she
experienced a weight gain that offered her the opportunity to work as a
plus-size model, most notably as the face for iconic
Marina Rinaldi
clothing (of
MaxMara
Group) and in commentary and editorials for
Mode
Magazine; since then Otis has served as a spokesman for National Eating Disorders Awareness Week in
2003 . She also appeared periodically as a correspondent on Channel 4 News in San Francisco. [1]
In 2005, she represented the Breil jewellery line. [4]
Carre Otis Today
Otis discovered Buddhism in the late 1980s. She is a committed practitioner of Tibetan Buddhism, and a student of Lama
Tsultrim Allione .
In 2005, Otis was remarried to Matthew Sutton, an environmental
scientist. She and Sutton have two daughters, Jade (born 2006) and Kaya
(born 2008). They live in
Colorado .
Her memoir,
“Beauty Disrupted: The Carre Otis Story” ” (with Hugo Schwyzer), is scheduled to be released by HarperCollins in August 2011.

Who is Patti LuPone ?
Who is Patti LuPone ? The entertainment and movie world knows Patti LuPone as an American singer and actress, known for her
Tony Award -winning performances as
Eva Perón
in the 1979 musical
Evita
and as Rose in the 2008 revival of
Gypsy , and for her
Olivier Award -winning performance as
Fantine
in the original London cast of
Les Misérables .
Early life and training
LuPone was born April 21, 1949  in
Northport, New York , on
Long Island , the daughter of Angela Louise (née Patti), a college library administrator, and Orlando Joseph LuPone, a school administrator. [1]
Her great-grand-aunt was the celebrated 19th-century opera singer
Adelina Patti . [2]
Her brother
Robert LuPone
is an actor, dancer, and director who originated the role of Zach the choreographer in
A Chorus Line .
Her other brother William LuPone is a teacher. When they were young,
they performed on Long Island as the LuPone Trio. She is of
Italian / Abruzzese
descent and a graduate of
Northport High School , where she studied under the musical direction of voice coach Esther Scott. [3]
LuPone was part of the first graduating class of
Juilliard ‘s Drama Division.
Theatre work
In 1972, LuPone became one of the original members of
The Acting Company , formed by
John Houseman . [4]
The Acting Company
was a nationally touring repertory theater company. [5]
LuPone’s stint with the company lasted from 1972 to 1976, and she appeared in many of their productions, such as
The Cradle Will Rock ,
The School for Scandal ,
Women Beware Women ,
The Beggar’s Opera ,
The Time of Your Life ,
The Lower Depths ,
The Hostage ,
Next Time I’ll Sing to You ,
Measure for Measure ,
Scapin ,
Edward II ,
The Orchestra ,
Love’s Labours Lost ,
Arms and the Man ,
The Way of the World . She made her
Broadway
debut in the
play
The Three Sisters
as Irina in 1973. [6]
For her work in
The Robber Bridegroom
(1975) she received her first
Tony Award
nomination, for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. [7]
In 1976,
producer
David Merrick
hired LuPone as a replacement to play Genevieve, the title role of the troubled pre-Broadway production of
The Baker’s Wife . The production toured at length but Merrick deemed it unworthy of Broadway and it closed out of town. [8]
Since 1977, LuPone has been a frequent collaborator with
David Mamet , appearing in his plays
The Woods ,
All Men are Whores ,
The Blue Hour ,
The Water Engine
(1978), [9]
Edmond
and
The Old Neighborhood
(1997). [10]
The
New York Times
reviewer wrote of LuPone in
The Old Neighborhood
“Those who know Ms. Lupone only as a musical comedy star will be
stunned by the naturalistic fire she delivers here. As Jolly, a part
inspired by Mr. Mamet’s real-life sister and his realized female
character, Ms. Lupone finds conflicting layers of past and present
selves in practically every line. She emerges as both loving matriarch
and wounded adolescent, sentimental and devastatingly clear-eyed.” [11]
In 1978, she appeared in the Broadway musical adaptation of
Studs Terkel ’s
Working , which ran for only 24 performances. [12]
In 1979 LuPone starred in the original Broadway production of
Evita , the musical based on the life of
Eva Peron , composed by
Andrew Lloyd-Webber
and
Tim Rice , and directed by
Harold Prince . [13]
Although LuPone was hailed by critics, she has since said that her time in
Evita
was not an enjoyable one. In a 2007 interview, she stated ” ‘Evita’ was
the worst experience of my life,” she said. “I was screaming my way
through a part that could only have been written by a man who hates
women. And I had no support from the producers, who wanted a star
performance onstage but treated me as an unknown backstage. It was like
Beirut, and I fought like a banshee.” [14]
Despite the trouble, LuPone won her first
Tony Award
for Best Actress in a Musical. [15]
LuPone and her co-star,
Mandy Patinkin , remained close friends both on and off the stage.
In May 1983, founding alumni of
The Acting Company
reunited for an off-Broadway revival of
Marc Blitzstein ’s landmark labor musical
The Cradle Will Rock
at the American Place Theatre. It was narrated by
John Houseman , with LuPone in the roles of Moll and Sister Mister. [16]
The production premiered at
The Acting Company’ s summer residence at Chautauqua Institution, toured the United States, including an engagement at the Highland Park, Illinois’
Ravinia Festival
in 1984, and played London’s
West End . When the run ended, LuPone remained in London to create the role of
Fantine
in
Cameron Mackintosh ’s original London production of
Les Misérables , in 1985, which premiered at the
Barbican Theatre , home of the
Royal Shakespeare Company . [17]
LuPone had previously worked for Mackintosh in a short-lived Broadway revival of
Oliver!
in 1984, playing Nancy opposite
Ron Moody
as Fagin. [18]
For her work in both
The Cradle Will Rock
and
Les Misérables , LuPone received the 1985
Olivier Award
for Best Actress in a Musical. [19] [20]
She returned to Broadway in 1987 to star as nightclub singer Reno Sweeney in the
Lincoln Center Theater
revival of
Cole Porter ’s
Anything Goes . She starred opposite
Howard McGillin , and they both received Tony Award nominations for their performances. [21] [22]
The Lincoln Center cast reassembled for a one-night-only concert performance of
Anything Goes
in New York in 2002, where LuPone met her future
Gypsy
co-star,
Boyd Gaines . [23]
In 1993, LuPone returned to London to create the role of Norma Desmond in the original production of
Andrew Lloyd Webber ’s
Sunset Boulevard
at the
Adelphi Theatre . There was much anticipation of LuPone appearing in another Lloyd Webber musical, the first since her performance in
Evita . Her time in the show was difficult and she was abruptly fired by Lloyd Webber and replaced by
Glenn Close
who opened the show in Los Angeles and eventually on
Broadway . [24] [25]
In November 1995 LuPone starred in her one-woman show,
Patti LuPone on Broadway , at the
Walter Kerr Theatre . [26]
For her work, she received an
Outer Critics Circle Award . The following year, she was selected by producer
Robert Whitehead
to succeed his wife,
Zoe Caldwell
in the Broadway production of
Terrence McNally ’s play
Master Class , based on the master classes given by operatic diva
Maria Callas
at
Juilliard , New York. [24]
LuPone received positive reviews in New York, with
Vincent Canby
writing : “Ms. LuPone really is vulnerable here in a way that wasn’t
anticipated: she’s in the process of creating a role for which she isn’t
ideally suited, but she’s working like a trouper to get it right.” [27]
and took the play to the
West End . In November 2001, she starred in a Broadway revival of
Noises Off , with
Peter Gallagher
and
Faith Prince . [28]
LuPone has performed in numerous New York concert productions of musicals including
Pal Joey
with
Peter Gallagher
and
Bebe Neuwirth ,
Annie Get Your Gun
with
Peter Gallagher ,

George Hearn

with
Kristin Chenoweth ,

Michael Cerveris
and
Audra
McDonald
and
Gypsy
with
Boyd Gaines
and
Laura Benanti
for

Sweeney Todd , and
Candide
were recorded and broadcast for
PBS ’ “ Great Performances ” and were released on DVD. The concert staging of
Passion
was televised as part of “ Live from Lincoln Center “, which contractually does not release its broadcasts on DVD.
Since 2001, LuPone has been a regular performer at the Chicago
Ravinia Festival . She starred in a six-year-long series of concert presentations of
Stephen Sondheim
musicals, which began in honor of his seventieth birthday. Her roles here have included Mrs. Lovett in
Sweeney Todd , Fosca in
Passion , Cora Hoover Hooper in
Anyone Can Whistle , Rose in
Gypsy
and two different roles in
Sunday in the Park with George . [29]
She returned to Broadway in October 2005, to star as Mrs. Lovett in
John Doyle ’s new Broadway production of
Sweeney Todd .
In this radically different interpretation of Sondheim’s masterpiece,
the ten actors on stage also served as the show’s orchestra. Therefore,
LuPone played the tuba and the orchestra bells as well as vocally
performing the challenging score. [30]
For her performance, she received a
Tony Award
nomination as well as a Golden Icon Award for Best Female Musical Theater Performance. [31]
In August 2006, LuPone took a three week leave from
Sweeney
in order to play Rose in
Lonny Price ‘s production of
Gypsy
at Ravinia. [29]
Sweeney Todd
closed in September 2006.
Following the Ravinia Festival production of
Gypsy , LuPone and author Arthur Laurents mended a decade-long rift and she was cast in the City Center Encores!
Summer Stars
production of the show. Laurents directed LuPone in Gypsy for a 22
performance run (July 9, 2007 – July 29, 2007) at City Center. [32]
This production of
Gypsy
then transferred to
Broadway , opening March 27, 2008 at the
St. James Theatre . [33]
LuPone won the
Outer Critics Circle Award , Drama League Award,
Drama Desk Award , and
Tony Award
for her performance in
Gypsy . [34] [35]
It closed on January 11, 2009.
In August 2010, LuPone appeared in a three-day run of
Irving Berlin ’s
Annie Get Your Gun , in which she played the title role opposite
Patrick Cassidy , at the Ravinia Festival, directed by
Lonny Price . [36]
Most recently, LuPone created the role of Lucia in the original Broadway production of
Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown , which opened at the
Belasco Theatre
on November 4, 2010, and closed on January 2, 2011, after 23 previews
and 69 regular performances. LuPone was nominated for a Drama Desk Award
and an Outer Critics Circle Award for her performance in
Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown .
LuPone will make her
New York City Ballet
debut in May 2011 in a production of
The Seven Deadly Sins , directed and choreographed by
Lynne Taylor-Corbett . LuPone will sing the role of Anna in the
Kurt Weill
and
Bertolt Brecht
score. [37]
LuPone recently concluded a four-night performance engagement as Joanne in the
New York Philharmonic
concert version of
Stephen Sondheim ‘s
Company , in which she starred opposite
Neil Patrick Harris
with whom she appeared in the 2000 and 2001 concert productions of
Sweeney Todd .

Glee .
Stance on distractions from audience members
LuPone opposes recording, photographs, and other electronic
distractions in live theatre. “Where’s the elegance?”, she asked in a
blog post on her official site. “I mean, I’m glad they show up because
God knows it’s a dying art form and I guess I’m glad they’re all
comfortable, sleeping, eating and drinking, things they should be doing
at home and in a restaurant. But it’s just not done in the theatre or
shouldn’t be.” LuPone has been the subject of some controversy due to
the bluntness of her statements regarding this matter. [56]
A related incident occurred at the second to last performance of
Gypsy
on January 10, 2009. Agitated at a man taking pictures with the use of
flash, she stopped in the middle of “Rose’s Turn” and loudly demanded
that he be removed from the theatre. “You heard the announcement in the
beginning, you heard the announcement at intermission! Who do you think
you are?” she yelled at him. After he was removed, LuPone restarted her
number. The audience applauded her stance. [57] [58]
The event was recorded by another audience member, who released it on
YouTube . [59]
She later claimed that such distractions drive “people in the audience
nuts. They can’t concentrate on the stage if, in their peripheral
vision, they’re seeing texting, they’re seeing cameras, they’re
listening to phone calls. How can we do our job if the audience is
distracted?”, and also mentioned that “the interesting thing is I’m not
the first one that’s done it”. [60]
Memoir
Ms. LuPone wrote a
memoir , recounting her life and career from childhood to the present, which was released in September 2010. It was simply titled
Patti LuPone: A Memoir , which was, according to LuPone, the winner of the competition she held to name the book. [61] [62]
Personal life
LuPone is married to Matthew Johnston, whom she married on December
12, 1988. The couple were wed on the stage of the Vivian Beaumont
Theatre at Lincoln Center after filming the TV movie
LBJ ; Johnston was a cameraman. [63]
They have one child, Joshua Luke Johnston (b. November 21, 1990). [46]
The family resides in
Connecticut [64]
and South Carolina. [65]

Who is Adina Howard?
Who is Adina Howard? The entertainment and music world knows Adina Howard as an
American
R&B
singer
who rose to prominence during the mid 1990s with her debut
album ,
Do You Wanna Ride?
and her debut
single , “ Freak Like Me “.
Howard is known for her sexual image and provocative songs. Some of her other minor
hits
include “It’s All About You” , “My Up And Down”,
“You Don’t Have To
Cry”, “T- Shirt And Panties”,
“(Freak) And U Know It”, “Outside (The
Club)” and “Nasty Grind”.
Career
Howard was born November 14, 1974. Her debut album
Do You Wanna Ride? , featuring the #2 Platinum
selling hit single, “Freak Like Me”, was released in 1995 and was
certified Gold by the RIAA. The non album remixes “It’s All About You
(Too Slow U Blow Remix)”, “My Up And Down (Something To Ride To Remix)”
and “Freak Like Me (Slow Wind Remix)” were released as singles.
A second album,
Welcome to Fantasy Island , garnered critical raves and a moderate hit with the lead single, “(Freak) And U Know It”, but was shelved by
Elektra Records
in 1997.The album was leaked to the internet in limited quantities and
promotional copies sell for hundreds of dollars on online auction sites. [ citation needed ]
In 1998, she collaborated with
Jamie Foxx
on the slow jam,
T-Shirt & Panties
for the feature film
Woo . During this time, she made her feature film debut in the independent film
High Freakquency , starring
Deon Richmond
and
John Witherspoon .
By 2004, Howard released her third album
The Second Coming
on Rufftown Records. A
video
for the first single, “Nasty Grind”, played on
BET
during early morning hours. The album sold poorly due to lack of
promotion and only managed to gather 40,000 copies on store shelves and
she was later sued by the label.
Her fourth album,
Private Show , was released on June 26, 2007
on Arsenal Records. The album managed to reach #17 on the iTunes R&B
music sells chart but completely missed the Billboard 200 charts. The
album managed to sell a few thousand copies and Howard parted ways with
the label shortly after.
On September 25, 2009 a UK compilation “Independent Soul Divas 2” was
released on Lola Waxx Records. This compilation album featured “What Do
I Do”, a song recorded by Howard in 2008. The album version is a
different version than the version that was originally included on
Howard’s MySpace page. The single is a slight departure to what Adina’s
fans may be accustomed to but is already picking up airplay and positive
response on UK Radio.
