Trivia
In the background of Mr. Mackey's office, it says "Father and Son Day Coming Soon", "Dads are Dandy" and "If You Don't Have a Dad, You're a Bastard".
When Liane remembers the events that happened 9 years earlier, you can see the band playing country music at "The Drunken Barn Dance". One of the band members resembles
Skeeter , the future character from " Sexual Harassment Panda ".
Another band member is the farmer from season six's " Fun with Veal ".
For the first thirteen episodes,
Trey Parker
and
Matt Stone
won the Producers Guild of America's 1998 Nova Award for "Most Promising Producer in Television".
This is the second time Cartman's name is mentioned in the title.
In the " The Unaired Pilot " of South Park, Eric states "It's supper time and my mom is probably worried!". The scene cuts to a dinner table, seating a man (dad), a girl (sister) and Liane comes on, indicating Eric had a dad but he was cut (along with his sister).
This this the first episode to have a cliffhanger. The second will be " You're Getting Old ".
References to Popular Culture
In this episode, Cartman's cat is voiced by late-night talk show host
Jay Leno .
The music playing during Cartman's tea-party scenes is based on composer
Johann Pachelbel's
Canon in D
which was composed in the late 1600s.
Cartman serves Peter Panda Earl Grey tea which was named after the 2nd Earl Grey who was Prime Minister of Britain in the 1830s.
Every time Liane Cartman would begin falling in "love" with someone at the Drunken Barn Dance, the song that plays in the background (" There You Are! ", like a throbbing star. I want you to make love to me.") is a parody of
Celine Dion 's hit 1997 song " My Heart Will Go On ".
Chief Runningwater is a member of the
Ute Indians
who reside in the Colorado area.
On TV, a preview for a Terrance and Phillip special named "Not Without My Anus" is seen. It is a parody of the 1991 film
Not Without My Daughter
starring Sally Field. It was based on a true story. This would later be turned into an
actual episode
and air instead of the conclusion of this episode as an April Fools joke.
The TV network HBC and the HBC Movie of the Week are parodies. Although the HBC logo is a parody of NBC, the HBC Movie of the Week is a parody of the popular
ABC Movie of the Week
which ran from 1969-1976 which aired made-for-TV-movies.
Grandpa Marsh is watching "America's Stupidest Home Videos" which is a parody of the television series
America's Funniest Home Videos . This also lampoons comedian
Bob Saget
who hosted the show from 1989-1997.
Weeks after the episode's premiere, Bob Saget was interviewed on
The Daily Show
with Craig Kilborn. Although he felt offended when he first heard of and saw the episode, he later indicated that he got the joke. Bob Saget also used this as a joke in his stand-up comedy set.
Stan and Kyle mention how the host of
America's Stupidest Home Videos
is almost "as bad as the guy from
Full House ". Full House was a sitcom that ran from 1987-1995, Bob Saget starred in the lead role of father Danny Tanner on the series.
When Cartman thinks he's black he dresses up in a track-suit and wears flat top hair much like Kid from the hip-hop group
Kid 'n Play , he also wears an alarm clock around his neck and a knuckle ring much like Flavor Flav.
The Drunken Barn Dance is visited by the 1989
Denver Broncos
a reference is made that they were the AFC Champions of 1989. This is historically correct.
Mr. Hat's drink of choice is the Cosmopolitan.
Kyle intends to use his half of the $10,000 dollars they are getting from America's Stupidest Home Videos to buy himself a Walkman. This is far beyond the usual price range for a Walkman.
Kenny's Death
Kenny is dragged around the bus stop area hanging onto an out-of-control go-cart, but lands safely. Unfortunately, he comes to a stop right on the train tracks, where a train soon runs him over. The death is videotaped by Stan's grandpa and is one of the three $10,000 finalists on
America's Stupidest Home Videos . On a side note he uses the same go-cart in the video game
South Park Rally
and in the opening sequence of the game he runs out of gas on the train tracks and a train runs him over similar to how he died in this episode.
Hidden Visitor(s)
After Ned says "Could be" it pans to Gerald and you can see a visitor behind Chief Running Water.
Goofs
When Cartman is pretending to be a Native American, Stan asks why he is wearing a bear necklace when Cartman is actually wearing an eagle necklace.
Mephesto says that one of the possible fathers is the 1989 Denver Broncos, however the announcer calls them the 1991 Denver Broncos.
Ever since the recurring characters
Terrance and Phillip
were established to be Canadians.
Continuity
This is the cliffhanger narrator's first appearance.
