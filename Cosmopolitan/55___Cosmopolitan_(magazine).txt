Seo In Young promoting
Elly Is So Hot
(2007)
Seo In Young debuted in 2002 with
Jewelry
as one of the replacements for
Jung Eu Jin
and
Jun Eun Mi . She made her solo debut in 2007 with the release of
Elly Is So Hot
and rose to significant fame in 2008 where she starred as a faux married couple with rap artist
Crown J . Seo released a digital single with Crown J titled " Too Much ", became the face for
Maybelline New York
South Korea in June 2008, and was selected as
Cosmopolitan
South Korea's style icon where she was featured in the July 2008 issue wearing 10 different swimsuits.
Seo hosted
Music Bank , starred in her own reality show
Seo In Young's Kaist , and released her hit solo single " Elly Is Cinderella ". Seo In Young also collaborated with Hip-hop duo
One Two
for their mini-album
Fun'ch , where she was featured in the song titled "Motdoen Yeoja" and filmed a music video for the track.
Seo and Crown J withdrew from
We Got Married
in January 2009, and she announced afterward her plan to take a two month vacation in the United States. She revealed later on
SBS's
Full of Ambition Season 2
that her impulsive vacation was sparked by depression.
After her break in the United States, Seo returned to South Korea and released a
CF
for Maybelline's latest lip gloss brand and became an exclusive model for the debut of
Baby Phat
in South Korea. She starred in the reality show
Seo In Young's Brand New Friend , modeled for the June 2009 issue of

In October 2009, Seo collaborated with the duo
One Two
to release " Motdoen Yeoja II ", the second version of previously released "Motdoen Yeoja". She also modeled for the October issue of
InStyle Korea
and revealed that she will be returning with a solo album in 2010. Seo made an appearance on the
SBS
Family Outing
variety show with
Park Jin Young
which aired on December 13th, and participated in the
Iris
drama OST with the song " Saranghamyeon Andoenayo ".
On December 10, 2009
Star Empire Entertainment
announced Seo In Young and
Park Jung Ah 's decision to leave
Jewelry . The duo planned to fully commit to their solo careers after finishing off promotions for Jewelry's sixth album
Sophisticated . Jewelry released
End And... , the repackaged album to
Sophisticated , and it included one new song called " Love Story " particularly created for Seo's and Park's departure.
Star Empire announced Seo's decision to stay with the company for her solo career on March 23, 2010. She collaborated with
MC Mong
for a duet on
Cho Young Soo
third album
Cho Young + All Star Vol 2.5 , singing " Bubble Love " and was featured in a song from the
dorama
Prosecutor Princess
soundtrack titled " Give Me " sung by the girl group
Nine Muses . She then announced her plans to return to her solo music career at the end of April with a mini-album and the title track being a ballad. However it was delayed for a May release due to Seo wanting to change the album design.
Album jacket photos for her solo debut were released in early May and her album was described as being full of ballads with lyrics talking about love. Seo announced her debut solo mini-album's ballad focus due to the singer wanting to show off her vocals. She released her second digital single " Lov-Elly ", which contained " Jalgayo Romance " on May 12, 2010.
Seo revealed on May 14, 2010 feeling burdened by her solo debut. She stated "This is my first solo album without the title of Jewelry’s Seo In Young, but just me, myself, and I. I felt burdened because I felt the pressure to show a new side of myself. After pondering for awhile, I realized that I simply wanted to share my memories with everyone."
Seo released the music video for " Sarangira Sseugo Apeumira Bureunda ", the title track to her solo debut mini-album
Lov-Elly
on June 1, 2010; the mini-album was also released on the 1st. For her solo debut Seo lost 6 kilograms, and revealed on her
Cyworld
minihompy that she exercised and ate a controlled diet of bananas and chicken breasts to lose the weight.
