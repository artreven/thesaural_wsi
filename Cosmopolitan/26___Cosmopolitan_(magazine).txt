New Orleans for My 27th Birthday

MEM to LAX
They say traveling together is the real test to a new relationship. “They” being the experts at
Cosmopolitan ,  my friends and all other relationship gurus at various media outlets.
I am happy to report that my boyfriend and I travel well together. This wasn’t our first trip together, but it was certainly our first real vacation (and if by “new relationship”, you mean under a year). We went to Vegas last month for
Super Bowl
weekend, but it was more of a weekend getaway. I also dragged him to a “ghost town” on the way. He is a good sport.
The only tension we seemed to have all week was when I worried aloud about wrinkles popping up in the late twenties. I also complained about men getting better with age and that I was probably past my peak since I am a woman. He warily asked if I would be freaking out every year on my birthday.
I suppose now that I’m 27, I should be past my “quarter-life” crisis. I am definitely past the quarter-life mark even if I live to 100. That’s rather depressing to think about…but instead of reaching some sort of clarity, things seem to be even more up in the air. There has been no particular event or words of wisdom that has made me less anxious lately except with this inexplicable feeling that 27 is going to be a really good year for me…
