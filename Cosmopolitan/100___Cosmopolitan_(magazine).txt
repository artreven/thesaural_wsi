Serbian supermodel - Milica Mila Jovovic
Milla Jovovich
( Serbian : Милица Јововић/Milica Jovović,
Ukrainian : Мілла Йовович/Mіlla Jovovič) (born Milica Nataša Jovović on
December 17 ,
1975 ) is an
American
supermodel ,
actress ,
musician , singer, and
fashion designer . Jovovich
was born in
Kiev ,
Ukrainian SSR ,
Soviet Union
to Bogdan Jovović, a
Serbian
medical doctor, and
Galina Jovovich
(Galina Logivina), a Soviet actress. Her paternal family's estate was at
Metohija
in Zlopek near
Peć . Her paternal great-grandfather, Bogić Camić Jovović, was a flag-bearer of the
Montenegrin
Serb
Vasojevići
clan
and officer of the guard of the King
Nicholas I of Montenegro ; his wife's name was Milica. Her paternal grandfather, Bogdan Jovović, was a commander in the
Pristina
military area, and later investigated finances in military areas of
Skopje
and
Sarajevo , where he uncovered massive
gold
embezzlement . He was punished for refusing to convict his friend for the crime. Later, the
communist
government imprisoned him on
Goli Otok . When he feared that he could be
arrested
again, he escaped to
Albania
and later moved to
Kiev . Another version of the story claims that he was the one to have taken the gold. Milla's father, Bogić Jovović, later joined her grandfather in Kiev, where he and his sister graduated in
medicine . In 1981, when Milla was five years old, her family had to leave the
Soviet Union
for political reasons and move to
London ; they subsequently lived in
Sacramento, California , USA. Seven months later, they settled in
Los Angeles, California . She also has a brother named Marco Jovovich born in 1988. At the age of eleven, Jovovich was spotted by the photographer
Richard Avedon , who featured her in
Revlon 's "Most Unforgettable Women in the World" advertisements. In October 1987, she was featured on the cover of the Italian fashion magazine
Lei , which was the first of her many cover shoots. In 1988, she also made her first professional model contract. Later she made it to the cover of
The Face , which led to new contracts and covers of the
Vogue
and
Cosmopolitan . Jovovich is also an "international spokesmodel" for
L'Oreal
cosmetics and was the highest paid
supermodel
in 2004. Milla's mother was directing her in her artistic career, by signing her up to an actors' school in
California ; [4]
she finished as the best pupil, as she did in the
ballet
school. [4]
She continued to act and in
1988 , appeared in her first film role, the romance thriller
Two Moon Junction . In
1991 , Jovovich had a starring role in the romance adventure sequel
Return to the Blue Lagoon , opposite
Brian Krause , which led to comparisons between her and
child model -turned-actress,
Brooke Shields
(who had starred in the original
Blue Lagoon ).
Also notable was her role in
Dazed and Confused
in 1993 wherein she sang lines from "The Alien Song", from her album
The Divine Comedy
though. She will appear in the third film in the Resident Evil series titled
Resident Evil: Extinction . Jovovich married actor
Shawn Andrews
in October of 1992, while filming
Dazed and Confused
together; the marriage was
annulled
by her mother a month later. She married
The Fifth Element
director
Luc Besson
in 1997, but the two divorced in 1999. Jovovich also dated
Red Hot Chili Peppers
guitarist
John Frusciante
for several months in 2000 and was linked to actor
Stephen Dorff . She also had a relationship with
Jamiroquai
ex-bassist
Stuart Zender , during which time they both lived in
London . Most recently she has appeared in public with Japanese soccer star
Hidetoshi Nakata , but is purported to be engaged to writer/director
Paul W. S. Anderson . She is pregnant with
Paul W.S. Anderson 's child; a girl, expected in November 2007. The couple has stated that they "would love to [get married], but maybe after the baby.
Jovovich is a
polyglot
- she fluently speaks
Russian ,
French ,
English
and
Serbian . http://www.millaj.com/
