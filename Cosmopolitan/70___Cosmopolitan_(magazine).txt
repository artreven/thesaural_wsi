Welcome to my World
What in the world is a grown woman doing collecting Barbie dolls, let
alone blogging about it? It mean,
really ?! What is the world
coming to? LOL I've heard those sentiments so many times and guess what?
I
don't
care. I love my Barbies!
The name of this
blog came from my brother. He would look at the Barbies in my bedroom
and the dolls that came in when I ordered, shake his head and say
"Vanessa,
Don't just play Barbie, be Barbie!"
Thus the title of
this blog. If he had any idea that he would contribute to this I'm sure
he would have kept that comment to himself. Anyhoo, I'm just doing
this to have fun and relieve a bit of stress. I'm also incorporating my
love for fashion and accessories into this blog. Stay tuned and feel
free to join in. :)

Barbie: Miss America Dr. Debbye Turner
From
debbyeturner.com
I never dreamed, as a little
girl, that I would one day become Miss America. I didn’t really want to.
I always loved animals. And, except for a brief time in elementary
school when I thought I wanted to be a teacher, I always wanted to be a
veterinarian. Since I was a young girl, I knew that the expensive
veterinary education was way beyond my family’s financial abilities. So I
began looking for scholarship opportunities to help get me through
veterinary school.
When the Director of the Miss
Jonesboro pageant approached me about entering her “local” pageant which
is in the Miss America System, I was more then willing because she told
me that the Miss America Scholarship Program was the largest source of
scholarship for women in the world. She then told me that I could win
tens of thousands of dollars if I won a state pageant and went on to the
Miss America competition. I knew right away that this might be my
ticket to paying for veterinary school!
But before I met the Miss
Jonesboro Director, I had participated in two other pageants. Thanks to
the encouragement and inspiration of my church choir director, I entered
my very first pageant, “Miss Black Teenage World.” I was fifteen at the
time. All my friends were in it too. It was more fun than competition.
Still my natural tendency to want to win made my First Runner-Up
placement a bit of a disappointment. But I did enjoy the experience, so
when the high school counselor announced the Junior Miss Program was
looking for participants, I signed up. I went on to win the title of
Northeast Arkansas Junior. And placed in the “Top 8” at the Arkansas
Junior Miss Program. I was later told that I was “too sophisticated” for
the Junior Miss Program and that I should consider the Miss America
program.
In 1983,
I was nominated to represent the FBLA (Future Business Leaders of
America) in a high school pageant. I gladly accepted. I won! That’s
where I met the lady from the Miss Jonesboro Pageant. So later that
year, I entered my first pageant in the Miss America system, the Miss
Jonesboro Pageant. The road was long to the Miss America stage. You see,
I HAD to win a “state pageant” in order to get to the Miss America
pageant. It took seven years, eleven tries in two states to get there. I
entered four local pageants in the Miss Arkansas system. I won three of
them, which meant that I went to the Miss Arkansas pageant three times.
But I could never win the Miss Arkansas title. So after that third
failed attempt, I changed my method. By this time, I was a veterinary
student at the University of Missouri-Columbia. So, since I was a
student in the state of Missouri, I was eligible for the Missouri
preliminaries. So in February of 1989 I entered the Miss Columbia
pageant and won. I went on to the Miss Missouri pageant that summer and
won. In September, I became Miss America 1990. And my life changed
forever...

Comme
des Garçons Barbie
From the
Telegraph :
The Comme des Garçons Barbie doll by Japanese fashion
designer, Rei Kawakubo, comes in a Jingle Flowers box. Kawakubo has
designed a multicolored, silk dress, with a full, asymmetric skirt that
stands away from the body – perfect for Barbie’s Christmas social whirl.
The
dress is in a photo-style, print graphic and forms part of ‘Jingle
Flowers’, the Comme des Garçons ‘new nonsense’ Christmas range.
The
limited edition Barbie is part of the Barbie Collector Platinum Label
collection, and comes in its own box, featuring the Jingle Flowers
print, and display stand.
Comme des Garçons Barbie was launched in
Tokyo last week and sold out.

Heidi
Klum Gets Doll'd Up…Fabulous! [VIDEO]
Here’s a video capturing a bit of the
discussion on the design for the
Heidi Klum
addition
to Mattel’s Blonde Ambition Collection. She worked with the
always-fabulous Robert Best, one of my favorite Barbie designers. If you
recall, he was a contestant on Project Runway a couple of seasons ago.
Anyhoo,
Heidi’s doll is gorgeous. That dress is oh so cute. (“If it’s not pink,
it’s not good.” Loved that comment!) And those shoes!!! OMG Everything
works well on this doll; I can hardly wait to redress another doll in
that fabulous ensemble.

Real-Life
Barbie: Cindy Crawford
From Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Crawford
Cynthia Ann "Cindy" Crawford
(born February 20, 1966) is a former
American
model . Known
for her trademark
mole
just
above her lip, Crawford has adorned hundreds of magazine covers
throughout her career. She was named #3 on
VH1 's 40 Hottest Hotties of
the 90s. Her success at modeling made her a celebrity that has led to
roles in television and film, and to work as a spokesperson.
Early life
Crawford
was born in
DeKalb, Illinois ,
the daughter of Jennifer Sue Crawford-Moluf (née Walker) and John
Crawford. [1] [2]
She was discovered at the age of 16 by a newspaper photographer. He
noticed Cindy at work during her summer job of
detasseling
corn and
took a picture of her. The photo and positive feedback she received
were enough to convince her to take up modeling. She entered the Elite
Model Management's Look of the Year contest at 17 and was the runner-up.
The
Elite
modeling agency
in Chicago then started representing her.
Crawford
graduated from
DeKalb
High School
in 1984, as
valedictorian . [3]
She won an academic
scholarship
to study
chemical
engineering
at
Northwestern
University , which she attended for only
one quarter . She
dropped
out
in order to pursue a full-time modeling career. After working
for photographer
Victor Skrebneski
in
Chicago ,
Cindy moved to
Manhattan
in 1986; she
was signed with the Elite New York modeling agency.
In
1987, she briefly appeared during the opening credits of the
Michael J. Fox
film
The Secret
of My Succe$s .
Career
During the 1980s and
1990s, Cindy Crawford was among the most popular
supermodels , and a
ubiquitous presence on magazine covers,
runways ,
and in fashion campaigns. She was repeatedly and frequently featured on
the cover of many magazines, including:
Vogue ,
W ,
People ,
Harper's Bazaar ,
Elle ,
Cosmopolitan ,
and
Allure . A
partial count in 1998 totalled over 400 appearances. [4]
Crawford also appeared in many fashion campaigns during her career,
including those for
Gianni Versace ,
Escada ,
Revlon ,
Ink . She has
also worked for
Omega ,
Maybelline ,
and
Clairol .
Fashion
designer
Michael Kors
summed
up her impact:
"Cindy changed the perception of the ‘sexy American
girl’ from classic blue eyed blonde to a more sultry brunette with
brains, charm, and professionalism to spare." [11]
After modeling
Crawford
quit modeling in 2000. She continues to provide
celebrity
endorsement
for a variety of projects. In 2005, Crawford created a
line of beauty products with Dr. Jean-Louis Sebagh called Meaningful
Beauty for
Guthy-Renker .
Crawford has admitted to regularly receiving certain cosmetic
procedures, including
Botox ,
collagen , and vitamin
injections. She first saw a
plastic surgeon
at the age of 29. [12]
In
2005, Crawford launched a new line of furniture under the "Cindy
Crawford Home Collection" name. This collection is manufactured by
HM
Richards Inc. , and is sold through many retailers including
Art Van Furniture
and
Rooms To Go . She
assisted in the creation of the line by directing the designers to
include certain features, colors, or styles that fit the needs of
families or reflected her own tastes. [13]
She also has a furniture line with
Raymour &
Flanigan
and will launch another home goods line with
J. C. Penney
in late 2009. [14]
This
one-of-a-kind Cindy Crawford Barbie was designed by Robert Best for a
charity auction. The winning bidder paid $33,000 for this doll.
I
think this Chocolate Obsession Barbie doll looks like Cindy Crawford!

Bond Girl: Die Another Day Barbie ~ Halle Berry as Jinx
This doll is a must have for my
collection. I love dolls with short hairdos and IMHO, Halle Berry has
never looked better than when she rocked this style. It is likely this
doll will serve as an excellent model for other doll fashions just as
Ms. Berry does IRL. Anyhoo, I'll be sure to share photos with you.

Christian
Louboutin Barbie #1: Love the Shoes!
This is the first of three dolls in
the Christian Louboutin series of dolls from Barbie® Collector. It
comes straight from the "My Year in Paris" dairy calendar’s September
scene—Barbie vividly dreaming of being a jewel thief on the rooftops of
Paris with her sophisticated partner in crime, Christian Louboutin.
Barbie wears a sleek, black catsuit with hood, headband and ultra-chic
Differa gold sandals by Christian Louboutin.
The
Doll comes with four pairs of Barbie shoes by Christian Louboutin each
with the signature red sole, miniature shoe boxes and cloth bags. Shoes
include the Differa gold sandals, Altameche Leopard boots, the Claudia
ankle straps in Barbie 219 Pink and the Belle Ankle shoes in black.
Monsieur
Louboutin ruffled many feathers earlier this year when he declared a
redesign of Barbie's legs would be required before the doll could wear
his creations. It seems the Barbie we've known and loved has fat ankles
but let's not go there, okay? His shoes are fab so I may have to buy the
doll just to get them!

Today
is World AIDS Day
From
Avert :
Started
on 1st December 1988, World AIDS Day is about raising money, increasing
awareness, fighting prejudice and improving education. The World AIDS
Day theme for 2009 is 'Universal Access and Human Rights'. World AIDS
Day is important in reminding people that HIV has not gone away, and
that there are many things still to be done.
According to
UNAIDS estimates, there are now 33.4 million people living with HIV,
including 2.1 million children. During 2008 some 2.7 million people
became newly infected with the virus and an estimated 2 million people
died from AIDS. Around half of all people who become infected with HIV
do so before they are 25 and are killed by AIDS before they are 35.
The
vast majority of people with
HIV
and
AIDS
live in lower- and middle-income countries. But
HIV today is a threat to men, women and children on all continents
around
the world .

The
Barbie Basics Collection: Permission to Play, Uh, I Meant Redress and
Accessorize
The new Barbie Basics Models
Collection 001 is perfect for collectors who love to redress and
accessorize their dolls. I confess that would be me. I have bought dolls
just for their fabulous ensemble or accessories to adorn another doll.
Thank you for this collection, Mattel.
I must
tell you that I’d planned to only purchase three of the dolls until I
saw these
photos
on Flickr . All of the dolls are so much more appealing than the
photos on the Barbie Collector site.
Here’s more info
about the Collection:
Customize. Personalize.
Play. Barbie Basics is all about permission to play. Part of the Barbie
Basics Collection, this collection of dolls and fashions is all about
customizing the fashion staple, the "Little Black Dress," and making it
your own! This collection includes 12 different dolls each of which is
dressed in a different style of a "Little Black Dress.” Barbie Basics
Accessories, sold separately, help you personalize your very own "Little
Black Dress" Barbie! As you probably already know, the
entire collection is on back order on Barbie Collector and pre-order at
many doll dealers on the internet. There may be a few available at your
local Toys R Us or other large stores. Shop wisely, as the dolls are
advertised on the internet for a wide range of prices.
Let’s
hope Mattel produces a sufficient quantity of these creations but
remember this is Collection 001 so let's try to exercise restraint. LOL

Barbie
Goes Muslim (for charity) and Causes International Controversy
Barbie has been almost every legitimate
profession one can imagine. She's also been from several countries
around the world too. Barbie has been praised for encouraging girls to
be all they can be and criticized for unrealistic body measurements.
She's had houses, automobiles, motorcycles, clothing, jewelry, etc. etc.
Now Barbie is the center of controversy again
as Italian designer Eliana Lorena has created Burka Barbie for a
fundraising auction at
Sotheby's . The doll
is part of a 500-Barbie doll collection. Checkout:

Barbie
Collector Catalog Spring Preview 2010
My Barbie Collector catalog
arrived with an awesome cover of the Christian Louboutin Barbie from the
2010 "My Year in Paris" diary calendar. The mixture of Barbie with real
people is so fabulous!
This catalog is
definitely a keepsake. The folks at Barbie Collector put together a
catalog with offerings that can be described as HOT...HOT...HOT! I'll
blog about some of the dolls in the catalog but it definitely has an
adult flavor this time. The problem is I'll probably have to eat Ramen
Noodles all year just to afford the Barbie dolls and accoutrements that I
want!
Smooches...

Barbie History
Barbie was named for a real young lady from California named Barbara
Handler. Barbie, the teen fashion doll that debuted in 1959 was created
by Barbara's mom, Ruth Handler, who named the doll after her daughter
and the rest is doll history.
