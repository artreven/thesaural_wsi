Kenneth Gilbert More
CBE (20 September 1914 – 12 July 1982) was a highly successful English film actor [1]
during the post-World War II era and starred in many feature films, often in the role of an archetypal carefree and happy-go-lucky middle-class gentleman.
Early life
Kenneth More was born in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, the only son of Charles Gilbert More, a Royal Naval Air Service pilot, and Edith Winifred Watkins, the daughter of a Cardiff solicitor. He was educated at Victoria College, Jersey. He spent part of his childhood in the Channel Islands, where his father was general manager of Jersey Eastern Railways. After he left school, he followed the family tradition by training as a civil engineer. He gave up his training and worked for a while in Sainsbury’s.
When More was 17 his father died, and he applied to join the RAF, but failed the medical test for equilibrium. He went to Canada, intending to work as a fur trapper, but was sent back for lacking immigration papers.
Acting career
On his return, a family friend, Vivian Van Damm, took him on as assistant manager at the Windmill Theatre, where his job included spotting audience members misbehaving or using opera glasses to look at the nude players during its
Revudeville
variety shows. [2]
He was soon promoted to playing straight man in the
Revudeville
comedy routines. This led to regular work in repertory, including Newcastle and Wolverhampton, performing in plays such as
Burke and Hare
and
Dracula’s Daughter . He continued this work until World War II, during which time he served as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, seeing active service aboard the cruiser HMS
Aurora
and the aircraft carrier HMS
Victorious , returning to acting in 1946. After various roles in the West End, he attracted particular attention through his performance as Freddie in Terence Rattigan’s
The Deep Blue Sea .
In the 1950s, he entered into a contract with the Rank Organisation, which led to a successful career in starring roles for a decade. He enjoyed great success in films of the 1950s after winning a BAFTA Award as best newcomer for
Doctor in the House
in 1954. Possibly his most famous role was that of the Royal Air Force fighter ace, Douglas Bader, in
Reach for the Sky
in 1956. He played the lead role in the Titanic movie
A Night to Remember
in 1958. He specialised in likeable, unflappable English heroes (“an air of hectoring confidence … heroic in a cocky big-brotherly way”), [3]
a persona that could in some roles show darker aspects, as with the controlling Crichton in
The Admirable Crichton
and the brash Ambrose Claverhouse in
Genevieve . In 1959, Rank’s John Davis gave permission for More to work outside his contract to appear in
The Guns of Navarone . More, however, made the mistake of heckling and swearing at Davis at a BAFTA dinner at the Dorchester, losing both the role (which went to David Niven) and his contract with Rank. [2]
He later appeared in a number of all-star war films, among them
Sink the Bismarck!
(1960),
The Longest Day
(1962),
Battle of Britain
(1969), and
Oh! What a Lovely War
(1969).
His film parts got smaller in the 1960s, with some thinking his popularity declined when he left his wife to live with Angela Douglas. [4]
His popularity recovered through West End stage performances and television roles, especially following his success in
The Forsyte Saga , and as the title character in ATV’s 1974
Father Brown . He is also known for his role as the Ghost of Christmas Present in 1970′s
Scrooge .
He stood in the wings to replace Bernard Lee as M in the James Bond film
Live and Let Die
when it wasn’t known if an ill Lee would be able to appear.
Personal life
More was married three times. His first marriage in 1939 to actress Beryl Johnstone (one daughter, Susan, born 1941) ended in divorce in 1946. He married Mabel Edith “Bill” Barkby in 1952 (one daughter, Sarah, born 1954) but left her in 1968 for Angela Douglas, an actress 26 years his junior, causing considerable estrangement from friends and family. He was married to Douglas (whom he nicknamed “Shrimp”) [2]
from 17 March 1968 until his death.
Kenneth More published two autobiographies,
Happy Go Lucky
in 1959 and
More or Less
in 1978. In the second book he related how he had had since childhood a recurrent dream of something akin to a huge wasp descending towards him. During the war he experienced a Nazi Stuka bomber descending in just such a manner. After that he claimed never to have had that dream again.
He died in London from Parkinson’s disease on 12 July 1982, aged 67, and was cremated at Putney Vale Crematorium.
The Kenneth More Theatre, named in his honour, is in Ilford, Essex. The robot Kryten in the TV series
Red Dwarf
was named after More’s character in
The Admirable Crichton .

Interview:
David Jude Heyworth Law
(born 29 December 1972), known professionally as
Jude Law , is an English actor, film producer and director. [1] [2]
He began acting with the National Youth Music Theatre in 1987, and had his first television role in 1989. After starring in films directed by Andrew Niccol, Clint Eastwood and David Cronenberg, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1999 for his performance in Anthony Minghella’s
The Talented Mr. Ripley . In 2000 he won a Best Supporting Actor BAFTA Award for his work in the film. In 2003, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in another Minghella film,
Cold Mountain .
In 2006, he was one of the top ten most bankable movie stars in Hollywood. [3]
In 2007, he received an Honorary César and he was named a Chevalier of the
Ordre des Arts et des Lettres
by the French government. [4] [5]
In April 2011, it was announced that he would be a member of the main competition jury at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. [6]
Early life
Jude Law was born in Lewisham, South London, the second child of teachers Peter Law and Margaret Heyworth. [1]
He grew up in Blackheath, an area in the Borough of Lewisham, [7]
and was educated at John Ball Primary School in Blackheath and Kidbrooke School in Kidbrooke, before attending the Alleyn’s School.
1980s–1990s
In 1987 Law began acting with National Youth Music Theatre. [8]
He played various roles in the Edinburgh Fringe-awarded play
The Ragged Child . One of his first major stage roles was Foxtrot Darling in Philip Ridley’s
The Fastest Clock In The Universe . Law went on to appear as Michael in the West End production of Jean Cocteau’s tragicomedy
Les Parents terribles , directed by Sean Mathias. For this play he was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Newcomer, and he received the Ian Charleson Award for Outstanding Newcomer.
Following a title change to
Indiscretions , the play was reworked and transferred to Broadway in 1995, where Law acted opposite Kathleen Turner, Roger Rees and Cynthia Nixon. [9] [10]
This role earned him a Tony Award nomination [11]
and the Theatre World Award. [12]
In 1989, Law got his first television role in a movie based on the Beatrix Potter children’s book,
The Tailor of Gloucester . After minor roles in British television, including a two-year stint in the Granada TV soap opera
Families
and the leading role in the BFI /Channel 4 short
The Crane , Law had his breakthrough with the British crime drama
Shopping , which also featured his future wife Sadie Frost.
In 1997, he became more widely known with his role in the Oscar Wilde bio-pic
Wilde . Law won the “Most Promising Newcomer” award from the Evening Standard British Film Awards for his role as Lord Alfred “Bosie” Douglas, the glamorous lover of Stephen Fry’s Oscar Wilde. [13]
In Andrew Niccol’s science fiction film
Gattaca
he played the role of a disabled former swimming star living in a eugenics-obsessed dystopia. In Clint Eastwood’s
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil
he played the role of the ill-fated hustler murdered by an art dealer, played by Kevin Spacey. He also played a mob hitman in Sam Mendes’s 1930s period drama
Road to Perdition .
2000s
Jude Law at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival
In 2001, Law starred as Russian sniper Vasily Zaytsev in the film
Enemy At The Gates .
Law was one of the Top Ten 2006 A-list of the most bankable movie stars in Hollywood, following the criteria of James Ulmer in the Ulmer Scale. [3]
On 1 March 2007, he was honoured with the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres conferred by the French government, in recognition of his contribution to World Cinema Arts. He was named a
Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres . [4]
He has been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in
The Talented Mr. Ripley
in 1999, and then again for the Academy Award for Best Actor for
Cold Mountain
in 2003. Both films were directed by Anthony Minghella.
For
The Talented Mr. Ripley , he learned to play saxophone and earned a MTV Movie Award nomination with Matt Damon and Fiorello for performing the song “ Tu vuò fà l’americano ” by Renato Carosone and Nicola Salerno. He learned ballet dancing for the film
A.I. Artificial Intelligence
(2001). [14] [15]
Law, an admirer of Laurence Olivier, used the actor’s image in the 2004 film
Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow . Using computer graphics, footage of the young Olivier was merged into the film, playing Dr. Totenkopf, a mysterious scientific genius and supervillain. [16] [17]
He portrayed the title character in
Alfie , the remake of Bill Naughton’s 1966 film, playing the role originated by Michael Caine. He took on another of Caine’s earlier roles in the 2007 film
Sleuth
adapted by Nobel Laureate in Literature Harold Pinter, while Caine played the role originated by Sir Laurence Olivier. [18]
Law is one of three actors who took over the role of actor Heath Ledger in Terry Gilliam’s film
The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus . Along with Law, actors Johnny Depp and Colin Farrell portray “three separate dimensions in the film.” [19] [20]
He appeared opposite Forest Whitaker in the dark science fiction comedy
Repo Men
and as Dr. Watson in Guy Ritchie’s adaption of
Sherlock Holmes , alongside Robert Downey, Jr. and Rachel McAdams. Law stars as a celebrity supermodel in the film
Rage . [21]
Hamlet
In May 2009, Law returned to the London stage to portray the title role in Shakespeare’s
Hamlet
at the Donmar Warehouse West End season at Wyndham’s Theatre. The BBC reported “a fine and solid performance” but included other reviews of Law’s interpretation that were mixed. [22]
There was a further run of the production at Elsinore Castle in Denmark from 25–30 August 2009. [23]
In September 2009 the production transferred to the Broadhurst Theatre in New York. Again, the critics failed to agree on the merit of Law’s interpretation: London’s
Daily Mail
found only positive reviews, [24]
but
The Washington Post
felt that the much-anticipated performance was “highly disappointing”. [25]
Nonetheless, he was nominated for the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play. [26]
In January 2010 at the Critics’ Circle Theatre Awards ceremony he was presented with the John and Wendy Trewin Award for Best Shakespearean Performance for his 2009 Hamlet. [27]
Advertising
Law is the face of the male perfume of Dior,
Dior Homme Sport . [28] [29] [30]
Since 2005, he has represented Dunhill as an “apparel ambassador” in Asia. [31]
In 2008, he became the international face of Dunhill and appears in the worldwide advertising campaigns. [32]
In 2002, he directed a Respect for Animals anti-fur cinema commercial. The commercial, titled “Fur and Against”, used music composed by Gary Kemp, and included appearances by Law, Chrissie Hynde, Moby, George Michael, Danny Goffey, Rhys Ifans, Sadie Frost, Helena Christensen, Sir Paul McCartney, Mel C, and Stella McCartney. [33]
Realtime Movie
In spring 2007 Jude Law shot the Jason Martin-directed short film “Realtime Movie Trailer” at Borough Market, South London. Instead of promoting a film, this “trailer”, which appeared among regular trailers in selected cinemas across London starting 19 November 2007, advertised a live event, Realtime Movie, by Polish artist Paweł Althamer. Hundreds turned up for this–unfilmed–re-enactment in real time of the sequence of events shown in “Realtime Movie Trailer” by the same actors, including Althamer as a Polish laborer, held at Borough Market on 30 November 2007. The performance was commissioned by Tate Modern as part of its “The World as a Stage” exhibition which explored the boundaries between arts and reality. [34] [35] [36] [37]
Charity activities
In 2004, Law launched a campaign to raise £2.5 million towards the Young Vic Theatre’s £12.5 million redevelopment project. [38] [39]
He is currently Chair of the Young Vic committee and has said that he is proud to help make the Young Vic “a nurturing bed” for young directors. [40]
In 2006, he joined Robbie Williams in the “Soccer Aid” celebrity football match to benefit UNICEF. [41]
In 2006, he starred in an anthology of Samuel Beckett readings and performances directed by director Anthony Minghella. With the Beckett Gala Evening at the Reading Town Hall, more than £22,000 was donated for the Macmillan Cancer Support. [42]
Also in 2006, Frost and Law directed a Shakespeare play in a South African orphanage. He travelled to Durban with Frost and their children in order to help children who have lost their parents to AIDS. In July 2007, as patron of the charity, he helped kick off the month-long tour of the AIDS-themed musical
Thula Sizwe
by The Young Zulu Warriors. [43]
Also in 2007, he encouraged the Friends of the Earth/The Big Ask campaign, asking British Government to take action against climate change. [44] [45] [46]
Law does charity work for organizations such as Make Poverty History, the Rhys Daniels Trust, and the WAVE Trauma Centre. [47]
He supports the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Pride of Britain Awards. [48] [49] [50] [51]
He is the chair of the Music For Tomorrow Foundation to help rebuild Katrina-devastated New Orleans. [52] [53]
Jude Law is an ambassador of HRH The Prince of Wales’ Children and the Arts Foundation. [54]
He supports Breast Cancer Care, [55]
and in December 2008 he supported the Willow Foundation with a small canvas for their campaign Stars on Canvas. [56]
In April 2009 he supported the charity Education Africa with the gift of a mask he had painted and signed himself. The campaign was launched on eBay by Education Africa. [57]
Stars including Dame Judi Dench and Jude Law have helped save St Stephen’s Church in Hampstead. The celebrities supported the campaign, which raised £4.5 million to refurbish the Victorian church in north London. The building reopened in March 2009 as an arts and community centre. [58] [59]
Peace activities
In July 2007, Jude Law and Jeremy Gilley were in Afghanistan over a period of 10 days to document peace commitments and activities there for an upcoming film and for marking the UN International Day of Peace. [60] [61]
Accompanied by UNICEF Representative Catherine Mbengue, they travelled and filmed in treacherous areas of eastern Afghanistan with a film crew, interviewing children, government ministers, community leaders and UN officials. [62] [63]
They also filmed at schools and visited various UNICEF-supported programmes inside and outside the capital Kabul. [64] [65]
The efforts of Peace One Day are coordinated in celebration of the annual International Day of Peace, on 21 September. [66] [67]
The film, named
The Day After Peace , premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. [68] [69] [70]
On 21 September 2008, the film was shown at a gala screening at the Royal Albert Hall. [71]
On 30 August 2008, Law and Gilley returned to Afghanistan to help keep a momentum around Peace Day. They met President Hamid Karzai, top NATO and UN officials, and members of the aid community. They also screened the new documentary about the efforts in support of peace. The documentary features activities that took place throughout Afghanistan in 2007. It also highlights support from UNICEF and the WHO for the peaceful immunization of 1.4 million children against polio in insecure areas. [72] [73] [74] [75]
Belarus
In 2011 Law joined street protests against Alexander Lukashenko and Lukashenko’s brutal crackdown on the Belarusian democracy movement. [76]
Personal life
Law’s parents live in France, where they run their own drama school and theatre. [77]
His sister Natasha is a well-regarded illustrator and artist, living in London. [78] [79]
Law met actress Sadie Frost while working on the film
Shopping . They married on 2 September 1997 and divorced on 29 October 2003. He is the father of a stepson, Finlay Munro (born 20 September 1990), and three biological children with Frost: son Rafferty (born 6 October 1996), daughter Iris (born 25 October 2000), and son Rudy (born 10 September 2002). [80] [81]
While making the film
Alfie
in late 2003, Law and co-star Sienna Miller began a relationship, becoming engaged on Christmas Day 2004. [82]
Miller and Law separated in November 2006. [83]
On 29 July 2009, it was announced that Law would become a father for the fourth time following a brief relationship with New Zealand model Samantha Burke in 2008. [84] [85]
Burke gave birth to a daughter, Sophia, on 22 September 2009 in New York. [86] [87]
In December 2009, it was reported that Law and Miller had rekindled their relationship after starring in separate shows on Broadway in New York City in the Fall of 2009. [88]
They spent Christmas 2009 in Barbados, along with three of Law’s children. [89]
They announced they had split again in February 2011. [90]

Years active:
1932 – 2005
Interview:
Sir John Mills
CBE (22 February 1908 – 23 April 2005), born
Lewis Ernest Watts Mills , was an English actor who made more than 120 films in a career spanning seven decades.
Life and career
Mills was born at the Watts Naval School in North Elmham, Norfolk, England, and grew up in Belton, where his father was the headmaster of the village school [1]
and in Felixstowe, Suffolk. He was educated at Norwich High School for Boys [2] , where it is said that his initials can still be seen carved into the brickwork on the side of the building in Upper St. Giles Street. He made his acting debut on the stage of the Sir John Leman School in Beccles in a performance of
A Midsummer Night’s Dream
when he played the part of Puck. Upon leaving school he worked as a clerk at a corn merchants in Ipswich.
Mills took an early interest in acting, making his professional debut at the London Hippodrome in
The Five O’Clock Girl
in 1929. He also starred in the Noël Coward revue
Words and Music . He made his film debut in
The Midshipmaid
(1932), and appeared as Colley in the 1939 film version of
Goodbye, Mr Chips , opposite Robert Donat.
In September 1939, at the start of World War II, Mills enlisted in the Royal Engineers. [3]
He was later commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. But in 1942 he received a medical discharge because of a stomach ulcer. [3]
He starred in Noël Coward’s
In Which We Serve .
Mills took the lead in
Great Expectations
in 1946, and subsequently made his career playing traditionally British heroes such as Captain Scott in
Scott of the Antarctic
(1948). Over the next decade he became particularly associated with war dramas, such as
The Colditz Story
(1954),
Above Us the Waves
(1955) and
Ice-Cold in Alex
(1958). He often acted in the roles of people who are not at all exceptional, but become heroes due to their common sense, generosity and right judgment. Altogether he appeared in over 120 films.
From 1959 through the mid-1960s, Mills starred in several films alongside his daughter Hayley. Their first film together was the 1959 crime drama
Tiger Bay , in which John plays a police detective investigating a murder that Hayley’s character witnessed. Following Hayley’s rise to fame in
Pollyanna
(1960) and the 1961 family comedy
The Parent Trap , John and Hayley again starred together, in the 1965 teen sailing adventure
The Truth About Spring , the 1964 drama
The Chalk Garden
(with Deborah Kerr in the lead role), and the 1966 comedy-drama
The Family Way , in which John plays an insecure, overbearing father and Hayley plays his son’s newlywed wife.
As Col. Barrow in
Tunes of Glory , Mills won the best Actor Award at the 1960 Venice Film Festival. For his role as the village idiot in
Ryan’s Daughter
(1970) — a complete departure from his usual style — Mills won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His most famous television role was probably as the title character in
Quatermass
for ITV in 1979. Also on the small screen, in 1974 he starred as Captain Tommy “The Elephant” Devon in the six-part television drama series
The Zoo Gang , about a group of former underground freedom fighters from World War II, with Brian Keith, Lilli Palmer and Barry Morse.
Mills also starred as
Gus: The Theatre Cat
in the filmed version of the musical
Cats
in 1998.
In 2000, Mills released his extensive home movie footage in a documentary film entitled
Sir John Mills’ Moving Memories , with interviews with Mills, his children Hayley, Juliet and Jonathan and Richard Attenborough. The film was directed and edited by Marcus Dillistone, and features behind the scenes footage and stories from films such as
Ice-Cold in Alex
and
Dunkirk . In addition the film also includes home footage of many of John Mills’ friends and fellow cast members including Laurence Olivier, Harry Andrews, Walt Disney, David Niven, Dirk Bogarde, Rex Harrison and Tyrone Power.
Mills’ last cinema appearance was playing a tramp in
Lights 2
(directed by Marcus Dillistone); shot at Pinewood Studios, he was photographed by cinematographer Jack Cardiff. They had last worked together on
Scott of the Antarctic
in 1948. Their combined age was 186 years, a cinema record.
Honours
He was appointed a Commander of Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1960. In 1976 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.
In 2002, he received a Fellowship of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), the highest award given by the Academy, and was named a Disney Legend by The Walt Disney Company.
Family
The Wick on Richmond Hill in Richmond, Greater London, was the family home for many years.
Mills’s sister Annette Mills was known as the partner of the puppet “Muffin”, in the BBC Television series
Muffin the Mule
between 1946 and 1955. Her grand-daughter is the actress Susie Blake.
His first wife was the actress Aileen Raymond. They were married in 1927 and divorced in 1941.
His second wife was the dramatist Mary Hayley Bell. Their marriage on 16 January 1941 lasted 64 years, until his death in 2005. They were married in a rushed civil ceremony, due to the war, and it was not until 60 years later that they had their union blessed in church. [4]
They had two daughters, Juliet, star of television’s
Nanny and the Professor
and Hayley, a Disney child star who starred in
Pollyanna ,
The Parent Trap
and
Whistle Down the Wind
and one son, Jonathan Mills. In 1947 Mills appeared with his daughters in the film
So Well Remembered . Mills’s grandson by his daughter Hayley, Crispian Mills, is a musician, best known for his work with the alternative rock group Kula Shaker.
Death
In the years leading up to his death, he appeared on television only on special occasions, his sight having failed almost completely in 1992. After that, his film roles were brief but notable cameos.
He died aged 97 on 23 April 2005 in Denham, Buckinghamshire, [5]
following a chest infection. A few months after Sir John’s death, Mary Hayley Bell (Lady Mills) died on 1 December 2005. Sir John and Lady Mills are buried in Denham Churchyard.

Name:
John Vincent Hurt
Born:
22 nd
January 1940
Occupation:
Actor
Years active:
1961 – present
Alien scene:
John Vincent Hurt , CBE (born 22 January 1940) is an English actor, known for his leading roles as John Merrick in
The Elephant Man , Winston Smith in
Nineteen Eighty-Four , Mr. Braddock in
The Hit , Stephen Ward in
Scandal
and Quentin Crisp in
The Naked Civil Servant , Caligula in the television series, I, Claudius, and
An Englishman in New York . Recognizable for his distinctive rich voice, [1]
he has also enjoyed a successful voice acting career, starring in films such as
Watership Down ,
The Lord of the Rings
and
Dogville , as well as BBC television series
Merlin .
Hurt initially came to prominence for his role as Richard Rich in the 1966 film
A Man for All Seasons , and has since appeared in such popular motion pictures as:
Alien ,
Midnight Express ,
Rob Roy ,
V for Vendetta ,
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , the
Harry Potter
film series and the
Hellboy
film series. Hurt is one of England’s best-known, most prolific and sought-after actors, and has had a versatile film career spanning six decades. [2]
He is also known for his many Shakespearean roles. [3]
Hurt has received multiple awards and honours throughout his career including three BAFTA Awards and a Golden Globe Award, with six and two nominations respectively, as well as two Academy Award nominations. [4]
His character’s final scene in
Alien
is consistently named as one of the most memorable in cinematic history. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]
Early life
John Hurt was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, when his father was vicar of Shirebrook. [12]
He is the son of Phyllis (née Massey), an amateur actress and engineer, and Arnould Herbert Hurt, a mathematician who became an Anglican clergyman. [3]
Hurt has an older brother, Br. Anselm (born Michael), a Roman Catholic convert, who became a monk and writer at Glenstal Abbey, to whose books his younger brother John has contributed. [13]
John Hurt also has an adopted sister, Monica. His father was a vicar at St John in Sunderland, but in 1937 he moved his family to Derbyshire, where he became Perpetual Curate of Holy Trinity church. When John was five, his father became the vicar of St Stephens Church at Woodville, South Derbyshire and remained there until 1952. In 1945, John’s father founded 1st Woodville (St Stephens) Scout Group which is still going strong today.
Hurt had a strict upbringing: the family lived opposite a cinema but he was not allowed to visit. He was also not permitted to mix with local children because in his parents’ view they were “too common”. [14]
Hurt’s mother died in 1975, and his father died in 1999 at the age of 95.
Education
At the age of eight he was sent to the Anglican St Michael’s Preparatory School in Otford, Kent, where he eventually developed his passion for acting. He decided he wanted to become an actor, and his first role was that of a girl in a school production
The Bluebird
(L’Oiseau Bleu) by Maurice Maeterlinck. While he was a pupil at the school he was abused by Donald Cormack (now deceased), then Senior Master of the school and later Head Teacher (until his retirement in 1981). [15]
Hurt described how Cormack would remove his two false front teeth and put his tongue in the boys’ mouths, and how he would rub their faces with his stubble. Hurt said that the experience affected him “hugely”. [16]
His father moved to St Aidan’s Church in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire. Hurt (then aged 12) became a boarder at Christ’s Hospital School (then a grammar school) in Lincoln, because he had failed the entrance exam for admission to his brother’s school. Hurt often accompanied his mother to Cleethorpes Repertory Theatre, but his parents disliked his acting ambitions and encouraged him to become an art teacher instead. His headmaster, Mr Franklin, laughed when Hurt told him he wanted to be an actor, saying “you wouldn’t stand a chance in the profession.” [14]
Aged 17, Hurt enrolled in Grimsby Art School (now the
East Coast School of Art & Design ), where he studied art. In 1959 Hurt won a scholarship allowing him to study for an Art Teachers Diploma (ATD) at Central St. Martins College in Holborn, London. Despite the scholarship, paying for his studies was financially difficult and so he persuaded some of his friends to pose nude and sold the portraits. In 1960 he won a scholarship to RADA where he trained for two years. He was then cast in small roles on TV.
Career
Hurt’s first film was
The Wild and the Willing
(1962), but his first major role was as Richard Rich in
A Man for All Seasons
(1966). His portrayal of Quentin Crisp in the 1975 TV play,
The Naked Civil Servant
gave prominence and earned him the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor. The following year, Hurt played the Roman emperor Caligula in the BBC drama serial,
I, Claudius . In 1978, he appeared in
Midnight Express , for which he won a Golden Globe, a BAFTA and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (the latter of which he lost to Christopher Walken for his performance in
The Deer Hunter ). Hurt played Hazel, the heroic rabbit leader of his warren in the film adaptation of
Watership Down
and later played the major villain, General Woundwort, in the animated television series version.
His roles at the beginning of the 1980s included Kane, the memorable first victim of the title creature in the film
Alien
(a role which he reprised as a parody in
Spaceballs ); would-be art school radical Scrawdyke in
Little Malcolm ; and “John” Merrick in the Joseph Merrick biography
The Elephant Man , for which he won a BAFTA and was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Actor. He also had a starring role in Sam Peckinpah’s critically panned but moderately successful final film,
The Osterman Weekend
(1983). Also in 1983 he starred as the Fool opposite Sir Laurence Olivier’s King in
King Lear . Hurt also appeared as Raskolnikov in the BBC series
Crime and Punishment
in 1980.
Cynthia Nixon, Hurt and Swoosie Kurtz in 2009.
Hurt has taken roles in famous political allegories, first playing the hero in an early production and then the tyrannical villain in a later work. For instance, he played Winston Smith in the 1984 adaptation of the novel
Nineteen Eighty-Four
and then assumed the role of a Big Brother-esque leader of a fascist Great Britain in the 2006 film
V for Vendetta , a movie that drew many parallels to the world of Orwell’s
1984 .
In 1985, Hurt starred in Disney’s
The Black Cauldron , voicing the film’s main antagonist, the Horned King. In 1986, Hurt provided the voiceover for
AIDS: Iceberg / Tombstone , a public information film warning of the dangers of AIDS. He had a memorable supporting role as “Bird” O’Donnell in Jim Sheridan’s 1990 film
The Field , which garnered him another BAFTA nomination. In 2001, he played Mr. Ollivander, the wand-maker, in the first Harry Potter film,
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone . He returned for the adaptation of
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , though his scenes in that film were cut. He also returned for
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows . In 1999, Hurt provided narration on the British musical group Art of Noise’s concept album
The Seduction of Claude Debussy . He was made a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in June 2004. During this time, he narrated a 4 part series on the Universe which was released on DVD in 1999. In May 2008, he appeared in Steven Spielberg’s
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
as Harold Oxley. [17]
He is also the voice of The Great Dragon, in the BBC television series, Merlin. [18]
In 2008, 33 years after
The Naked Civil Servant , Hurt reprised the role of Quentin Crisp in
An Englishman in New York . This film depicts Crisp’s later years in New York. [19]
In June 2009, Hurt played the on-screen Big Brother for Paper Zoo Theatre Company’s production of Orwell’s
Nineteen-Eighty Four . The theatre production premiered at the National Media Museum, in Bradford and will be touring during early 2010. Hurt said, “I think Paper Zoo thought it would be quite ironic to have the person who played Winston having risen in the party. From the Chestnut Tree Cafe, he’s managed to get his wits together again, now understanding that 2 and 2 make 5, and becomes Big Brother. So it tickled my fancy, and of course I looked up Paper Zoo, and they seem to me to be the sort of company that’s essential in the country as we know it, and doing a lot of really good stuff.” [20]
Hurt also did a voice in BBC tv show Merlin as the dragon, Kilgharrah, who aides the young warlock Merlin as he protects Arthur.
Hurt is due to appear alongside Ben Kingsley in a new feature entitle
Broken Dream
which will be directed by Neil Jordan in 2011. [21]
Personal life
In 1962 Arnould Hurt left his parish in Cleethorpes to become headmaster of St Michaels College in the Central American country of Belize. In that same year John Hurt first performed on the London stage and married, to actress Annette Robertson. The marriage ended in 1964. In 1967 he began his longest relationship, with the French model Marie-Lise Volpeliere-Pierrot, sister of fashion photographer Jean-Claude Volpeliere-Pierrot. The couple had planned to get married after fifteen years, when things evolved tragically on 26 January 1983: Hurt and Volpeliere-Pierrot went horse riding early in the morning near their house in Ascott-under-Wychwood, Oxfordshire, when suddenly Volpeliere-Pierrot lost her stirrup and was thrown off the horse, landing on her head in the middle of the lane. She went into a coma and died later that day.
Hurt married, secondly, on 6 September 1984 to Texan actress and old friend Donna Peacock at a local Registrar’s office. The couple moved to Kenya and tried unsuccessfully to have children through IVF. They divorced in early January 1990.

While living in Ireland he hit and killed a sheep and was brought to court over the dispute. Soon afterwards (on 24 January 1990) Hurt married American production assistant Jo Dalton whom he had met while filming
Scandal . With her he had two sons: Sasha John Vincent Hurt (born 6 February 1990) and Nick Hurt (born 5 February 1993), who are currently residing in County Waterford, Ireland. His son Nick has gone to acting school in England and wishes to follow in his father’s footsteps. This marriage ended in 1996. At one point Hurt was involved with Sarah Owen, twenty years his junior, and with whom he lived in County Wicklow, Ireland. In March 2005, Hurt married his fourth wife, advertising film producer Anwen Rees Meyers.
In January 2002, Hurt received an honorary degree from the University of Derby and in January 2006 received the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from the University of Hull.
In 2007, Hurt took part in the BBC genealogical television series
Who Do You Think You Are? ,
which investigated part of his family history. Prior to participating in the programme, Hurt had harboured a love of Ireland and was enamoured of a ‘deeply beguiling’ family legend that suggested his great-grandmother had been the illegitimate daughter of Irish nobleman, the Marquess of Sligo. The genealogical evidence uncovered seemed to contradict the family legend, rendering the ‘suggestion’ doubtful. Coincidentally, the search revealed that his great-grandmother had previously lived in Grimsby at a location within a mile of the art college at which Hurt had once enrolled. [22]
He is distantly related to author Enid Blyton on his father’s side.
Since 2006, John Hurt has been a patron of Project Harar, a UK-based charity working in Ethiopia for children with facial disfigurements. [23]
Since 2009, he has been patron of QUAD. On 25 September 2009 Hurt visited QUAD and took part in a Q&A directly preceding a screening of the film
The Night Train
as part of the festivities, celebrating the first birthday at QUAD (opened on 26 September 2008). The day after, 26 September, John Hurt was guest of honour at Derby County vs Bristol City and went on the pitch at Pride Park Stadium at half time to oversee a prize draw.

Interview:
Sir Arthur John Gielgud , OM, CH (14 April 1904 – 21 May 2000) was an English actor, director, and producer. A descendant of the renowned Terry acting family, he achieved early international acclaim for his youthful, emotionally expressive Hamlet which broke box office records on Broadway in 1937. He was known for his beautiful speaking of verse and particularly for his warm and expressive voice, which his colleague Sir Alec Guinness likened to “a silver trumpet muffled in silk”. [1] [2]
Gielgud is one of the few entertainers who have won an Oscar, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Award.
Birth and family background
John Gielgud was born in South Kensington in London to Kate Terry and Frank Gielgud. He was of theatrical lineage on his mother’s side, being the grandson of actress Kate Terry and the great nephew of Dame Ellen Terry, as well as of Marion Terry, Fred Terry, and all their actor siblings.
Gielgud’s Catholic father, Franciszek Giełgud, born 1880, was a descendant of a Lithuanian noble family residing at a manor in Gelgaudiškis (a town called Giełgudyszki in Polish), dating back to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (now a town in Marijampolė County, Lithuania). In his autobiography, Gielgud states repeatedly and clearly that his father was Polish Catholic, and mentions Gelgaudiškis as being his ancestral home from where his family and their surname originated.
His elder brother Val Gielgud came to be a pioneering influence in BBC Radio. His niece Maina Gielgud is a dancer and one time artistic director of The Australian Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet.
Early stages
After Hillside Preparatory School in Godalming, Surrey, and Westminster School, where he gained a King’s Scholarship, Gielgud trained briefly at RADA and understudied Noel Coward in Coward’s The Vortex at the Everyman Theatre in Hampstead under the direction of Norman MacDermott (1890–1977). He had his initial success as a stage actor in classical roles, first winning stardom during a successful two seasons at the Old Vic Theatre from 1929 to 1931 where his performances as Richard II and Hamlet were particularly acclaimed, the latter being the first Old Vic production to be transferred to the West End for a run. He returned to the role of Hamlet in a famous production under his own direction in 1934 at the New Theatre in the West End. He was hailed as a Broadway star in Guthrie McClintic’s production in which Lillian Gish played Ophelia in 1936. (The production’s popularity was assisted when a rival staging featuring film star Leslie Howard opened shortly afterward and was critically denounced in comparison to Gielgud’s. Gielgud’s production broke the long-run record for a Broadway “Hamlet.”) There followed a 1939 production that Gielgud again directed at the Lyceum Theatre, historic for having been the professional home for Henry Irving’s company. This was the last production to play the Lyceum until 50 years later when it was restored to host, among other shows, the hit musical The Lion King. Gielgud’s Hamlet would be later taken to Elsinore Castle in Denmark (the actual setting of the play), there was a 1944 production directed by George Rylands, and finally a 1945 production that toured the Far East under Gielgud’s own direction. In his later years, Gielgud would play the Ghost of Hamlet’s Father in productions of the play, first to Richard Burton’s Melancholy Dane on the Broadway stage which Gielgud directed in 1964, then on television with Richard Chamberlain, and finally in a radio production starring Gielgud’s protégé Kenneth Branagh.
Gielgud had triumphs in many other plays, notably his greatest popular success
Richard of Bordeaux
(1933) (a romantic version of the story of Richard II),
The Importance of Being Earnest
which he first performed at the Lyric Hammersmith in 1930 and which would remain in his repertory until 1947, and a legendary production of
Romeo and Juliet
(1935) which Gielgud directed and alternated the roles of Romeo and Mercutio with a young Laurence Olivier in his first professional Shakespearean leading role. Olivier’s performance won him an engagement as the leading man of the Old Vic Theatre the following season, starting his career as a classical actor, but he was said to have resented Gielgud’s direction and developed a wary relationship with Gielgud which resulted in Olivier turning down Gielgud’s request to play the Chorus in Olivier’s film of
Henry V
and later doing his best to block Gielgud from appearing at the Royal National Theatre when Olivier was its director. [3]

Queen’s Theatre season
Gielgud had hoped to stay in America after his Broadway performance as Hamlet in 1936 to play Richard II in New York, but director Guthrie McClintic was so certain that the production would fail in the United States that Gielgud gave up the idea (and was dismayed when Maurice Evans had a legendary success in the play on Broadway after Gielgud gave him his blessing to mount it when he decided not to).
However much Gielgud may have wished to stay in America, his return to London in 1937 had an enormous influence on the development of English Theatre. In 1937/38, he brought his celebrity and talent to bear in producing a season of plays at the Queen’s Theatre, presenting the aforementioned
Richard II ,
The School for Scandal ,
Three Sisters , and
The Merchant of Venice
with a permanent company that included himself, Peggy Ashcroft, Michael Redgrave and Alec Guinness. Although not always acknowledged for this achievement, Gielgud set a precedent in establishing a company of actors gathered together to present classics. This effort proved it could be done and shaped the development of such future theatrical institutions as the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre. Gielgud acted in all four productions and directed the two Shakespeare plays, while Tyrone Guthrie directed
The School for Scandal
and Michael Saint-Denis staged
Three Sisters .
From Sheridan Morley’s authorised biography: “Accustomed as we have now become to…the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, it is almost impossible to conceive how revolutionary John’s idea was for the West End of 1937, where there had simply been nothing like it since the heyday of Henry Irving and the actor-managers more than fifty years earlier.” Laurence Olivier said that Gielgud’s performance in
The School for Scandal
was “the best light comedy performance I have ever seen – or ever shall!” and considered his Shylock to be among his greatest impersonations, but the greatest success of the season was the production of
Three Sisters .
That production went far toward Gielgud’s successful effort to establish Chekhov’s's viability on the English-speaking stage. Gielgud’s own performance as Vershinin, along with his past successes as Treplev in
The Seagull
(1929 and 1936), and his later work in
The Cherry Orchard
(1954), and
Ivanov
(1965) were part of that Chekhovian legacy.
Shakespearean legacy
It would always be, however, for his Shakespearean work that Gielgud would be best known. In addition to Hamlet which he played over 500 times in six productions, he gave what some consider definitive performances in
The Tempest
(as Prospero) in four productions (and in the 1991 film
Prospero’s Books ) , as well as in other roles – Richard II in three productions, Benedick in
Much Ado About Nothing
which he first played in 1930 and revived throughout the 1950s, Macbeth and Oberon in
A Midsummer Night’s Dream
twice, Romeo three times, and King Lear four times (as well as taking on the part for a final time in a radio broadcast at the age of 90). He also had triumphs as Malvolio in
Twelfth Night
(1931), Shylock in
The Merchant of Venice
(1937), Angelo in
Measure for Measure
(1950), Cassius in
Julius Caesar
(1950) (which he immortalised in the 1953 film), Leontes in
The Winter’s Tale
(1951), and Cardinal Wolsey in
Henry VIII
(1959) (although his 1960 performance as Othello was not a success). It became rumoured that Gielgud also provided the voice for the uncredited role of the Ghost of Hamlet’s Father in Laurence Olivier’s 1948 film version, but the voice was actually that of Olivier, electronically distorted. Gielgud did voice the Ghost in both the stage and film version of the Richard Burton Hamlet, which he directed in 1964, and in the 1970 Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation starring Richard Chamberlain.
Gielgud’s crowning achievement, many believe, was
Ages of Man , his one-man recital of Shakespearean excerpts which he performed throughout the 1950s and 1960s, winning a Tony Award for the Broadway production, a Grammy Award for his recording of the piece, and an Emmy Award for producer David Susskind for the 1966 telecast on CBS. Gielgud made his final Shakespearean appearance on stage in 1977 in the title role of John Schlesinger’s production of
Julius Caesar
at the Royal National Theatre. He also made a recording of many of Shakespeare’s sonnets in 1963. Among his non-Shakespearean Renaissance roles, his Ferdinand in John Webster’s
The Duchess of Malfi
was well-known.
Later stage work
As he aged, Gielgud sought out distinctive new voices in the theatre, appearing in plays by Edward Albee ( Tiny Alice ), Alan Bennett ( Forty Years On ), Charles Wood ( Veterans ), Edward Bond ( Bingo , in which Gielgud played William Shakespeare), David Storey ( Home ), and Harold Pinter ( No Man’s Land ), the latter two in partnership with his old friend Ralph Richardson, but he drew the line at being offered the role of Hamm in Beckett’s
Endgame , saying that the play offered “nothing but loneliness and despair”. [4]
It looked as though Gielgud would retire from the stage after appearing in
Half Life
at the Duke of York’s Theatre in 1978, but he made a successful comeback in 1988 in Hugh Whitemore’s play
The Best of Friends
as museum curator Sydney Cockerell.
Directing career
Sir John Gielgud in 1973, by Allan Warren.
Gielgud was almost as highly regarded for his work as a theatre director as for his acting, having staged his first production as a guest director of the Oxford University Dramatic Society production of
Romeo and Juliet
in 1932. The custom of OUDS at the time was to cast student undergraduates in the male roles and professional actresses in the female roles. Gielgud engaged Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet and Edith Evans as the nurse, who would play the same roles three years later in his legendary production of the play at the New Theatre.
Gielgud quickly rose to the status of being one of the top directors for Binkie Beaumont’s H.M. Tennent, Ltd. production company in London’s West End Theatre and later on Broadway, his productions including
Lady Windermere’s Fan
(1945),
The Glass Menagerie
(1948),
The Heiress
(1949), his own adaptation of
The Cherry Orchard
(1954),
The Potting Shed
(1958),
Five Finger Exercise
(1959), Peter Ustinov’s comedy
Half Way Up a Tree
(1967), and
Private Lives
(1972). Gielgud won a Tony Award for his direction of
Big Fish, Little Fish
in 1961, the only time he won the award in a competitive category (having won honorary awards for “Best Foreign Company” for his 1947 production of
The Importance of Being Earnest
and for his one-man show
Ages of Man ). He also directed the operas
The Trojans
in 1957 and
A Midsummer Night’s Dream
in 1960.
Gielgud directed other actors in many of the Shakespearean roles that he was famous for playing, notably Richard Burton as Hamlet (1964), Anthony Quayle as Benedick in
Much Ado About Nothing
(1950), and Paul Scofield as the title role in
Richard II
(1952). But Gielgud didn’t always have the magic touch, staging a disappointing revival of
Twelfth Night
with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh in 1955 and a disastrous production of
Macbeth
with Ralph Richardson in 1952.
But Gielgud was best known for directing productions in which he also starred, including his greatest commercial success
Richard of Bordeaux
(1933), his definitive production of
The Importance of Being Earnest
(1939, 1942, 1947),
Medea
with Judith Anderson’s Tony Award-winning performance of the title role with Gielgud supporting her as Jason (1947),
The Lady’s Not for Burning
(1949) that won Richard Burton his first notoriety as an actor, and
Ivanov
(1965). But many believed that his greatest successes were in Shakespearean productions in which he both directed and starred, especially
Romeo and Juliet
(1935),
Richard II
(1937, 1953),
King Lear
(1950, 1955),
Much Ado About Nothing
(1952, 1955, 1959) and his signature role of
Hamlet
(1934, 1939, 1945).
Radio work
Gielgud’s brother Val Gielgud became the head of BBC Radio Production in 1928, [5]
and John made his radio debut there the following year in a version of Pirandello’s
The Man With the Flower in His Mouth , which he was then performing at the Old Vic Theatre. In the ensuing years, John played many of his greatest stage roles on BBC Radio including
Richard of Bordeaux ,
The Importance of Being Earnest ,
The Tempest , and
Hamlet , one production of which featured Emlyn Williams as Claudius, Celia Johnson as Ophelia, and Martita Hunt as Gertrude (the part she played in Gielgud’s debut in the role at the Old Vic in 1930). He also played some Shakespearean roles which he would never essay on stage, such as Iago in a 1932 broadcast of
Othello
opposite Henry Ainley as the Moor, Buckingham (1954) [6]
and Cranmer (1977) in
Henry VIII , and Friar Laurence in
Romeo & Juliet
for the first time when he was eighty-nine.
John Gielgud played Sherlock Holmes for BBC radio in the 1950s, with Ralph Richardson as Watson. Gielgud’s brother, Val Gielgud, appeared in one of the episodes, perhaps inevitably, as the great detective’s brother Mycroft. This series was co-produced by the American Broadcasting Company. Orson Welles appeared as Professor Moriarty in
The Final Problem .
Gielgud gave one of his final radio performances in the title role of an All Star production of
King Lear
in 1994 that was mounted to celebrate his 90th birthday. The cast included Judi Dench, Kenneth Branagh, Derek Jacobi, and Simon Russell Beale.
Film work
Gielgud
Although he began to appear in British films as early as 1924, making his debut in
Who Is the Man?
and appearing in the Edgar Wallace-based thriller
The Clue of the New Pin
(1929), he would not make an international impact in the medium until the last decades of his life. His early important film roles included Inigo Jollifant in Victor Saville’s
The Good Companions
(1933), the lead in Alfred Hitchcock’s
Secret Agent
(1936), Benjamin Disraeli in
The Prime Minister
(1940), Cassius in
Julius Caesar
(1953) (BAFTA Award for Best British Actor), George, Duke of Clarence to Olivier’s
Richard III
(1955), and Henry IV to Orson Welles’ Falstaff in
Chimes at Midnight
(1966). A brief glimpse of his Hamlet from the gravediggers scene appears in the
Humphrey Jennings
short
A Diary for Timothy
(1945). But he lost his aversion to filming in the late 1960s, and by the 1980s and 1990s he was appearing in films so regularly that it was jokingly said that he was prepared to do almost anything for his art. He won an Academy Award for his supporting role as a sardonic butler in the 1981 comedy
Arthur , starring Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli, a New York Film Critics Circle Award for
Providence
(1977), and a BAFTA Award for
Murder on the Orient Express
(1974), and his performances in
The Charge of the Light Brigade
(1968),
The Elephant Man
(1981), and
Shine
(1996) were critically acclaimed. In 1991, Gielgud was able to satisfy his life’s ambition by immortalising his Prospero on screen in Peter Greenaway’s extremely offbeat version of
The Tempest , a film called
Prospero’s Books
in which Gielgud voiced every single character in the play. [7]
Television also developed as one of the focal points of his career, with Gielgud giving a particularly notable performance in
Brideshead Revisited
(1981). He won an Emmy Award for
Summer’s Lease
(1989) and televised his stage performances of
A Day by the Sea
(1957),
Home
(1970),
No Man’s Land
(1976) and his final theatre role in
The Best of Friends
as Sydney Cockerell in the 1991 Masterpiece Theatre Production, along with Patrick McGoohan and Dame Wendy Hiller. In 1983, he made his second onscreen appearance with fellow theatrical knights Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson (following Olivier’s own
Richard III ) in a television miniseries about composer Richard Wagner. In 1996 he played a wizard in the TV adaptation of
Gulliver’s Travels . Gielgud and Ralph Richardson were the first guest stars on
Second City Television . Playing themselves, they were in Toronto during their tour of Harold Pinter’s
No Man’s Land . According to Dave Thomas, in his book,
SCTV: Behind the Scenes , their sketch was very poor and the actors gave bad performances.
Gielgud’s final television performance was on film in
Merlin
in 1998, his final television studio appearance having been in
A Summer Day’s Dream
recorded in 1994 for the BBC 2
Performance
series. [8]
Gielgud was one of the few people who has won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony Award.
Gielgud’s final onscreen appearance in a major release motion picture was as Pope Pius V in
Elizabeth
which was released in 1998. His final acting performance was in a film adaptation of Samuel Beckett’s short play
Catastrophe , opposite longtime collaborator Harold Pinter and directed by American playwright David Mamet; Gielgud died mere weeks after production was completed at the age of 96 of natural causes.
Personal life
Gielgud lived and worked in an era when there was a conspiracy of silence around homosexuality outside of theatrical circles. Shortly after he was knighted, Gielgud endured a horrific humiliation. In 1953, he was convicted of “persistently importuning for immoral purposes” (cottaging) in a Chelsea mews, having been arrested for trying to pick up a man in a public lavatory. [9] [10]
Gielgud would avoid Hollywood for over a decade for fear of being denied entry because of the arrest. There was much discussion behind closed doors about whether his career could endure the ignominy, but he continued to rehearse the play in which he was scheduled to direct and act. Instead of being rejected by the public, he received a standing ovation at the play’s initial opening in Liverpool, in part because of his co-star Sybil Thorndike; Thorndike seized him as he stood in the wings unable to bring himself to make his first entrance and brought him onstage, whispering “Come on, John darling, they won’t boo me.” Biographer Sheridan Morley writes that while Gielgud never denied being homosexual, he always tried to be discreet about it and felt humiliated by the ordeal. Some speculate that it helped to bring to public attention a crusade to decriminalise homosexuality in England and Wales. [11] [12]
The ‘Gielgud case’ of 1953, above, was dramatised by critic turned playwright Nicholas de Jongh in the play
Plague Over England
and performed at the Finborough, a small London theatre, in 2008, with Jasper Britton as Gielgud. In 2009 the play was presented for a limited run at the Duchess Theatre, in London’s West End, with Michael Feast (who had worked with Gielgud) in the main role. [11]
Gielgud’s long-standing professional relationship with producer Hugh “Binkie” Beaumont had its personal side as well. Gielgud’s first significant lover, playwright John Perry, left Gielgud for Beaumont. Later, Perry went on to partner Beaumont in the H. M. Tennent organisation, within which Gielgud continued to work. Beaumont, himself closeted outside the theatrical community, was a very powerful producer who oversaw a great deal of high-profile and artistically ambitious work. He stood behind Gielgud during the 1953 scandal, and, with Perry, took the risk of backing Gielgud’s Queens’ Theatre season. However, Morley’s biography states: “Binkie…was..to keep him…..on such an extremely tight salary that it wasn’t until Gielgud first escaped to Hollywood in 1953 that he began to earn the kind of money that Olivier and Richardson and Redgrave had earned for decades.”
In the same biography, Keith Baxter remarks on Gielgud’s private life: “…the theatre was always much more important to John G. than any private relationship…”
Longtime partner Martin Hensler died in December 1998, 16 months before Gielgud’s own death in 2000. [13]
He publicly acknowledged Hensler as his lover only in 1988, in the programme notes for
The Best of Friends , which was his final stage performance. [14] [15]
Laurence Olivier’s friendship with Gielgud was peppered with barely acknowledged competitive tension, for, while Olivier’s fame as a film actor eventually eclipsed Gielgud’s, Gielgud had been the great Shakespearean actor when Olivier was just coming up and that was hard for Olivier to forget. Gielgud maintained a very close relationship with Olivier’s second wife, Vivien Leigh, throughout their marriage, divorce, and her long struggle with manic depression. In
Curtain
(1991), Michael Korda’s novel based on the marriage of Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, Gielgud becomes Philip Chagrin.
Another fictionalised Gielgud – this time given the family name John Terry – appeared around the same time as de Jongh’s play in Nicola Upson’s detective novel
An Expert in Murder , a crime story woven around the original production of
Richard of Bordeaux .
John Gielgud died of a respiratory infection and was cremated at Oxford Crematorium.
Awards and honours
He was knighted in the 1953 coronation honours, became a Companion of Honour in 1977, and was admitted to the Order of Merit in 1996.
The National Portrait Gallery, London commissioned artist David Remfry to paint a portrait of Sir John for the collection in 1980, which now holds 112 likenesses of Gielgud in its collections.
The Globe Theatre in London was renamed the Gielgud Theatre in 1994 in his honour.

There is also the

Other interests
Sir John Gielgud believed that animals should not be exploited. He was particularly fond of birds and joined PETA’s campaign against the foie gras industry in the early 1990s, narrating PETA’s video exposé of the force-feeding of geese and ducks. Many chefs and restaurateurs who saw that video dropped foie gras from their menus. Sir John received PETA’s Humanitarian of the Year Award twice, in 1994 and 1999. [16]
Following his death it was revealed that late in his life he had made financial contributions to the lobby group Stonewall, but had insisted that his support not be made public. [17]
He also authored several books, including his memoirs in
An Actor and His Time ,
Early Stages
and
Distinguished Company . He also co-wrote, with John Miller,
Acting Shakespeare .
John Gielgud in popular culture
Gielgud is referenced in Bruce Robinson’s 1986 cult film
Withnail and I . In an early scene in which Withnail is complaining about his lack of work as an actor, Marwood attempts to console him by suggesting that September is a “bad patch” for actors. Withnail responds by saying “Rubbish! Haven’t seen Gielgud down the labour exchange. Oh, why doesn’t he retire?”
In the Australian satirical news television show
Newstopia , Shaun Micallef’s impersonation of Gielgud acts as the African correspondent.
In the satirical puppet comedy
Spitting Image , Gielgud was regularly shown in a short segment where he poetically read a nursery rhyme or other short stanza and then fell asleep immediately after.
As of early 2009, there is currently a West End play running based on a section of Gielgud’s life titled
Plague Over England , starring Celia Imrie and Michael Feast.
In the book
Adrian Mole and the Weapons of Mass Destruction
by Sue Townsend, Adrian names the swan that terrorises him outside his apartment Gielgud as he believes they share similar physical attributes.

Funny walk:
John Marwood Cleese
(born 27 October 1939) is an English actor, comedian, writer and film producer. He achieved success at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and as a scriptwriter and performer on
The Frost Report . In the late 1960s he became a member of Monty Python, the comedy troupe responsible for the sketch show
Monty Python’s Flying Circus
and the four Monty Python films:
And Now for Something Completely Different ,
Holy Grail ,
Life of Brian
and
The Meaning of Life .
In the mid 1970s, Cleese and his first wife Connie Booth, co-wrote and starred in the British sitcom
Fawlty Towers . Later, he co-starred with Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis and former Python colleague Michael Palin in
A Fish Called Wanda
and
Fierce Creatures . He also starred in
Clockwise , and has appeared in many other films, including two James Bond films, two Harry Potter films, and three
Shrek
films.
With
Yes Minister
writer Antony Jay he co-founded the production company Video Arts, responsible for making entertaining training films.
Early life
Cleese was born in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, the only child of Muriel (née Cross), an acrobat, and Reginald Francis Cleese (b. 1894), who worked in insurance sales. [1]
His family’s surname was previously “Cheese”, but his father changed it to “Cleese” in 1915, upon joining the Army. [2] [3]
Cleese was educated at St Peter’s Preparatory School where he was a star pupil, receiving a prize for English studies and doing well at sport including cricket and boxing. At 13 he received an exhibition to Clifton College, an English public school in Bristol. He was tall as a child and was well over 6 ft when he arrived there. While at the school he is said to have defaced the school grounds for a prank by painting footprints to suggest that the school’s statue of Field Marshal Earl Haig had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet. [4]
Cleese played cricket for the first team, and after initial indifference he did well academically, passing 8 O-Levels and 3 A-Levels in mathematics, physics and chemistry. [5] [6]
After leaving school, he went back to his prep school to teach science before taking up a place he had won at Downing College, Cambridge, where he studied Law and joined the Cambridge Footlights. There he met his future writing partner Graham Chapman. Cleese wrote extra material for the 1961 Footlights Revue
I Thought I Saw It Move , [7] [8]
and was Registrar for the Footlights Club during 1962, as well as being one of the cast members for the 1962 Footlights Revue
Double Take! [7] [8]
He graduated from Cambridge in 1963 with a 2:1 classification in his degree. Despite his successes on The Frost Report, his father would send him cuttings from the
Daily Telegraph
offering management jobs in places like Marks and Spencer. [9]
Pre-Python
Cleese was one of the script writers, as well as being a member of the cast, for the 1963 Footlights Revue,
A Clump of Plinths , [7] [8]
which was so successful during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe that it was renamed
Cambridge Circus
and taken to the West End in London and then on a tour of New Zealand and Broadway, with the cast also appearing in some of the revue’s sketches on
The Ed Sullivan Show
in September 1964. [8]
After
Cambridge Circus , Cleese briefly stayed in America, performing on and Off-Broadway. While performing in the musical
Half a Sixpence , [8]
Cleese met future Python Terry Gilliam, as well as American actress Connie Booth, whom he married on 20 February 1968. [8]
He was soon offered work as a writer with BBC Radio, where he worked on several programmes, most notably as a sketch writer for
The Dick Emery Show . The success of the Footlights Revue led to the recording of a short series of half-hour radio programmes, called
I’m Sorry, I’ll Read That Again , which were so popular that the BBC commissioned a regular series with the same title which ran from 1965 to 1974. Cleese returned to England and joined the cast. [8]
In many episodes, he is credited as “John Otto Cleese”.
Also in 1965, Cleese and Chapman began writing on
The Frost Report . The writing staff chosen for
The Frost Report
consisted of a number of writers and performers who would go on to make names for themselves in comedy. They included co-performers from
I’m Sorry, I’ll Read That Again
and future Goodies Bill Oddie and Tim Brooke-Taylor, and also Frank Muir, Barry Cryer, Marty Feldman, Ronnie Barker, Ronnie Corbett, Dick Vosburgh and future Python members Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. It was while working on
The Frost Report , in fact, that the future Pythons developed the writing styles that would make their collaboration significant. Cleese and Chapman’s sketches often involved authority figures, some of which were performed by Cleese, while Jones and Palin were both infatuated with filmed scenes that open with idyllic countryside panoramas. Idle was one of those charged with writing David Frost’s monologue. It was during this period that Cleese met and befriended influential British comedian Peter Cook.
It was as an actual performer on the Frost Report that Cleese achieved his breakthrough on British television as a comedy actor, appearing as the tall, patrician figure on the classic class sketch, contrasting comically in a line-up with the shorter, middle-class Ronnie Barker and the shortest, working-class Ronnie Corbett. Such was the popularity of the series that in 1966 Cleese and Chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with Brooke-Taylor and Feldman on
At Last the 1948 Show , [8]
during which time the
Four Yorkshiremen sketch
was written by all four writers/performers (the Four Yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a Monty Python sketch). [10]
Cleese and Chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of
Doctor in the House
(and later Cleese wrote six episodes of
Doctor at Large
on his own in 1971). These series were successful, and in 1969 Cleese and Chapman were offered their very own series. However, owing to Chapman’s alcoholism, Cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership, and was therefore unenthusiastic about doing a series with just the two of them. He had found working with Palin on
The Frost Report
an enjoyable experience, and invited him to join the series. Palin had previously been working on
Do Not Adjust Your Set , with Idle and Jones, with Terry Gilliam creating the animations. The four of them had, on the back of the success of
Do Not Adjust Your Set , been offered a series for Thames Television, which they were waiting to begin when Cleese’s offer arrived. Palin agreed to work with Cleese and Chapman in the meantime, bringing with him Gilliam, Jones and Idle.
Monty Python
Monty Python’s Flying Circus
ran for four seasons from October 1969 to December 1974 on BBC Television, though with only limited participation of Cleese in the last six shows. Cleese’s two primary characterisations were as a sophisticate and a stressed-out loony. He portrayed the former as a series of announcers, TV show hosts, government officials (for example, “The Ministry of Silly Walks”). The latter is perhaps best represented in the “Cheese Shop”, and by Cleese’s Mr Praline character, the man with a dead Norwegian Blue parrot and a menagerie of other animals all named “Eric”. He was also known for his working-class “Sergeant Major” character, who worked as a Police Sergeant, Roman Centurion, etc. he is also seen as the opening announcer, with the now famous line: “And now for something completely different”, although in its premiere in the sketch “Man with Three Buttocks”, the phrase was spoken by Eric Idle.
Partnership with Graham Chapman
Along with Gilliam’s animations, Cleese’s work with Chapman provided Python with its darkest and angriest moments, and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of Basil Fawlty.
Unlike Palin and Jones, Cleese and Chapman actually wrote together—in the same room; Cleese claims that their writing partnership involved him sitting with pen and paper, doing most of the work, while Chapman sat back, not speaking for long periods, then suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a different level. A classic example of this is the “Dead Parrot” sketch, envisaged by Cleese as a satire on poor customer service, which was originally to have involved a broken toaster, and later a broken car (this version was actually performed and broadcast, on the pre-Python special
How To Irritate People ). It was Chapman’s suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot, and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a
Norwegian Blue , giving the sketch a surreal air which made it far more memorable.
Their humour often involved ordinary people in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason. Like Chapman, Cleese’s poker face, clipped middle-class accent and imposing height allowed him to appear convincing as a variety of authority figures, such as policemen, detectives, Nazi officers, or government officials—which he would then proceed to undermine. Most famously, in the “Ministry of Silly Walks” sketch (actually written by Palin and Jones), Cleese exploits his stature as the crane-legged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office.
Chapman and Cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects, such as in the “cheese shop”, the “dead parrot” sketch and “The Argument Sketch”, where Cleese plays a stone-faced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless, trivial bickering. All of these roles were opposite Palin (who Cleese often claims is his favourite Python to work with)—the comic contrast between the towering Cleese’s crazed aggression and the shorter Palin’s shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series. Occasionally, the typical Cleese-Palin dynamic is reversed, as in “Fish Licence”, wherein Palin plays the bureaucrat with whom Cleese is trying to work.
Though the programme lasted four series, by the start of series 3, Cleese was growing tired of dealing with Chapman’s alcoholism. He felt, too, that the show’s scripts had declined in quality. For these reasons, he became restless and decided to move on. Though he stayed for the third series, he officially left the group before the fourth season. Despite this, he remained friendly with the group, and all six began writing
Monty Python and the Holy Grail ; Cleese received a credit on episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions, and even makes a brief appearance in one episode as the voice of a cartoon in the “Hamlet” episode, though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series. Cleese returned to the troupe to co-write and co-star in the Monty Python films
Monty Python and the Holy Grail ,
Monty Python’s Life of Brian
and
Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life , and participated in various live performances over the years.
Post-Python
From 1970 to 1973, Cleese served as rector of the University of St Andrews. [11]
His election proved a milestone for the University, revolutionising and modernising the post. For instance, the Rector was traditionally entitled to appoint an “Assessor”, a deputy to sit in his place at important meetings in his absence. Cleese changed this into a position for a student, elected across campus by the student body, resulting in direct access and representation for the student body for the first time in over 500 years. This was one of many changes that Cleese brought in.
Cleese achieved greater prominence in the United Kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager Basil Fawlty in
Fawlty Towers , which he co-wrote with his wife Connie Booth. The series won three BAFTA awards when produced and in 2000, it topped the British Film Institute’s list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. The series also featured Prunella Scales as Basil’s acerbic wife Sybil, Andrew Sachs as the much abused Spanish waiter Manuel (“…he’s from Barcelona”), and Booth as waitress Polly, the series’ voice of sanity. Cleese based Basil Fawlty on a real person, Donald Sinclair, whom he had encountered in 1970 while the Monty Python team were staying at the Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay while filming inserts for their television series. Reportedly, Cleese was inspired by Sinclair’s mantra “I could run this hotel just fine, if it weren’t for the guests.” He later described Sinclair as “the most wonderfully rude man I have ever met,” although Sinclair’s widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series. During the Pythons’ stay, Sinclair allegedly threw Idle’s briefcase out of the hotel “in case it contained a bomb,” complained about Gilliam’s “American” table manners, and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town.
The first series was screened from 19 September 1975 on BBC 2, initially to poor reviews, [12]
but gained momentum when repeated on BBC 1 the following year. Despite this, a second series did not air until 1979, by which time Cleese’s marriage to Booth had ended, but they revived their collaboration for the second series.
Fawlty Towers
consisted of only twelve episodes; Cleese and Booth both maintain that this was to avoid compromising the quality of the series.
Cleese as a Mexican maraca soloist as part of his 1977 guest appearance on
The Muppet Show
In December 1977, Cleese appeared as a guest star on
The Muppet Show . Cleese was a fan of the show, and co-wrote much of the episode. He appears in a “Pigs in Space” segment as a pirate trying to hijack the spaceship Swinetrek, and also helps Gonzo restore his arms to “normal” size after Gonzo’s cannonball catching act goes wrong. During the show’s closing number, Cleese refuses to sing the famous show tune from
Man of La Mancha , “The Impossible Dream”. Kermit The Frog apologises and the curtain re-opens with Cleese now costumed as a Viking trying some Wagnerian opera as part of a duet with Sweetums. Once again, Cleese protests to Kermit, and gives the frog one more chance. This time, as pictured opposite this text, he is costumed as a Mexican maraca soloist. He has finally had enough and protests that he is leaving the show, saying “You were supposed to be my host. How can you do this to me? Kermit – I am your guest!”. The cast joins in with their parody of “The Impossible Dream”, singing “This is your guest, to follow that star…”. During the crowd’s applause that follows the song, he pretends to strangle Kermit until he realises the crowd loves him and accepts the accolades. During the show’s finale, as Kermit thanks him, he shows up with a fictional album, his own new vocal record
John Cleese: A Man & His Music , and encourages everyone to buy a copy. [13]
This would not be Cleese’s final appearance with The Muppets. In their 1981 movie
The Great Muppet Caper , Cleese does a cameo appearance as Neville, a local homeowner. As part of the appearance, Miss Piggy borrows his house as a way to impress Kermit The Frog.
Cleese won the
TV Times
award for Funniest Man On TV – 1978 / 1979. [14]
1980s and 1990s
During the 1980s and 1990s, Cleese focused on film, though he did work with Peter Cook in his one-off TV special
Peter Cook and Co.
in 1980. In the same year Cleese played Petruchio, in Shakespeare’s
The Taming of the Shrew
in the BBC Television Shakespeare series. In 1981 he starred with Sean Connery and Michael Palin in the Terry Gilliam-directed
Time Bandits
as Robin Hood. He also participated in
Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl
(1982), and starred in
The Secret Policeman’s Ball
for Amnesty International. In 1985, Cleese had a small dramatic role as a sheriff in
Silverado , which had an all-star cast that included Kevin Kline, with whom he would star with in
A Fish Called Wanda
3 years later. In 1986, he starred in
Clockwise
as an uptight school headmaster obsessed with punctuality and constantly getting in to trouble during a journey to a headmaster’s conference.
Cleese at the 1989 Academy Awards
Timed with the 1987 UK elections, he appeared in a video promoting proportional representation. [15]
In 1988, he wrote and starred in
A Fish Called Wanda , as the lead, Archie Leach, along with Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin.
Wanda
was a commercial and critical success, and Cleese was nominated for an Academy Award for his script. Cynthia Cleese starred as Leach’s daughter.
Chapman was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1989; Cleese, Michael Palin, Peter Cook and Chapman’s partner David Sherlock, witnessed Chapman’s death. Chapman’s death occurred a day before the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of
Flying Circus , with Jones commenting, “the worst case of party-pooping in all history.” Cleese’s eulogy at Chapman’s memorial service—in which he “became the first person ever at a British memorial service to say ‘fuck’”—has since become legendary. [16]
Cleese would later play a supporting role in Kenneth Branagh’s adaptation of Mary Shelley’s
Frankenstein
alongside Branagh himself and Robert De Niro. He also produced and acted in a number of successful business training films, including
Meetings, Bloody Meetings
and
More Bloody Meetings . These were produced by his company Video Arts.
With Robin Skynner, the group analyst and family therapist, Cleese wrote two books on relationships:
Families and How to Survive Them , and
Life and How to Survive It . The books are presented as a dialogue between Skynner and Cleese.
In 1996, Cleese declined the British honour of Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). The follow-up to
A Fish Called Wanda ,
Fierce Creatures —which again starred Cleese alongside Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Palin—was also released that year, but was greeted with mixed reception by critics and audiences. Cleese has since often stated that making the second movie had been a mistake. When asked by his friend, director and restaurant critic Michael Winner, what he would do differently if he could live his life again, Cleese responded, “I wouldn’t have married Alyce Faye Eichelberger and I wouldn’t have made
Fierce Creatures .” [17]
In 1999, Cleese appeared in the James Bond movie,
The World Is Not Enough
as Q’s assistant, referred to by Bond as “R”. In 2002, when Cleese reprised his role in
Die Another Day , the character was promoted, making Cleese the new quartermaster (Q) of MI6. In 2004, Cleese was featured as Q in the video game
James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing , featuring his likeness and voice. Cleese did not appear in the subsequent Bond films,
Casino Royale
and
Quantum of Solace .
2000 to present
Cleese is currently Provost’s Visiting Professor at Cornell University, after having been Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large from 1999–2006. He makes occasional, well-received appearances on the Cornell campus, but he lives in the town of Montecito, California. [18]
In 2001, Cleese was cast in the comedy
Rat Race
as the eccentric hotel owner Donald P. Sinclair,the name of the Torquay Hotel owner that Cleese had based the character of Basil Fawlty. [19]
In a 2005 poll of comedians and comedy insiders
The Comedian’s Comedian , Cleese was voted second only to Peter Cook. Also in 2005, a long-standing piece of Internet humour, “The Revocation of Independence of the United States”, was wrongly attributed to Cleese.
In 2006, Cleese hosted a television special of football’s greatest kicks, goals, saves, bloopers, plays and penalties, as well as football’s influence on culture (including the famous Monty Python sketch, “Philosophy Football”), featuring interviews with pop culture icons Dave Stewart, Dennis Hopper and Henry Kissinger, as well as football greats including Pelé, Mia Hamm and Thierry Henry.
The Art of Soccer with John Cleese [20]
was released in North America on DVD in January 2009 by BFS
Entertainment & Multimedia
Cleese recently lent his voice to the BioWare video game
Jade Empire . His role was that of an “outlander” named Sir Roderick Ponce von Fontlebottom the Magnificent Bastard, stranded in the Imperial City of the Jade Empire. His character is essentially a British colonialist stereotype who refers to the people of the Jade Empire as savages in need of enlightenment. His armour has the design of a fork stuck in a piece of cheese.
He also had a cameo appearance in the computer game
Starship Titanic
as “The Bomb” (credited as “Kim Bread”), designed by Douglas Adams. When the bomb is activated it tells the player that “The ship is now armed and preparing to explode. This will be a fairly large explosion, so you’d best keep back about 22 miles (35 km)”. When the player tries to disarm the bomb, it says “Well, you can try that, but it won’t work because
nobody likes a smart-arse !”
In 2002, Cleese made a cameo appearance in the movie
The Adventures of Pluto Nash , where he played “James”, a computerised chauffeur of a hover car stolen by the title character (played by Eddie Murphy). The vehicle is subsequently destroyed in a chase, leaving the chauffeur stranded in a remote place on the moon.
In 2003, Cleese also appeared as Lyle Finster on the US sitcom
Will & Grace . His character’s daughter, Lorraine, was played by Minnie Driver. In the series, Lyle Finster briefly marries Karen Walker (Megan Mullally).
In 2004, Cleese was credited as co-writer of a DC Comics graphic novel entitled
Superman: True Brit . Part of DC’s “Elseworlds” line of imaginary stories,
True Brit , mostly written by Kim Howard Johnson, suggests what might have happened had Superman’s rocket ship landed in Britain, not America.
From 10 November to 9 December 2005, Cleese toured New Zealand with his stage show,
John Cleese—His Life, Times and Current Medical Problems . Cleese described it as “a one-man show with several people in it, which pushes the envelope of acceptable behaviour in new and disgusting ways.” The show was developed in New York with William Goldman and includes Cleese’s daughter Camilla as a writer and actor (the shows were directed by Australian Bille Brown). His assistant of many years, Garry Scott-Irvine, also appeared, and was listed as a co-producer. It then played in universities in California and Arizona from 10 January to 25 March 2006 under the title “Seven Ways to Skin an Ocelot”. [21]
His voice can be downloaded for directional guidance purposes as a downloadable option on some personal GPS-navigation device models by company TomTom.
In June 2006, while promoting a football song in which he was featured, entitled
Don’t Mention the World Cup , Cleese appears to have claimed that he decided to retire from performing in sitcoms, instead opting to writing a book on the history of comedy and to tutor young comedians. [22]
This was an erroneous story, the result of an interview with
The Times
of London (the piece was not fact checked before printing).
In 2007, Cleese appeared in ads for Titleist as a golf course designer named “Ian MacCallister”, who represents “Golf Designers Against Distance”.
In 2007, he started filming the sequel to
The Pink Panther , titled
The Pink Panther 2 , with Steve Martin and Aishwarya Rai.
On 27 September 2007, The Podcast Network announced it had signed a deal with Cleese to produce a series of video podcasts called HEADCAST to be published on TPN’s website. Cleese released the first episode of this series in April 2008 on his own website, headcast.co.uk
In 2008, Cleese collaborated with Los Angeles Guitar Quartet member William Kanengiser on the text to the performance piece “The Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha”. Cleese, as narrator, and the LAGQ premiered the work in Santa Barbara.
According to recent reports, Cleese is currently working on a musical version of
A Fish Called Wanda
with his daughter Camilla. He also said that he is working on a new film screenplay for the first time since 1996′s
Fierce Creatures . Cleese collaborates on it with writer Lisa Hogan, under the current working title “A Taxing Time”. According to him, it is “about the lengths to which people will go to avoid tax. [...] It’s based on what happened to me when I cashed in my UK pension and moved to Santa Barbara.” [23]
At the end of March 2009, Cleese published his first article as ‘Contributing Editor’ to
The Spectator : “The real reason I had to join
The Spectator “. [24]
On 6 May 2009, he appeared on
The Paul O’Grady Show . Cleese has also hosted comedy galas at the Montreal Just for Laughs comedy festival in 2006, and again in 2009. He had to cancel the 2009 appearance due to prostatitis, but hosted it a few days later. [25]
Towards the end of 2009 and into 2010, Cleese appeared in a series of television adverts for the Norwegian electric goods shop chain, Elkjøp. [26]
In March 2010 it was announced that Cleese would be playing Jasper in the video game “Fable III”. [27]
In 2009 and 2010, Cleese toured Scandinavia and the US with his Alimony Tour Year One and Year Two. In May 2010, it was announced that this tour would extend to the UK (his first tour in UK), set for May 2011 – The show is dubbed the ‘Alimony Tour’ in reference to the financial implications of Cleese’s recent divorce. The UK tour starts in Cambridge on 3 May visiting Birmingham, Salford, Liverpool, Oxford, Leeds, Edinburgh and finishing in Palmerston North, New Zealand. [28]
In October 2010 Cleese was featured in the launch of an advertising campaign by The Automobile Association for a new home emergency response product. [29]
Cleese appeared as a man who believed the AA couldn’t help him during a series of disasters, including water pouring through his ceiling, with the line, “The AA? For faulty showers?”
Personal life – 1960s to 1980s
Cleese met Connie Booth in the US during the late 1960s and the couple married in 1968. [12]
In 1971, Booth gave birth to Cynthia Cleese, their only child. With Booth, Cleese wrote the scripts for and co-starred in both series of the TV series
Fawlty Towers , even though the two were actually divorced before the second series was finished and aired. Cleese and Booth are said to have remained close friends since. [30]
Cleese married American actress Barbara Trentham in 1981. [31]
Their daughter Camilla, Cleese’s second child, was born in 1984. He and Trentham divorced in 1990. During this time, Cleese moved from the United Kingdom to California. [32]
1990s to present
On 28 December 1992 he married American psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger. In January 2008 the couple announced they had split. The divorce was settled in December 2008. The divorce settlement left Eichelberger with £12 million in finance and assets, including £600,000 a year for seven years. Cleese stated that “What I find so unfair is that if we both died today, her children would get much more than mine”. [33]
In April 2010, Cleese revealed on
The Graham Norton Show
on BBC One that he had started a new relationship with a woman 31 years his junior, Jennifer Wade. In this same show, he revealed that he is no longer a vegetarian, as he claimed to have enjoyed eating dog in Hong Kong. [34] [35] [36]
During the disruption caused by the Eyjafjallajökull eruption in 2010 Cleese became stranded in Oslo and decided to take a taxi to Brussels. The 1500 km journey cost £3,300 and was completed with the help of three drivers who took shifts in driving Cleese to his destination where he planned to take a Eurostar passenger train to the UK. [37]
Cleese has a passion for lemurs. [38] [39]
Following the 1997 comedy film
Fierce Creatures , in which the ring-tailed lemur played a key role, he hosted the 1998 BBC documentary
In the Wild: Operation Lemur with John Cleese , which tracked the progress of a reintroduction of Black-and-white Ruffed Lemurs back into the Betampona Reserve in Madagascar. The project had been partly funded by Cleese’s donation of the proceeds from the London premier of
Fierce Creatures . [39] [40]
Cleese is quoted as saying, “I adore lemurs. They’re extremely gentle, well-mannered, pretty and yet great fun… I should have married one.” [38]
Political views
Currently a member of the Liberal Democrats after previously being a Labour party voter, Cleese switched to the SDP after their formation in 1981, and during the 1987 general election, Cleese recorded a nine minute party political broadcast for the SDP-Liberal Alliance, which spoke about the similarities and failures of the other two parties in a more humorous tone than standard political broadcasts. Cleese has since appeared in broadcasts for the Liberal Democrats, in the 1997 general election and narrating a radio election broadcast for the party during the 2001 general election. [41]
In April 2010, Cleese posted a Twitter declaring his support for the Lib Dems after Nick Clegg performed strongly in the first leaders’ debate on ITV1, stating: “Well, well, well. First leaders debate, and LibDems do so well. Good luck to them.” [42]
In April 2011, Cleese revealed that he had declined a life peerage for political services in 1999. Outgoing leader of the Liberal Democrats, Paddy Ashdown, had put forward the suggestion shortly before he stepped down, with the idea that Cleese would take the party whip and sit as a working peer, but the actor “realised this involved being in England in the winter and I thought that was too much of a price to pay.” [43]
Cleese expressed support for Barack Obama’s presidential candidacy, donating US$2,300 to his campaign and offering his services as a speech writer. [44]
He also criticised Republican Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin—saying that “Michael Palin is no longer the funniest Palin” [45] — and wrote a satirical poem about Fox News commentator Sean Hannity for
Countdown with Keith Olbermann . [46]

Jeremy John Irons
(born 19 September 1948) is an English actor. After receiving classical training at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, Irons began his acting career on stage in 1969, and has since appeared in many London theatre productions including
The Winter’s Tale ,
Macbeth ,
Much Ado About Nothing ,
The Taming of the Shrew , and
Richard II . In 1984, he made his Broadway debut in Tom Stoppard’s
The Real Thing
and received a Tony Award for Best Actor.
Irons’s first major film role came in the 1981 romantic drama
The French Lieutenant’s Woman , for which he received a BAFTA nomination for Best Actor. After starring in such films as
Moonlighting
(1982),
Betrayal
(1983), and
The Mission
(1986), he gained critical acclaim for portraying twin gynecologists in David Cronenberg’s psychological thriller
Dead Ringers
(1988). In 1990, Irons played accused murderer Claus von Bulow in
Reversal of Fortune , and took home multiple awards including an Academy Award for Best Actor. Other notable films have included
The House of the Spirits
(1993),
The Lion King
(1994),

(1995),
Lolita
(1997),
The Merchant of Venice
(2004),
Being Julia
(2004), and
Appaloosa
(2008).
Irons has also made several notable appearances on television. He earned his first Golden Globe Award nomination for his breakout role in the ITV series
Brideshead Revisited
(1981). In 2006, Irons starred opposite Helen Mirren in the historical miniseries
Elizabeth I , for which he received a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Since 2011, he has been starring in the Showtime historical drama
The Borgias .
Early life
Irons was born in Cowes, Isle of Wight, the son of Barbara Anne Brereton Brymer (née Sharpe; 1914–1999), a housewife, and Paul Dugan Irons (1913–1983), an accountant. [1]
Part of his maternal ancestry is Irish, [2]
and his great-grandfather was one of the first Metropolitan Policemen, and later a chartist. Irons has a brother, Christopher (born 1943), and a sister, Felicity Anne (born 1944). He was educated at the independent Sherborne School in Dorset, (c. 1962–1966). He achieved some fame as the drummer and harmonica player (most memorably for his rendition of “Stairway to Heaven” on harmonica) in a four-man school band called the Four Pillars of Wisdom. They performed, in a classroom normally used as a physics lab, for the entertainment of boys compulsorily exiled from their houses for two hours on Sunday afternoons. He was also known within Abbey House as half of a comic duo performing skits on Halloween and at end-of-term House Suppers. Irons has stated that his family is Catholic, but of himself he states, “I don’t go to church much because I don’t like belonging to a club, and I don’t go to confession or anything like that, I don’t believe in it. But I try to be aware of where I fail and I occasionally go to services. I would hate to be a person who didn’t have a spiritual side because there’s nothing to nourish you in life apart from retail therapy.” [3]
Career
Irons trained as an actor at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and is now president of its fundraising appeal. He performed a number of plays, and busked on the streets of Bristol, before appearing on the London stage as John the Baptist and Judas opposite David Essex in
Godspell , which opened at the Roundhouse on 17 November 1971 before transferring to Wyndham’s Theatre playing a total of 1,128 performances. [4]
Irons was bestowed an Honorary-Life Membership by the Law Society (University College Dublin) in September 2008, in honour of his contribution to television, film, audio, music and theatre.
Television
He made several appearances on British television, including the children’s television series
Play Away
and as Franz Liszt in the BBC 1974 series
Notorious Woman . More significantly he starred in the 13-part adaptation of H.E. Bates’ novel
Love for Lydia
for London Weekend Television (1977), and attracted attention for his key role as the pipe-smoking German student, a romantic pairing with Judi Dench in Harold Pinter’s screenplay adaptation of Aidan Higgins’ novel
Langrishe, Go Down
for BBC television (1978).
The role which brought him fame was that of Charles Ryder in the television adaptation of Evelyn Waugh’s
Brideshead Revisited
(1981).
Brideshead
reunited him with Anthony Andrews, with whom he had appeared in
The Pallisers
seven years earlier. In the same year he starred in the film
The French Lieutenant’s Woman
opposite Meryl Streep.
Almost as a ‘lap of honour’ after these major successes, in 1982 he played the leading role of an exiled Polish building contractor, working in the Twickenham area of South West London, in Jerzy Skolimowski’s independent film
Moonlighting , widely seen on television, a performance which extended his acting range.
In 2005, Irons won both an Emmy award and a Golden Globe award for his supporting role in the TV mini-series,
Elizabeth I . A year later Irons was one of the participants in the third series of the BBC documentary series
Who Do You Think You Are? [5] [6]
In 2008 he played Lord Vetinari in
Terry Pratchett’s The Colour of Magic , an adaptation for Sky One.
On 6 November 2008,
TV Guide
reported he would star as photographer Alfred Stieglitz with Joan Allen as painter Georgia O’Keeffe, in a Lifetime Television O’Keeffe biopic. [7]
Irons also appeared in the documentary for Irish television channel TG4,
Faoi Lan Cheoil
in which he learned to play the fiddle.
On 12 January 2011, Irons was a guest-star in an episode of
Law & Order: Special Victims Unit
called “Mask”. He played Dr. Cap Jackson, a sex therapist. [8]
He reprised the role on an episode that ran on 30 March 2011.
Irons stars in the 2011 U.S. premium cable network Showtime’s series
The Borgias , a highly fictionalized account of the Renaissance dynasty of that name. Irons portrays patriarch Rodrigo Borgia, better known to history as Pope Alexander VI. [9]
Film
Irons’ made his film debut in
Nijinsky
in 1980. He appeared sporadically in films during the 1980s, including the Cannes Palme d’Or winner
The Mission
in 1986, and in the dual role of twin gynecologists in David Cronenberg’s
Dead Ringers
in 1988. Other films include
Danny the Champion of the World
(1989),
Reversal of Fortune
(1990), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor,
Kafka
(1991),
Damage

The Man in the Iron Mask .
Other roles include the evil wizard Profion in the film

The Time Machine
(2002). In 2004, Irons played Severus Snape in Comic Relief’s

In 2008, Irons co-starred with Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen in

Audio
Irons read the audio book recording of Evelyn Waugh’s
Brideshead Revisited , Paulo Coelho’s
The Alchemist , and the audio book recording of Vladimir Nabokov’s
Lolita
(he had also appeared in the 1997 film version of the novel)).
One of his best known film roles has turned out to be lending his distinctive voice to the villain Scar in
The Lion King
(1994). Irons has since provided voiceovers for three Disney World attractions. He narrated the
Spaceship Earth
ride, housed in the large geodesic globe at Epcot, from November 1994 to July 2007. He was also the English narrator for the Studio Tram Tour: Behind the Magic at the Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Paris. He also voiced H.G. Wells in the English version of the former Disney attraction The Timekeeper. He also played Scar in
Fantasmic .
He is also one of the readers in the 4x CD boxed set of
The Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde , produced by Marc Sinden and sold in aid of the Royal Theatrical Fund. [11] [12]
He was originally to star as the Phantom in a 2006 French musical adaptation of Gaston Leroux’s novel
The Phantom of the Opera , though the project was canceled. He will be the narrator for Val Kilmer and Bill Pullman’s brand-new Lewis and Clark movie from Revolution Studios.
He serves as the English-language version of the audio guide for Westminster Abbey in London.
Irons has served as voice-over in two big cat documentary films by National Geographic:
Eye of the Leopard , which was released in 2006, [13]
and
The Last Lions , which is a 2011 motion-picture, released on 18 February. [14]
Music
In 1985, Irons directed a music video for Carly Simon and her heavily promoted single, “Tired of Being Blonde”. Although the song was not a hit, the video —featuring the fast cutting, parallel narratives and heavy use of stylized visual effects that were a staple of pop videos at the time— received ample attention on MTV and other outlets.
In 1994 Jeremy Irons had a cameo role in the video for Elastica’s hit single “Connection”. Irons was one of the many naked men sitting down around Elastica as they performed the song. Irons has since claimed that this three-minute slice of nudity was his most enjoyable work to date.
Irons has contributed to other musical performances, recording William Walton’s
Façade
with Dame Peggy Ashcroft, and in 1987 the songs from Lerner and Loewe’s
My Fair Lady
with Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, released on the Decca label.
He sang a selection of Noël Coward at the 1999 Last Night of the Proms in celebration of the 100th anniversary of Coward’s birth.
In 2003 he played Fredrik Egerman in a New York revival of Stephen Sondheim’s
A Little Night Music , and two years later appeared as King Arthur in Lerner and Loewe’s
Camelot
at the Hollywood Bowl.
Jeremy Irons also sang the song “Be Prepared” in the movie
The Lion King . However, he actually sang only a section of the song after having vocal problems; Jim Cummings finished the last few lines.
Irons performed the Bob Dylan song “Make You Feel My Love” on the 2006 charity album
Unexpected Dreams – Songs From the Stars .
In 2009 Irons appeared on the Touchstone album
Wintercoast , recording a narrative introduction to the album. [15]
Recording took place in New York City in February 2009 during rehearsals for his Broadway play
Impressionism .
Theatre
Irons has worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company three times in 1976, 1986–87 and 2010. [16] [17]
In 1984, Irons made his New York debut and won a Tony Award for his Broadway performance opposite Glenn Close in
The Real Thing .
After an absence from the London stage for 18 years, in 2006 he co-starred with Patrick Malahide in Christopher Hampton’s stage adaptation of Sándor Márai’s novel
Embers
at the Duke of York’s Theatre. [18]
He made his National Theatre debut playing Harold Macmillan in
Never So Good , a new play by Howard Brenton which opened at the Lyttelton on 19 March 2008. [19] [20]
In 2009 Irons appeared on Broadway opposite Joan Allen in the play
Impressionism . [21]
The play ran through 10 May 2009 at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater. [21]
Personal life
Irons married Irish actress Sinéad Cusack in March 1978. They have two sons, Samuel James Brefni Irons (16 September 1978), who works as a photographer, and Maximilian Paul Diarmuid Irons (17 October 1985), also an actor, who appeared in the 2006 Burberry fashion campaign&
Red Riding Hood . Both of Irons’ sons have appeared in films with their father – Sam in
Danny, Champion of the World
and Max in
Being Julia . Irons lives in the small town of Watlington, Oxfordshire and the village of Ballydehob, in County Cork, Republic of Ireland.
He has been the patron since 2002 of the Thomley Activity Centre, [22]
an Oxfordshire non-profit activity centre for disabled children. Irons owns Kilcoe Castle (which he had painted a rusty pink) in County Cork, Ireland, and has become involved in local politics there. He also has another Irish residence in The Liberties, Dublin. Irons is a patron of the Chiltern Shakespeare Company. [23]
He is a fan of English football club Portsmouth. [24]
At the 1991 Tony Awards, Irons was one of the few celebrities to wear the recently created red ribbon to support the fight against AIDS, and he was the first celebrity to wear it onscreen. [25] [26]
He supports a number of other charities, including The Prison Phoenix Trust, of which he is an active patron. [27]
Politics
In 1998 Irons and his wife were named in the list of the biggest private financial donors to the Labour Party. [28]
In 2004, he publicly declared his support for the Countryside Alliance, referring to the hunting ban as an “outrageous assault on civil liberties”. [29]
In 2010, Irons starred in a promotional video [30]
for “The 1billionhungry project” – a worldwide drive to attract at least one million signatures to a petition calling on international leaders to move hunger to the top of the political agenda. [31]

Occupation:

Years active:

Training:
Jason Statham
[2] [3]
(born 12 September 1967) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
is an English actor and former diver, known for his roles in the Guy Ritchie crime films
Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels ;
Revolver ; and
Snatch . Statham appeared in supporting roles in several American films, such as
The Italian Job , as well as playing the lead role in
The Transporter ,
Crank ,
The Bank Job ,
War
(opposite martial arts star Jet Li), and
Death Race . Statham also appeared alongside established action film actors Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren in
The Expendables . He normally performs his own fight scenes and stunts. [10]
Early life
Statham was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the son of Eileen (née Yates) and Barry Statham, a lounge singer. [7] [11] [12] [13]
He moved to Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, where he chose not to follow his father’s career working on the local market stalls, and decided to pursue the arts. He grew up with Vinnie Jones, alongside whom he would later go on to act. Jones introduced him to football, and Statham went on to play for the local grammar school (1978–83), which he had attended since the age of eleven, but his real passion was diving. He practised daily in perfecting his diving techniques — in particular, he finished 12th in the World Championships in 1992. [14]
He was also a member of Britain’s National Diving Squad for twelve years. [15] [16]
Statham’s life in the media began when he was spotted by a talent agent specialising in athletes while training at London’s Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. Afterwards, he became a model for the clothing brand French Connection.
Career
While working for French Connection, he was introduced to fledgling British director Guy Ritchie [17]
who was developing a film project and needed to fill the role of a street-wise con artist. After learning about Statham’s past as a Black Market Salesmen, Ritchie cast him to play the role of “Bacon” in Ritchie’s breakout 1998 hit,
Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels . [18]
The movie was well received by both critics and audiences, and helped catapult Statham into the public eye. Statham’s second collaboration with Ritchie came in the 2000 film
Snatch , playing the role of “Turkish”. [19]
Cast alongside popular actors Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina and Benicio del Toro, and with the movie earning more than $80 million in box-office revenue, Statham was able to break into Hollywood and appeared in two movies in 2001:
Ghosts of Mars
and
The One .
Statham was offered more film roles and in 2002 was cast as the lead role of driver Frank Martin in the action movie
The Transporter , in which his background in martial arts enabled him to do most of his own stunts. [19]
He has studied Wing Chun kung fu, karate, and kickboxing. [20]
The film spawned two sequels,
Transporter 2 , in 2005 [19]
and Transporter 3 in 2008. He also played in supporting roles in
Mean Machine
(2002),
The Italian Job
(2003) (in which he played Handsome Rob), [19]
and
Cellular
(2004) where he played the lead villain. [19]
In 2005, Statham was once again cast by Ritchie to star in his new project,
Revolver
which was a critical and box office failure. [21]
He also played a dramatic role in the independent drama
London
in 2006. In 2006 he played the lead role in
Crank . [19]
Statham compares his role in
Crank
to his real life in the September 2006 issue of
Maxim . The success of
Crank
led to a sequel in 2009 titled
Crank: High Voltage .
In 2008, Statham starred in the British crime thriller
The Bank Job
which was both a critical and box office success. In 2008, American film critic Armond White hailed Statham’s ascension as the leading international action film star. On the occasion of
Death Race ,
White championed Statham’s “best track record of any contemporary movie star.” [22]
Later in 2008, White praised Statham’s
Transporter 3
as a great example of kinetic pop art.
Statham in 2006
In 2009, Statham started to develop a new movie written by David Peoples and Janet Peoples ( Twelve Monkeys ). Statham stated “We’ve got a movie we’re trying to do, written by David Peoples and Janet Peoples, in the vein of an old film,
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre . It’s not a remake or anything, but it’s a little bit like that, about relationships and how greed contaminates the relationships these three people have. The working title is
The Grabbers ,” [23]
and the release date is still unknown. [24]
In 2010, Statham appeared alongside fellow action stars Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Jet Li and Mickey Rourke, among others in
The Expendables . Statham plays Lee Christmas, a former SAS soldier and expert at close quarters combat using knives. In 2011, Statham starred in the remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson film,
The Mechanic .
He will also star in the action film,
The Killer Elite . According to
Variety , the film will be based on real events, which were the subject of Sir Ranulph Fiennes’ fictional novel
The Feather Men . Statham will play a former SAS named Danny who comes out of retirement to save an old friend who will be played by Clive Owen. [25]
Personal life
Statham was in a seven year relationship with model Kelly Brook, until 2004. [26] [27]
Since April 2010, he has been dating Victoria’s Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. [28]
Statham is also a fan of mixed martial arts and has attended many mixed martial arts pay per views, usually put on by the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

Interview:
James Andrew McAvoy
(born 21 April 1979(1979-04-21)) [1]
is a Scottish stage and screen actor. His best-known work includes the films
The Last King of Scotland
and
Atonement , both of which earned him BAFTA Award nominations, the 2008 action film
Wanted
and the TV series
Shameless . McAvoy has won the BAFTA Rising Star Award and a BAFTA Scotland award. He has also been nominated for an ALFS Award, a European Film Award, and a Golden Globe award. He recently played the role of Professor X/Charles Xavier in
X-Men: First Class .
Early life
McAvoy was born in Port Glasgow, Scotland, the son of Elizabeth (née Johnstone), a psychiatric nurse, and James McAvoy, a builder. [2]
He was brought up as a Roman Catholic. [3]
McAvoy’s parents divorced when he was seven, and he subsequently lived with his maternal grandparents, Mary and James Johnstone, in the Drumchapel area of Glasgow. [4]
His mother lived with them intermittently, but McAvoy has not been in contact with his father since childhood. [5]
McAvoy attended St. Thomas Aquinas Secondary in Jordanhill, Glasgow, a Catholic school, and briefly considered joining the Catholic priesthood. [6]
During his education, he worked at a local bakery. [7] [8]
He was a member of PACE Youth Theatre before he eventually graduated from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in 2000. His sister, Joy McAvoy, is a singer and actress. [9]
Career
McAvoy’s first roles were in David Hayman’s
The Near Room
in 1995 and then as Anthony Balfour in Pat Barker’s
Regeneration
in 1997. He received his first big break with a role in the Steven Spielberg-produced miniseries
Band of Brothers . His first international starring role was as Leto Atreides II in the 2003 Sci Fi Channel miniseries
Frank Herbert’s Children of Dune
(adapted from Frank Herbert’s novels). The same year he also appeared in several episodes of the BBC sitcom
Early Doors
and co-starred in Paul Abbott’s acclaimed thriller serial
State of Play . In 2004, he starred as Steve McBride in another Abbott-written drama series,
Shameless
on Channel 4, for which he was nominated for the British Comedy Award for Best TV Newcomer. He also appeared in two other productions:
Wimbledon
as Paul Bettany’s obnoxious brother, Carl Colt; and he played disabled character Rory O’Shea in the Irish film Inside I’m Dancing. In 2005, he starred in three productions: he played Ben in the Royal Court Theatre’s production
Breathing Corpses
and an adaptation of Macbeth in the four-part BBC production
ShakespeaRe-told ; he also portrayed Mr. Tumnus, the Faun, in
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe , and Max/Johnny-2008 in
Penelope .
In 2006, McAvoy starred alongside Forest Whitaker as Dr. Garrigan in
The Last King of Scotland . The film is an adaptation of Giles Foden’s novel of the same name and gives a fictionalized account of the regime of the brutal Ugandan dictator Idi Amin during the 1970s, as seen by his (fictional) personal physician and adviser. The character of Garrigan is a composite of several men who were close to Amin, most notably Englishman Bob Astles, who was a top adviser to Amin during his regime and became known in Uganda as “The White Rat”. [10]
McAvoy at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival
That same year, McAvoy took the lead role in
Starter for 10 . The film, which was adapted from the novel
Starter for Ten
by David Nicholls, follows the exploits of the nerdy Brian Jackson as he navigates his first year at Bristol University during the mid-1980s. McAvoy won the new Mary Selway/Orange Rising Star Award at the 2006 BAFTA Awards for his role. He also completed filming of
Penelope
in 2006, but due to distribution problems the film was not put in wide release until 2008. [11]
In 2007 McAvoy appeared in two critically acclaimed films:
Becoming Jane , a fictional romance inspired by the life of Jane Austen, alongside Anne Hathaway, and
Atonement , an adaptation of Ian McEwan’s award-winning 2001 novel. McAvoy was nominated for a Golden Globe for his role in
Atonement . During this time he workshopped scenes for the film
Three Way Split
for directors Neil Hunter and Tom Hunsinger, [12]
but will not take part in the actual film.
McAvoy’s film,
Wanted , was released on 25 June 2008. [13]
Loosely based on the comic book miniseries by the same name, McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, a 25-year-old everyman who is offered the opportunity to avenge the death of his father, who was an assassin. The character is then trained by his father’s partner, Sloan (Morgan Freeman), and by Sloan’s second-in-command, Fox, played by Angelina Jolie. McAvoy appeared in the 2009 film
The Last Station , [14]
based on the 1990 novel by Jay Parini, about the final year of Leo Tolstoy’s life; the film co-starred McAvoy’s wife, Anne-Marie Duff. McAvoy also starred in Robert Redford’s
The Conspirator ,
as attourney Frederick Aiken, who fought to defend Mary Surratt from charges of conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. [15]
McAvoy was set to star in the upcoming film
50/50 , which will be directed by Nicole Holofcener and produced by Seth Rogen, but dropped out and was replaced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. [16]
McAvoy has expressed interest in returning as Wesley Gibson in
Wanted 2 , which is currently in pre-production. [17]

Name:

Occupation:
Actor
Years active:
1935 – 1984
What’s my line:
James Neville Mason
(15 May 1909 – 27 July 1984) was an English actor who attained stardom in both British and American films. Mason remained a powerful figure in the industry throughout his career and was nominated for three Academy Awards as well as three Golden Globes (winning once).
Early life
Mason was born in Huddersfield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, to John and Mabel Mason; his father was a wealthy merchant. Mason had no formal training as an actor and initially embarked upon it for fun. He was educated at Marlborough College, and earned a first in architecture at Peterhouse, Cambridge where he became involved in stock theatre companies in his spare time. After Cambridge he joined the Old Vic theatre in London under the guidance of Tyrone Guthrie and Alexander Korda. In 1933 Korda gave Mason a small role in
The Private Life of Don Juan
but fired him three days into shooting. [1]
Career
From 1935 to 1948 he starred in many British quota quickies. A conscientious objector during World War II (something which caused his family to break with him for many years), he became immensely popular for his brooding anti-heroes in the Gainsborough series of melodramas of the 1940s, including
The Man in Grey
(1943) and
The Wicked Lady
(1945). He also starred with Deborah Kerr and Robert Newton in
Hatter’s Castle
(1942). He then took the lead role in the critically acclaimed and immensely popular
The Seventh Veil
(1945) that set box office records in postwar Britain and raised him to international stardom. He followed it with a role as a mortally wounded Irish revolutionary in
Odd Man Out
(1947) and his first Hollywood film,
Caught
(1949).
Mason’s distinctive voice enabled him to play a menacing villain as greatly as his good looks assisted him as a leading man. His roles include Brutus in
Julius Caesar
(1953), Fieldmarshal Erwin Rommel in
The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel
and
The Desert Rats , the amoral valet turned spy in Joseph Mankiewicz’s
5 Fingers , the declining actor in the first remake of
A Star Is Born
(1954), Captain Nemo in
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea
(also 1954), a small town school teacher driven insane by the effects of Cortisone in
Bigger Than Life
(1956), a suave master spy in
North by Northwest
(1959), a determined explorer in
Journey to the Center of the Earth
(also 1959), Humbert Humbert in Stanley Kubrick’s
Lolita
(1962), a hired assassin sent to kill Peter O’Toole’s character in
Lord Jim
(1965), the evil Doctor Polidori in
Frankenstein: The True Story
(1973), the vampire’s servant, Richard Straker, in
Salem’s Lot , and surreal Royal Navy Captain Hughes in
Yellowbeard
(1983). One of his last roles, that of corrupt lawyer Ed Concannon in
The Verdict
(1982), earned him his third and final Oscar nomination.
Mason was once considered to play James Bond in a 1958 TV adaptation of
From Russia with Love , which was ultimately never produced. Despite being in his fifties, he was still under consideration to play Bond in
Dr. No
before Sean Connery was cast. He was also approached to appear as Bond villain Hugo Drax in
Moonraker , however, he turned this down despite his renowned tendency to take any job offered him – which led to appearances in films such as
The Yin and the Yang of Mr. Go ,
Bloodline
and
Hunt the Man Down . His final screen-work was playing the lead role in
Dr. Fischer of Geneva
(adapted from the Graham Greene novella, 1985) as the eccentric wealthy businessman who played games with the Swiss upper class, such as offering gifts to his guests on the proviso they accepted some humiliating ritual activity (such as wearing a child’s bib at the dinner table). In 1975 he played Falconhurst plantation owner in the controversial film
Mandingo .
In the late 1970s, Mason became a mentor to up-and-coming actor Sam Neill.
Late in life, he served as narrator for a British television series on the films of Charlie Chaplin,
Unknown Chaplin,
which was aired in the U.S. on PBS and later issued on home video. [2]
As Brutus in Julius Caesar (1953)
Private life
Mason was a devoted lover of animals, particularly cats. He and his wife, Pamela Mason, co-authored the book
The Cats in Our Lives , which was published in 1949. James Mason wrote most of the book and also illustrated it. In
The Cats in Our Lives , he recounted humorous and sometimes touching tales of the cats (as well as a few dogs) he had known and loved.
Mason was married twice:
First from 1941 to 1964 to British actress Pamela Mason (née Ostrer) (1916–1996); one daughter, Portland Mason Schuyler (1948–2004), and one son, Morgan (who is married to Belinda Carlisle, the former lead singer of The Go-Go’s. Their son, James Duke Mason, is also an actor). Portland Mason was named for Portland Hoffa, the wife of the American radio comedian Fred Allen; the Allens and the Masons were friends.
Australian actress Clarissa Kaye (1971-his death). Tobe Hooper’s DVD commentary for
Salem’s Lot
reveals that Mason regularly worked contractual clauses into his later work guaranteeing Kaye bit parts in his film appearances.
Mason’s autobiography,
Before I Forget , was published in 1981.
Death
Mason survived a major heart attack in 1959 and died as a result of another on 27 July 1984 in Lausanne, Switzerland. [3]
He was cremated and (after a delay of 16 years) his ashes were buried in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Vaud, Switzerland. The remains of Mason’s old friend Charlie Chaplin are in a tomb a few steps away.
Mason’s widow, Clarissa Kaye, also known as Kaye-Mason, died in 1994 from cancer.
