sekilas biography Career miranda yang saya lihat dari Wikipedia :
1997–2006
At age 13, Kerr entered and won the 1997 annual  Dolly  Magazine/Impulse Model Competition. She was flown to Sydney a week before her 14th birthday to shoot for the magazine. Upon Kerr's win, local media expressed "concerned outrage" at her young age. The controversy raised concerns about the glorification of young girls within the fashion, beauty, and entertainment industries. [7]  Some media outlets claimed her  Dolly  shoot (including images of a 14-year-old Kerr in bathing suits) constituted a form of  paedophilia . Of the press, Kerr said: "In the media at the time they were trying to cling on to anything remotely to do with paedophilia. Dolly is a magazine for teenage girls, not for old men. And I was fully clothed! Doing a winter shoot! They just made something out of nothing." [3]
Kerr signed to Chic Management's Sydney division. She received considerable commercial exposure after a series of beachwear ads predominantly for Australian surf chain  Billabong , in which Kerr modeled surf brands  Tigerlily ,  Roxy ,  Billabong Girls , and One Teaspoon. This increased her profile in the Australian and Asian markets, after which Kerr relocated to New York where she became co-owner of the Bowery Ballroom. [3] [7]
In early 2006, Kerr appeared in the finale episode of the TV show  Project Runway , modeling clothes for contestant  Daniel Vosovic 's final collection. She was the first woman to walk down the catwalk. She debuted with the United States market when she signed a lucrative cosmetics contract with  Maybelline New York . The campaign ran in a series of internationally sold women's beauty magazines, including  Cosmopolitan ,  CLEO , and  Elle , and was eventually featured in  Victoria's Secret  catalogues. [7]  She (along with several other Victoria's Secret and Next agency models) was also featured in a music video for the American  hip-hop  single " Number One " by artists  Kanye West  and  Pharrell . [3] In New York, Kerr had a multitude of  runway  appearances and then signed with  NEXT Model Management  in early 2004. From there, she was booked for runway and print campaigns for major labels, including  Alex Perry , Baby Phat ,  Lisa Ho ,  Voodoo Dolls ,  Levi's ,  Bettina Liano ,  Nicola Finetti ,  L.A.M.B. ,  Heatherette ,  Betsey Johnson , Trelise Cooper , Jets,  John Richmond ,  Blumarine  Swimwear,  Neiman Marcus ,  Seafolly Swimwear ,  Anna Molinari , Rock and Republic ,  Roberto Cavalli , and  Ober Jeans . [2]  Kerr was also booked for print in magazines such as  Elle , Australian  Vogue  and  Harper's Bazaar , and was featured in television advertisements for brands like  Portmans ,  Bonds , and  Veet . [3] [7]
2007–present
Following her success with Maybelline, [7]  Kerr became the first Australian model to be offered a contract with  Victoria's Secret  in 2007, replacing  Gisele Bündchen . Upon her acceptance, she became the first ever Australian  Victoria's Secret Angel [10]  joining the stable of models already signed to the lingerie giant, including  Alessandra Ambrosio , Karolína Kurková ,  Adriana Lima ,  Selita Ebanks ,  Izabel Goulart , and  Heidi Klum . Before becoming an Angel in 2007, Kerr was already picked to become the successor of Alessandra Ambrosio as the face of PINK in 2006. Kerr's popularity continued to increase as one of the globally recognized Angels when she appeared in the Victoria's Secret 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 televised runway shows, which aired on four continents. [7]

[3]  Following her modeling success with Victoria's Secret, Kerr made a small guest appearance in the CBS sitcom  How I Met Your Mother  alongside fellow Angels:  Adriana Lima ,  Marisa Miller ,  Alessandra Ambrosio ,  Heidi Klum , and  Selita Ebanks . [3]  She also became the new face of  Clinique  Happy and signed a lucrative six-figure deal to be the new face of Australian department store  David Jones , replacing model  Megan Gale . [11]  In 2008, having earned an estimated $3.5 million in the past 12 months,  Forbes  placed Kerr tenth in the list of the world's top-earning models. [12]
Since 2009, Kerr was in the spring/summer ad campaign for XOXO. [13]  She was in  Forbes  2009 list of the world's highest-paid models, ranking 9th with estimated earnings of $3 million.

She appeared in the 2010  Pirelli Calendar  photographed by  Terry Richardson  in  Bahia, Brazil . [19]  Previously better known for her Victoria's Secret status rather than her  high fashion  work,  Balenciaga  is credited for launching her high fashion modeling career when casting directors Ashley Brokaw and  Nicolas Ghesquière  chose her to walk  exclusively  for the brand's spring 2010 runway show. [20]  It was her first designer fashion show, aside from  Victoria's Secret , since 2007. [2]  A season later she walked for design company  Prada  for their Fall 2010 collection in  Milan  alongside fellow Angels  Doutzen Kroes  and Alessandra Ambrosio . [21]  Kerr then modeled for campaigns for  Prada  and  Jil Sander , and was shot by  Steven Meisel  for the cover of  Italian Vogue  for September. [20]
In January 2011, Kerr became the first pregnant model for  Vogue  when featured in  Vogue  Australia, being six months pregnant at the time of the shoot. [22]  In March she hit the catwalk for  Balenciaga 's Fall 2011 Ready-to-Wear collection as part of  Paris Fashion Week , two months after giving birth.

Mini Biography
Orlando Bloom was born in Canterbury, Kent, England on January 13, 1977. The man he briefly knew as his father, Harry Bloom, was a legendary political activist who fought for civil rights in South Africa. But Harry died of a stroke when Orlando was only four years old. After that, Orlando and his older sister,  Samantha Bloom , were raised by their mother, Sonia, and family friend, Colin Stone. When Orlando was 13, Sonia revealed to him that Colin was actually his biological father. Orlando attended St. Edmunds School in Canterbury but struggled in many courses because of dyslexia. He did embrace the arts, however, and enjoyed pottery, photography and sculpturing. He also participated in school plays and was active at his local theater. As a teen, Orlando landed his first job: he was a clay trapper at a pigeon shooting range. Encouraged by his mother, he and his sister began studying poetry and prose, eventually giving readings at Kent Festival. Orlando and Samantha won many poetry and Bible reciting competitions. Then Orlando, who always idolized larger-than-life characters, gravitated towards serious acting. At the age of 16, he moved to London and joined the National Youth Theatre, spending two seasons there and gaining a scholarship to train with the British American Drama Academy. Like many young actors, he also auditioned for a number of television roles to further his career, landing bit parts in British television shows  "Casualty"  (1986), "Midsomer Murders"  (1997) and  "Smack the Pony"  (1999). He also appeared in the critically acclaimed movie  Wilde  (1997). He then attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. It was there, in 1998, that Orlando fell three stories from a rooftop terrace and broke his back. Despite fears that he would be permanently paralyzed, he quickly recovered and returned to the stage. As fate would have it, seated in the audience one night in 1999 was a director named  Peter Jackson . After the show, he met with Orlando and asked him to audition for his new set of movies. After graduating from Guildhall, Orlando began work on the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, spending 18 months in New Zealand bringing to life "Legolas", a part which made him a household name. Today, he is one of the busiest and most sought-after actors in the industry.

Personal Quotes
On his character Legolas and the way Legolas moves: "Legolas doesn't speak a lot - he prefers to let his actions speak for him. Legolas' moves are smooth and elegant, like a cat. You know how cats can jump and land steadily on their paws? That's what I'm trying to do. There's a strength in that, but it's very balletic. It's also bloody hard to do without falling over!"
It's all very surreal. I've had two very fantastic experiences. In Lord of the Rings and in Black Hawk Down. I feel very lucky. I'm sort of doubly excited.
I'm rather accident-prone, I have to admit. I've broken my back, my ribs, my nose, both my legs, my arm, my wrist, a finger and a toe and cracked my skull three times.
On how he got the part in  Black Hawk Down  (2001): "My character breaks his back, and I had mentioned I had done that when I was up for the part. Who knows why one actor gets a job and another doesn't? I think it was just good timing that I happened to be there and I had had the experience - I mean, I was lucky."
I broke my back. I fell out of a window... some friends had a roof terrace on the landing before their apartment, and I fell off the drain pipe. It gave way, actually, and I fell three floors. I was told I might not walk again. So, for about four days,I was contemplating that as a serious part of reality. Then they operated, and I walked out of the hospital in about twelve days.
Vig used to call me 'elf boy,' and I'd call him 'filthy human.' As an Elf, I never got a scratch on me, never got dirty. And Vig would come out with blood and sweat all over him. And he'd say to me, 'Oh, go manicure your nails.'
On his 2002 Empire  Award : "I think my mum will have [my  award ] in pride of place somewhere beside my grandmother on the mantelpiece."
We have these digs at each other. Viggo will go on about Elves and how they're always doing their nails and brushing their long, blonde hair, and being all prissy. And I just say: Well, at least I'm going to live forever! Got that? LIVE FOREVER!
You have to be quite serious about tattoos [because] they're there forever.
For a young actor like me to have the oportunity to work with the genre of actors and directors on 'Lord Of The Rings' is unbelievable. There was no, should I should I not. It was like, where do I sign up! It was just bonkers. It was like here, have a life.
It's a bit strange to be included in those sexiest people polls and all that sort of thing. I don't really even know who I'm up against!
Elf Envy...they all had it.
Aged nine, I had this girlfriend, and we used to have running races in the park to see who would be her boyfriend for the day. I wanted to be like Superman and fly in and rescue her. Once I realised Superman was an actor, I thought, 'That's for me.'
On being in love in general: "I'm in love with love. It's heavenly when you're falling for someone and you can't stop thinking about her."
The girls have got a bit excited. I spoke to my agent and she says she's wading through the fan mail. We've got bags of it. I'm like, 'OK, well, what do we do with that, then?' And she explains that we're sending them pictures and stuff, which is great.
It was like a drama school of its own, being on set. Peter [Jackson] is a genius.  Ian McKellen  is the greatest theatre actor in Britain. He's somebody I look at and say, 'That's what I would like to do.' I had studied videos of his performances, so it was bizarre to be thrown into an environment with him.
The thing with Ridley [Scott] is he's been doing this forever, he knows what it is he wants and how to get it. There's absolutely no messing around on set. Having said that, he's very accessible to actors, very open to what you want to do and willing to talk about it. He casts people who he feels are going to bring something to the role and allows them to take care of the situation, to do what it is that they do.
I'm quite sensitive to women. I saw how my sister got treated by boyfriends. I read this thing that said when you are in a relationship with a woman, imagine how you would feel if you were her father. That's been my approach, for the most part.
Theatre is something that I feel very important for an actor to keep doing. I think it keeps you sharp. But at the moment I'm intrigued with movies and filmmaking. It hasn't lured me away from theatre, but I'm just going to try to ride this wave and then jump onto another and see how far it takes me.
I did send a girl a plane ticket, asking her for a visit, I guess that's quite romantic.
I'd like to grow old gracefully or pain free at least.
I know how lucky I am. I've no complaints about the work.
Fame and celebrity were not something that I contemplated because they were too far ahead to imagine.
When I'm not working, I prefer to sit and do nothing. The simple things suddenly become more enjoyable.
If life isn't about humanity, then tell me what it's about, because I'd love to know.
[on Pirates of the Carribean] It's the best gig in the world, are you kidding me?
I always feel like a pirate.
I see my career as a marathon. I don't see it as a sprint. Hopefully, I'll be around for a long time, to see my son grow up and have the opportunity to keep working on films.
It's harder on some days than on others. It's (difficult) if ten cars with cameras are following you. My first priority is trying to protect my family.
[on his wife and son] Attraction doesn't stop when a child is born. It's the opposite. Being a mum and dad makes you even sexier. It's the most challenging part of my life. And I feel blessed. Flynn totally turned my world upside down. Everything I considered important suddenly faded from the spotlight. Now my favorite pastime is to take a bath with my son.
