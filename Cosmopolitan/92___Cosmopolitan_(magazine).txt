Who is Amanda Laura Bynes?
Who is Amanda Laura Bynes? The entertainment world knows her as
an American actress,
fashion designer , and singer. Bynes
appeared in several successful television series, such as
All That
and
The Amanda Show , on Nickelodeon in the mid to late 1990s and
early 2000s, and in 2002, she starred in the TV series,
What I Like About You
. She transitioned to a film career, starring in several films aimed at
teenage audiences, including
She's the Man
(2006) and
Hairspray
(2007).
Bynes was named one of
Teen People 's
"25 Hottest Stars Under 25" in 2006,
and in 2007,
Forbes
listed her as the fifth highest paid
celebrity under 21, with earnings of $2.5 million.
In 2010, Bynes announced her retirement from acting.
After one month, Bynes announced she had "unretired".
Early life Bynes was born April 3, 1986  and raised in
Thousand Oaks,
California , the
daughter of Lynn ( née
Organ), a
dental assistant
and office manager, and Rick Bynes, a
dentist
who also practiced
stand-up comedy .
Bynes has two older siblings, Tommy (born 1974), a
chiropractor , and Jillian (born 1983), who has a
B.A.
in
History
from
UCLA
and has also acted.
Bynes' maternal grandparents are from
Toronto, Ontario,
Canada
and her ancestors immigrated from
Ireland ,
Poland ,
Russia
and
Romania .
Her father is
Catholic
and her mother is
Jewish ;
Bynes has described herself as Jewish,
and has also stated "I haven't decided yet [on a religion]. I don't
know yet exactly what I believe".
Career Acting
In 1993, Bynes attended a comedy camp, with guest-instructors
including
Arsenio Hall
and
Richard
Pryor , and began professionally acting at the age of seven,
appearing in a television advertisement for
Buncha Crunch
candies.
During her childhood, she also appeared on stage in versions of
Annie ,
The Secret Garden ,
The
Music Man
and
The Sound of Music .
After taking acting classes, Bynes became a regular cast member of
Nickelodeon 's
Figure
It Out
and
All That
(both in 1996). Bynes remained a
regular cast member on
All That
until its presumed cancellation
in 2000, though she appeared in the sketches since shooting and
preparing as the star of her own sketch show
The Amanda Show , also on Nickelodeon.
The Amanda Show
features a combination of comical skits and sketches, including Amanda
Bynes playing Judge Trudy, a judge based on
Judge
Judy
that always rules in kids' favor, and Penelope Taynt, an
Amanda-obsessed fan.
Bynes made her film debut in 2002's modest box office success,
Big
Fat Liar , where she starred opposite
Frankie
Muniz . Her first solo leading role was in 2003's
What a Girl Wants
as Daphne
Reynolds, co-starring with
Colin
Firth ,
Oliver James
and
Kelly
Preston . Subsequently, Bynes starred in
The WB Television Network 's sitcom
What I Like About You
and had voice parts in 2003's
Charlotte's Web 2:
Wilbur's Great Adventure
and 2005's
CGI
animated comedy,
Robots . She also co-starred in an episode of
The Nightmare Room
as Danielle Warner, and in

edition with nine of
Hollywood 's other female young stars, including
Lindsay
Lohan ,
Hilary Duff ,
Alexis
Bledel ,
Raven-Symoné ,
Evan Rachel Wood , the
Olsen Twins , and
Mandy
Moore .
Although she is often compared with them, Bynes has said that "It's
like being the hot girl at the high school party. I was never that girl.
I grew up with terrible acne and feeling insecure. I was tall and
skinny. I didn't feel pretty at all, and guys didn't even like me.
That's why I got into comedy."
Bynes has also said that her relatability to teenage audiences may stem
from the fact that she is "more similar to them than some... socialite
or whatever".
Bynes at the premiere of
Robots . In 2006, Bynes starred in
She's the Man , a comedy based on
William Shakespeare 's
Twelfth
Night ; in the film, Bynes disguises herself as her brother in
order to join the boys' soccer team due to the fall of the girls' team.
Producers had originally wanted to cast singer
Jesse McCartney
as Bynes' brother, noting a physical
resemblance between McCartney and Bynes disguised as a boy, but
McCartney was unavailable.
James Kirk
plays her brother in the film.
Around the time of the film's release, Bynes commented that she would
like to start appearing in more mature roles, and believes that she is
still developing her acting skills and maturing as an actress, saying
that she is "getting better" with each role.
Bynes appeared in another romantic comedy,
Lovewrecked , which was shot before
She's
the Man
but released after it, showing in cinemas outside of the
United States in 2005 and 2006 and debuting in the U.S. on the
ABC
Family
network on January 21, 2007. She also portrays Penny
Pingleton in
Hairspray , a film adaptation of
the
Broadway musical
of the
same name . The movie, which was her
first musical role, began filming in
Toronto
in September 2006 and was released on July 20, 2007. Bynes has stated
that she enjoyed appearing in a "fun, quirky part in a big ensemble
movie".
Bynes next starred in another comedy,
Sydney
White , released on September 21, 2007.
The film is based on
Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs , with Bynes playing a freshman in the
college Greek system, co-starring alongside
Sara
Paxton
and
Matt Long .
In 2008, Bynes appeared in the
Lifetime Television
movie
Living Proof
as the student
assistant of
Harry Connick, Jr. 's character, who
creates the Herceptin drug for
breast
cancer .
In April 2009, Bynes filmed a pilot for an
ABC
sitcom
titled
Canned , but the series failed to make the network's fall
lineup. Bynes was also originally set to appear as the female lead in
the 2009 comedy
Post Grad , and was replaced by
Alexis
Bledel .
In June 2009, Bynes inked a two picture deal with Screen Gems. The
first of the two movies is teen comedy
Easy A ,
starring
Emma Stone
and
Lisa
Kudrow , and the second was to have been a starring role
Bynes also planned to reprise her role as Penny Pingleton in the big
screen sequel to
Hairspray .
However,
Hairspray 2
was
cancelled. On June 19, 2010, Bynes announced on her
Twitter
that she has decided to retire from her acting career, because she no
longer enjoys it as much as she once did. Her last film to be released
was to be
Easy A .
On July, 23 Bynes announced via Twitter that she "unretired".
Fashion In 2007, Bynes signed a five-year deal with
Steve & Barry's
(which had been expanding its
product offerings outside of its traditional university apparel and
sweatshirts) to create her own fashion line,
Dear , consisting of
apparel and accessories. The line launched in stores August 16, 2007.
The clothing line was cut short when Steve & Barry's filed
Chapter 11 bankruptcy
in 2008 and went out of business completely in January 2009.
Personal life Bynes started out at University Elementary, and later graduated from
Thousand Oaks High School 's
independent study program (though she attended
La Reina High School
in Thousand Oaks for some time).
She has expressed a desire to attend
New York University
in the near future. She briefly
moved into an apartment in
Hollywood ,
California ,
but has since returned to her family home in Thousand Oaks.
Bynes is interested in drawing and fashion design, having commented
that she is "the girl whose biggest nightmare would be to lose my makeup
bag while traveling."
In 2007, Bynes spoke out against becoming another wild Hollywood
star: "I think I’ll go out as much as I’ve ever gone out... which is not
a lot. I like to dance and stuff, but drinking isn’t good for you in
every way. It’s not good for your skin; it makes you feel horrible. So,
drinking-wise, no".
She restated these ideas in interviews throughout the summer of 2007,
telling
Access Hollywood : "I like being with my
family and friends, and I don't need to be out at the clubs."
In an interview in December 2007, Bynes described how her parents
taught her about
alcohol .
Bynes has since stated that she is "reevaluating" how to spend her
social time. In the January 2009 issue of
Cosmopolitan , she stated: "I
used to be known as the girl who was anti the club scene. But I'm
finding a balance. I can have a drink and dance if I want. You have to
go out to meet people and guys. I'm in that phase where I just want to
have fun."
Bynes appeared in lingerie on the cover of the February 2010 issue of
Maxim
magazine, highlighting her photo
spread inside. She stated "I think every shot ... was sexy" and that the
new look is "who I am."
