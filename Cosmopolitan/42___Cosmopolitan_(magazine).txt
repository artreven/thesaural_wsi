''I think God has a big plane for me...I just don't think it's in this life'' GIA MARIE CARANGI
Gia Marie Carangi - GIA
(January 29, 1960 – November 18, 1986)
was an
American
fashion model during the late 1970s and early 1980s . Carangi was considered by some to be the
first
supermodel ,
although that title has also been given to others, including
Janice Dickinson ,
Dorian Leigh , and
Jean Shrimpton .
Cindy Crawford , who also appeared on the covers of fashion publications during her time, was later referred to as "Baby Gia" due to her resemblance to Carangi.
Carangi was featured on the cover of
fashion magazines , including
Vogue , April 1, 1979;
Vogue Paris , April 1979;
American Vogue , August 1980;
Vogue Paris , August 1980;
Italian Vogue , January 1981; and several issues of
Cosmopolitan
between 1979 and 1982.
After she became addicted to
heroin , Carangi's modeling
career rapidly declined . She later
became infected with
HIV
and died at the age of 26 . Her death was not widely publicized and few people in the fashion industry knew of it.
Carangi is thought to be one of the first famous women to die of
AIDS .
A biographical film starring
Angelina Jolie , debuted on
HBO
in 1998.

A beaUTiful LOST Angel
"Life and Death
energy and peace
if I stopped today it was fun
even the terrible pains
that have burned me
and scarred my soul It was worth it
for having been allowed
to walk where I walked
Which is to hell on earth Heaven on earth
back again, into, under, far in between,
through it, in it, over and above it." (Gia 1986)

"Vita e morte
energia e pace
se mi fermo ora è stato divertente
e anche le terribili sofferenze
che mi hanno consumata
e hanno lasciato segni indelebili nella mia anima
sono valse la pena
perché mi è stato donato di camminare dove ho camminato
che è stato l'inferno in terra poi il Paradiso in terra
e poi di nuovo giù, al suo interno, sotto di esso, in mezzo ai due,
attraverso esso, dentro esso e poi oltre." (libera traduzione di M.Canevari)

...TO ARTISTS' TRUE...
-I dedicate this Blog-Diary to artists'true, innermost soul.To aspiring artists who have not yet found their place.''To struggle to succeed. To the dufficulty in expressinga passion that is often nurtured in the deepest cornerof the soul. To those who nourish and develop a stanceand special outlook on life deep in their heart. To those whowork with great commitment and perseverance without losingthe most precious and less exposed film: individualand personal vocation. To all those individuals whom I likeand who give me the opportunity to express my dignity.''-
