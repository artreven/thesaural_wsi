sports coupe Layout FR layout The Mazda RX-7 (also called the
Ẽfini
RX-7) is a
sports car
produced by the Japanese automaker
Mazda
from 1978 to 2002. The original RX-7 competed in the affordable
sports car
segment with the likes of the
Nissan Fairlady Z . The styling was inspired by the
Lotus Elan
2+2. It featured a unique twin-rotor
Wankel rotary engine
and a sporty
front-midship ,
rear-wheel drive
layout, making it well balanced and appropriate for
racing . The RX-7 was a direct replacement for the
RX-3
(both were sold in Japan as the Savanna) and subsequently replaced all other Mazda rotary cars with the exception of the
Cosmo . The original RX-7 was a true
sports coupé
design, as opposed to a
sports car
like the
Triumph TR6
or a
sedan
with sporting intentions. The compact and light-weight
Wankel engine , also known as a rotary engine is situated slightly behind the front
axle . It was offered in
America
as a two-seat coupé, with four seats being optional in
Japan ,
Australia , and other parts of the world. The RX-7 made
Car and Driver
magazine's
Ten Best list
five times. In total, 811,634 RX-7s were produced.

(GSL-SE) 1983 Mazda RX-7 Series 1 (1979–1980) is commonly referred to as the "SA22C" from the first alphanumerics of the vehicle identification number- although RX-7 tech site
Rotorhead.ca
points out that the chassis code used by Mazda was 'P642'. This series of RX-7 had exposed steel bumpers and a high-mounted license plate located in an indented part of the rear of the car, famously criticized by Werner Buhrer of Road & Track magazine as a "Baroque depression." Buhrer published his own suggested design for this part of the car.[ citation needed ] Series 2 (1981–1983) had smoothly integrated plastic-covered bumpers, wide black rubber body side moldings, wraparound taillights and updated engine control components. The GSL package provided optional 4-wheel disc brakes and clutch-type rear
limited slip differential
(LSD). Known as the "FB" in North America after the
US Department of Transportation
mandated 17 digit Vehicle Identification Number changeover. Elsewhere in the world, the 1981-1985 RX-7 is technically still an 'SA22C' among enthusiasts. The license-plate surround looks much like Buhrer's "Styling Impressions."[ citation needed ] Series 3 (1984–1985) featured an updated lower front fascia and different instrument cluster (the S3 RX-7 is the only rotary-engined car to not have a centrally mounted tachometer). GSL package was continued into this series, but Mazda introduced the GSL-SE sub-model. The GSL-SE had a
fuel injected
1.3 L
13B RE-EGI
engine producing 135 hp (101 kW) and 135 lb-ft. GSL-SEs had much the same options as the GSL (clutch-type rear LSD and rear disc brakes), but the brake rotors were larger, allowing Mazda to use the more common lug nuts (versus bolts), and a new bolt pattern of 4x114.3 (4x4.5"). Also, they had upgraded suspension with stiffer springs and shocks, and a new, heavy duty oil cooler. The 1984 RX-7 G has an estimated 29 highway miles per gallon (12.33 kilometres per
litre ) /19 estimated city miles per gallon (8.08 km/l). According to Mazda, its rotary engine, licensed by NSU-Wankel allowed the RX-7 G to accelerate from 0 to 50 (80 km/h) in 6.3 seconds.
Kelley Blue Book , in its January-February 1984 issue, noted that a 1981 RX-7 G retained 93.4% of its original sticker price. The handling and
acceleration
of the car were noted to be of a high caliber for its day. This generation RX-7 had "live axle"
4-link
rear
suspension
with
Watt's linkage , a
50/50 weight ratio , and weighed under 2600
lb
(1180
kg ). It was the lightest generation of RX-7 ever produced.
12A -powered models accelerated from 0–60 mph in 9.2 s, and turned 0.779 lateral Gs on a skidpad. The
12A
engine produced 100 hp (75 kW) at 6000 rpm, allowing the car to reach speeds of over 120
mph
(190
km/h ). Because of the smoothness inherent in the
Wankel rotary engine , little vibration or harshness was experienced at high rpm, so a buzzer was fitted to the
tachometer
to warn the driver when the 7000
rpm
redline was approaching. The 12A engine has a long thin shaped combustion chamber, there is a large surface area in relation to its volume. So combustion is cool, giving few oxides of nitrogen. However, the combustion is also incomplete, so there are large amounts of partly burned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The exhaust is hot enough for combustion of these to continue into the exhaust. An engine driven pump supplies air into the exhaust to complete the burn of these chemicals. This is done in the "thermal reactor", chamber where the exhaust manifold would normally be on a conventional engine. Under certain conditions the pump injects air into the thermal reactor and at other times air is pumped through injectors into the exhaust ports. This fresh air is needed for more efficient and cleaner burning of the air/fuel mixture. This system is extremely conducive to creating backfires because the combustion continues down the exhaust system. Further modification of the engine can yield even more impressive backfires. For example, adding a header system or disconnecting the air pump allows the unburnt fuels to build up therefore strengthening the backfires. It is not uncommon to witness unmodified RX-7's produce flaming backfires from the exhaust tips. Options and models varied from country to country. The gauge layout and interior styling in the Series 3 was only changed for
North American
versions. Additionally, North America was the only market to have offered the first generation RX-7 with the fuel injected
13B . A
turbocharged
(but non- intercooled )
12A
engine was available for the top-end model of Series 3 in Japan. Sales were strong, with a total of 474,565 first generation cars produced; 377,878 were sold in the United States alone. In 2004,
Sports Car International
named this car #7 on its list of
Top Sports Cars of the 1970s . In 1983, the RX-7 would appear on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for the first time. [ edit ] Second generation (FC) FC Production 1985–1991 Engine(s) 1.3L 146 hp

13B-VDEI
producing 146 hp (108 kW). An optional
turbocharged
model, known as the Turbo II, had 182 hp (135 kW). Series 5 (1989–1992) featured updated styling and better engine management, as well as lighter rotors and a higher
compression ratio , 9.7:1 for the naturally aspirated model, and 9.0:1 for the turbo model. The Turbo II moniker was dropped, and the turbocharged model was simply dubbed Turbo. The naturally aspirated Series 5 FC made 160
hp
(119
kW ), while the Series 5 Turbo made 200 hp (147 kW). The second generation RX-7 ("FC", VIN begins JM1FC3 or JMZFC1), still known as the "Savanna RX-7" in Japan, featured a complete restyling reminiscent of the
Porsche 928 . Mazda's stylists, lead by Chief Project Engineer Akio Uchiyama, actually focused more on the Porsche 944 for their inspiration in designing the FC because the new car was being styled primarily for the American market, where the majority of first generation RX-7's had been sold. This strategy was chosen after Uchiyama and others on the design team spent time in the United States studying owners of earlier RX-7's and other sports cars popular in the American market. The Porsche 944 was selling particularly well at the time and provided clues as to what sports-car enthusiasts might find compelling in future RX-7 styling and equipment. While the SA22/FB was a purer sports car, the FC tended toward the softer sport-tourer trends of its day. Handling was much improved, with less of the
oversteer
tendencies of the FB. Steering was more precise, with
rack and pinion
steering
replacing the old
recirculating ball
steering of the FB.
Disc brakes
also became standard, with some models (S4: GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found. Though about 80 lb heavier and more isolated than its predecessor, the FC continued to win accolades from the press. The FC RX-7 was
Motor Trend 's
Import Car of the Year
for 1986, and the Turbo II was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for a second time in 1987. Many car drivers still favor the FC more than the FD because of its high tuning potential and upfront affordability. In 1988, a convertible version started production in atmospheric and turbocharged form, proving an instant success. This sleek, clean-lined model featured a cabriolet design and was introduced to the American market in splashy television advertisements featuring Hollywood actor
James Garner , who was known to race cars in his spare time. Several leading car magazines at the time also selected the convertible as the best ragtop available on the market, and it was the star of auto shows around the globe. The convertible's well orchestrated introduction caused a notable public sensation and heavy demand for these vehicles. Dealers took full advantage of the situation, charging up to $5,000 above Mazda's suggested retail selling price with buyers happy to pay the premium. It is believed Mazda exported approximately five thousand convertibles to the United States in 1988 and fewer in each of the next three model years, although it is difficult to confirm these figures, as Mazda USA did not keep RX-7 import records by model type. Despite production ceasing in October 1991, Mazda built a limited run of 500 convertibles for 1992 as "specials" for the domestic market only. In Japan, the United Kingdom, and other regions outside the US, a turbocharged version of the convertible was available. Being former "dream cars", it now appears a nascent collectors market is developing for these classic, semi-exotic sports cars. In the Japanese market, only the turbo engine was available; the atmospheric version was allowed only as an export. This can be attributed to insurance companies penalising turbo cars (thus restricting potential sales). This emphasis on containing horsepower and placating insurance companies to make RX-7's more affordable seems ironic in retrospect. Shortly after the discontinuance of the second generation RX-7's in 1991, an outright horsepower "arms race" broke out between sports car manufacturers, with higher and higher levels of horsepower required to meet buyer demands. Overall, the second generation was the most successful for Mazda sales wise, with 86,000 units sold in the US alone in 1986, its first model year. The FC model is believed to have achieved its peak in sales in 1988. [ edit ] Third generation (FD) FD Production 1991–2002 Engine(s) 1.3L 255 hp

manual Wheelbase 95.5 in Length 168.5 in Width 68.9 in Height 48.4 in Mazda 13B-REW Engine (Modified) Image:3rotor.jpg 20b Pettit Racing engine in an RX-7 Series 6 (1992–1995) was exported throughout the world and had the highest sales. In Japan, Mazda sold the RX-7 through its
Efini
brand as the Efini RX-7. Only the 1993–1995 model years were sold in the U.S. and Canada. Series 6 came with 230hp and 200lb-Tor. Series 7 (1996–1998) included minor changes to the car. Updates included a simplified vacuum routing manifold and a 16-bit ECU allowing for increased boost which netted an extra 10 hp. In Japan, the Series 7 RX-7 was marketed under the Mazda brand name. The Series 7 was also sold in Australia, New Zealand and the UK. Series 7 RX-7s were produced only in right-hand-drive configuration. Series 8 (January 1999– August 2002) was the final series, and was only available in the Japanese market. More efficient turbochargers were installed, while improved intercooling and radiator cooling was made possible by a revised frontal area. The seats, steering wheel, and front and rear lights were all changed. The rear wing was modified and gained adjustability. The top-of-the-line "Type RS" came equipped with a Bilstein suspension and 17" wheels as standard equipment, and reduced weight to 1280 kg. Power was officially claimed as 250 ps (276 hp, 208 kW) (with 330 N·m (243 ft·lbf) of torque) as per the maximum Japanese limit, though realistic power was more likely 220–230 kW (290–308 hp). The Type RZ version included all the features of the Type RS, but at a lighter weight (at 1270 kg). It also featured custom gun-metal colored BBS wheels and a custom red racing themed interior. Further upgrades included a new 16-bit ECU and ABS system upgrades. The improved ABS system worked by braking differently on each wheel, allowing the car better turning during braking. The effective result made for safer driving for the average buyer. Easily the most collectible of all the RX-7s was the last 1,500 run-out specials. Dubbed the "Spirit R", they combined all the "extra" features Mazda had used on previous limited-run specials and all sold within days of being announced. They still command amazing prices on the Japanese used car scene years later. - There are three kinds of "Spirit R": the "Type A", "Type B", and "Type C". The "Type A", which accounts for 500 of the 1,500 "Spirit" models produced, has a 5-speed manual transmission, and is said to have the best performance of the three models. The "Type B" has a 2+2 seat configuration and also sports a 5-speed manual transmission, 500 of which were also made. "The Spirit C" is also a 2+2, but has a 3-speed automatic transmission and 500 were made. There is also a "Touring Model" which includes a
sun roof , and Bose stereo system. Compared to the R1 and R2 which both don't have a
moon roof , and they have an extra front oil cooler in the front bumper, and other race modification equipment The third and final generation of the RX-7, FD (with FD3S for the JDM and JM1FD for the USA VIN), was an outright, no-compromise sports car by Japanese standards. It featured an aerodynamic, futuristic-looking body design (a testament to its near 11-year lifespan). The 13B-REW was the first-ever mass-produced sequential twin-turbocharger system to export from Japan, boosting power to 255 hp (190 kW) in 1993 and finally 280 ps (276 hp, 208 kW, the Japanese manufacturers' gentlemen's agreement on engine power) by the time production ended in Japan in 2002. The FD RX-7 was
Motor Trend 's Import\Domestic Car of the Year. When
Playboy
magazine first reviewed the FD RX-7 in 1993, they tested it in the same issue as the [then] new
Dodge Viper . In that issue, Playboy declared the RX-7 to be the better of the two cars. It went on to win
Playboy 's Car of the Year for 1993. The FD RX-7 also made Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1993 through 1995, for every year in which it was sold state-side. June, 2007 Road&Track magazine proclaimed "The ace in Mazda's sleeve is the RX-7, a car once touted as the purest, most exhilarating sports car in the world. The sequential twin turbocharged system was a very complex piece of engineering, developed with the aid of
Hitachi
and previously used on the domestic
Cosmo
series (JC Cosmo=90–95). The system was comprised of two small turbochargers, one to provide torque at low RPM. The 2nd unit was on standby until the upper half of the rpm range during full throttle acceleration. The first turbocharger provided 10 psi of boost from 1800 rpm, and the 2nd turbocharger was activated at 4000 rpm and also provided 10 psi (70 kPa). The changeover process was incredibly smooth, and provided linear acceleration and a very wide torque curve throughout the entire rev range. Handling in the FD was regarded as world-class, and it is still regarded as being one of the finest handling and best balanced cars of all time. The continued use of the front-midship engine and drivetrain layout, combined with an 50:50 front-rear weight distribution ratio and low center of gravity made the FD a very competent car at the limits. In North America, three models were offered; the "base", the touring, and the R models. The touring FD had a sunroof, leather seats, and a complex
Bose
Acoustic Wave system. The R (R1 in 1993 and R2 in 1994–95) models featured stiffer suspensions, an
aerodynamics
package, suede seats, and Z-rated
tires . Australia had a special high performance version of the RX-7 in 1995, dubbed the RX-7 SP. This model was developed as a
homologated
road-going version of the race car used in the 12hr endurance race held at
Bathurst, New South Wales , beginning in 1991. An initial run of 25 were made, and later an extra 10 were built by Mazda due to demand. The RX-7 SP produced 204 kW (274 hp) and 357 N·m (263 ft·lbf) of torque, compared to 176 kW (236 hp) and 294 N·m (217 ft·lbf) on the standard version. Other changes included a race-inspired nose cone, race-proven rear wing, a 120 L fuel tank (as opposed to the 76 L tank in the standard car), a 4.3:1-ratio rear differential, 17 in diameter wheels, larger brake rotors and calipers. An improved intercooler, exhaust, and modified
ECU
were also included. Weight was reduced significantly with the aid of carbon fibre; a lightweight bonnet and seats were used to reduce weight to just 1218 kg (from 1310 kg). It was a serious road going race car that matched their rival Porsche 968CSRS for the final year Mazda officially entered. The formula paid off when the RX-7SP won the title, giving Mazda the winning trophy for a fourth straight year. A later special version, the Bathurst R, was released in 2001. A popular modification to the 3rd Gen RX-7 is the substitution of a
20B
(2.0 litre) 3-rotor engine taken from the
Eunos Cosmo
in place of the stock
13B
(1.3 litre) 2-rotor engine. Many aftermarket performance houses sell conversion kits with the 20B engine, such as
Stillen
and Pettit Racing. Such 3-rotor configurations typically produce 550 hp and a top speed of well over 200 mph. While critics claim that any
13B
2-rotor RX-7 can be highly tuned to achieve this level of performance, the difference is in daily drivability and reliability that makes the
20B
conversion superior to the stock 13B motor at those high horsepower levels.

24 hours of Le Mans
endurance race. The first outing for the car, equipped with a
13B
engine, failed by less than one second to qualify in 1979. The next year, a 12A-engine car not only qualified, it placed 21st overall. That same car did not finish in 1981, along with two more 13B cars. Those two cars were back for 1982, with one 14th place finish and another DNF. The RX-7 Le Mans effort was replaced by the
717C
prototype for 1983. In 1991, Mazda became the first (and so far, only) Japanese manufacturer to win the 24 hours of Le Mans. The car was a 4-rotor prototype class car, the 787B. The FIA outlawed rotary engines shortly after this win. Mazda began racing RX-7s in the
IMSA
GTU
series in 1979. That first year, RX-7s placed first and second at the
24 Hours of Daytona , and claimed the GTU series championship. The car continued winning, claiming the GTU championship seven years in a row. The RX-7 took the
GTO
championship ten years in a row from 1982. The RX-7 has won more IMSA races than any other car model. The RX-7 also fared well at the
Spa 24 Hours
race. Three Savanna/RX-7s were entered in 1981 by
Tom Walkinshaw Racing . After hours of battling with several
BMW 530i
and
Ford Capri , the RX-7 driven by
Pierre Dieudonné
and
Tom Walkinshaw
won the event. Mazda had turned the tables on
BMW , who had beaten Mazda's
Familia Rotary
to the podium eleven years earlier at the same event. TWR's prepared RX-7s also won the
British Touring Car Championship
in 1980 and 1981, driven by
Win Percy . Canadian/Australian touring car driver
Allan Moffat
was instrumental in bringing Mazda into the Australian touring car scene. Over a four year span beginning in 1981, Moffat took the Mazda RX-7 to victory in the 1983
Australian Touring Car Championship , as well as a trio of
Bathurst 1000
podiums, in 1981 (3rd with
Derek Bell ), 1983 (second with
Yoshima Katayama ) and 1984 (third with former motorcycle champion
Gregg Hansford ). Australia's adoption of international
Group A
regulations, combined with Mazda's reluctance to homologate a Group A RX-7, ended Mazda's active participation in the touring car series at the end of the 1984 season. The RX-7 even made an appearance in the
World Rally Championship . The car finished 11th on its debut at the
RAC Rally
in
Wales
in 1981.
Group B
received much of the focus for the first part of the 1980s, but Mazda did manage to place third at the 1985
Acropolis Rally , and the
Familia 4WD
claimed the victory at
Swedish Rally
in both 1987 and 1989. The RX-7 is considered as a popular choice in import drag racing, during the late nineties toward 2004
Abel Ibarra
raced a spaceframe FD which averaged no less than high 6 seconds passes, until he replaced it with a spaceframe RX-8, the FD was later to shipped and sold to an Australian. The FC and FD is considered a popular choice for
drifting
contests, given the long wheelbase and an average of 450 bhp.

RX-8 . It produces approximately 232 hp naturally aspirated (the USDM version FD3S produces 255 hp stock with two Hitachi turbochargers), while the Japanese market version produces around 250 hp. It's also been said by Automobile Magazine that a new generation of RX-7s will be returning in 2011. [ edit ] Movies and TV The car appeared in the Japanese anime series,
Initial D , driven by both the Takahashi brothers-Keisuke and Ryosuke, with Keisuke driving a yellow twin-turbo FD3S and Ryosuke driving a white FC3S-and the girl that likes Keisuke, Kyoko, who drives a black single turbo FD3S. A yellow FB is used in the
Metal Heroes
show
Uchuu Keiji Shaider
by Annie to patrol the streets. The FD was featured in several
Need for Speed
games as well as Japanese imported racing computer games. The RX-7 has made an appearance in every Gran Turismo game to date, which includes many types of the different generations, including specially tuned racing versions by the various 'shops' in 'Gran Turismo mode'. The RX-7 FD has also been featured in every film in the ' Fast and the Furious ' franchise so far. The FD RX-7 is shown in "Office Space" in the parking lot of Initech. The FD RX-7 is featured in "Fast Getaway II". It is the center of a high-speed chase. The FC RX-7 is shown in "Don't be a Menace To South Central While Drinking Juice in the Hood" Strangely, the FC RX-7 is very often classified as a higher class(harder) car than the FD in video games. A highly modified RX-7 was fabricated by Veilside, one of Japan's largest automotive aftermarket companies, to show off its "Fortune" wide-body kit at the 2005 Tokyo Auto Salon. The car won the Grand Prix of show, soon after picture Car Coordinator Dennis McCarthy saw it and decided it should, repainted Sunset Orange Pearl, co-star in
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift . Veilside also built three duplicates for the film while the Tokyo Drift shop built three more visual clones — including one destined for destruction using a Mazda RX-7 that appeared in both previous Fast and Furious films as its base.

RX7
You've got to hand it to Mazda. Ever since it released the 'Series 1' RX-7 in the late '70s, it resisted all temptation to soften its affordable sportscar design - the brilliant weight distribution, the wonderfully linear torque delivery and driver emphasis have long remained RX-7 trademarks. Contrast this with Nissan, which really lost the plot with its Zed during much of the 1980s.
The RX-7 saga came to a sad end in August 2002 with the axing of the so-called Series 8. The Series 8 RX-7 was unleashed on the Japanese market in January 1999 and the up-spec Type R and RS versions gained recognition for having more power than any other prior RX-7. Note that the Series 8 RX-7 was never officially released in any country outside of Japan.
As you may be aware, car manufacturers in Japan have a loose agreement with the local government to produce vehicles of no more than 280ps (206kW). Although there are a few vehicles that have crept past this limit, we're told that the top-line versions of the Series 8 Type R and RS models are dead-on the 280ps ceiling. The only mass-produced rotary engine that exceeds the 280ps limit is the triple-rotor twin-turbo 20B Cosmo (which is reputedly good for around 300ps or 221kW).
Okay, so the Series 8 RX-7 might not go down in history as the most powerful production rotary - but it is certainly the fastest. Weighing in at 1260 kilograms in go-fast RS form, you're looking at a power to weight ratio of 6.1 kilograms per kilowatt. That whips the new Nissan 350Z (at 7.0 kilograms per kilowatt), so it's no surprise that 5-second 0 - 100 km/h performance is easily within reach. The Japanese motoring press raved over the top-line Type RS's on-road and on-track performance.
RX-7 in Australia In late 1998, Mazda Australia announced it would no longer be importing the RX-7. The decision came as no shock. From 1996 to 1998 only 30-40 RX-7s were sold per year - not enough for a big company to bother about. There was a last-minute rush to pick up the last few examples, but the RX-7 saga fizzled out rather uneventfully.Only now - in 2003 - has the rotary engine reappeared on the Australian market with the debut of the RX-8.
The availability of the 280ps engine in the Series 8 Type R and RS was certainly the biggest progression over the Series 7. So what changes gave the Type R and RS a 15ps (11kW) increase over Series 7 twin-turbos, you ask? Well, the 9.0:1 static compression twin-rotor 13B remains largely unchanged, but its small HT-12 sequential turbochargers received smaller turbine housings and altered blade profiles. At the production stage, each turbine housing was also coated with an adbradable resin and the turbine wheel was then spun in order to shear way the excess resin. Once hardened, this dramatically increased the turbo efficiency. The 280ps motor also ran slightly increased boost pressure (11 psi) and slightly less exhaust backpressure. Exhaust flow was enhanced by using a thinner wall exhaust tube (to increase the internal flow area) and less restrictive mufflers. Even so, the factory exhaust has just a 1¾-inch ID, meaning massive power increases can be found with aftermarket exhaust systems. With these changes, the Series 8 Type R and RS are credited with the full 280ps (206kW) output at 6500 rpm along with 310Nm at 5000 rpm. And if you reckon this is a peaky engine, guess again - more than 280Nm of torque is available from as low as 3000 rpm, making the car extremely flexible.
The Type R and RS's increase in power also called for some added reliability measures. The existing oil injectors for each rotor - which are mounted in each housing near the intake port - were modified to provide quicker response to accelerator inputs. The radiator was also upgraded to a triple-core unit and an external cooler added. Note that the Series 8's revised nosecone is also responsible for dramatically improved cooling efficiency over the Series 7. Interestingly, the Series 7 was susceptible to poor oil cooling and intercooling when pushed hard on the street or when raced. We're told that cooling airflow available to the intercooler was impaired whenever the engine was at full power and sucking a vast quantity of induction air from a shared forward-facing intake. Mazda Australia's testing for the SP program apparently revealed reverse cooling flow through the intercooler core! This problem was solved in the Series 8 by separating the incoming airflow to the intercooler and airbox - a 'letterbox' slot in the front numberplate mount now feeds induction air to the airbox. Thanks to this mod, a whopping 80 percent improvement in intercooler cooling airflow was seen. The pipe from the turbochargers to the intercooler is also known to pop off at high boost pressure in the Series 7 RX-7, so the Series 8 Type R and RS use a one-piece alloy pipe that's firmly bolted into place. As far as we can determine, this part is exclusive to the Type R and RS. A 5-speed manual is typical for the Series 8 RX-7 but lazy buyers had the option of a 4-speed automatic transmission. Note that a 4-speed auto was available in Japan throughout the FD's life, but never in Australia. More interestingly, however, is that a MazdaSpeed proven 4.3:1 LSD (instead of a 4.1:1 LSD) came standard on the top-line Series 8 Type RS. This is the same diff as fitted to the Series 6 SP. Appropriate high speed cruising rpm is maintained in the Type RS thanks to a taller 5th gear ratio. The FD-series RX-7 was built on a wishbone suspension arrangement that was widely praised as communicative and controllable. The Series 8 RX-7 has virtually the same suspension hardware as the Series 7, but the RS version scores Bilstein dampers along with 17 x 8.5-inch factory alloys wearing 235/45 and 255/40 Bridgestone Potenzas. The standard Series 8 RX-7 carries over the 300mm ventilated front discs and ABS, while the Type R and RS use the 330mm discs that were proven on the Series 6 SP. These big discs required relocating the 4-pot calipers and recalibrating the ABS system. At this point we should mention the Mazda produced a few different versions of the Series 8 RX-7. First is the base Type RB version, which makes 255ps (187kW) in auto form and 265ps (195kW) in 5-speed manual form. Next is the Type R that offers 280ps and the aforementioned Type RS, which adds Bilsteins, a shorter diff, 17s and a few body and trim differences.
RX-7 Chassis Code Nomenclature In case you were wondering, FD RX-7s are identifiable by a system other than Series 6, Series 7 etc. The 1991 - 1995 Series 6 RX-7 carries a FD3S-1/2/3000 chassis code and the 1996 - 1998 Series 7 is officially known as the FD3S-4000. The 1999 - 2002 Series 8 RX-7 is coded FD3S-5/6000.
As mentioned, the Series 8 RX-7 boasts a much more efficient nosecone design - and there's not much else to distinguish it from the Series 7. The round taillights were carried over from the Japanese spec version but the MazdaSpeed inspired adjustable rear wing is new. The only other body mods include front driving lights and backlit rear safety lights. Inside, the Series 8 is pretty similar to the Series 7. The troublesome oil pressure gauge makes way for a turbo boost gauge, a Nardi unit replaces the much-criticised oversized steering wheel and twin airbags come standard. Options include remote central locking and a Bose sound system. Leather trim and a power sunroof were available as special order items. A decent number of Series 8 RX-7s were sold in Japan over the car's 4 year lifespan - 15,000 units to be exact. A Spirit R limited edition was also introduced near the end of the model run. The RX-7 was strategically priced in the Japanese market (equivalent to AUD$55,000) but it's obvious that it would've struggled in Australian market after the expensive importing and ADRing costs were tacked on. As such, the only Series 8 RX-7s you'll see on Australian roads are private imports like David Morris's 2000 Type RS seen here. This particular vehicle has just been sold, but at the time of writing, David has another red Type RS with 17,000 kilometres on the clock that he's offering for AUD$63,000. We enjoyed a brief test drive of the black RS and can vouch that it's a brilliantly responsive and torquey performer with eye-widening top-end performance. The steering is razor sharp, the suspension taught and very well controlled and the brakes ample. The Series 8 is certainly a worthy final act...

SAVING THE BEST UNTIL LAST
Simply the best sports car from a Japanese manufacturer. Mazda did not compromise when designing what is arguably the ultimate Marque killer. The 3rd generation RX-7 didn't rested on the reputations of the prevoius two. 1992 - 93 - 94 - 95 victories in the Bathurst 12 hour endurance events against the best Porsche (open cheque book) racers (944 - 968 - 911RS) & other reputable sports car entries has showed the the world how Mazda's little 1.3 lt rotary engine could outclass the best from Europe & any other country bidding for it's glory. At the popular "Targa Tasmania" each year, even privater RX-7 entries are able to tople the factory Porsche outfits for top honours on regular occasions.
Porsche 911, Honda NSX, Nissan Skyline etc were targets Mazda aimed for, & when released onto the world stage in 1992 the "series-6" RX-7 easily outshined the best of them with styling years ahead of it’s time & breathtaking performance to match. The 3rd generation RX-7 won numerous awards & races throughout the world & became an instant classic. However the cost of building such an "over achiever" meant the 3rd generation had crept up the price scale putting it out of touch with many of it's loyal followers. Reluctantly Mazda dropped the RX-7 from the world stage at the end of the series-6 production run (92-95) leaving the series-7 (96-98) to Japan & Australia only (after Mazda AUS fought hard for it to stay) were they remained as the companies flagship sports car.
A few years later & it was a sad day in Australia's automotive history when the announcement was made late in 98. After 30 years of exportation to our Australian shores, the Mazda rotary was to be no more. 20 of those years where holding the RX-7 name, etching it forever into our hearts and heads. A name that easily brought gloating emotions of Porsche killing even to the average man in the street. Its demise here may have appeared untimely but was not with out reason. Like any business, Mazda produce cars to make money. Due to overpricing here, only 30-40 sold each year in Australia for the series-7 version, (96-98) there seemed little choice but to pull the pin. Where was the problem you ask..? Well, like the US & Europe. It was the pricing. At AUS $89,ooo plus on road costs, Mazda Australia simply took the car far beyond the reach of its true market. "The enthusiast". When the series-6 was released in 1992, the AUS $73,ooo price tag was a hard pill to swallow, especially since the direct equivelent in Japan was AUS$30,ooo cheaper. Mazda would tell you that it worked out that way but then couldn't explain how the 121 - 323 - 626 where all similarly priced between the two countries. By 1998, sales where too low to justify the expensive of re-testing the car for Australian complaince with the pending series-8 in 1999. New emmissions standards meant a lot of expensive re-working & that would have meant pricing the series-8 into the AUS$90,ooo plus catergory.Its fate as an officially released car was sealed.

More RX7 from UK
Generally held to be the most beautiful car ever to hail from the Land Of The Rising Sun, the
Mazda
RX7 could delight and frustrate in equal measures. Here is a car that is stunning to look at, electrifying to drive, agreeably rare, relatively affordable to buy, yet is horrendously thirsty and fiendishly complex mechanically. As the final custodians of the rotary engine concept, the Mazda RX series had its highs and lows. This last RX to be sold here was Mazdas way of going out with a bang. Unless you want similar pyrotechnics from your used RX7, pay close attention. Were it not for Porsches 968 Club Sport, the
Mazda
RX7 would be remembered as the best handling sports coupe of its generation. Little since is able to touch it as a drivers car. As an ownership proposition, the Mazda was uncompromising and high maintenance. Buoyed by the success of Johnny Herbert in a Mazda at Le Mans in 1991, the UK-spec RX7 was designed as a sports car with the emphasis on driving thrills, but many were sold purely on the strength of their looks. With concealed door handles long before the Alfa 156 ever hit the drawing board, voluptuous curves, that elegant sweep of the door line and a cab-back profile that emphasised bonnet without looking overtly chestwig, the RX7 was, and is, a dazzler. The bodywork appears to have melted over the car, its fluidity punctuated with scoops, dams and spoilers with just the right amount of aggression. Aftermarket specials show just how right Mazda got it. The other key talking point was, of course, that rotary engine. Few customers either understood or trusted the Wankel unit, bearing as it did a reputation both for rotor tip wear and prodigious thirst. Mated to twin sequential turbochargers (as seen in the
Porsche
959) the Mazda was a sophisticated piece of kit. This deterred many buyers who saw the big, honest four-cylinder engine of the Porsche 968 as something that would be less of a worry. By and large they were right. The interior of the RX7 fails to match the visual drama of the bodywork, but it nevertheless feels like a great place to drive quickly. The driver is faced by an old-school fascia with chrome bezels lifting the otherwise unremitting black theme. Other clues to the RX7s sporting intent are the tiny gear lever, the drilled aluminium pedal set and the lightweight sports seats. Visibility is pretty good and this helps reduce the intimidation factor, making the RX7 a truly useable sports car. UK-spec 237bhp cars start at around £4,000, which will buy the first of the 1992 cars, in this instance sitting pretty on a K plate. Now that the used market for RX7s has matured, the crazy new pricing policies that Mazda pursued have been smoothed over. For an early 1993 model, expect to pay £6,000 or a smidgeon over £7,000 for an early 1994 car. The last of the 1995 cars, residing on M plates, will fetch around £8,000. Many import companies have recognised the RX7s growing reputation as a modern classic and are shipping in increasing numbers of Japanese specification RX7s, often in RS (most similar to our model) or racy RZ guise. These are both powered by a 276bhp version of the UK cars 13B twin rotor engine, and you can expect to pay up to £25,000 for a nearly new example.Three words that will have Mazda RX7 owners quaking in their boots. Rotor tip wear. It comes to everyone who signs up at this particular rotary club, being caused by carbon build-ups lodging at the tip of the rotors themselves. Normal use will see rotors start to drop in compression and lose power at around 75,000 miles, necessitating an engine rebuild, itself in the region of £2,000. Check to see whether the work has been carried out if youre considering a higher mileage example. Aftermarket parts stores also stock a wide range of auxiliary cooling and heat shielding equipment for the RX7 that tells you that its not a car that particular likes being run in hot weather. Although not too much of a problem in this country, should you run your RX7 hard in during a hot spell, keep an eye on that temperature gauge. You wont want to lose all your water from the radiator or reservoir. If youre buying an import RX7 check that the exhaust is legal. Standard Mazda items are fiendishly expensive for a complete system, boasting as they do two catalytic converters, so they are often replace with freer flowing aftermarket items. The other thing you may have to take into account is that some Mazda dealers will lock themselves in the service bay toilets should you turn up with an RX7, so find out in advance how far youll need to go to get your Rex serviced.(approx based on a 1994 RX7 ex Vat) A rear exhaust box and tail pipe come to about £250, although a full system with both catalysts amounts to an eye-watering £2,000. Front brake pads weigh in at around £100 a pair, with rears retailing at around £90. A new windscreen is £150 whilst a new starter motor will cost you around £315. A clutch wont leave a great deal of change from £400. If this strikes you as expensive, the incredible moving fuel gauge needle will give you a whole new perspective.So long as you can afford to keep pouring in the unleaded at a rate of around 15mpg, youre going to have some serious fun with the RX7. A good used example should still feel lithe, taut and eager in a way that so many contemporary rivals seem to have forgotten. Performance is predictably punchy, the 237bhp rotary engine only having to shift 2888lbs plus you, making the RX7 some 285lbs lighter than a
Honda
NSX. Performance is impressive, the RX7 making 60mph in around 5. 4 seconds before topping out at 156mph. The uncanny smoothness of the RX7s engine is countered by the liveliness of its ride, and it never makes going quickly the strangely anaesthetised experience it is in, say, a
Mitsubishi
3000GT. Handling is also designed to appeal to the hardcore enthusiast. With all that power going to the rear wheels the Mazda serves up huge entertainment for those who enjoy driving their cars at only vague approximations of straight ahead. Especially in the wet, a heavy right boot can lead to some quite outrageous tail-out antics. If youre sensible, the first time you approach the handling limits, the nose will push wide benignly, and can be tucked in with a gentle lift of the throttle. It all feels like an MX-5 on steroids. The gearshift and brakes are both correspondingly excellent, and for those who like this sort of car, the RX7 approaches ten out of ten status. If youre a keen, knowledgeable driver who revels in nods of appreciation from like-minded souls, the RX7 could be just the ticket. Expensive to run but jaw-droppingly beautiful, the Mazda is not recommended for those who merely want a car to look good in. To cruise in an RX7 is to waste it. Its best to try to find an honest UK model, use it as a second car, treat it to heaps of TLC and stretch its legs on a racetrack occasionally. If you know what youre getting yourself in to, get into one.
