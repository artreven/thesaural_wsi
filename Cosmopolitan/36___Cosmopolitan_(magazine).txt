EIFFEL TOWER Named after its designer, engineer
Gustave Eiffel , the Eiffel Tower is the
tallest building in Paris .More than 200,000,000 have visited the tower since its construction in 1889,including 6,719,200 in 2006,making it the most visited paid monument in the world.Including the 24 m (79 ft) antenna, the structure is 325 m (1,063 ft) high (since 2000), which is equivalent to about 81 levels in a conventional building. Eiffel Tower October 2007 When the tower was completed in 1889 it was the world's tallest tower — a title it retained until 1930 when
New York City 's
Chrysler Building
(319 m — 1,047 ft tall) was completed.The tower is now the fifth-tallest structure in France and the tallest structure in Paris, with the second-tallest being the
Tour Montparnasse
(210 m — 689 ft), although that will soon be surpassed by
Tour AXA
(225.11 m — 738.36 ft). The metal structure of the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tonnes while the entire structure including non-metal components is approximately 10,000 tonnes. Depending on the ambient temperature, the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to 18 cm (7 in) because of thermal expansion of the metal on the side facing the sun. The tower also sways 6–7 cm (2–3 in) in the wind.As demonstration of the economy of design, if the 7300 tonnes of the metal structure were melted down it would fill the 125 meter square base to a depth of only 6 cm (2.36 in), assuming a density of the metal to be 7.8 tonnes per cubic meter. The tower has a mass less than the mass of the air contained in a cylinder of the same dimensions, that is 324 meters high and 88.3 meters in radius. The weight of the tower is 10,100 tonnes compared to 10,265 tonnes of air.

ROSE TOWER The Rose Tower is a 333-metre (1,093-feet), 72-story
skyscraper
on
Sheikh Zayed Road
in
Dubai ,
United Arab Emirates . Originally, the tower was to be 380 m (1,247 ft.) high, but its projected height was reduced in further design modification. Construction began in 2004. ACC (Arabian Construction Co.) was the general contractor. On
24 October
2006 , the building reached its full height with the addition of the spire. Although the tower was expected to open in April 2008, it still had not opened by October 2008. Once open, it is expected to become the world's tallest hotel.This hotel, known as "Rose Rotana Suites", will surpass both the 321m (1,053ft)
Burj Al Arab , and the incomplete 330m (1,083ft)
Ryugyong Hotel
in
Pyongyang ,

HEARST TOWER (CHARLOTTE) The Hearst Tower in
Charlotte ,
North Carolina
is a 47-story skyscraper that rises 659 feet (201 m) in height. It was first opened on
14 November
2002
and is the 2nd-tallest building in Charlotte. The 32-story tower rest atop a 15-floor podium. Located within the podium is a three story, 180,000 square-foot trading floor designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, and operated by Bank of America. The building is currently owned by Bank of America, although the
Hearst Corporation
also has offices in the building. The building's reverse floorplate design makes the upper floors averaging 24,000 square feet compared to an average of only 20,000 square feet for the lower floors. There are brass railings designed by Edgar Brandt, which were rescued from an Au Bon Marche department store in
Paris , located in the College Street lobby. The Hearst Plaza, a 160 by 65 foot public plaza lined with restaurants, shops, and the Mint Museum of Craft + Design, is located next to the main entrance off North Tryon Street. In front of the plaza is a 10-foot glass and bronze sculpture crafted by
Howard Ben Tre
entitled the Castellan, which translates to "keeper of the castle." Within in the lobby is the Bank of America Gallery, it contains priceless pieces of art and is open to the public during regular business hours. It is located across the street from the
Bank of America Corporate Center
and
201 North Tryon .

HEARST TOWER (NY) Hearst Tower in
New York City ,
New York
is located at 300 West
57th Street , 959
8th Avenue , near
Columbus Circle . It is the world
headquarters
of the
Hearst Corporation , bringing together for the first time their numerous publications and communications companies under one roof, including among others
Cosmopolitan ,
Esquire
and the
San Francisco Chronicle . The former six-story headquarters building was commissioned by the founder,
William Randolph Hearst
and awarded to the architect
Joseph Urban . The building was completed in 1928 at a cost of $2 million and contained 40,000 sq ft (3,700 m2). The original
cast stone
facade
has been preserved in the new design as a designated
Landmark
site. Originally built as the base for a proposed skyscraper, the construction of the tower was postponed due to the
Great Depression . The new tower addition was completed nearly eighty years later, and 2000 Hearst employees moved in on
4 May
2006 . The tower – designed by the
architect
Norman Foster , structural engineered by
WSP Cantor Seinuk , and constructed by
Turner construction
– is 46 stories tall, standing 182
m
(597
ft ) with 80,000 m² (856,000
ft² ) of
office
space. The uncommon triangular framing pattern (also known as a
diagrid ) required 9,500
metric tons
(10,480
tons ) of structural
steel
– reportedly about 20% less than a conventional
steel frame . Hearst Tower was the first skyscraper to break ground in New York City after
September 11, 2001 . The building received the 2006
Emporis Skyscraper Award , citing it as the best skyscraper in the world completed that year. Hearst Tower is the first "green" high rise office building completed in New York City, with a number of
environmental
considerations built into the plan. The floor of the atrium is paved with
heat conductive
limestone.
Polyethylene
tubing is embedded under the floor and filled with
circulating
water for cooling in the summer and heating in the winter. Rain collected on the roof is stored in a tank in the
basement
for use in the cooling system, to irrigate plants and for the water sculpture in the main lobby. The building was constructed using 80% recycled steel. Overall, the building has been designed to use 25% less energy than the minimum requirements for the city of New York, and earned a gold designation from the
United States Green Building Council ’s
LEED
certification program. The atrium features escalators which run through a 3-story water sculpture titled Icefall, a wide waterfall built with thousands of glass panels, which cools and humidifies the lobby air. The water element is complemented by a 70-foot (21.3 m) tall fresco painting entitled Riverlines by artist
Richard Long .

SEA MINK The Sea Mink, Neovison macrodon, is an extinct
North American
member of the
Mustelidae
family. It is the only
mustelid , and one of two
mammalian carnivore
species to have gone extinct in historic times, along with the
Falkland Islands Wolf . It was significantly longer than the closely related
American Mink
(N. vison), and bulkier, leading to a pelt that was almost twice the size of the other species. The longest specimen recorded was said to be 82.6 cm (32.5 in). The fur of the Sea Mink was said to be coarser and redder than the American Mink's, and to give off a distinctive odor. It was found along the rocky coasts of
New England
and
Atlantic Canada , as far north as
Nova Scotia . It was not a truly marine species, being confined to coastal waters. The
Labrador Duck , with which it co-existed, may have been a prey item. Due to its highly prized
fur , this
mink
was hunted to
extinction . The animal's remains are often found in
Native American
shell-heaps on the coasts of the islands of
Maine , but while indigenous hunting may have had some contribution to the Sea Mink's decline, it was the competitive European fur trade that led to its extinction. The last known member of the species was said to have been captured in
New Brunswick , New Jersey in 1894, although there is some debate if this was a specimen of N. macrodon or N. vison. The last substantiated report has led to an estimated extinction date of around 1860,although a specimen was reported as sold to a fur-buyer in Maine in 1880. Although well known to fur hunters, it became extinct before being scientifically described, and therefore little is known about its habits. Existing data suggests it was nocturnal and solitary. The Sea Mink is sometimes considered a subspecies of the American Mink, in which case the name Neovison vison macrodon is used

TARPAN
The Tarpan, Equus ferus ferus, was the Eurasian
wild horse . The last specimen of this species died in captivity in
Ukraine
in 1876. The name Tarpan is from a
Turkic language
( Kyrgyz
or
Kazakh ) name for the horse. Several attempts have been made to re-create the Tarpan, beginning in the 1930s. The breeds that resulted included the
Heck horse , the Hegardt or Stroebel's horse, and a derivation of the
Konik
breed - all of which closely resembled the original Tarpan.

BAKUN DAM
The Bakun Hydroelectric Project is located in
Sarawak ,
Malaysia
on the
Balui River , a tributary or source of the
Rajang River
and some sixty kilometers west of
Belaga .As part of the project, the tallest concrete-faced rockfill
dam
in the world would be built. This would also be the largest dam in
Asia
outside of
China . It is expected to generate 2,400
megawatts
(MW) of
electricity
once completed. The purpose for the dam was to meet growing demand for electricity. However, most of this demand said to lie in
Peninsular Malaysia
and not
East Malaysia , where the dam is located. Even in Peninsular Malaysia, however, there is an over-supply of electricity, with Tenaga Nasional Berhad being locked into unfavourable purchasing agreements with Independent Power Producers. The original idea was to have 30% of the generated capacity consumed in East Malaysia and the rest sent to Peninsular Malaysia. This plan envisioned 730 km of overhead
HVDC
transmission lines in East Malaysia, 670 km of undersea
HVDC
cable and 300 km of
HVDC
transmission line in Peninsular Malaysia. Future plans for the dam include connecting it to an envisioned Trans- Borneo
Power Grid Interconnection, which would be a grid to supply power to Sarawak,
Sabah ,
Brunei , and
Kalimantan
( Indonesia ). There have been mentions of this grid made within
ASEAN
meetings but no actions have been taken by any party.

GREERS FERRY The dam is located at
35°31′15″N 91°59′36″W﻿ / ﻿35.52083, -91.99333
north of
Little Rock . It was dedicated in October, 1963 by President
John F. Kennedy
just one month before his assassination. This event marks the only time a sitting president has visited
Cleburne County . Construction of the dam began in March 1959 and was completed in December 1962. The lake serves the
Heber Springs
area flood control, and is a site for recreation and power generation. When construction began on the dam in 1956, hundreds of workers showed up looking for work. The newly-hired workers then rented empty houses next to the construction site, and workers were even building their own homes next to the soon-to-be lake. Once all the workers arrived, people and business owners saw an opportunity in this construction and built motels, shops, and stores next to the construction site so workers would have a place to shop and relax. Farmers also felt the benefit of the construction, as work on the lake created demand for livestock and agriculture. After completion, the lake was dedicated on October 3, 1963 by
John F. Kennedy .The trip was his last major public appearance before his fateful trip to
Dallas
on Nov. 22, 1963, where he was assassinated. In his remarks in Heber Springs, Kennedy explained that the Greers Ferry project and others like it were investments in Arkansas and the nation's future. He was right - after the lake filled, tourism boomed, many businesses reopened, and Greers Ferry Lake became one of Arkansas' leading destinations. Today, many resort communities dot the shores of Greers Ferry Lake.

Coordinates :
30°26′14.02″S 136°53′19.23″E﻿ / ﻿-30.4372278, 136.888675
is a mining centre in
South Australia
located some 550 km NNW of
Adelaide
the capital city of
South Australia . It is the site of an extremely large deposit of
copper ,
uranium ,
gold
and
silver , which supports an underground mine as well as an integrated metallurgical processing plant. It is the largest known single deposit of
uranium
in the world, though uranium represents only a minority of the mine's total revenue.The deposit was discovered by
Western Mining Corporation
in 1975 and started production in 1987. It now belongs to
BHP Billiton , which acquired WMC Resources in 2005. The mine currently operates by an underground mining method called
sublevel open stoping , using modern and highly productive mining equipment. The March 2005 mine production rate is an annualised 9.1 million tonnes making it one of Australia's larger mines. 2005 metal production is thought to be in excess of 220,000 tonnes of copper, 4500 tonnes of
uranium oxide , plus gold and silver. The copper and uranium oxide are exported through
Port Adelaide . Most of the mine workers live in the nearby towns of
Roxby Downs
and
Andamooka . Regular flights to
Olympic Dam Airport
service Olympic Dam. The Olympic Dam mine uses 35 million litres of
Great Artesian Basin
water each day, making it the largest industrial user of underground water in the southern hemisphere.

IMPERIAL DAM The Imperial Dam is a dam near
Yuma, Arizona
(USA), built in the 1930s. It diverts
Colorado River
water into three different canals and holds the river water until it can be directed into a desilting plant before being released into the
All-American Canal , the
Gila River , and the Yuma project aqueduct. While it was being built between 1932 and 1940, the
Imperial Irrigation District (IID)
relied on water from two temporary canals: the Inter-California canal and the Imperial canal (Alamo river). The
dam
was built with three sections; the gates of each section hold back the water to help divert the water towards the desilting plant. Three giant desilting basins and seventy-two 770 foot (230 m) long scrapers hold and desilt the water; the removed silt is carried away by six sludge-pipes running under the Colorado River that dump the sediment into the California sluiceway, which returns the silt to the Colorado River. The water is now directed back towards one of the three sections which divert the water into one of the three channels. About 90% of the volume of the Colorado River is diverted into the canals at this local. Diversions can near 40,000 ft³/s (1,100 m³/s), roughly the volume of the Susquehanna River and more than 50 times the natural volume of the Rio Grande River. The Gila River and the Yuma project aqueduct branch off towards
Arizona
while the All-American canal branches southwards for 37 miles (60 km) before reaching its headworks on the
California
border and bends west towards the
Imperial Valley . Though the All-American canal moves billions of gallons of water into Imperial Valley every year, millions of it are lost due to seepage problems. IID and Mexican authorities are debating on whether or not to line the All-American canal with concrete. The Mexican authorities are opposed to the All-American canal lining project, as the leaking water allows
Mexican
farmers to irrigate their crops with well-water.

CLYDE DAM There was considerable controversy when the dam was planned as to whether it was needed, and because it would flood many houses and orchards upstream at
Cromwell , as well as the scenic
Cromwell Gorge , which was a highlight of the then young but growing New Zealand
tourism
industry. Construction would also require the closure of the
Otago Central Railway
beyond Clyde, though materials for the dam would provide significant traffic for the rest of the line, which was experiencing a drop in freight tonnage. The dam was constructed, following the passing of enabling legislation, as part of
Prime Minister
Sir
Robert Muldoon 's
Think Big
projects of the late 1970s and early 1980s, creating
Lake Dunstan . The power station has a capacity of four 120
MW
francis turbines
(for a total of 480MW), but is only allowed to run 432 MW due to resource consent conditions. The dam was built such that two further penstocks and turbines could be installed, but if they were installed there will not be enough water to keep them running.

HUME DAM
The
Hume Power Station
is a 58-megawatt
hydro-electric power station
installed in the dam wall, and is primarily used for peak-load generation. Constructed over a 12-year period from 1919 to 1931 with a workforce of thousands, it was extended during the 1950s, and completed in 1961, necessitating the wholesale removal of Tallangatta township and its re-establishment at a new site eight kilometres west of the original. As it is the furthest downstream of the major reservoirs on the
Murray River
system, and has the capacity to release water at the fastest rate, Lake Hume is used by the irrigation authorities as the storage of first resort. The reservoir typically falls to less than one-third capacity by March each year, but in normal years refills to at least two-thirds capacity before November, though Australia's highly unpredictable climatic conditions cause these figures to vary quite significantly from year to year. In 2007 Lake Hume fell to a scant 1% capacity, barely more than the water in the two rivers (Murray and Mitta) flowing through on their original paths. Monitoring of the dam in the early 1990s revealed that the water pressure and leakage had caused the dam to move on its foundations slightly, leading to concerns that the dam was heading for collapse, threatening Albury-Wodonga and the entire Murray basin with it. Authorities denied any short-term threat. Traffic was banned from the spillway, and a large repair job commenced involving, in part, the construction of a secondary earth wall behind the original to take the strain.

COULEE DAM Grand Coulee Dam is a
hydroelectric
gravity dam
on the
Columbia River
in the
U.S. state
of
Washington . In the
United States , it is the largest
electric power
producing facility and the largest concrete structure.It is the fourth largest producer of
hydroelectricity
in the world. The top producing dams are the
Three Gorges Dam
in
China , the
Guri Dam
in
Venezuela , and the
Itaipu Dam
on the border of
Paraguay
and
Brazil . The
reservoir
is called
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake , named after the United States
President
who presided over the completion of the dam. The foundation was built by the MWAK Company, a joint effort of several contractors united for this purpose. Consolidated Builders Incorporated, including industrialist
Henry J. Kaiser , completed the dam. The
United States Bureau of Reclamation
supervised the contractors and operates the dam. Folk singer
Woody Guthrie
was commissioned by the
Bonneville Power Administration
to write songs about the Columbia Basin Project; the songs Roll On Columbia and Grand Coulee Dam are part of that series. The Grand Coulee Dam is almost a mile long at 5223 feet (1586 m). The spillway is 1,650 feet(503 m) wide. At 550 feet (168 m), it is taller than the
Great Pyramid of Giza ; all the pyramids at
Giza
could fit within its base. Its hydraulic height of 380 feet (115 m) is more than twice that of
Niagara Falls . There is enough concrete to build a four-foot wide, four-inch deep sidewalk twice around the equator

HOOVER DAM Hoover Dam, also sometimes known as Boulder Dam, is a
concrete
arch-gravity dam
in the
Black Canyon
of the
Colorado River , on the
border
between the
U.S.
states
of
Arizona
and
Nevada . When completed in 1935, it was both the world's largest electric-power generating station and the world's largest concrete structure. It was surpassed in both these respects by the
Grand Coulee Dam
in 1945. It is currently the world's 35th-largest hydroelectric generating station. This dam, located 30 miles (48 km) southeast of
Las Vegas, Nevada , is named after
Herbert Hoover , who played an instrumental role in its construction, first as the
Secretary of Commerce
and then later as the
President of the United States . Construction began in 1931 and was completed in 1935, more than two years ahead of schedule. The dam and the power plant are operated by the
Bureau of Reclamation
of the
U.S. Department of the Interior . Listed on the
National Register of Historic Places
in 1981, Hoover Dam was designated a
National Historic Landmark
in 1985. Lake Mead
is the reservoir created behind the dam, named after
Elwood Mead , who oversaw the construction of the dam.

VERZASCA DAM The Contra dam (or Verzasca dam) is a 220- meter
high arch
hydroelectric
dam
in the Val Verzasca,
Switzerland . It was constructed between 1960 and
1965 . The dam forms
Lago di Vogorno , an artificial reservoir. It was designed by Lombardi Engineering. Made of
concrete , the structure dams the Verzasca River and retains over 100 million cubic meters of water. The builder and owner is Verzasca SA, an electricity generator which has an 80-year concession to expire in 2046.It generates 105 MW
of
electricity . The designer, Dr. Lombardi, considers it one of his most aesthetically pleasing dams, primarily because of the slenderness of the concrete arch; the smaller volume of concrete also kept construction costs low.It is the 25th tallest dam in the world. The dam is one of several at which the filling of the reservoir has triggered small
earthquakes . The dam leases access to a commercial
bungee jump
operator. The opening scene of the 1995
James Bond
film
GoldenEye
was filmed here. In the film the dam doubles as the fictional
Arkhangelsk
Chemical Weapons Facility located in the northern
Soviet Union
during the
Cold War .

in 2004. It has been hailed as one of the Seven New Wonders of the World ( Newsweek
magazine, 2006) and Seven Wonders of Engineering ( Discovery Channel , 2005). The building contains 101 floors above ground and 5 floors underground. Its
postmodern
style combines Asian and international modern and traditional elements. It is designed to withstand
typhoons
and
earthquakes . A multi-level shopping mall adjoining the tower houses hundreds of fashionable stores, restaurants and clubs.
Fireworks
launched from Taipei 101 feature prominently in international
New Year's Eve
broadcasts, and the tower appears frequently in films, television shows, print publications,
anime
media, games, and other elements of popular culture.[ citation needed ] The name of the tower reflects its location in Taipei's international business district (101 mailing code) as well as its floor count. (See also " Symbolism " below.) The number is pronounced in English simply as One Oh One and in
Mandarin
and other local languages by the equivalent. Taipei 101 is owned by the
Taipei Financial Center Corporation
and managed by the International division of Urban Retail Properties Corporation based in
Chicago . The name originally planned for the building, Taipei World Financial Center, was derived from the name of the owner. The original name in
Chinese
was literally, Taipei International Financial Center ( traditional Chinese : 臺北國際金融中心;
pinyin : Táiběi Guójì Jīnróng Zhōngxīn). Taipei 101 was overtaken in height on
2007 - 08-21
by the
Burj Dubai
in
Dubai ,
UAE , upon the completion of that building's 141st floor . As of November 2008, the title of "world's tallest building" still rests with Taipei 101, as international architectural standards define a "building" as a structure capable of being fully occupied. The Burj Dubai will claim the title upon its completion, which is expected in September 2009.

MILLENIUM TOWER WORLD BUSINESS CENTER The Millennium Tower World Business Center is an approved supertall skyscraper which The Solomon Group, a private Korean developer, intends to move forward with Asymptote’s design for a 560m tall tower, which upon completion will be the tallest building in Asia. Asymptote’s three-towered design for the World Business Center Busan is a newly minted approach where the notion of singularity and autonomy gives way to a strong juxtaposition of form and voids.
Simultaneously a single entity, the towers are also read as three distinct forms set against Busan’s dramatic natural backdrop of sea and mountains. The base of the tower artfully negotiates the site at the entrance level while from the top of the midsection the three slender towers rise above the skylobby level and gracefully taper upwards around a spectacular central void. Through its formal and sculptural qualities this unique architectural expression is a powerful symbol of 21st century Busan and a beacon for it’s trajectory into the future and onto the global stage.

BURJ DUBAI Burj Dubai ( Arabic : برج دبي‎ "Dubai Tower") is a
supertall
skyscraper
under construction in the
Business Bay
district of
Dubai ,
United Arab Emirates , and is the
tallest man-made structure
ever built, despite being incomplete. Construction began on September 21, 2004 and is expected to be completed and ready for occupation in September 2009. The building is part of the 2 km2 (0.8 sq mi) development called "Downtown Dubai", at the "First Interchange" (aka "Defence
Roundabout ") along
Sheikh Zayed Road
at Doha Street. The tower's architect is
Adrian Smith
who worked with
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM)
until 2006.The architecture and engineering firm SOM is in charge of the project.The primary builders are
Samsung Engineering & Construction
and
Besix
along with
Arabtec . Turner Construction Company
was chosen as the construction manager. The total budget for the Burj Dubai project is about
US$ 4.1 billion and for the entire new 'Downtown Dubai', US$20 billion. Mohamed Ali Alabbar, the
CEO
of

JET ENGINE A jet engine is a
reaction engine
that discharges a fast moving
jet
of
fluid
to generate thrust in accordance with
Newton's
laws of motion . This broad definition of jet engines includes
turbojets ,
turbofans ,
rockets ,
ramjets ,
pulse jets
and
pump-jets . In general, most jet engines are
internal combustion engines
but non-combusting forms also exist. In common usage, the term 'jet engine' generally refers to an
internal combustion
duct engine , which typically consists of an engine with a rotary air compressor powered by a
turbine
(" Brayton cycle "), with the leftover power providing thrust via a
propelling nozzle . These types of jet engines are primarily used by
jet aircraft
for long distance travel. The early jet aircraft used
turbojet
engines which were relatively inefficient for subsonic flight. Modern subsonic jet aircraft usually use
high-bypass turbofan engines
which help give high speeds as well as, over long distances, giving better fuel efficiency than many other forms of transport. About 7.2% of the oil used in 2004 was ultimately consumed by jet engines.In 2007, the cost of jet fuel, while highly variable from one airline to another, averaged 26.5% of total operating costs, making it the single largest operating expense for most airlines.

TANK A tank is a
tracked ,
armoured fighting vehicle
designed for
front-line
combat which combines
operational mobility
and
tactical
offensive
and
defensive
capabilities. Firepower is normally provided by a large- calibre
main gun
in a rotating
turret
and secondary
machine guns , while heavy
armour
and all-terrain
mobility
provide protection for the tank and its crew, allowing it to perform all primary tasks of the armoured troops on the
battlefield . Tanks were
first manufactured
during
World War I
in an effort to break the bloody deadlock of
trench warfare . The
British Army
was the first to field a vehicle that combined three key characteristics: mobility over
barbed wire
and rough
terrain , armour to withstand
small arms
fire and
shrapnel
and the firepower required to
suppress
or destroy
machine gun
nests and
pillboxes . Despite some success and a significant psychological effect on the German
infantry , "the tank in
1918
was not a war-winning weapon." Interwar developments
culminated
in the
blitzkrieg
employed by the German
Wehrmacht
during
World War II
and the contribution of the
panzers
to this doctrine. Hard lessons learned by the Allies during
World War II
cemented the reputation of the tank, appropriately employed in
combined arms
forces, as "indispensable to success in both tactical and strategic terms."Today, tanks seldom operate alone, being organized into
armoured units
and operating in combined-arms formations. Despite their apparent invulnerability, without
support , tanks are vulnerable to
anti-tank
artillery ,
helicopters
and
aircraft , enemy tanks,
anti-tank
and
improvised mines , and (at
close range
or in
urban environments ) infantry. Due to its formidable capabilities and versatility the battle tank is generally considered a key component of modern armies,but recent thinking has challenged the need for such powerful and expensive weaponry in a period characterized by
unconventional
and
asymmetric warfare .Ongoing
research and development
attempts to equip the tank to meet the challenges of the
21st century .

AIRSHIPS
An airship or dirigible is a
lighter-than-air aircraft
that can be steered and propelled through the air using
rudders
and
propellers
or other
thrust . Unlike other
aerodynamic
aircraft such as
fixed-wing aircraft
and
helicopters , which produce
lift
by moving a wing or
airfoil
through the air, aerostatic aircraft, such as airships and
hot air balloons , stay aloft by filling a large cavity, such as a
balloon , with a
lifting gas . A Zeppelin is a brand name for rigid airships historically built by either the Luftschiff Zeppelin company of Germany or the Goodyear Zeppelin company of the USA, and now of smaller semi-rigid airships built by Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik, also of Germany. The main types of airship are
non-rigid (or blimps) ,
semi-rigid
and
rigid . Blimps are small airships without internal skeletons. Semi-rigid airships are slightly larger and have some form of internal support such as a fixed keel. Rigid airships with full skeletons, such as the massive
Zeppelin
transoceanic models, all but disappeared after several high-profile catastrophic accidents during the mid-20th century. Airships were the first aircraft to make controlled, powered flight, and were widely used before the 1940s, but their use decreased over time as their capabilities were surpassed by those of airplanes. Their decline continued with a series of high-profile accidents, including the 1937 burning of the
hydrogen -filled
Hindenburg
near
Lakehurst, New Jersey , and the destruction of the
USS Akron . Airships are still used today in certain niche applications, such as
advertising , as
camera
platforms for sporting events, and as aerial observation and interdiction platforms, where the ability to hover in one place for an extended period outweighs the need for speed and maneuverability.

SUBMARINE A submarine is a
watercraft
capable of independent operation below water. It differs from a
submersible
that has only limited underwater capability. The term submarine most commonly refers to large manned autonomous vessels, however historically or more casually, submarine can also refer to medium sized or smaller vessels, ( midget submarines ,
wet subs ),
Remotely Operated Vehicles
or
robots . The word submarine was originally an adjective meaning "under the sea", and so consequently other uses such as "submarine engineering" or " submarine cable " may not actually refer to submarines at all. Submarine was shortened from the term "submarine boat". Submarines are referred to as " boats " for historical reasons because vessels deployed from a ship are referred to as boats. The first submarines were launched in such a manner. The
English
term
U-Boat
for a
German
submarine comes from the
German
word for submarine, U-Boot, itself an
abbreviation
for Unterseeboot ("undersea boat"). Although experimental submarines had been built before, submarine design took off during the 19th century. Submarines were first widely used in
World War I , and feature in many large
navies . Military usage ranges from attacking enemy ships or submarines,
aircraft carrier
protection,
blockade
running,
ballistic missile submarines
as part of a nuclear strike force,
reconnaissance , conventional land attack (for example using a
cruise missile ), and covert insertion of
special forces . Civilian uses for submarines include
marine science , salvage, exploration and facility inspection/maintenance. Submarines can also be specialised to a function such as search and rescue, or undersea cable repair. Submarines are also used in tourism and for academic research

SUBMERSIBLES
A submersible is a type of
underwater
vessel with limited mobility which is typically transported to its area of operation by a surface vessel or large submarine. Used by oceanographers and marine scientists. Apart from size, the technical difference between a 'submersible' and a 'submarine' is that submersibles are not totally autonomous. They may rely on a support facility or vessel for charging of batteries, high pressure air, high pressure oxygen replenishment, or all of these. The main problem with submersibles is that they may be relatively small, holding only a small crew. A submersible vessel has greater mobility, using
propeller screws
or
pump-jets , than
submersible chambers
(diving chambers or
diving bells ), which are suspended from a
cable
and
winch
operated from the
diving support vessel .

ROCKETS A rocket or rocket vehicle is a
missile ,
aircraft
or other
vehicle
which obtains
thrust
by the
reaction
of the rocket to the ejection of fast moving
fluid
from a
rocket engine . Chemical rockets work by the action of hot gas produced by the combustion of the
propellant
against the inside of
combustion chambers
and
expansion nozzles . This generates forces that accelerate the gas to
extremely high speed
and exert a large thrust on the rocket (since
every action has an equal and opposite reaction ). The history of rockets goes back to at least the 13th century.By the 20th century, they have enabled human
spaceflight
to the Moon. In the 21st century, they have made commercial
space tourism
possible. Rockets are used for
fireworks
and weaponry, as
launch vehicles
for
artificial satellites ,
human spaceflight
and
exploration
of other planets. While inefficient for low speed use, they are, compared to other propulsion systems, very lightweight and powerful, capable of generating large accelerations and of attaining
extremely high speeds
with reasonable efficiency. Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily-released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction, and use minimizes risks.

BIG BANG THEORY
The Big Bang is the
cosmological
model of the
universe
that is best supported by all lines of
scientific evidence
and
observation . As used by scientists, the term Big Bang generally refers to the idea that the universe has expanded from a primordial hot and dense
initial condition
at some finite
time
in the past, and continues to
expand
to this day.
Georges Lemaître
proposed what became known as the Big Bang theory of the origin of the Universe, although he called it his 'hypothesis of the primeval atom'. The framework for the model relies on
Albert Einstein 's
General Relativity
as formulated by
Alexander Friedmann . After
Edwin Hubble
discovered in 1929 that the distances to far away
galaxies
were generally
proportional
to their
redshifts , this observation was taken to indicate that all very distant galaxies and clusters have an apparent velocity directly away from our vantage point: the farther away, the higher the apparent velocity. [1]
If the distance between galaxy clusters is increasing today, everything must have been closer together in the past. This idea has been considered in detail back in time to extreme
densities
and
temperatures , and large
particle accelerators
have been built to experiment on and test such conditions, resulting in significant confirmation of the
theory , but these accelerators have limited capabilities to probe into such
high energy regimes . Without any evidence associated with the earliest instant of the expansion, the Big Bang theory cannot and does not provide any explanation for such an initial condition; rather, it describes and explains the general evolution of the universe since that instant. The observed abundances of the light elements throughout the cosmos closely match the calculated predictions for the formation of these elements from nuclear processes in the rapidly expanding and cooling first minutes of the universe, as logically and quantitatively detailed according to
Big Bang nucleosynthesis . Fred Hoyle
is credited with coining the phrase 'Big Bang' during a 1949 radio broadcast, as a derisive reference to a theory he did not subscribe to.Hoyle later helped considerably in the effort to figure out the nuclear pathway for building certain heavier elements from lighter ones. After the discovery of the
cosmic microwave background radiation
in 1964, and especially when its collective frequencies sketched out a
blackbody
curve, most scientists were fairly convinced by the evidence that some Big Bang scenario must have occurred.
