Lexus LFA
The
Lexus LFA
is a two-seat
exotic
sports coupe
produced by
Lexus
as a
concept car ,
"halo" vehicle ,
racing prototype , and production model. It is the second model in the
F marque
line of performance vehicles from Lexus, following the
IS F .
Three concept versions have been shown, each debuting at the
North American International Auto Show
with the LF-A designation as part of the
LF Series
concept line. The first LF-A concept premiered in 2005, followed in
2007 by a second LF-A with a more completely furnished interior and
exterior.
The third version of the LF-A, a
roadster
model, premiered in 2008. The production model, trademarked LFA, was shown at the
Tokyo Motor Show
in October 2009.
The production Lexus LFA features a new
V10 engine
and a
carbon fiber-reinforced polymer
(CFRP) body. CFRP materials account for 65 percent of the LFA's body composition by mass.
The LFA went into production in late 2010, with a projected run of 500 vehicles at the base price of
US$375,000 . A
circuit-tuned variant
is scheduled for 2012.
Production Lexus began taking orders for the LFA supercar on October 23, 2009.
Buyers will be selectively chosen by Lexus in the second quarter of
2010.
Production will begin in December 2010 as a 2011 model. Only 500 total
LFA models will be made worldwide, with only 20 produced each month.
Each car will be custom ordered to the customer's specifications, and
will cost an estimated
US$375,000 , depending on options and customization.
Following the LFA's release at the Tokyo Motor Show, Lexus unveiled a
website with a 'LFA configurator' which allowed users to select
exterior and interior colors, brake caliper colors, seats, steering
wheel leather, and other interior designs.
In total, there are over 30 billion possible configurations. Each LFA will be hand-built by a dedicated production team of engineers and specialists at Toyota's Motomatchi plant in
Aichi , Japan.
In the North American market 150 LFAs will be initially sold through a two year lease program much like the
Ferrari F50 . This is to prevent owners from reselling the vehicle for a profit.
Racing driver
Scott Pruett
was hired to give test drives to interested buyers, demonstrating the vehicle's capabilities at
Auto Club Speedway .
The Lexus division of Toyota Motor USA will stop taking orders at the
end of 2009, in which they will talk about a purchase plan for the
lessees.
Lexus later changed their stance and allowed outright purchase,
but only on the condition that they sign an agreement giving the dealer
first right of refusal to buy back the LFA if the owner wants to sell
it within the first two years. The dealer will have the option to buy
back the used LFA for either fair market value or the original sticker
price, whichever is lower.
[47]
In the European market buyers order their LFA through a single Lexus dealer located in
Park Lane ,
London
where it is purchased outright.
During LFA production, each vehicle will receive a plaque which is
individually numbered, indicating the unit's place in the production
run. Each LFA V10 engine will also bear the signature of the specialist
who assembled it. With 20 units produced monthly, production of the entire LFA run will last for 25 months, from December 2010 to December 2012.
Engine   The Lexus LFA is powered by a 72-degree bank angle 4.8-liter V10 engine equipped with dual
VVT-i
carrying the
1LR-GUE
designation with a maximum output of 412 kW (560 PS) delivered at
8,700 rpm.   Its maximum torque output of 480 N·m (354 lb·ft) arrives at
6,800 rpm, 90 percent of which is available from 3,700 rpm. The engine
redlines
at 9,000 rpm, but with a fuel cutoff set at 9,500 rpm,
and is constructed using forged aluminum pistons, forged titanium
connecting rods, and solid titanium valves.  The V angle of the LFA's
V-10 engine is set to 72-degrees (as opposed to the 90-degree V angle
present in a Dodge Viper's V-10) to fully balance the firing force from
the pistons.  This 72-degree angle allows for even firing from the
pistons without the use of a split-journal crankshaft, thus improving
engine efficiency as well as lowering overall weight.  Dry sump
lubrication prevents engine oil starvation through high speed corners
and lowers the engine's center of mass. Air is fed directly from beneath
the hood through a visible slit passing into a dual stage variable
intake manifold and then into ten individual throttle bodies before
finally exiting from a dual stage titanium muffler. The LFA's engineers selected a V10 engine over an equivalent displacement V8 engine for its ability to rev higher, and over a V12 for its lower reciprocating mass,
allowing for more rapid engine response.  Lexus claims their engine can
rev from idle to its redline in 0.6 seconds and an analog tachometer
needle could not accurately track the LFA's changes in engine speeds.  This necessitated the use of a digital tachometer which can instantly
display engine speed. The engine reportedly weighs less than the manufacturer's own 3.5-liter
2GR-FE
V6 engine.  Engineers attempted to make the engine sound like that of a
Formula One car with high revs, while at the same time maintaining
reliability and vibration control. Along with other manufacturers such
as
Ferrari , Toyota had produced their own F1 engines and chassis designs.  The exhaust note has been described by Toyota engineers as the "roar of an angel", and a US television spot later used the engine sound to shatter a champagne glass via
resonance
frequency. The powerplant gives the LFA a power-to-weight ratio of 5.9 lb/hp and
enables it to reach a top speed of around 325 km/h (202 mph).  Like the
IS F
Yamaha co-developed the engine cylinder heads. The engine exceeds
Euro V emissions .  The engine is installed with a front mid-engine placement.  According to Chief Engineer Haruhiko Tanahashi a front engine layout
was selected instead of a mid engine layout as it is inherently more
forgiving dynamically, affording less experienced drivers a wider safety
net. Transmission The gearbox itself is a six-speed Automated Sequential Gearbox ( electrohydraulic transmission )
operated with paddle-shifters developed and constructed in-house by
Toyota.  The driver can select from four settings: auto, normal, sport,
and wet.  The manufacturer quotes minimum up-shift times of 200 ms in the
sport mode. According to Tanahashi a
dual-clutch transmission
was tested but the design team felt gear changes were overly smooth,
resembling that of a traditional automatic and they preferred more
abrupt and mechanically engaging shifts.  This shifting experience was
also favored despite Lexus vehicles' typical emphasis on smooth
operation. The auto mode and low speed performance suffer as a result.  A
Torsen
limited slip differential
is also applied on the LFA, and a
launch control
system is available. An offset gear mounted to the crank (a world first )
sends power via a torque tube to the transmission.  The carbon-fiber
torque tube system was developed because of the rear placement of the
transmission and low engine layout .
Nürburgring Edition On March 15, 2010, Lexus detailed the circuit-tuned variant of the
LFA, plans for which were first disclosed at the LFA official press
launch the previous October.
The variant is officially known as the LFA Special Edition or LFA
Nürburgring Edition, the latter in reference to the similar setup
employed on the LFA race vehicles at the 24 Hours Nürburgring. The model features an extra 7 kW (10 bhp) from its V10 engine,
bringing the total to 419 kW (562 bhp). It also features a re-calibrated
transmission with gear shifts made faster by 0.05 seconds, a front
splitter , stiffer and more adjustable suspension, lightweight
alloy wheels
coated in track rubber,
aerodynamic canards
at the sides of the front bumper, and a large fixed rear wing.
The special edition is a competition-focused variant, and will be
available in four exterior colors, namely glossy black, matte black,
orange, and whitest white. The production totals are to be included in the 500-unit total LFA planned build cycle, and will be limited to a 50-unit run.
At a base price of
US$445,000 ,
buyers will receive training sessions at the Nordschleife, accompanied
by Nürburgring chief instructors, a one-night stay at the Lindner
Congress and Motorsport Hotel Nürburgring, admission to the ring°werk
leisure park, a Nürburgring branded jacket, and a one-year pass to the
circuit.
The Nürburgring Edition LFA was tested at the Nürburgring in June
2011. Driven by Akira Iida, the LFA set a time of 7:22.85 (video
confirmed), the 10th-fastest time ever for a production vehicle.
Lexus USA
confirmed that this lap video was recorded as a "warm up" video for the
"ADAC 24-hours" for exhibition purposes.
The LFA hit 292 km/h (181 mph)
on the last straight uphill climb, which is one of the highest speeds
achieved by a stock exotic supercar on that segment of the track. An
official lap time will be attempted in the next few months.
Standard OEM
Bridgestone Potenza RE70 performance street tires were used.

Ferrari Enzo (automobile)
The
Enzo Ferrari
is a
12 cylinder
mid-engine
berlinetta
named after the company's founder,
Enzo Ferrari . It was built in 2002 using
Formula One
technology, such as a
carbon-fibre
body, F1-style
electrohydraulic shift transmission , and
Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide
(C/SiC)
ceramic
composite
disc brakes . Also used are technologies not allowed in F1 such as active aerodynamics and traction control. After a
downforce
of 775 kg (1,709 lb) is reached at 355.6 km/h (221 mph) the rear wing is actuated by computer to maintain that downforce.
The Enzo's
V12 engine
is the first of a new generation for Ferrari. It is based on the architecture of the
V8
found in sister-company
Maserati 's
Quattroporte ,
using the same basic architecture and 104 mm (4.1 in) bore spacing.
This design will replace the former architectures seen in V12 and V8
engines used in most other contemporary Ferraris. The 2005
F430
is the second Ferrari to get a version of this new powerplant.
Production The Enzo, named after the founder, was established to commemorate Ferrari's first formula one title of the new millennium.
The Enzo was designed by
Ken Okuyama , the
Japanese
former
Pininfarina
head designer, and initially announced at the 2002
Paris Motor Show
with a limited production run of 349 and at US $659,330. The company
sent invitations to existing customers, specifically, those who had
previously bought the
F40
and
F50 .
All 349 cars were sold in this way before production began. Later,
after numerous requests, Ferrari decided to build 50 more Enzos,
bringing the total to 399. Before being unveiled at the Paris Motor
show, the Enzo (that was used in the show) was flown from Italy to
California to be filmed in
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle . It was driven on a beach by actress
Demi Moore . After filming was complete, the Enzo was flown to France to be in the Motor Show. [ 1 ]
Enzos are listed as being built in 2003. In 2003 an Enzo Ferrari delivered to Houston, Texas attorney
Joe D. Jamail, Jr.
was involved in a driving mishap and was totally consumed by fire.
Ferrari made an additional vehicle for Mr. Jamail that carried the same
serial number as the destroyed car. This kept the number of Enzo
Ferraris at 400.
Ferrari built one more Enzo — the 400th car — and it was auctioned by
Sotheby's
Maranello Auction on June 28, 2005, to benefit survivors of the
2004 Tsunami
for
€ 950,000 ( US$ 1,274,229), almost twice its list price. This sum was presented to
Pope Benedict XVI , while former Ferrari
Formula One
driver
Michael Schumacher
gave the pope a steering wheel to commemorate the donation. This wheel
included a plaque which read, "The Formula 1 World Champion's steering
wheel to His Holiness Benedict XVI, Catholicism's driver."
The Enzo Ferrari typically trades above $1,000,000 (£800,000) at auction. [ 2 ]
Three prototype "mules" were built, M1, M2, and M3. Each was bodied to look like a
348 ,
even though the mules were built in 2000. The third mule was offered
for auction alongside the 400th Enzo in June, 2005, bringing €195,500
(US$236,300).
Engine
Main article:
Ferrari Dino engine#V12
The Enzo is a
mid-engined
car with a 43.9/56.1 front/rear weight distribution. The engine is Ferrari's
F140
65°
V12
with
4 valves per cylinder ,
dual overhead cams
and
variable valve timing .
Bosch
Motronic ME7
fuel injection
is used and the engine is
naturally aspirated . It displaces 5998 cc (366 in³) and produces 660 PS (485 kW; 651 hp) at 7800 rpm and 657 N·m (485 lb·ft) at 5500  rpm . [ 4 ]
The
redline
is 8000 rpm. [ 5 ]
Chassis
The Enzo has a
semi-automatic transmission
(also known as the F1 gearbox) using paddles to control an automated
shifting and clutch mechanism, with LED lights on the steering wheel
telling the driver when to change gears. The gearbox has a
shift time
of just 150 milliseconds. The transmission was a first generation
"clutchless" design from the late 1990s, and there have been complaints
about its abrupt shifting.
The Enzo Ferrari has 4 wheel independent suspension with push-rod actuated
shock absorbers
which can be adjusted from the cabin, complemented with
anti-roll bars
at the front and rear.
The Enzo uses 19-inch (483 mm) wheels and has 15-inch (381 mm)
Brembo
disc brakes . The wheels are held by a single lug nut and fitted with
Bridgestone
Potenza Scuderia RE050A tires
Performance
The Enzo can accelerate to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.14 seconds [ 9 ]
and can reach 100 mph (160 km/h) in 6.6 seconds. [ 4 ]
The ¼ mile (~400 m) time is 11.0 at 136 mph (219 km/h) and the top
speed has been recorded to be as high as 350 kilometres per hour
(220 mph). [ 10 ]
It is rated at 12 miles per US gallon (20 L/100 km; 14 mpg -imp ) in the city and 18 miles per US gallon (13 L/100 km; 22 mpg -imp ) on the highway.
Despite the Enzo's extraordinary performance and price, the
Ferrari 430 Scuderia
(an improved version of Ferrari's standard F430 production car) is
capable of lapping the Ferrari test track just as quickly as the Enzo.
Evo
magazine tested the Enzo on the famed
Nordschleife Circuit
and ran a 7:25.21 lap time. The Enzo in the test had a broken electronic damper.

Lamborghini LP 550-2 Valentino Balboni
Let's get straight to the point: the LP550-2 is a car designed with very specific tastes in mind. Valentino Balboni, the
Lamborghini
test driver after whom the LP550-2 has been named, has been in the supercar test-driving business for over 40 years, which is actually longer than I have been alive. The notches on the calendar mean that he is amongst the most capable and sensitive drivers in the world. I, on the other hand, am not. Which means that when you make a car to the specific tastes of Valentino Balboni, you cook up a big bubbling cauldron of Marmite.
The recipe looks like a good one. This Gallardo comes as standard with a six-speed manual 'box (you can option an e-Gear version, but that's kind of straying from the point if this is supposed to be ‘his' spec), more feelsome steel discs instead of the (still optional) carbon ceramics, white and gold stripes, less weight (120kg less, to be precise) and, most tellingly, two-wheel drive. And of course, it's this last bit upon which most people have seized, crowing loudly about the Balboni being a ‘proper'
Lambo
because it's reverted to rear-wheel-drive. Right then.
Ever since the Diablo died, there hasn't been a
Lambo
that transmits its prodigious power through the rear wheels only. Since horsepower went north of 500 ponies,
Lambo
decided the best way of nearly containing it was to throw it through a rear-biased 4x4 system. It works -
Lambos
are among the friendliest
supercars , because they have lots of natural grip under acceleration and don't try to slice off your face if you do anything stupid but natural, like lift when you find yourself barreling into a corner too fast.
The LP550-2 is a totally different experience. Drive the Balboni and you notice as soon as you move the steering wheel more than a quarter of an inch. The steering feels lighter, more communicative, instantly more textured than the four-wheel drive car. You realise that the 4x4 car is operating through a thin film of mechanical interference necessitated by driveshafts and their subsequent torque. The uncorrupted steering is a joy. The car feels darty, lively, more connected than any
Gallardo
ever made. More
awake .
Go faster and you start getting messages from fingertips and buttocks that this is a car that really wants to play. There's a great deal more reaction readily available for smaller steering inputs. The car feels like most of the 120kg weight loss is from the front wheels themselves, rather than the 30 or 40kg that deleting the front diff actually achieves. It makes you smile insanely hard. Right up until you push just that little bit further and the car gives you a little warning wiggle and the smile falters. The traction control has been altered to allow more slip, but that isn't the reason the Balboni suddenly isn't really your friend.
Turn in and there's still prodigious grip, a lovely adjustable attitude that you remember from the LP560-4. But when you lift mid-corner, or try a bit too hard, the Balboni gets nervous, and much less forgiving than the standard car. The dampers and springs, brakes, ESP and even the tyres have been tweaked to make the car feel exactly how Balboni wants it. That means it lives closer to the edge of reason, bites harder, more suddenly and is less helpful once 542bhp has got the better of those rear tyres. Of course, if you're Valentino Balboni, this is a good thing, allowing you a greater proportion of playtime-per-mile. If you're average, it makes you nervous and, in my case, quite a lot slower.
It probably doesn't help that the
Gallardo
I'm driving has some sort of ‘sports pack' suspension that Balboni has already decided needs softening off to give a decent turn-in without the current spine-cracking ride quality. It certainly exacerbates the nervousness along these Italian backroads, only really becoming acceptable at speeds high enough to make you wince at the mere thought of them. It's all a bit macho really and pretty much as you'd expect. Valentino Balboni has this car absolutely pegged - as he demonstrates in no uncertain fashion on a passenger ride right up there with the most amusing things I've ever done, ever, but you have to be confident of riding that particular knife edge.
Of course, with a little less mass to propel and the same basic mechanical bits, the rest of the experience is as brilliant as ever. The 5.2-litre V10 howls behind you, playing angry pop through a set of exhaust valves, daring you to try to open up the butterflies and hear the metallic wail just once more. The gearbox is a deliberate joy, the open gate and musical ‘clackety, clack - ting!' of a perfect second-to-third gearchange one of the most satisfying things ever to grace your palm.
The stripes appear on every car, a broad white central strip edged on one side with gold, a theme carried through the seats and dash leather. There for no other reason than Balboni likes them because they used to appear on many old racing cars. On the left-hand window is Balboni's signature and the wheels are multi-spoked, 19in tall and dark grey. And that's pretty much it. No wings, or funny exhausts, or tinselly tat - a pleasant change of pace.
But ultimately, there's a disconnect between what the LP550-2 Balboni can provide for the average driver and actually having to
be
Valentino Balboni to adequately access the extra fun factor. Some buyers will undoubtedly play car park bullshit and say all the right things, while being capable of mining just the smallest seam of the LP550-2's ability, and the percentage of people actually using the thing the way it should be used will be very small.
Still, if it were a lighter, cheaper
Lamborghini
then I'd be more than happy to recommend it as a perfect heart-pumper for the more committed pilot. But, and here's the killer point, it costs £18k more than a standard LP560-4 Coupe. So you're paying an exclusivity tax on a car that will be marginally slower than the standard car in the hands of most of us. It's a very cool thing, this special
Lamborghini , made cooler by the name that it bears. But you'll be just fine with a standard
Gallardo , and save £18k in the process.

Nissan S30
The
Nissan S30
(sold in
Japan
as the
Nissan Fairlady Z
and in other markets as the
Datsun 240Z , then later as the
260Z
and
280Z ) was the
first generation of Z
GT
2 seat coupe, and later (beginning in the 1974 model year) also
2+2
hatchbacks
produced by
Nissan
Motors, Ltd. of Japan from 1970 to 1978. It was designed by a team led
by Mr. Yoshihiko Matsuo, the head of Nissan's Sports Car Styling Studio.
HLS30 was the designation of the left-hand drive model and HS30 for the
right-hand drive model.
All variants had a 4-wheel
independent suspension
consisted of
MacPherson struts
in front (borrowed from the
Nissan Laurel C30 ) and
Chapman struts
in back. Front
disc brakes
and rear
drums
were standard.
The 240Z and 260Z used twin, variable venturi
Hitachi
one-barrel side-draft
SU-like carburetors .
The carburetors were changed beginning with model year 1973 to comply
with emissions regulations, but the earlier carburetors were far
superior for performance.
Fuel injection
(L-Jetronic electronic fuel injection, designed by
Bosch )
was added for the 280Z in 1975 for the US. This was primarily in order
to cope with the difficulty faced in getting enough power using
carburetors while still meeting US emissions regulations.
Due to its relatively low price compared to other foreign sports cars of the time ( Jaguar ,
BMW ,
Porsche , etc.), it became popular in the
United States
and was a major success for the Nissan Motor Corporation, which at the time sold cars in
North America
under the name
Datsun . The 240Z also broadened the image of Japanese car-makers beyond their
econobox
success.
Continuing through the 1975-1978 model years, other non-USA markets
still received the 260Z coupe and the 260Z 2+2 hatchback — the two-door,
four-seat model. The S30 240Z is essentially unrelated to the later
240SX , which is sold as the
Silvia
in Japan, although initial advertising for the 240SX mentioned the S30.
240Z
The 1970 240Z was introduced to the American market by
Yutaka Katayama ,
president of Nissan Motors USA operations, widely known as Mr. K. The
1970 through the mid-1971 model year 240Z was referred to as the Series
I. These early cars had many subtle but notable features differing from
later cars. The most easily visible difference is that these early cars
had a chrome "240Z" badge on the sail pillar, and two horizontal vents
in the rear hatch below the glass molding providing flow through
ventilation. In mid-1971, for the Series II 240Z cars, the sail pillar
emblems were restyled with just the letter "Z" placed in a circular
vented emblem, and the vents were eliminated from the hatch panel of the
car. Design changes for the U.S. model 240Z occurred throughout
production, including interior modifications for the 1972 model year,
and a change in the location of the bumper over-riders, as well as the
addition of some emission control devices and the adoption of a new
style of emissions reducing (and performance compromising) carburetors
for the 1973 model year. [ 1 ]
The 1970 models were introduced in October 1969, received the
L24
2.4 liter engine and a 4-speed manual. A less common 3-speed
automatic transmission
was optional from 1971 on, and had a "Nissan Full Automatic" badge.
In 2004,
Sports Car International
named this car number two on the list of
Top Sports Cars of the 1970s .
One of the most appealing Japanese cars ever produced, it nevertheless
disappeared almost entirely from American roads within two decades,
presumably because like most Japanese cars of the time it had
insurmountable rust issues.

260Z  This model was sold in the
United States
for the 1974 model year only, but was available in other countries
until 1978. The engine was enlarged over that of the 240Z with a longer
stroke to 2.6 L. In the U.S., federal emissions regulations forced a
reduction in ignition timing and compression ratio, resulting in a lower
power output (140 hp) for the 260Z's despite the additional
displacement, whereas in other countries the power output increased to
165 bhp (123 kW; 167 PS). A 3-speed
automatic transmission
was an option, and the 4-speed
manual
remained standard. 1974 brought for the first time to the S30 line a new 2/2 (2+2) seating
option, which offered room for 4 passengers and an extra 11.9 in
(302 mm) of wheelbase. These cars have a notably different roofline from
the 2 seat coupes, incorporating larger opening quarter panel windows.
Some regard the 260Z as the least desirable of the S30 models, because
of the reduced performance offered in comparison to the earlier 240Z,
and also in comparison to the later 280Z with its fuel injected 2.8
liter motor.
The 260Z claimed a few updates or improvements or over the 240Z. The
climate controls were more sensibly laid out and easier to work, and
those cars with air conditioning now had the A/C system integrated into
the main climate control panel. There was also additional stiffness in
the chassis due to a redesign of the chassis rails which were larger and
extended further back than previous models. The 260Z debuted a
redesigned dashboard and console, as well as new seat trim, and door
panels for the interior. The rear tail lights were updated, moving the
reverse lights from the main tail light housing to the back panel. Early
1974 U.S. 260Z models had bumpers that resembled those of the earlier
240Z, though increased slightly in size, pushed away from the body
somewhat, and wearing black rubber bumper guards rather that the
previous chrome bumper guards with rubber strips. These early cars still
had the front turn signals located below the bumpers. Late 1974 U.S.
260Z models (often referred to as 1974.5 models) carried the heavier
bumpers that would remain on the 1975-76 model years of the 280Z. These
late cars had the front turn signals relocated to the outer edges of the
front grill, above the bumper.

280Z
In a further effort to keep the S30 models sporting in the face of
increasingly stringent U.S. emission and safety requirements, Nissan
Motors released the Datsun 280Z model for the U.S. market in the 1975
model year. Both the 2 seat coupe and 2/2 (2+2) hatchback models
remained available throughout the 1975-78 model year run of the 280Z.
For the 280Z, engine size was again increased, this time to 2.8 L, by
enlarging the bore of the L26 engine to create the L28, and a reliable
Bosch L- Jetronic
fuel injection
system was added.
1975 and 1976 models continued to be fitted with the Federally
required 5mph crash test bumpers that were introduced for the mid-1974
model year of the 260z. These bumpers were smooth surfaced, and blended
into smooth black rubber extensions as they met the body of the car.
1977 and 1978 models received bumpers with recessed channels added to
the faces of the bumpers themselves, that blended into corrugated or
accordion style black rubber extension trim. Also new for the 1977 model
year, 280Zs no longer received the full size spare tire, and instead
had a "space saver" spare and a larger fuel tank. This resulted in a
raised rear deck area made of fiberboard, reducing cargo space. In
1977-78 an optional 5-speed manual transmission was available along side
the 4-speed manual, and the 3-speed automatic options, which included a
"5-speed" emblem on the left bottom edge of the rear hatch. 1977 also
saw an update from the charcoal painted hubcap style (with a chrome Z
floating in the amber center emblems) to a hubcap that resembled an
alloy wheel, bearing a center cap with a chrome Z floating in a black
circle.
In 1977 and 1978 respectively, Datsun offered two special edition
models. The "Zap" edition was offered in 1977 as a "Special Decor
Package". Zap cars were finished in Sunshine Yellow paint, and sported
black stripes down the center and sides, with yellow, red, and orange
chevrons at the front ends of the stripes. An estimated 1,000 "Zap Z"
cars were offered in 1977. The "Zap Z" model was also used as the pace
car in the 1977 Long Beach Gran Prix. The Black Pearl edition (produced
in 1978) came with Black
Pearlescent
paint and a "Special Appearance Package" (SAP), which consisted of dual
racing mirrors, rear window louvers, and a unique red and silver
stripe. It is estimated that between 750-1,500 of these cars were
produced.
The S30 series Z car was replaced in 1979 by the S130 Nissan Fairlady 280ZX /
Datsun 280ZX .
Owner modifications The most common conversion is to replace the 2.4 or 2.6 liter engine
with the L28 2.8 liter engine from the later model 280Z/280ZX. Turbo
280ZX L28s can be retrofitted into earlier cars using the later wiring
harness and associated parts.
The S30s are popular for
Skyline
RB25DET/RB26DETT
swaps, with numerous kits available.
The S30 has also proven to be a popular and affordable basis for V8 and other engine conversions, usually a
Chevrolet Small-Block engine
or Ford. Several vendors make kits and informational books to allow the conversion to be done as a nearly bolt-in process.
The 280Z, although relatively heavy and
smog-controlled
in stock form due to government regulations, is easily modified. For instance, simply removing the heavy front
bumper
and adding a front
spoiler
corrects the otherwise jittery high-speed handling of the stock version.
Replacement of stock bumpers with those from the 240z, along
with removal of spare tire, jack, and
air conditioning
system can lighten a 280z by nearly 200 lbs. Some of the weight gain of
a 280z is actually a benefit over the 240z such as a much stronger
Nissan R200 rear
differential
replacing the R180 in the 240z, and the addition of a rear
sway bar . Further, a great variety of
aftermarket parts
are available to, in effect, bring the 280Z back in line with the ethic of the early Z-cars, such as free-flowing
exhaust/header
kits and the installation of a
280ZX turbo
turbocharger.

Bmw 2002 turbo
The
short-lived BMW 2002 Turbo was a extroverted, turbocharged
hooligan of a car. It was introduced in 1972 to inject some
glamour into the ageing BMW sedan it was derived from. The standard
BMW 2002 was a handsome, yet unremarkable two door coupe. The
2002 Turbo was a different story.
Based off the 2002 Tii body platform, the BMW 2002 Turbo was
powered by a turbocharged 2.0 litre engine which produced 170
hp (125 kW) @ 5,800 rpm, and 177 ft/lbs (240 Nm) of torque.
The 5-speed manual ZF gearbox allowed the BMW 2002 Turbo to
reach a respectable 130 mph. One of the drawbacks to the engine
was its sharp turbo cut in from 4,500 rpm. If the driver was
caught out it could make the car a bit of a handful.
The styling of the BMW 2002 Turbo screamed performance. Early
cars even advertised their turbocharged performance with prominent
reversed 'Turbo' lettering on the front bumper. The wheel arches
of the BMW 2002 Turbo were widened with tacked on, race-like
extensions. At the front the chrome bumper of the standard car
was replaced with a deep chin spoiler.
Inside the BMW 2002 Turbo were a pair of adjustable bucket seats, a turbo boost gauge and a three spoke
sport steering wheel.
The BMW 2002 Turbo's production run lasted for only 10 months.
In that time 1,672 cars had been manufactured. Today the 2002
Turbo is highly sought after by collectors.

Ford GT
The
Ford GT
is a mid-engine two-seater sports car.
Ford Motor Company
produced the Ford GT for the 2005 to 2006 model years. The designers drew inspiration from Ford's classic
GT40
race cars of the 1960s.
Development The Ford GT began as a
concept car
designed in anticipation of the automaker's centennial year and as part
of its drive to showcase and revive its "heritage" names such as
Mustang
and
Thunderbird . At the 1995
Detroit Auto Show , the
Ford GT90
concept was shown. At the 2002
auto show , Ford unveiled a new
GT40 Concept
car. Camilo Pardo, the head of Ford's "Living Legends" studio, is
credited as the chief designer of the GT and worked under the guidance
of
J Mays .
The GT is similar in outward appearance to the original
Ford GT40
cars, but bigger, wider, and 3 in (76 mm) taller than the original
40 in (100 cm); as a result, a potential name for the car was the GT43.
Although the cars are visually related, structurally, there is no
similarity between the modern GT and the 1960s GT40 that inspired it.
Three production prototype cars were shown in 2003 as part of Ford's
centenary, and delivery of the production Ford GT began in the fall of
2004.
A British company,
Safir Engineering ,
who built continuation GT40s in the 1980s, owned the "GT40" trademark
at that time. When they completed production, they sold the excess
parts, tooling, design, and trademark to a small
Ohio
company called Safir GT40 Spares. This company licensed the use of the
"GT40" trademark to Ford for the initial 2002 show car. When Ford
decided to make the production vehicle, negotiations between the two
firms failed. The production
Production and sales
The GT was produced in model years 2005 and 2006, with the first
customers taking delivery in August 2004. The GT began assembly at
Mayflower Vehicle Systems in
Norwalk , Ohio and was painted by
Saleen
in their
Saleen Special Vehicles
facility in
Troy , Michigan. The GT is powered by an engine built at Ford's Romeo Engine Plant in
Romeo, Michigan . Installation of the engine and
manual transmission
along with interior finishing was handled in the
SVT
building at Ford's
Wixom, Michigan
plant.
Of the 4,500 GTs originally planned, approximately 100 were to be
exported to Europe, starting in late 2005. An additional 200 were
destined for sale in Canada. Production ended in 2006 without reaching
the planned lot. Approximately 550 were built in 2004, nearly 1,900 in
2005, and just over 1,600 in 2006, for a grand total of 4,038. The final
11 car bodies manufactured by Mayflower Vehicle Systems were
disassembled, and the frames and body panels were sold as service parts.
As with many exotic vehicles, when the Ford GT was first released,
the demand outpaced supply, and the cars initially sold for premium
prices. The first private sale of Ford's new mid-engine sports car was
completed on August 4, 2004, when former
Microsoft
executive Jon Shirley took delivery of his Midnight Blue 2005 Ford GT. [2]
Shirley earned the right to purchase the first production Ford GT (chassis #10) at a charity auction at the Pebble Beach
Concours d'Elegance
Auction after bidding over $557,000. [3]
A few other early cars sold for as much as a US$100,000 premium over the suggested retail price of $139,995 (Ford increased the
MSRP
to $149,995 on July 1, 2005). [4]
Optional equipment available included a
McIntosh
sound system, racing stripes, and forged alloy wheels adding an additional $13,500 to the MSRP. [5]
The production run of 4,038 GTs ended the 2006 model year on September 21, 2006, short of the originally planned 4,500. [6]
The
Wixom Assembly Plant
has stopped production of all models as of May 31, 2007. [7]
Sales of the GT continued into 2007, from cars held in storage and in
dealer inventories. During the GT's lifetime, the car was featured on
the cover of the
video game
Gran Turismo 4 .
Performance and engineering
The Ford GT features many new and unique technologies, including
superplastic -formed aluminum body panels, roll-bonded floor panels, a
friction stir welded
center tunnel, a " ship-in-a-bottle "
gas tank, a capless fuel filler system, one-piece door panels, and an
aluminum engine cover with a one-piece carbon-fiber inner panel.
Brakes are four-piston aluminum
Brembo
calipers with cross-drilled and vented rotors at all four corners. When
the rear canopy is opened, the rear suspension components and engine
are visible.
The mid-mounted 5.4 L
Modular
V8 engine
is all-aluminum with a Lysholm
twin screw-type supercharger .
It features a forged rotating assembly housed in an aluminum block
designed specifically for the GT program. A dry sump oiling system is
employed, allowing the engine to sit low in the car's frame. The DOHC
4-valve heads are a revision of the
2000 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra R
cylinder heads (with slightly increased wall casting thickness in the
exhaust port). The camshafts have unique specifications, with more lift
and duration than those found in the Shelby GT500 or
2003–2004 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra . Power output is 550 hp (410 kW; 558 PS) at 6500 rpm and generates 500 ft·lbf (678 N·m) of torque at 3750 rpm. [8]

Mazda RX-7
The
Mazda RX-7
is a
sports car
by the Japanese automaker
Mazda . It was produced from 1978 to 2002. The original RX-7 featured a 1146 cc twin-rotor
Wankel rotary engine
and a sporty
front-midship ,
rear-wheel drive
layout. The RX-7 was a direct replacement for the
RX-3
(both were sold in Japan as the Savanna) and subsequently replaced all other Mazda rotary cars with the exception of the
Cosmo .
The original RX-7 was a sports car. The compact and lightweight
Wankel engine
( rotary engine )
is situated slightly behind the front axle, a configuration marketed by
Mazda as "front mid-engine". It was offered as a two-seat coupé, with
optional "occasional" rear seats in Japan, Australia, the United States,
and other parts of the world. These rear seats were initially marketed
as a dealer-installed option for the North American markets.
The RX-7 made
Car and Driver
magazine's
Ten Best list
five times. In total, 811,634 RX-7s were produced.
First generation (SA/FB) Series 1 (1979–1980) is commonly referred to as the "SA22C" from the first alphanumerics of the
vehicle identification number .
This series of RX-7 had exposed steel bumpers and a high-mounted
indentation-located license plate, called by Werner Buhrer of
Road & Track
magazine a "Baroque depression."
In 1980 Mazda released 3000 special models known as the LS (Leather
Sport). This package added an LS badge, full leather upholstery,
sunroof, and gold-colored alloys. This model was only available in three
different colors Aura White (1250 made), Brilliant Black (1250 made)
and Solar Gold (500 made).
The Series 2 (1981–1983) had integrated plastic-covered bumpers, wide
black rubber body side moldings, wraparound taillights and updated
engine control components. The GSL package provided optional 4-wheel
disc brakes, front ventilated (Australian model) and clutch-type rear
limited slip differential
(LSD). Known as the "FB" in North America after the
US Department of Transportation
mandated 17 digit Vehicle Identification Number changeover. Elsewhere
in the world, the 1981-1985 RX-7 retained the 'SA22C' VIN prefix. As a
result, enthusiasts outside North America never picked up the "FB"
nickname. The license-plate surround looks much like Buhrer's "Styling
Impressions.
The Series 3 (1984–1985) featured an updated lower front fascia. North
American models received a different instrument cluster (the NA S3 RX-7
is the only rotary-engined car to not have a centrally mounted
tachometer). GSL package was continued into this series, but Mazda
introduced the GSL-SE sub-model. The GSL-SE had a
fuel injected
1.3 L
13B RE-EGI
engine producing 135 hp (101 kW) and 135 lb·ft (183 N·m). GSL-SEs had
much the same options as the GSL (clutch-type rear LSD and rear disc
brakes), but the brake rotors were larger, allowing Mazda to use the
more common lug nuts (versus bolts), and a new bolt pattern of 4x114.3
(4x4.5"). Also, they had upgraded suspension with stiffer springs and
shocks. The external
oil cooler
was reintroduced, after being dropped in the 1983 model-year for the controversial "beehive" water-oil heat exchanger.
The 1984 RX-7 GSL has an estimated 29 highway miles per gallon (8.11
litres per 100 km) /19 estimated city miles per gallon (12.37 l/100 km).
According to Mazda, its rotary engine, licensed by NSU-Wankel allowed
the RX-7 GSL to accelerate from 0 to 50 (80 km/h) in 6.3 seconds.
Kelley Blue Book , in its January–February 1984 issue, noted that a 1981 RX-7 GSL retained 93.4% of its original sticker price.
1985 - Mazda released in Australia the RX7 Finale - this was the last
of the series and brought out in limited numbers. The Finale featured
power options and a brass plaque mentioning the number the car was as
well as "Last of a legend" on the plaque. The finale had special
stickers and a blacked out section between the window & rear hatch.
The handling and
acceleration
of the car were noted to be of a high caliber for its day. This generation RX-7 had "live axle"
4-link
rear
suspension
with
Watt's linkage , a
50/50 weight ratio , and weighed under 2500 lb (1100 kg). It was the lightest generation of RX-7 ever produced.
12A -powered models accelerated from 0–60 mph in 9.2 s, and turned 0.779 g
(7.64 m/s²) laterally on a skidpad. The
12A
engine produced 100 hp (75 kW) at 6000 rpm, allowing the car to reach
speeds of over 120 miles per hour (190 km/h). Because of the smoothness
inherent in the
Wankel rotary engine , little vibration or harshness was experienced at high rpm, so a buzzer was fitted to the
tachometer
to warn the driver when the 7000 rpm redline was approaching
The 12A engine has a long thin shaped combustion chamber, having a
large surface area in relation to its volume. Therefore, combustion is
cool, giving few oxides of nitrogen. However, the combustion is also
incomplete, so there are large amounts of partly burned hydrocarbons and
carbon monoxide. The exhaust is hot enough for combustion of these to
continue into the exhaust. An engine driven pump supplies air into the
exhaust to complete the burn of these chemicals. This is done in the
"thermal reactor" chamber where the exhaust manifold would normally be
on a conventional engine. Under certain conditions the pump injects air
into the thermal reactor and at other times air is pumped through
injectors into the exhaust ports. This fresh air is needed for more
efficient and cleaner burning of the air/fuel mixture.
Options and models varied from country to country. The gauge layout
and interior styling in the Series 3 was only changed for North American
versions. Additionally, North America was the only market to have
offered the first generation RX-7 with the fuel injected
13B , model GSL-SE. A
turbocharged
(but non- intercooled )
12A
engine was available for the top-end model of Series 3 in Japan.
Sales were strong, with a total of 474,565 first generation cars
produced; 377,878 were sold in the United States alone. In 2004,
Sports Car International
named this car #7 on its list of
Top Sports Cars of the 1970s . In 1983, the RX-7 would appear on
Car and Driver
magazine's Ten Best list for the first time in 20 years
Second generation (FC)
The Series 4 (1986–1988) was available with a naturally aspirated, fuel-injected
13B-VDEI
producing 146 hp (108 kW). An optional
turbocharged
model, known as the Turbo II in the American market, had 182 hp /
185 ps (135 kW). The Series 5 (1989–1992) featured updated styling and
better engine management, as well as lighter rotors and a higher
compression ratio , 9.7:1 for the naturally aspirated model, and 9.0:1 for the turbo model. The naturally aspirated Series 5 FC made 160  hp
(119  kW ), while the Series 5 Turbo made 200 hp / 205 ps (147 kW).
The second generation RX-7 ("FC", VIN begins JM1FC3 or JMZFC1), still known as the
Savanna RX-7
in Japan, featured a complete restyling reminiscent of the
Porsche 944
or
Porsche 924 .
Mazda's stylists, led by Chief Project Engineer Akio Uchiyama, focused
on the Porsche 944 for their inspiration in designing the FC because the
new car was being styled primarily for the American market, where the
majority of first generation RX-7's had been sold. This strategy was
chosen after Uchiyama and others on the design team spent time in the
United States studying owners of earlier RX-7's and other sports cars
popular in the American market. The Porsche 944 was selling particularly
well at the time and provided clues as to what sports-car enthusiasts
might find compelling in future RX-7 styling and equipment. While the
SA22/FB was a purer sports car, the FC tended toward the softer
sport-tourer trends of its day. Handling was much improved, with less of
the
oversteer
tendencies of the FB. The rear end design was vastly improved from the
FB's live rear axle to a more modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear
axle). Steering was more precise, with
rack and pinion
steering
replacing the old
recirculating ball
steering of the FB.
Disc brakes
also became standard, with some models (S4: GXL, GTU, Turbo II,
Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston
front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC
RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also
introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the 2nd
generation RX-7. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated
special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited
degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. The DTSS worked
by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions
but induced slight toe-in under heavier cornering loads at around 0.5
G's or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation
of the rear, but toe-in allowed for a more stable rear under heavier
cornering. Mazda also introduced Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS) in the
2nd generation RX-7. The system changed damping characteristics
according to the road and driving conditions. The system compensated for
camber changes and provided anti-dive and anti-squat effects. The Turbo
2 uses a turbo charger with a twin scroll design. Engineered to cancel
the turbo lag at low engine speeds is the smaller primary chamber. At
higher revolutions the secondary chamber is opened pumping out 33% more
power than the naturally aspirated counterpart. The Turbo 2 also has an
air-to-air intercooler that has its own intake on the hood.
Though about 80 lb (36 kg) heavier and more isolated than its
predecessor, the FC continued to win accolades from the press. The FC
RX-7 was
Motor Trend ' s
Import Car of the Year
for 1986, and the Turbo II was on
Car and Driver
magazine's Ten Best list for a second time in 1987.
In the Japanese market, only the turbo engine was available; the
naturally-aspirated version was allowed only as an export. This can be
attributed to insurance companies penalizing turbo cars (thus
restricting potential sales). This emphasis on containing horsepower and
placating insurance companies to make RX-7's more affordable seems
ironic in retrospect. Shortly after the discontinuance of the second
generation RX-7's in 1992, an outright horsepower "arms race" broke out
between sports car manufacturers, with higher and higher levels of power
required to meet buyer demands. This rising horsepower phenomena arose
from the US
CAFE standards
remaining stable while engine technologies marched forward rapidly.
Mazda sold 86,000 RX-7's in the US alone in 1986, its first model year, with sales peaking in 1988.
Australian Motors Mazda released a limited run of 250 'Sports' model
Series 4 RX-7's; each with no power steering, power windows or rear
wiper as an attempt to reduce the weight of the car. In Japan, there was
a special limited release of the FC called Infini with only 600 made
for each year. Some special noted features for all Infini series are:
infini logo on the back, upgraded suspension, upgraded ECU, higher
horsepower, lightened weight, 15" BBS aluminum alloy wheels, Infini logo
steering wheel, aero bumper kits, bronze colored window glass, floor
bar on the passenger side, aluminum bonnet with scoop, flare and holder.
The car was thought as the pinnacle of the RX-7 series (until the FD
came out). The Infini IV came with other special items such as black
bucket seats, 16" BBS wheels, Knee pads, and all the other items
mentioned before. There are differing years for the Infini, which noted
the series. Series I was introduced in 1987, Series II was introduced in
1988, Series III was introduced in 1990, and Series IV was introduced
in 1991. Series I and II came in White or Black, Series III came in
Forest Green only, and Series IV came in Forest Green or Noble Green.
There are only minor differences between the series, the biggest change
which was from the Series II being an S4 (1986–1988) and the Series III
and IV being an S5 (1989–1991).
Third generation (FD)
The third generation of the RX-7,
FD
(with FD3S for the JDM
and JM1FD for the USA VIN), featured an updated body design. The 13B-REW
was the first-ever mass-produced
sequential twin-turbocharger
system to export from Japan, boosting power to 255 PS (188 kW; 252 hp)
in 1993 and finally 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp) by the time production ended
in Japan in 2002.
Series 6 (1992–1995) was exported throughout the world and had the highest sales. In Japan, Mazda sold the RX-7 through its
Efini
brand as the
Efini RX-7.
Models in Japan included the Type R, the top-of-the-range Type RZ, the
Type RB, the A-spec and the Touring X, which only came with a 4-speed
automatic reducing power to 255 PS (188 kW; 252 hp), but the others ran
on the standard 265 PS (195 kW; 261 hp) engine with a 5-speed manual
gearbox. Only the 1993–1995 model years were sold in the U.S. and
Canada. Series 6 came with 255 PS (188 kW; 252 hp) and 294 N·m
(217 ft·lbf). In the UK only 124 examples of this model were sold
through the official Mazda network, Only one spec. was available and
this included twin oil-coolers, electric sunroof, cruise control and the
rear storage bins in place of the back seats.
In North America, three models were offered; the "base", the touring, and the R models. The touring FD had a sunroof,
leather seats , and a complex
Bose
Acoustic Wave system. The R (R1 in 1993 and R2 in 1994–95) models featured stiffer suspensions, an
aerodynamics
package, suede seats, and Z-rated tires.
There is also a "Touring Model" which includes a sun roof, and Bose
stereo system. Compared to the R1 and R2 which both don't have a
moon roof , and they have an extra front oil cooler in the front bumper, and other race modification equipment
Series 7 (1996–1998) included minor changes to the car. Updates
included a simplified vacuum routing manifold and a 16-bit ECU allowing
for increased boost which netted an extra 10 PS (7 kW). In Japan, the
Series 7 RX-7 was marketed under the Mazda brand name. The Series 7 was
also sold in Australia, New Zealand and the UK. Series 7 RX-7s were
produced only in right-hand-drive configuration.
Series 8 (January 1999– August 2002) was the final series, and was
only available in the Japanese market. More efficient turbochargers were
installed, while improved intercooling and radiator cooling was made
possible by a revised frontal area. The seats, steering wheel, and front
and rear lights were all changed. The rear spoiler was modified and
gained adjustability. The top-of-the-line " Type RS " came equipped
with a Bilstein suspension and 17" wheels as standard equipment, and
reduced weight to 1,280 kg (2,822 lb). Power was 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp)
with 313.8 N·m (231 ft·lbf) of torque as per the maximum Japanese
limit. The very limited edition
Type RZ
version included all the
features of the Type RS, but at a lighter weight (at 1270 kg). It also
featured custom gun-metal colored BBS wheels and a custom red racing
themed interior. Further upgrades included a new 16-bit ECU and ABS
system upgrades. The improved
ABS
system worked by braking differently on each wheel, allowing the car
better turning during braking. The effective result made for safer
driving for the average buyer. Easily the most collectible of all the
RX-7s was the last 1,500 run-out specials. Dubbed the " Spirit R ",
they combined all the "extra" features Mazda had used on previous
limited-run specials plus new exclusive features. They still command
amazing prices on the Japanese used car scene years later. Sticker
prices when new were 3,998,000 yen for Type-A and B and 3,398,000 yen
for Type-C. Mazda's press release said " The Type-A Spirit R model is the ultimate RX-7, boasting the most outstanding driving performance in its history. "
- There are three kinds of "Spirit R": the "Type A", "Type B", and
"Type C". The "Type A" has a 5-speed manual transmission, and is said to
have the best performance of the three models. The "Type B" has a 2+2
seat configuration and also sports a 5-speed manual transmission. The
"Type C" is also a 2+2, but has a 4-speed automatic transmission.
Clarification of the build number breakdown for each type is sought as
Mazda hasn't publicly published the production figures.
The FD RX-7 was
Motor Trend 's Import\Domestic Car of the Year. When
Playboy
magazine first reviewed the FD RX-7 in 1993, they tested it in the same issue as the [then] new
Dodge Viper .
In that issue, Playboy declared the RX-7 to be the better of the two
cars. It went on to win Playboy's Car of the Year for 1993. The FD RX-7
also made
Car and Driver
magazine's Ten Best list for 1993
through 1995, for every year in which it was sold state-side. June, 2007
Road&Track magazine proclaimed "The ace in Mazda's sleeve is the
RX-7, a car once touted as the purest, most exhilarating sports car in
the world.
The sequential twin turbocharged system was a very complex piece of engineering, developed with the aid of
Hitachi
and previously used on the domestic
Cosmo
series (JC Cosmo=90–95). The system was composed of two small
turbochargers, one to provide torque at low RPM. The 2nd unit was on
standby until the upper half of the rpm range during full throttle
acceleration. The first turbocharger provided 10 psi (0.7 bar) of boost
from 1800 rpm, and the 2nd turbocharger was activated at 4000 rpm and
also provided 10 psi. The changeover process, between 3500 rpm and
4000 rpm, provided 8 psi (0.6 bar), was smooth, and provided linear
acceleration and a wide torque curve throughout the entire rev range.
Handling in the FD was regarded as world-class, and it is still
regarded as being one of the finest handling and best balanced cars of
all time. The continued use of the front-midship engine and drivetrain
layout, combined with an 50:50 front-rear weight distribution ratio and
low center of gravity made the FD a very competent car at the limits.
Australia had a special high performance version of the RX-7 in 1995, dubbed the
RX-7 SP . This model was developed as a
homologated
road-going version of the factory race cars used in the 12hr endurance races held at
Bathurst, New South Wales ,
beginning in 1991 for the 1995 event held at Eastern Creek, Sydney, New
South Wales. An initial run of 25 were made, and later an extra 10 were
built by Mazda due to demand. The RX-7 SP produced 204 kW (274 hp) and
357 N·m (263 ft·lbf) of torque, compared to the 176 kW (236 hp) and
294 N·m (217 ft·lbf) of the standard version. Other changes included a
race developed carbon fibre nose cone and rear spoiler, a carbon fibre
120 L fuel tank (as opposed to the 76 L tank in the standard car), a
4.3:1-ratio rear differential, 17 in diameter wheels, larger brake
rotors and calipers. An improved intercooler, exhaust, and modified
ECU
were also included. Weight was reduced significantly with the aid of
further carbon fibre usage including lightweight vented bonnet and
Recaro seats to reduce weight to just 1218 kg (from 1310 kg). It was a
serious road going race car that matched their rival
Porsche 911
RS CS for the final year Mazda officially entered. The formula paid off
when the RX-7 SP won the title, giving Mazda the winning 12hr trophy
for a fourth straight year. The winning car also gained a podium finish
at the international tarmac rally Targa Tasmania months later. A later
special version, the
Bathurst R , was released in 2001 to commemorate this,
in
Japan
only .
In the United Kingdom, for 1992, customers were offered only one
version of the FD which was based on a combination of the US touring and
base model. For the following year, in a bid to speed up sales, Mazda
reduced the price of the RX-7 to £25,000, down from £32,000 and refunded
the difference to those who bought the car before that was announced.
The FD continued to be imported to the UK until 1996. In 1998, for a car
that had suffered from slow sales when it was officially sold, with as
surge of interest following its appearances in videogames, notably
Gran Turismo
and the benefit of a newly introduced
SVA
scheme, which meant an influx of inexpensive Japanese imported cars,
the FD would become so popular that there were more parallel and grey
imported models brought into the country than Mazda UK had ever
imported.
