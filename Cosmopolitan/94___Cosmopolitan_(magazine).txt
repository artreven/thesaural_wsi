fourth grade teacher fired for having sex with her husband
When Jarretta Hamilton, a fourth grade teacher at a
Florida
Christian school , told administrators she was
pregnant , she expected them to ask when she was
due.

Florida Christian school, told administrators she was pregnant, she

answer would get her fired.

She did not, however, think her answer would get her fired.
In April 2009, Hamilton told her boss at Southland Christian School in
St. Cloud, Fla., that she was pregnant and planned to take a six-week
leave in October. When asked when she conceived, Hamilton answered
honestly: She became pregnant just three weeks prior to her Feb. 20
wedding.
That was enough to get her fired under the school’s strict morality
rules, which prohibit teachers from “fornication,” engaging in sex
before marriage.
“Jaretta was asked not to return because of a moral issue that was
disregarded, namely fornication, sex outside marriage,” administrator
Julie Ennis wrote in a letter to Hamilton’s lawyer.
Now, Hamilton is suing the school in federal court, seeking damages for
lost wages and emotional distress.
“She was incredibly upset about being fired,” Hamilton’s lawyer Edward
Gay told ABCNews.com.
“She was upset that she wasn’t able to complete
the term with less than two months left in the school year and upset
that her fourth graders were told about this.”
According to Gay, Hamilton filed a complaint with the
Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission , but opted out of
mediation and chose instead to file suit because of the commission’s
lengthy backlog.
According to the complaint, Hamilton is suing under federal gender
discrimination laws, a state marriage discrimination law and for
violations of her privacy.
“The school told the students and their parents why Hamilton had been
fired. Disclosing that kind of personal information was a violation of
her privacy,” Gay said.
“There were never any complaints about her teaching. The school said she
was an outstanding teacher,” he added.
The school does not dispute the reasons for firing Hamilton, calling sex
outside of marriage “an immoral action,” but argues that her
termination does not rise to discrimination because it employs other
pregnant women.

How can they speak for a black man?
Nothing frustrates me more, than to hear some Ivory League know it all stand-up on his soap box and act like he knows black people.
Unfortunately their are some whites in the world that feel that they can stand up and tell the world that they are tire of black feeling like they got the short end of the stick. At times if you listen to them, you would think they were black for just a split second when they are telling blacks to stop using the race card…
To intentionally provoke a individual with the intent to get a adverse reaction is not cool at all. I seldom see white’s that are pushed and prod ed
to get a reaction and then justify their actions.
Blacks need to understand that some whites do things all for the good of what ever point that they are trying to make. Gary come back, why, so that we can finish grilling you and get our point across. So since he did not come back now Mr White man can give you the evolution of blacks and how they really act! What was really sad is that they had a black female on the show that looked like she had already been bought and sold!
So you know who she was not defending

Oscar Azócar, Venezuelan
baseball
player (New York Yankees, San Diego Padres) has died he was 45
Oscar Gregorio Azócar
was a
Major League Baseball
outfielder
and left-handed batter who played for the
New York Yankees
( 1990 ) and
San Diego Padres
( 1991 – 1992 ) has died he was 45.
(February 21, 1965 in
Soro ,
Venezuela
– June 14, 2010 in
Valencia , Venezuela)
Until
1987
Azócar was a left-handed
pitcher
(lifetime 14–5, 2.30
ERA
as a pro), but then switched to the outfielder
position. Azócar was a classic example of the impatient hitter who will
swing at almost anything and usually put it in play. It took him 100
Major League
at-bats
to draw his first
walk .
He normally obliged the pitchers by hitting whatever they threw, and
his
batting average
dropped accordingly.
In his 202-game career Azócar hit for .226, with 5
home runs ,
36
runs batted in , 38
runs scored , 99
hits , 16
doubles , 10
stolen
bases
and 12
base on balls . Despite his free-swinging
style, he had only 36
strikeouts
in 439 at-bats (one every 12 at-bats).
Azócar also used his speed selectively and never was
caught stealing .
He signed with
Navegantes del Magallanes
after
leaving the Padres and finished his baseball career in Mexico in 2001. [ 1 ]
Azócar died in Valencia, Venezuela on June 14th, 2010.
[ 2 ]
Azócar spent most of his career in the minors and later in the
Venezuelan and Mexican leagues:
1987
Fort Lauderdale Yankees
( Florida State League )
1989
Albany/Colonie Yankees
( Eastern League )
1989–1990
Columbus Clippers
( International League )
1991
Las Vegas Stars
( Pacific Coast League )
2000
Oaxaca Warriors
( Mexican League (baseball) )
2001
Yucatan Lions
( Mexican League (baseball) )

who is Amy Lyn Acuff?
Who is Amy Lyn Acuff ?
The Track and Field world knows her as Amy Acuff. She is a
track and field athlete
from
the
United States . A
high
jump
specialist, she competed in the
1996 ,
2000 ,
2004 , and
2008 Summer Olympics
as a member of
USA Track and Field . Her best
Olympic performance came at the 2004 Games, where her jump of 1.99 m
earned her fourth place in the final.
She (born July 14, 1975,
Port Arthur, Texas )established herself domestically with wins at the
USA Outdoor Track and
Field Championships
in 1995 and 1997. At the age of 22, she became
the
Universiade
champion, edging out
Monica Iagăr
in the
1997 high jump final .
Acuff was the winner of the 1998
Hochsprung mit Musik
meeting in
Arnstadt ,
Germany ,
becoming the first non-European winner in the history of the event. She
went on to win at the national championships in 2001, 2003, and 2005.
Her personal best is 2.01 m, which she achieved in
Zürich
on August 15, 2003.
While in high school in 1993 she was named the named the national
Girl’s “High School Athlete of the Year” by
Track and Field News . [ 1 ]
Acuff is distantly related to country musician
Roy Acuff
(her grandfather’s second cousin). ( Acuff-Ecoff Family Archives )
Amy Acuff’s high jumping journey started at an extraordinarily young age in South Texas.
At age five in the summer of 1980, Amy could be found at the track stadium competing in A.A.U. sprint races. 50 meter, 100 meter, and 200 meter races, which were specially organized for kids five and under, were her first introduction to sport.
As her track and field exploits diversified, Amy took up other events and was a quick study. In 1985 she set an A.A.U. national long jump record for age 10 and under with 14’1″. From this breakthrough accomplishment, Amy’s determination would only grow.
At Calallen Middle School in Corpus Christi, Texas, Amy would first be introduced to the high jump as a “filler” event to pick up extra points for the team. With exponential improvement, her 8th grade season would culminate in the amazing performance of 5’8-1/2″. The mark set at age 13, would have been competitive at the high school state championships.
In addition to her early track and field success, Amy also excelled at basketball throughout her grade school years.
In 1990, Amy’s freshman year of high school, Head Coach Leta Andrews would lead her perennial state power club all the way to the state championship. Amy had the good fortune to witness this great victory firsthand, as a sideline contributor.
Amy continued to flourish under Leta Andrews’ tutelage and support through high school athletics. Even without the technical instruction of a high jump coach, Amy would find an independent strength at this level. It was that same freshman year that would find Amy thrust upon the national scene with an incredible leap of 6’0″.
For the duration of her high school campaign, Amy would methodically go about capturing each separate national high jump class record:
freshman (1990: 6’0″)
sophomore (1991: Texas state record 6’2-1/4″)
junior (1992: national record 6’3″)
senior (1993: re-establishing her national mark at 6’4″).
Amy’s astonishing jump of 6’4″ at age 17, incredibly defeated an international field. On a cold and rainy night in Innsbruck, Austria, she remarkably topped the three medalists from the then recent 1993 World Championships. This was in her final meet of high school eligibility.
For her efforts, she was named 1993’s Gatorade Prep Track and Field Athlete of the Year, edging out the likes of Marion Jones. This prestigious honor, while also managing to stay focused academically and finish as her high school’s Salutatorian.
After high school, Amy accepted a full athletic scholarship to UCLA. There, she had the great fortune to train under the elite mentorship of coaches Bob Kersee and Jeanette Bolden. Without even blinking it seemed Amy quickly became part of their circle of success.
Competition record
National Scholastic Indoor Champion: 1991, 1992
Pan-Am Junior Champion: 1993
NCAA Indoor Champion: 1994, 1995, 1997
NCAA Outdoor Champion: 1995, 1996
U.S. Outdoor Champion: 1995–1997, 2001–2007
U.S. Indoor Champion: 2001, 2004, 2007–2008
At UCLA, she would earn a degree in Biology in four years, while also complementing her golden track and field resume. While a Bruin in 1995, Amy jumped 6’6″ to establish a new collegiate record. This was on her way to 4 PAC-10, 3 NCAA Indoor, and 2 NCAA Outdoor titles.
Post-graduation, Amy remained in Los Angeles to train full-time. Being so close to the bright lights of Hollywood provided the opportunity to pursue part-time modeling. On select occasions she combined her eccentric flair for fashion with her athleticism by wearing non-traditional outfits while competing and attracting attention to a sport, which often times goes unnoticed.
The success Amy found on the track at UCLA, combined with her subsequent resiliency on the professional circuit, has now established her as one of the world’s elite for more than a decade.
She has finished ranked #1 in the U.S. three times, and been ranked no lower than 3rd in the nation for each of the last ten years. Amy has been ranked in the yearly top 10 in the world on five occasions. Her honors include two Olympic games, in Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000.
She is now a Licensed Acupuncturist in Northern California and married since 2004 to pole vaulter Tye Harvey. She trains under Coach Dan Pfaff at an elite track and field training center in Stockton, California with about 20 other athletes. The training center, known as
Tri-Valley Athletics
track club, has been a big passion, with the objective of giving athletes a place to train and receive quality coaching after college.

Acuff is also known for her career as a model, including multiple cover appearances:
Esquire , “Women of Summer: Strength & Beauty: A Portfolio of America’s 10 Sexiest Athletes”
“ Men’s magazines ”, such as
Maxim
and
FHM
The 2004 Olympics were noted for the large number of female Olympians who posed nude—following in the footsteps of the 2000
Matildas . Of the 2004 examples the most visible was Acuff’s appearance on the cover and within
Playboy ‘s, “The Women of the Olympics” issue. [1]
Acuff is on the top part cover of the 2008 edition of the
