Just a quickie: champagne tips
Just a very quick note in follow-up to the
Hove Champagne Festival
which I fully intended to blog about, but have now run out of that elusive commodity: time. Anyway, I thought it worth passing on that we went to the Waitrose Direct tutored tasting and we really liked both of these sparkling wines, both of which are on offer right at this moment (25% off all sparkling wines at
Waitrose Direct
until 16th June).
Just thought you might like a little heads-up:
Nyetimber Classic Cuvée 2002

This little number is from West Sussex and is a steal at around £25 (£20 if you get it now). We were delighted to discover the quality of this local sparkling wine, which was served to President Sarkozy recently (who is famously derisive about British wines). Apparently our Queenie likes a drop of this too
and
it’s served in the Fat Duck. The secret to its success is the chalky soil in Sussex, which is similar to the soil in the Champagne region. This was our favourite of all the sparkling wines we tried (including the vintage Champagnes).
SanLeo Prosecco Brut NV

I admit that I’m Prosecco mad, but this wine should satisfy even the most cynical of the Champagne devotees. Cheap as chips at £7.99 (£5.99 online now), it is a lovely example of this Italian sparkling. If you need convincing then it is the exact wine (different packaging) that is used at the  Hotel Cipriani
(owned by legendary inventor of the
Bellini ). The wine itself is really pale and light and would be the perfect sparkling wine to drink on a summer’s day. And at £5.99 why the hell not?
