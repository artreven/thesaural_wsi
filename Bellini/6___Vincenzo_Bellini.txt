Re-Visioning Callas
I have great admiration for
Maria Callas
(1923-1977) and recently discovered a fascinating website about her life and art called
Re-Visioning Callas .
Its creator is Marion Lignana Rosenberg, and
Re-Visioning Callas
is not only the title of her website but also of an award-winning article and book-in-progress.
Rosenberg’s article was first published in (the now-defunct)
USItalia .
It won a Front Page Award from the Newswomen’s Club of New York, and, says Rosenberg, “represents the germ of my project.” Following is the judges’ citation:
Maria Callas died in 1977 at age 53, but her tempestuous legend lives on. This essay is written with the same extraordinary passion and fire that characterized the opera diva’s career. Offered up on the occasion of Callas’ 80th birthday, this article acknowledges but righteously dismisses the ‘petty, salacious lore’ of the woman’s private life and celebrates the performer’s extreme dedication to her art [and] her lasting gifts to music. Whether you agree or disagree, it’s a compelling, absorbing read from start to finish. Bravo!
It is indeed. Here’s just a snippet of Rosenberg's article (with added links).
How, then, can we fittingly remember Callas? We can recall the musician who re-shaped the operatic canon, revealing the musical and dramatic integrity of works (by
Rossini ,
Bellini ,
Donizetti , and others) once dismissed as mindless showpieces for canary-like singers. We can think of the artist who, in upholding the ideals of
dramma per musica , drew to the opera house directors from the so-called “legitimate” theatre, crossly informing one such colleague who demurred, “I don't want opera directors. I want directors.” Granted, there remain pockets of provincialism (New York, for example) where opera is seen as a concert in costume, an ingratiating timbre and loud high notes are mistaken for music making, and probing, high-minded productions are reserved for “respectable” (i.e. non-Italian) opera. Most everywhere else, though, Callas’s example continues to shape what audiences see and hear. This is true at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, where world-class scholarship, theatrical values, and musical prowess go hand in hand; in the best work of such singers as
Juan Diego Flórez
and
Cecilia Bartoli ; and at
La Scala , where generations of artists (including
Giorgio Strehler ,
Claudio Abbado , and
Riccardo Muti ) have tended the Italian operatic tradition with seriousness, love, and a spirit of discovery. Finally, we can remember the awkward little girl with a wayward voice who, through unsparing hard work, became an artist whose musicianship, glamour, and quest for dramatic truth transfix music lovers even now, some forty years after her last appearances in opera.
Rosenberg’s
Re-Visioning Callas
website is very comprehensive. Its accompanying
blog , for instance, contains numerous insightful and scholarly articles.
Also, I was happy and honored to see in the site’s
links section , my website documenting and celebrating
Maria Callas in Pier Pablo Pasolini’s
Medea
listed by
Rosenberg as an “especially useful or compelling” site.
I thank Marion for her generous commendation of my site and wish her all the best in the writing and publishing of
Re-Visioning Callas , the book.
If you’re a Callas fan,
Re-Visiting Callas
and its companion
blog
are essential resources. For those who are unfamiliar with the great Callas, I share this evening the following clip of her singing "Ah, non credea mirarti" from
La sonnambula
(Bellini). It's one of my favorite arias - and was recorded in Paris in 1965, the year of my birth. It's taken from the 2003 DVD
The Callas Conversations .
I'm sure it will give you a sense of the artistry, passion, and beauty of Maria Callas.

About Me
Michael J. Bayly
Born and raised in
Australia , I now reside in the U.S. where I currently serve as executive coordinator of
Catholics for Marriage Equality MN , an initiative of the
Catholic Pastoral Committee on Sexual Minorities (CPCSM) . I am also editor of
The Progressive Catholic Voice
and co-chair of the Minnesota-based
Catholic Coalition for Church Reform . I established
The Wild Reed
as a sign of solidarity with all who are dedicated to living lives of integrity –
though, in particular, with gay people seeking to be true to both the gift of their sexuality and their Catholic faith.
The Wild Reed
simply invites people to observe and reflect upon one man’s progressive, gay, Catholic perspective on faith, sexuality, politics, and culture.

Even though reeds can symbolize frailty, they may also represent the strength found in flexibility. Popular wisdom says that the green reed which bends in the wind is stronger than the mighty oak which breaks in a storm. Tall green reeds
are associated with water, fertility, abundance, wealth, and rebirth. The sound of a reed pipe
is often considered the voice of a soul
pining for God or a lost love.

Readers write . . .
"I believe your blog to be of utmost importance for all people regardless of their orientation. . . . Thank you for your blog and the care and dedication that you give in bringing the TRUTH to everyone."
– William "Michael, if there is ever a moment in your day or in your life when you feel low and despondent and wonder whether what you are doing is anything worthwhile, think of this: thanks to your writing on the internet, a young man miles away is now willing to embrace life completely and use his talents and passions unashamedly to celebrate God and his creation. Any success I face in the future and any lives I touch would have been made possible thanks to you and your honesty and wisdom."
– AB "Since I discovered your blog I have felt so much more encouraged and inspired knowing that I'm not the only gay guy in the Catholic Church trying to balance my Faith and my sexuality. Continue being a beacon of hope and a guide to the future within our Church!"
– Phillip "Your posts about Catholic issues are always informative and well researched, and I especially appreciate your photography and the personal posts about your own experience. I'm very glad I found your blog and that I've had the chance to get to know you."
– Crystal "Thank you for taking the time to create this fantastic blog.
It is so inspiring!"
– George "I cannot claim to be an expert on Catholic blogs, but from what I've seen, The Wild Reed ranks among the very best."
– Kevin "Reading your blog leaves me with the consolation of knowing that the words Catholic, gay and progressive are not mutually exclusive.."
– Patrick "I grieve for the Roman institution’s betrayal of God’s invitation to change.
I fear that somewhere in the midst of this denial is a great sin that rests on the shoulders of those who lead and those who passively follow.
But knowing that there are voices, voices of the prophets out there gives me hope.
Please keep up the good work."
– Peter "Michael, your site is like water in the desert."
– Jayden
