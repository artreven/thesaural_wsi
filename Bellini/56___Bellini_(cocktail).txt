Ruby Jewel Cocktail
Many people associate champagne and sparkling wine with New Year's or other celebrations. I enjoy drinking the bubbly year round and see no reason to wait for a special occasion! Occasionally, I get a chance to have some *really* good stuff: However, drinking three-figure bottles of vintage champagne isn't an everyday thing for me so I often turn to Prosecco, an Italian sparkling wine that is an inexpensive substitute with a slightly lower alcohol content. It also lends itself to mixing (which I would never do with a pricey French champagne) such as in the classic
Bellini .
Not having any white peaches around though, I decided to use some A marena cherries. These little gems are slightly sour cherries grown mostly in northern Italy. They are usually found in a crock or can in a heavy syrup. The  Amarena Fabbri  cherries I used were a lovely gift from my husband and I am looking forward to using them in and over gelato or ice cream. They are also a great upgrade from a traditional maraschino cherry in your cocktail.
Try a ruby jewel: drop one or two cherries with a bit of syrup into a champagne flute and top with Prosecco. I often enjoy   Mionetto Prosecco .  Salut!
