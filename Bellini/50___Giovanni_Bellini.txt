Undoubtedly one of Italy's most
beautiful and well-endowed
cities, Bergamo is divided into
a lower, modern city ( Bergamo
Basso ) and its ancient,
historical heart ( Bergamo
Alta ) which sits high above
the
Lombardy
plain at
over 500 meters, at the
confluence of the
Brembo
and
Serio
rivers, two
tributaries of the
Adda
river.
Bergamo Basso has developed
largely in the 20th century and
features a number of overwrought
neo-classical buildings on its
over-planned streets, and
perhaps few too public buildings
that of the 1930s and 40s that
manifest the muscular
grandiosity of Italian fascism.
Still, even the lower city, with
its public gardens and
tree-lined avenues, has its
attractions.
Bergamo Alta, although connected
by a network of winding streets,
is best accessed by funicular -
an inclined railway because the
streets are mind-bogglingly
complicated, parking is very
limited in the
centro storico
- the historical  center,
and all traffic is curtailed on
Sundays.
The history of Bergamo follows
that of the region generally. It
was probably settled by the
Celts
during the
Bronze Age ,
and later by the
Gauls .
But, by the 6th century BC,
Bergamo was under the domination
of the
Etruscans
up until the 3rd Century BC when
it was conquered by the
Romans ,
eventually in 49 BC, under
Julius Caeser ,
becoming a Roman
municipium ,
known as
Bergomum , a city
whose people enjoyed the rights
and privileges of Roman
citizenship.  During the
long  decline of the Roman
Empire, in the 5th century AD,
the city was destroyed by
Attila ,
king of the Huns. Later, during
the 9th century, it fell under
the sword of the
Longobards
- or Lombards.
For a time (between 1264 and
1428), the City was under the
control of the Lords of Milano,
after which, by conquest again,
it was incorporated into the
Venetian Republic
whose control lasted until 1797
- when the region was conquered
by Napoleon and the city folded
into the Cisalpine Republic. The
city, thereafter, was mostly
under the Austrians, but
Austrian rule was ended when the
Austrians were pushed out during
the
Risorgimento ,
and northern Italy became part
of the modern state of Italy.
The Etruscans, Romans and
Longobards and Milanese had each
constructed walls and
fortifications, but it was the
Venetians who, partly using what
was there already, were
largely responsible for the
fabulous ring of walls which
encircle Bergamo Alta today.
Inside the walls, which run
about 5 km - the centro storico
still reflects the Roman town
plan - two main streets ( via
Gombito
and
via Colleoni ),
with gates at each end, run from
north to south and east to west
intersecting at right angles.
The
Gombito Tower , built
in medieval times, stands at
this crossroads today.  The
principal gate today is the
Porta Sant'Agosta.
Visiting Bergamo, travelers will
find the streets and piazzas
eminently seductive...wandering
the entire precinct within the
walls a treat in itself.
Naturally, there are many
buildings and  monuments of
note along the way and, of
course, there is an abundance of
shops, some very high end, some
devoted to pushing souvenirs,
and the usually plethora of
cafes, trattorias and
restaurants, where one can rest
one's legs and take a little
nourishment.
Piazza Vecchia
is the
main public square.  Facing
into this piazza is the
Palazzo della Ragione
(12th
Century, rebuilt in the 16th),
seat of the medieval comunal
governments and today an
exhibition hall whose atrium
boasts an 18th century sundial.
The St. Mark's lion over the
mullioned windows reflects a
strong Venetian influence.
There are many palazzi and
public buildings in Bergamo Alta
- adding immensely to its charm
and appeal - that similarly
reflect the Venetian style.
The most impressive church, the
local Duomo or cathedral,
accessible through the portico
on Piazza Vecchia, is the more
or less
Romanesque
Basilicata di Santa Maria
Maggiore , built in 1137 non
the foundations of an earlier
7th century church which itself
had been built on the
foundations of a Roman temple.
The main church features an
octagonal dome.
The campanile - bell tower - was
added between 1436 and 1459.
The interior, which was
remodelled during the late
Renaissance period, has a
fresco, painted in 1347, by
Giotto
in its transept and
frescoes by
Tiepolo
in its dome.
The tomb of
Gaetano Donizetti,
a native
son, lies within.
Next to the Basilica is the
Capella Colleoni ,
essentially a tomb commissioned
by the mercenary Bartolomeo
Colleoni, whose architecture and
decoration are magnificent
examples of the high
Renaissance
style.  Colleoni is
pictured sitting on a golden
horse.
The Venetian artist-arcthitect
Lorenzo Lotto
worked in
Bergamo for about 12 years.
Several churches in the city
display his work, most
particularly the
Chiesa di
San Michele al Pozzo Bianca
which has a work on the life of
Mary from 1525.
Two of the city's best museums
are also found within the walls:
the
Museo Civico Archeologico
(Archaeological Civic Museum)
and the
Museo di scienze
naturali Caffi
(Caffi
Natural Science Museum).
Bergamo Bassa
It is more likely than not that
travelers who want to stay a
night or two in Bergamo will
find accommodation in the lower
city.  It is a much
different "built" environment
than its higher counterpart -
indeed it is several "worlds"
away.
But there is much to do and see
in Bergamo Bassa.  It is,
for instance, the home of the
Pinacoteca
dell'Accademia Carrara ,
founded in 1796,
known more simply as the
Accademia Carrara
and the
nearby
GAMEC
- the
Galleria d'Arte Moderna e
Contemporanea
(Gallery of
Modern and Contemporary art)
which will wrench your head out
of things ancient and plant you
firmly in the now, or perhaps
even the future.  The
Accademia Carrara has a large
collection (18,000 pieces), not
all good, but some spectacular
works by
Raphael ,
Bellini ,
Donatello ,
Rubens
and
Clouet .
Look for the
Porta Nuova
which stands at the entrance to
the
Sentierone , a
capacious garden surrounded by
19th century arcades and loomed
over by one of the aforesaid
fascist buildings, the
Palazzo di Giustizia
(Palace
of Justice).
The high streets are lined with
shops, some very fashionable,
and offices - because Bergamo
is, after all a modern,
commercial and light industrial
center of some impo rt
in the Italian economy.
