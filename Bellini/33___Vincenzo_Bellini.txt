NYT Friday 12/18/09 - Another BEQuest
With this Friday
New York Times
crossword, I seem to be right back where I started, with solving times of around an hour. Here, I managed to get a start at the top right, with answers like
Molière
and
ariette
being the way in. Then I worked steadily counterclockwise from there - never really getting stuck for long, but never finding answers falling into place with the rapidity that they seem to do for others.
I've tried to analyze why this particular puzzle should take way longer than my current average of 30 minutes or so for Friday/Saturday crosswords: I think it comes down to the large number of non-dictionary entries like
say what ,
you jest ,
amuse me
and
well yes . It's not at all what I'm used to from the cryptic crosswords I've been doing most of my life. I think this freedom to choose answers from informal speech is great, but it's doesn't play to my strengths and it'll take me a while to get the hang of BEQ's style in particular.
Solving time: 60 mins ( solo, no solving aids )
Clue of the puzz: 38a
squad car
{Place for a collared person}

Letters used
ABCDEF G HIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY Z
New To Me
19a
Haj
{1984 historical novel, with "The"}.
Haj
was not what I was expecting for an historical novel of 1984.
The Haj
is by the American author
Leon Uris
(1924–2003) and tells the story of a Palestinian Arab family from the 1920s-1950s. The
Haj
of the title relates figuratively to the journey made by the family as refugees.
20a
La Jolla
{Home to Torrey Pines Golf Course}. I knew roughly where
Torrey Pines
is for the strange reason that it was the standard course on a computer golf game I played many years ago. I've forgotten what the game was, but remember the course as being on the West Coast overlooking the sea. So as soon as I had a few letters towards it, I penciled in
La Jolla , which I gather from Magdalen is pronounced
"Lah HOY-ya".
22a
Nel
{Bellini's "___ furor delle tempeste"}. Opera is the standard recourse when a three-letter Italian word needs to be clued.
Nel furor delle tempeste
("in the fury of the storm") is a tenor aria from
Il pirata
(1827).
Bellini 's not really our bag, so it's no surprise that we hadn't heard of the aria, nor the opera.
35a
WNBA
{The Sun and Mercury are in it: Abbr.}. This clue was mysterious even when I'd finished the crossword to my satisfaction. My best guess was that
WNBA
was a radio or TV station, but in fact it's the
Women's National Basketball Association , which has teams called the
Connecticut Sun
and
Phoenix Mercury . I could only figure this out with Wikipedia's help.
51a
cream
{Shellac}. Another clue which I couldn't figure out and so had to rely on crossings. Magdalen tells me to "shellac" is to defeat decisively, as is to "cream". The former is specifically North American slang, which explains why I hadn't heard of it before.
53a
Endy
{Outfielder Chávez}.
Endy Chávez
played for the
New York Mets
in the 2006-2008 seasons, but was then traded to the
Seattle Mariners . An injury caused him to miss much of the 2009 season and he's now a
free agent .
7d
toe jam
{Digital detritus}. Eww!
Toe jam
is apparently the lint that accumulates between the toes. We don't need a name for that. It's also a rock-climbing technique - that's much more appealing.
10d
olla
{Indian water holder}. "Indian"? Really? I thought
olla
was a Spanish word, as in
olla podrida
(literally "rotten pot"). I gather that
olla
is also used for the pots in which Native American tribes in the Southwest store their water - the term presumably being introduced by Spanish settlers. They often have narrow necks to reduce loss from evaporation.
24d
air walk
{High passageway between buildings}. An "air walk" is something we're all familiar with, but I didn't realize there was an architectural term for it. This may be one of the less familiar uses of the answer, since there's an
Airwalk
footwear company and an
airwalk
is also a skateboarding trick. In fact, researches suggest
skyway or skywalk
may be the more usual architectural terms.
43d
Bon Jovi
{First hard rock band to score a #1 country hit}. I knew of
Bon Jovi
the singer, but I don't think I've been aware until today that his band was called the same thing. Their country hit was presumably
Who Says You Can't Go Home , a duet with
Jennifer Nettles .
51d
Coote
{"My Fair Lady" actor Robert}. Vague memories of the English actor
Robert Coote
(1909–1982) saved me from my difficulties at 51-Across.
Coote
typically played aristocrats or British military types in many films, and created the role of Colonel Hugh Pickering in the long-running original Broadway production of
My Fair Lady . I think of him more for playing the role of Flying Officer Trubshaw in one of my fav movies,
A Matter of Life and Death
(1946).
Noteworthy
16a
Molière
{"The Imaginary Invalid" playwright}. The English title in the clue wrong-footed me: once I'd translated it into
Le Malade imaginaire , I got the answer stat and in fact
Molière
(1622–1673) was my "way in" to the grid. Why this particular translation? Doesn't "hypochondriac" say it all much better?
25a
nanos
{Mini replacements}. Have seen something like this before, so worked out this
iPod
reference after a few crossings.
29a
mes
{Período de 31 días}. Somehow this escaped mention in
Español para los crucigramistas , though the Spanish for month is one of the most worthy candidates for inclusion. It's there now.
65a
The Wire
{Gritty TV series set in Baltimore}. I think we must have watched an episode or two of
The Wire , as the title came fairly easily once I had some crossings. It didn't inspire continued watching, probably because the grittiness isn't that appealing to us.
8d
I'm a Loser
{Second song on "Beatles '65"}. Helpful to have
I'm a Loser
again so soon after
I'm a
{The Beatles' "___ Loser"} in
last Sunday's puzzle . That on its own couldn't counteract the overall hostility of the puzzle and after spending an hour on the puzzle, the song title summed up my feelings well.
28d
kinds
{Stripes}. I figured early on that "Stripes" had to mean
sorts
or
kinds , as in "persons of the same political stripe". It looked like
kinds
was going to work, but I had doubts when I saw how 35-Across was shaping up. Had to go with it in the end, though.
34d
caf
{Half-___ (coffee order)}. Kept thinking of
demitasse
here, which I assumed would translate as half-cup.
cup
turned out to be only 33% right, so the clue kept me thinking and I eventually worked out half- caf
must mean some compromise between regular and decaf coffee.

I love spending an hour on a puzzle like this one, where everything finally comes out right - no miscues!
I'm afraid I'm rather the opposite of fast solvers such as yourself and actually handicap myself in various ways - too involved to explain here - so that I won't solve it too soon and have it FLY BY but, rather, savour it and solve it IN STYLE.
If I were to come across a competition, I think I should run for my life to a room where I could solve - with handicaps - in quietude. But I'm certainly glad your lot are about, Ross, otherwise I would have nowhere to type superfluous comments!
The long and short of it: Nobody's a loser who finishes one of Quigley's
Friday crosswords without error. PS-The "otter killed in sport" quip was a nebulous allusion to the rest of the verse from your King Lear title of yesterday.

Similar experience of this being an extremely tough Friday, though my actual solving experience was the reverse of yours. I sorted out the top-left relatively quickly, then the bottom-left. Finally remembering
the "Shellac" trick, which I'd been fooled by more than once in the past - I think in the LAT (not sure.) Found the top-left brutally hard - after much staring guessed ARIETTE (after previous OPERETE proved unworkable, not surprisingly). Frustrated couldn't come up with 8D - since it's a popular FITB clue for IMA! Toe Jam is probably the most disgusting clue I've seen in the NYT to date. By miles. BTW, if you aren't aware of it: BEQ gives away three crosswords a week @ www.brendanemmettquigley.com. Expect: colloquial phrases galore, lots of contemporary pop culture, and occasionally a TOEJAM or two!

Daniel, I don't feel a puzzle that takes me an hour is flying by exactly. But I'll try to beat myself up less over this (have I said that before?).

Gareth, thanks for the pointer to BEQ's blog. I'd actually done "We Can Work (It) Out" today and will attempt his self-published efforts regularly to try and get into the mindset. ARIETTE eventually caused me trouble because I started out with more usual variant ARIETTA.

I got 'a la mode' for 26 down, giving 'probes' for 42 across and making the rest of the puzzle unsolvable.

Being from the 'Burbs of Chicago, we get the NYT Crossword puzzle,obviously,a little late in the "Chicago Sun Times". Thank God for the "Englishman" although "toejam" came way too easily for me since my husband is disgusting!
