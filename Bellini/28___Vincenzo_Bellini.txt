NYT Thursday 7/1/10 Clive Probert - Inspect A Rebus
This Thursday
New York Times
crossword is decidedly
rebus -based, and yet the term "rebus" seems to have been adopted in America for puzzles where more than one letter is written in a square. I'm not sure how that peculiar usage came about, but it means I have to be careful when describing something as a "rebus puzzle".
The nature of the theme was clear within the first minute, when I noticed the cross reference from 1-Across to the clue below and immediately thought of
eggs over easy . Then I knew what to expect, although I was also prepared for left-right juxtapositions and those didn't materialize: the constructor went for a streamlined set of
over / under
answers, which is both completely symmetrical in position, and balanced in having
over
opposite
under
everywhere. Neat!
As I was solving, I noted the real danger with this idea: that having two entries relating to a single clue together can leave a gaping hole if you fail to solve the clue. This happened to me in the northeast corner (where the answer is the horribly familiar
London Underground
... isn't that ironic!) and that corner stayed stubbornly empty until I worked my way into from a different direction. (Looking for a tube map, I found the highly amusing one above with anagrams of each station .... have fun working them out!)
The constructor(s) may have erred on the side of caution, as I found most of the cluing to be very straightforward and this resulted in one of the fastest Thursday times I think I've recorded. My nine minute solving time is certainly WAY faster than the 25+ minutes I've experienced in the last couple of weeks.

These
{"___ Eyes" (1969 hit)}.
These Eyes
is a
song by the Canadian rock
band
The Guess Who . The song was co-written by the group's lead guitarist
Randy
Bachman
and lead singer
Burton Cummings
and originally included on the band's 1968
album
Wheatfield Soul . Bachman had the
original piano chords with a title of
These Arms . Cummings
changed the title to
These Eyes
and added the middle eight. The song has been used in the films
Now and Then

gar
{Long-nosed fish}. The
gar
and the

are two crossword pikes I learned from cryptics. The term
gar , or
garpike
for long, is strictly applied to members of the
Lepisosteidae , a family
including seven living species of fish in two genera that inhabit fresh,
brackish, and occasionally marine, waters of eastern North
America, Central America, and the Caribbean
islands. In British English the name
gar
was originally used for a
species of
needlefish ,
Belone belone , found in the North Atlantic,
itself likely named after the Old
English word
gar
meaning "spear".
Belone belone
is now more commonly referred to as the "garpike"
or "gar fish" to avoid confusion with the North American
gars
of the family Lepisosteidae. The
alligator gar
Atractosteus spatula
(shown above) is
the biggest, with specimens recorded up to 3 metres (9.8 ft)
in length.

NYT Wednesday 6/30/10 Kristian House - Sing Quartet
I found this Wednesday
New York Times
crossword remarkably straightforward, taking a minute less than yesterday, despite only knowing one and a half of the artists involved in the theme: I actually own the
Jewel
album that includes
You Were Meant for Me , but haven't listened to it in ages (she was recommended based on some of the other female artists I like, but didn't appeal enough for regular listening).
I'd also heard of
MC Hammer , but didn't know it was acceptable to drop the
MC . He also goes by
Hammertime
apparently. The
Hammer
at 10-Down could have easily been a different artist for all I knew. And in fact, the puzzle can be solved easily enough without knowing any of the singer's names - perhaps a good thing given the obscurity of some.
Very few problems outside the theme: not being au fait with the
Georgetown Hoyas , I had to get to 15-Across via the sometimes tricky down cluing and only then remembered having seen
Hoya
before in at least one puzzle. The other hiccup was leaping on instinct to
NASA
for 19-Across {Major in astronomy?} without really understanding the workings of the clue - it became my favorite clue once I realized what was going on.
Who else might have been pulled into the theme? How about
Usher ?
Chief Usher
won't do, as the first word has to be a verb ... how about {Woo the "Lil Freak" singer} for
Court Usher ? That's the best I can come up with in five minutes or so, and I don't think it trumps any of the examples in the constructor's 10-letter quartet.

Norma
{Singer of the "Casta diva" aria}. The

NYT Tuesday 6/29/10 Peter A. Collins - Monochrome Display
I found this Tuesday
New York Times
crossword puzzle rather tougher than usual. I struggled to get going on the left hand side, failing to see
snow-leopard
early on (maybe it was easier for users of
Mac OS X Snow Leopard ).
Reaching the central row, I could only put in
white
to start with and didn't finally see the theme (and hence add
black and ) till I got to good old {Shamu, for one} at 60-Across,
Shamu
references have gone from whas? to a gimmes since I started solving.
After this, the going was reasonably good in most areas, but I got stuck on a string of answers in the SW corner. Problems may have come down to having
miser
for {Choir support}at 55-Down. I was thinking of
misericords
and imagining a non-existent shortening. I've now seen
riser
in the platform sense a couple of times in crosswords and since I wasn't aware of that meaning at all in the UK, this suggests an apparently technical sense of
riser
is more generally known over here.
However, that isn't the whole story: I also struggled to think of answers for {Makeshift seat at a rodeo} at 32-Across, {Cause of a beach closure, maybe} at 33-Down, {Some track-and-field training} at 53-Across, and {Actress Parker} at 54-Down. I'm going to give myself a break and say these were a bit tough for a Tuesday, especially in that combination.
There's another cultural difference relating to the theme, illustrated by my immediately thinking of
panda
when I saw {Cop cruiser} at 39-Across: Brits have a habit of naming
black and white
things seen on the road after animals of a similar stripe: a
panda car
(originally painted black and white) is a small or medium-sized police car
a
zebra crossing
is a pedestrian crossing without traffic controls
pelican crossings
and
puffin crossings
are types of pedestrian crossings with traffic controls
There's more than that, but I don't want to bore you!

Nena
{"99 Red Balloons" singer, 1984}. I somehow was aware of this song when it became a UK hit in 1984 and I remembered all but the singer's second letter immediately ... that's unusual, so maybe
Nena
struck a chord (pardon the pun) with me.
99 Luftballons
is a protest song by the German
singer
Nena , born
Gabriele Susanne Kerner .
Originally sung in German (as in the clip above), it was later re-recorded in English as
99
Red Balloons .
99 Luftballons
reached #1 in West Germany in 1983. In 1984, the
original German version also peaked at #2 on the American
Billboard
Hot 100
chart and the English-language
version topped the
UK
Singles Chart . When it made the charts in the United States, most US radio DJs
incorrectly assumed that "99 Luftballons" translated to English as "99
Red Balloons" and spoke the number 99 in English, saying "Ninety-nine
Luftballoons."

nacho

processed cheese
mixed with peppers and
other spices is often used in place of freshly shredded cheese in
institutional or large-scale production settings, such as schools, movie
theaters, sports venues, and convenience stores, or wherever using freshly grated cheese
may be logistically prohibitive. Such processed cheese is referred to in
the U.S. as
nacho cheese , and alternatively "queso
cheese" (or just "queso"). Though originally formulated as a cheaper and
more convenient source of cheese to top nachos, this dip
has become popular enough in the U.S. that it is available in some
Mexican-themed restaurants, and at major grocery
stores, in both name-brand ( Frito-Lay ,
Tostitos ,
and
Taco
Bell ) and off-brand versions.
Unlike many European cheeses, "nacho
cheese" bears no geographical indication or other
regulated guarantee of ingredients, process, or quality, beyond the
general

NYT Monday 6/28/10 Joel Fagliano - Gaga Over It
This Monday
New York Times
crossword makes a cracking start to the week: the idea is straightforward (phrases with a tightly constrained pattern), but there are six examples, with two pairs crossing. The really unusual feature of the grid is the plethora of rarer letters (six X's!!!!!!, three J's!!! and a Q!) raising the average Scrabble value per letter to 1.87.
It seemed about average difficulty for the day: one thing that held me up was being a little confused about the pattern of the theme answers. From a few early examples like
la-la Land , I wrongly assumed letters 1, 3 and 5 would be the same - in that way I ended up with
Mama Maid
at 38-Down, which took a few extra seconds to remedy.
One other oddity about the grid is the orientation: the grid could have been flipped around the diagonal to have four theme answers across and two down (rather than the other way round). I'm not clear why this wasn't done ... maybe because
rara avis
is one of the least spicy examples and it was thought preferable to kick off with
la-la land
as the first across thematic.
I thought I'd use
TEA
to see what might have been left on the cutting room floor: a few alternatives in
Mama Bear
(but Papa's there already),
Papa John
and
Mama Cass , but nothing terribly exciting ... the constructor seems to have scraped the barrel fairly dry in his choices. I was amused to discover that there's an Indian car maker called
Tata
and a few of its models fit the puzzle mold including the
Tata Nano , the "cheapest car in the world today". Solving time: 5 mins ( solo, no solving aids )

Liev
{Schreiber who won a Tony for "Glengarry Glen Ross"}.
Glengarry Glen Ross
is a 1982 play written by
David
Mamet . The play shows parts of two days in the lives of four
desperate Chicago
real estate agents
who are prepared to
engage in any number of unethical, illegal acts—from lies and flattery
to
bribery ,
threats, intimidation, and
burglary —to
sell undesirable
real estate
to unwilling prospective buyers. The
play draws partly on Mamet's experiences of life in a Chicago real
estate office, where he worked briefly in the late 1960s. The title of
the play comes from the names of two of the real estate developments
being peddled by the salesmen characters, Glengarry Highlands and Glen
Ross Farms.
Liev Schreiber
won the Tony for his portrayal of Richard Roma in the 2005 Broadway revival, the part played by
Al
Pacino
in the
1992 movie
(trailer above).

veery
{Small American thrush}. Seems a veery obscure reference for a Monday? The
veery ,
Catharus fuscescens , is apparently a small species of
thrush , which is what I'd have taken it for. It is occasionally called
Willow Thrush
or
Wilson's Thrush . This bird has a breezy downward-spiralling flute-like song, often heard
from a low but concealed location. The most common call is a
vee-er ,
which gave this bird its name. Although they breed in Canada and parts of the northern USA, they don't show up in Pennsylvania according to our bird book; veeries migrate to eastern South America.

NPR Puzzle 6/27/10 - Artsy-Fartsy Types
Here's this week's puzzle:
Name a famous English composer with two vowels in his last name.
Interchange the vowels and you'll get the last name of a famous American
writer. Who are these two people? Ross figures this one is super easy, but then who knows?  We thought last week was easy too...  If you know the answer,
submit it to NPR here .
Here's my challenge: to find photos that will amuse those of you who have figured out the answer, while not giving too much away to those of you still working on it.
Here's a clue:
to
Now for a clue to the other name:
That's Estacion de Aranjuez.  You can click on the photo for more information.
Here's another great photo:
Again, click on any photo to see if it helps.  (I wouldn't say that if I thought it would give the game away
too
easily!)
It's time for
P I C K   A   R A N G E
This is where we ask you how many entries you think NPR will get for the puzzle above.  It was a bit surprising last week that there were only 1,300 - 1,400 entries, particularly as the lowest guess we had here was 1,800.  This week's puzzle strikes me as even easier, but it's a holiday weekend coming up, so maybe people are already on holiday and just don't care.
What do you think?  Leave a
comment with your guess for the range of entries NPR will receive;
first come first
served, so read
existing
comments before you guess.
Ross and I guess
last, just
before we
publish the Thursday post.  After the Thursday post is up,
the entries are closed.
Here are the ranges:
Fewer than 100
100 - 200
200 - 300
300 - 400
400 - 500
500 - 600
600 - 700

3,000 - 3,500
3,500 - 4,000
4,000 - 4,500
4,500 - 5,000
More than 5,000
More than 5,000
and
it sets a new record.
*Sorry, Ben -- we changed your name to Pick-a-Range.  Less chance for people to think we had anything to do with the "fat cats on Wall Street."  But you still get credit!

NYT Sunday 6/27/10 Michael J. Doran - Western Weevil
Magdalen and I returned to the normal routine this weekend and solved this Sunday
New York Times
crossword puzzle together over Saturday dinner. Glancing down at the clues to the long answers, it was immediately clear what was going on, but the theme clues were still quite a challenge to work out.
The theme started out strongly at the top, with {Irate} for
film critic
and the like being nicely solid. Further down, the examples moved further away from dictionary entries and that seemed less satisfactory,
eBay patron
from {Ibid.} being our least favorite.
I can see it was fun to come up with this idea as I've had a go at a few more examples myself. How about these:
careless driver
{Ident}
pit worker
{Imine}
commis chef
{iPod}
garbageman
{Irid}
Yeah, not that great I agree. I think that explains why the ones in the puzzle couldn't all be as good as 23-Across.
Apart from the theme, the puzzle seemed on the easy side. There were a couple of trouble spots where I might have got into difficulties on my own: 59a
Sert
and 54d
IED
was a mean crossing - my instinct was to go for an
E
(probably based on having seen
Sert
before), but I couldn't think of what
IED
might expand to by way of confirmation. Luckily Magdalen had heard of
improvised explosive devices
on news programs and could explain.
We also debated over 31d
Darla
and 31a
depend . I'm apparently now considered the household expert on
Our Gang , but couldn't remember
Darla
Hood . Ultimately, the only way to make a word out of 31-Across was to put a D at the front, but maybe {Bank} was still a little tricky given the crossing?
Solving time: 30 mins ( with Magdalen, no solving aids )
Clue of the puzz: 11d

NYT Saturday 6/26/10 - Climb Elk-y Mountain
This Saturday
New York Times
crossword was fairly straightforward, though every section of the grid seemed to have something a little challenging; so I needed to take two (or more) bites of the cherry in a lot of spots.
It's nice to get a reasonable start at the top and I found gimmes with
ovo - (or was it
ovi -) at 2-Down,
yenta
at 8-Down,
adit
at 11-Down,
fiancé
at 9-Across. I fairly soon had the start of the topmost 15-letter answer as
something ... , but couldn't finish it due to mistakes at 10-Down ( invest ) and 14-Down ( eco- ).
So I moved down to the middle stratum (the grid does rather split into three layers) and got going really well there. Again, it was a challenge to finish the 15-letter answer off, as the right hand side was a thicket of obscure references, among which
Whitehorse
and
Neri
at 41-Across and 39-Down.
A revisit to the NW corner with the advantage of knowing the end of 3-Down allowed me to complete that area, but the NE looked stubborn enough that I left it to the end. The bottom layer now got all the attention and I think that turned out the easiest of three. It helped that I knew every answer, even
Elk
(Mountain) as it's our local ski resort, our neighbors work there etc.
After 18 minutes, I had done everything except the gnarly NE corner, but concentrated attention soon led me to look at 10-Down again and I changed
invest
to
infest . When solving I hoped
invest
met {Take over}, but it doesn't really, as it means "to surround with troops or ships so as to prevent escape or entry". It was now easy to finish off 17-Across and get all the downs via 16-Across ...
Fiske
and
Cohn
being unknown to me ... I also couldn't see how
nose
satisfied the enigmatic {A hook might give it a hook}. See below for my explanations of all these.
I enjoyed this puzzle a lot, but thought it a little heavy on the prefixes and suffixes. I count four, all in the down clues and wondered why 55-Down wasn't clued as a regular word. Clues like {Egg head?} and {What may start climactically?} are best in moderation ... too many of that type (and I think one per puzzle is about the max) and they lose any potential to deceive and surprise.

permission for the parody, he didn't know what kind of reaction he'd
get. Jackson allegedly thought it was amusing, and agreed to allow the
parody.

Elk
{Pennsylvania's ___ Mountain (skiing area)}. I could hardly believe this: a clue in the New York Times crossword references something within 20 miles of where we live!! That's a first since I've been solving. I thought it so unlikely that I opted first for
Snö Mountain
(sic: the umlaut is as silly as the one in
Spı n̈ al Tap ), which Magdalen remarked was stupid, as it was only renamed that two years ago.
Anyway,
Elk Mountain
is the largest ski area in the
Endless Mountain
region (our neck of the woods) of
Pennsylvania . The ski area was opened in 1959. It is the highest ski area in
eastern Pennsylvania. Located about 30 miles north of
Scranton, Pennsylvania , it has a
1,000 feet vertical drop. It has 27 trails including 6 greens, 10 blues
and 11 diamonds. It also has a new terrain park located on the east side
of the mountain off of the Delaware Trail. Many trails are serviced by
snow-making facilities. The above picture shows the mountain with the colors typical of a fall round here.

NYT Friday 6/25/10 - The Midsummer Marriage
I thought this Friday
New York Times
crossword a lot of fun, but boy was it a tough one! I certainly wasn't expecting a rebus idea this late in the week, but even when I saw what was up, it didn't help much - that's down to the asymmetry of the IDOs ... how mean is that?
I got off to a good start with the puzzle and really thought I'd have a better time than I ended up with. I immediately got traction on the right hand side at the top and on forays into the bottom half, found clues right up my street: 31-Down had to be
I Puritani , well-known (to me at least) for being the opera performed on the boat at the end of
Fitzcarraldo . 61-Down I knew from the entry in
Chambers Dictionary
for
rosy-fingered , which the lexicographers describe as "Homer's favorite epithet ( rhododaktylos ) of the dawn".
All good stuff, but there wasn't enough of it for sustained progress; I was starting to despair when I finally saw a rebus was involved, on completing the SE corner with 10 minutes on the clock. This finally explained the oddities in the NE, where I had hitherto imagined the constructors had conjured up an alternative spelling/plural for
didgeridoos . Not so: the normal spelling and plural makes complete sense once you see a rebus is involved.
My immediate thought on the IDOs was that the puzzle must be celebrating someone's marriage. I don't normally look at other blogs for evidence about such things before completing my own post, so I can only speculate at this point. Since I'd discovered two IDOs on the right hand side, I wondered if the corresponding questions were on the left hand side. I certainly didn't expect a string of five IDOs in the middle - a neat feature, but ringing vague (wedding) bells ... has it been done before?
Having no symmetry to the rebus squares was a significant hindrance in the SW, which was finally done after 27 minutes. That just left the NW corner, where (up to this point) I had nothing to go on except
SST
for 5-Down. I thought it a little cruel here to have one of the toughest clues (but a great one) for an answer affected by the rebus, viz 3-Down
libidos . 1-Down was nasty too, cluing
Part V
with the very specific {Final section of T. S. Eliot's "The Waste Land"}.
Still, I was pleased to get such a grid done at all, and also felt sure of having a correct solution. I worry less that I missed the half-hour by a whisker. If this puzzle is celebrating a wedding tomorrow (or Saturday) I wish the bride and groom every happiness.
Solving time: 31 mins ( solo, no solving aids )

Video of the Day
6d
Alda
{"Crimes and Misdemeanors" actor, 1989}.
Crimes and Misdemeanors
is one of my favorites of the later
Woody
Allen
movies (was it really 21 years ago?!). It's a black comedy written, directed by and co-starring
Woody
Allen , alongside
Martin
Landau ,
Mia Farrow ,
Anjelica Huston ,
Jerry
Orbach ,
Alan Alda ,
Sam
Waterston
and
Joanna Gleason .
Alda
plays a wonderful comic character - the pompous television producer Lester who hires his increasingly reluctant brother-in-law Cliff (Woody Allen) to make a documentary about him. In short, typical Woody Allen fare ... great stuff.
The Doctor is
IN
14a
alias
{O. Henry, e.g.}.
O. Henry 's real name was
William Sydney Porter .

{Only actor to win a comedy and drama Emmy for the same
character}.
Ed Asner
achieved this for his portrayal of
Lou Grant .
36a
Orr
{Yossarian's tentmate in "Catch-22"}. All the other crossword
Orr 's seem to be sports stars.
57a

Ringo Starr .

Atropos , one of the three
Moirae , cuts the thread of life when a mortal dies.
13d

{Freelance output: Abbr.}.
mss.

27d
Is ido ra
{George Sand title
heroine}. Too obscure for Wikipedia, you can nevertheless read
the complete Fren c h text of

stac.
=

38d
silent R
{February 4th, to some?}. The fourth letter of "February" is not pronounced in some accents.
Image of the Day
25a
okapis
{Inhabitants of central African rain forests}. I've a feeling
okapis
have been featured as the
Image of the Day
before, but no harm in this reminder ... The
okapi
( Okapia johnstoni ) is a
giraffid
artiodactyl
mammal
native to the
Ituri Rainforest , located in the northeast
of the
Democratic Republic of the
Congo , in central Africa. Although the okapi bears striped markings
reminiscent of the
zebra , it is most closely related to the
giraffe .
Unknown to Europeans until 1901, today there are approximately
10,000–20,000 in the wild and only 40 different worldwide institutions
display them.
The body shape is similar to that of the giraffe, except that okapis
have much shorter necks. Both species have very long (approximately
30 centimetres (12 in), flexible, blue tongues that they use to strip
leaves and buds from trees. The tongue of the okapi is long enough for the animal to wash its
eyelids and clean its ears (inside and out). 35 to 46 centimeters (14 to
18 in) in length, the sticky tongue is pointed and bluish gray in
color like the giraffe's.
