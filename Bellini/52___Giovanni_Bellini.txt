What to say about La Spezia?
It is home to Italy's largest
navel base and it is a major
port.  Industrialized
suburbs spread in all directions
from the harbour, and the
working class districts are
rough and ready.  The
center of town is a busy
commercial and business center
where people are in much more of
a distracted hurry than just
about anywhere else but
Genoa
on the
Ligurian coast.  Moreover,
the architecture of the
buildings along the main streets
running parallel and
perpendicular to the harbour,
for the most part is drab and
uninspired - a  modern
day replacement for the grander,
older
buildings that were flattened by
Allied bombing during World War
2.
La Spezia, then, is not, at
first glance, a "tourist town" -
and does not pretend to be.
And yet...it's amiable location
on the
Golfo dei Poeti
(Bay of Poets), and a number of
important monuments, museums and
buildings are very much worth
seeing.  Also, you could do
a lot worse finding a good base
from which to explore the
Cinque Terre ,
Portovenere , and the stretch
of coast running south to
Lerici
and beyond.
Ferries for
Corsica
and
Sardinia , as well as for various
ports of call along the
Cinque
Terre
also depart regularly from
La Spezia (the terminals are at
Porto Mercantile
in the central
part of the harbour).
The city sits on the litoral
between the inland hills and the
sea.  Its protected
position and good harbour made
it a prized posession of
the
Etruscans
who once ruled the area (7th
century BC) and of the
Romans
who supplanted them.  Later
in the Middle Ages, the town was
dominated by Genoa, a powerful
maritime Republic, and the
Genoese were the first to
fortify the city and the areas
north and south.  Their
castles and forts dot the coast
and inland hills around the
city.
La Spezia's role as a major
naval base - and the reason for
the Allied's destructive interest
during the
Second World War was initiated
by
Napoleon
during his brief
reign over northern Italy in the
19th century.  The base -
known as the Arsenale - occupies
a vast stretch of land to at the
western end of the city.
The base is not publicly
accessible, but just outside its
main gates is the
Museo Tecnico Navale
where
those with an interest in
maritime history and maritime
wars can become pleasantly lost in the
exhibits.
Not far, also in the city's
western reaches, a short way
from
Piazza Chiodo , there
are lovely public gardens.
At the eastern end, opposite the
P orto Mercantile
is the
City's Cathedral -
Cattedrale
Cristo Re
- built in the
1970s.  Featuring a large,
white cylindrical tower above a
large rectangular base, the
Cathedral sits behind a large
campo - Piazza Europa, which
gives it the space in which its
massiveness against its hilly
backdrop can be
appreciated...but at the expense
of the kind of charm more
ancient cathedrals in other
Italian cities can claim.
But...the Duomo of
Santa
Maria Assunta
on the P iazza
Beverini
(on
Via Prione )
has that more traditional
aspect, and a vivacious,
terracotta work by
Andrea della Robbia .
From the Duomo, you could find
your way down to the harbour and
enjoy a stroll along the
promenade that runs parallel to
Viale Mazzini , or you could head
toward the back of the Duomo
to
Piazza Cavour , which
is one of the main gathering
places of the city.  A
hundred or so meters to the east
is La Spezia's most important
civic enterprise, the
Museo Amedeo Lia
- an art
gallery and museum that was
opened in 1996 after a private
collector, the gallery's
namesake, Amedeo Lia, donated over
1000 works to the city.
The gallery is housed in a 17th
century Franciscan convent that
has been superbly renovated. The
gallery's collection includes
the most important medieval and
Renaissance art in all of
Luguria Region.  There are
works here by
Titian ,
Bellini ,
Pontormo
and others, all of
which are highly prized, but the
supreme object is a terracotta
Addolorata - Madonna grieving -
by
Benedetto da Maiano .
La Spezia does not want for good
hotels, restaurants, cafes,
trattorias and other
attractions...places and things
that you will discover when you
begin your explorations.
So, despite the commercial,
industrial and military aspects
of the city, which conceal or
dominate its more subtle and
refined attributes, La Spezia is
definetly worth a visit.
As always, we recommend coming
in the off-season period, when
you may not have the whole city
to yourself, but when you will
most certainly have more elbow
room.
