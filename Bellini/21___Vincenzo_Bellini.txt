Marni Nixon
Marni Nixon
(born February 22, 1930) is an American
soprano
renowned for being a
playback singer
for featured actresses in well known
movie musicals . This has earned her the
sobriquet
“The Ghostess with the Mostess”, and also “The Voice of Hollywood”. [1]

symphony orchestras
around the world and in
operas
and
musicals

became part of the newly formed
Los Angeles
Concert Youth Chorus – whose
other members included a 13-year-old
Marilyn Horne

(1955)
The singing voice for
Deborah Kerr
in the film of
Rodgers & Hammerstein ‘s
The King and I
(1956) (in one song — “Shall I tell you what I think of you?” — Kerr’s
and Nixon’s voices were skillfully intertwined; this was deleted from
the film before its release, but it was retained on the soundtrack cast
recording; Deborah Kerr also provides the spoken words at the beginning
of “Getting to know you”).
Dubbing Deborah Kerr’s singing voice again in
An Affair to Remember , one year after dubbing her in
The King and I
The singing voice for
Natalie Wood
as Maria in
West Side Story
(1961). Nixon also sang some parts of the score of Anita played by

Betty Wand
and Moreno herself. In parts of the quintet setting of the song
“Tonight”, she sings both Maria and Anita’s lines, according to her
autobiography.
The singing voice for
Audrey Hepburn
as Eliza in
My Fair Lady
(1964). In the finished film, the only remaining singing vocals by
Audrey Hepburn
herself is a section of the song Just You Wait, one line in the song
I Could Have Danced All Night , “Sleep, sleep, I couldn’t sleep tonight”, and Just You Wait (reprise).
Except for
Dementia ,
in which she received on-screen credit as “Featured Voice”, the credits
for her many dubbing roles did not appear on the titles of any of the
films, and Nixon did not begin to be fully credited or widely
acknowledged until the movies’ subsequent release on VHS decades later.
The Sound of Music
Nixon appeared on screen singing for herself as Sister Sophia in the film
The Sound of Music , cast in the role by director
Robert Wise .
In the DVD commentary to the film, he comments that audiences were
finally able to see the woman whose voice they knew so well.
When Hollywood musicals gave her less work, she started to perform on stage, as Eliza Doolittle in
My Fair Lady
and as Fraulein Schneider in
Cabaret . In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she hosted a children’s television show in
Seattle
on
KOMO-TV
channel 4 called
Boomerang . In 2001, she replaced
Joan Roberts
as Heidi Schiller in the
Broadway
revival
of
Stephen Sondheim ‘s
Follies . In 2003, she returned to Broadway as a replacement in role of Guido’s mother in the revival of
Nine .
In the 1998
Disney
film
Mulan , Nixon sang the role of Grandmother Fa.
In March 2007 she was involved in a concert version of
My Fair Lady , in which she performed the non-singing role of Mrs. Higgins, Professor Higgins’s mother.
On June 18, 2007, Marni joined a group of volunteers who were inspired by the documentary film “Tocar y Luchar.” [1]
They are trying to bring more music education to all children. [2]
Nixon performed on the U.S. National Tour of
Cameron Mackintosh ‘s U.K. revival of
My Fair Lady
through July 2008, replacing
Sally Ann Howes
in the role of Mrs. Higgins.
Under her own name, she has also recorded songs by
Jerome Kern ,
George Gershwin ,
Arnold Schönberg ,
Charles Ives , and
Anton Webern .
One of her three husbands,
Ernest Gold , composed the theme song to the movie
Exodus . They had three children together, one of whom is the singer and songwriter
Andrew Gold
(“Lonely Boy” and “Thank You For Being a Friend”).

Gordon Jenkins
Gordon Hill Jenkins
(May 12, 1910 – May 1, 1984) was an
American arranger ,
composer and pianist who was an influential figure in popular music in
the 1940s and 1950s, renowned for his lush string arrangements. Jenkins
worked with the
Andrews Sisters ,
Johnny Cash ,
The Weavers ,
Frank Sinatra ,
Louis Armstrong ,
Judy Garland ,
Nat King Cole ,
Billie Holiday , and
Ella Fitzgerald , among other singers. [1]
Jenkins was born in
Webster Groves, Missouri . He began his career doing arrangements for a
St. Louis
radio station. [ specify ]
He was then hired by
Isham Jones ,
the director of a dance band known for its ensemble playing, and this
gave Jenkins the opportunity to develop his skills in melodic scoring.
He also conducted
The Show Is On
on
Broadway .
Jenkins married high school sweetheart Nancy Harkey in 1931 and had
three children: Gordon Jr., Susan, and Page. In 1946, he divorced Harkey
and married Beverly Mahr, one of the singers in his band. They had a
son, Bruce.
“Goodnight Irene” The Weavers, with the
Gordon Jenkins
Orchestra
After the Jones band broke up in 1936, Jenkins worked as a freelance
arranger and songwriter, contributing to sessions by Isham Jones,
Paul Whiteman ,
Benny Goodman ,
Andre Kostelanetz ,
Lennie Hayton , and others. In 1938, Jenkins moved to
Hollywood
and worked for
Paramount Pictures
and
NBC , and then became
Dick Haymes ‘ arranger for four years. In 1944, Jenkins had a hit song with “San Fernando Valley”.
Sinatra singing, “The Night We Called It A Day”
In 1945, Jenkins joined
Decca Records . In 1947, he had his first million-seller with “ Maybe You’ll Be There ” featuring vocalist
Charles LaVere
and in 1949 had a huge hit with
Victor Young ‘s film theme “ My Foolish Heart “, which was also a success for
Billy Eckstine . At the same time, he regularly arranged for and conducted the orchestra for various Decca artists, including Dick Haymes (“ Little White Lies “, 1947), Ella Fitzgerald (“ Happy Talk “, 1949, “ Black Coffee “, 1949, “ Baby “, 1954),
Patty Andrews
of the Andrews Sisters (“ I Can Dream, Can’t I “, 1949) and Louis Armstrong (“ Blueberry Hill “, 1949 and “ When It’s Sleepy Time Down South “, 1951).
The liner notes to
Verve Records ‘ 2001 reissue of one of Jenkins’ albums with Armstrong,
Satchmo In Style , quote Decca’s onetime A & R Director,
Milt Gabler ,
saying that Jenkins “stood up on his little podium so that all the
performers could see him conduct. But before he gave a
downbeat, Gordon
made a speech about how much he loved Louis and how this was the
greatest moment in his life. And then he cried.”
Dinah Washington sings, “Goodbye” by Gordon Jenkins
Benny Goodman performing, “Goodbye” It was a huge hit recording for the Goodman Orchestra.
During this time, Jenkins also began recording and performing under
his own name. One of his
enduring works while at Decca was a pair of
Broadway-style musical vignettes, “ Manhattan Tower ”
and “California” which saw release several times (78s, 45s, and LP) in
the ’40s and ’50s. The two were paired on a very early Decca LP in
1949), and Jenkins was given the Key to New York City by its mayor when
Jenkins’s orchestra performed the 16-minute suite on the
Ed Sullivan
show in the early ’50s. In 1956, he
expanded “Manhattan Tower”
to almost three times its length, released it (this time on
Capitol Records ),
and performed it on an hour-long television show. (Both versions of
“Manhattan Tower” are currently available on CD.) His “Seven Dreams”
included a sequence which was the source for
Johnny Cash ‘s immensely popular recording, “ Folsom Prison Blues “. His final long-form work was
The Future , which comprised the entire third disk of
Frank Sinatra ‘s 1980 Grammy-nominated
Trilogy
album. Although the piece was savaged by critics, Sinatra reportedly
loved the semi-biographical work and felt that Jenkins was treated
unfairly by the media.
“Caravan”
Jenkins headlined New York’s Capitol Theater between 1949 and 1951 and the Paramount Theater in 1952. He appeared in
Las Vegas
in 1953 and many times thereafter. He worked for NBC as a TV producer from 1955 to 1957, and performed at the
Hollywood Bowl
in 1964. By 1949, Jenkins was musical director at Decca, and he signed — despite resistance from Decca’s management —
the Weavers , a
Greenwich Village
folk ensemble that included
Pete Seeger
among its members. The combination of the Weavers’
folk music
with Jenkins’ orchestral arrangements became immensely popular, to the
surprise of everyone involved. Their most notable collaboration was a
version of
Leadbelly ‘s “ Goodnight Irene ” (1950) backed by Jenkins’ adaptation of the Israeli folk song, “ Tzena, Tzena, Tzena “. Other notable songs they recorded together are “ The Roving Kind “, “ On Top of Old Smoky ” (1951), and “ Wimoweh ” (1952).
“Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps” 1949
Jenkins later moved to
Capitol Records
where he worked with
Frank Sinatra , notably on the albums
Where Are You?
(1957) and
No One Cares
(1959), and Nat King Cole, with whom he had his greatest successes;
Jenkins was responsible for the lush arrangements on the 1957 album
Love Is the Thing
(Capitol’s first stereo release, which included “ When I Fall in Love “, one of Cole’s best-known recordings), as well as the albums
The Very Thought of You
(1958) and
Where Did Everyone Go?
(1963). Jenkins also wrote the music and lyrics for Judy Garland’s 1959 album
The Letter
which also featured vocalist Charles LaVere, and conducted several of Garland’s London concerts in the early 1960s.
“Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered”
Whilst most of Jenkins’ arrangements at Capitol were in his
distinctive string-laden style, he continued to demonstrate more
versatility when required, particularly on albums such as
A Jolly Christmas From Frank Sinatra
(1957), which opens with a swinging version of
Jingle Bells , and Nat King Cole’s album of spirituals,
Every Time I Feel The Spirit
(1960), which includes several tracks with a pronounced
beat that might almost be described as
rock . He also produced a diverse set of charts for his critically-acclaimed 1960 album
Gordon Jenkins Presents
Marshall Royal , a jazz-pop crossover project with Count Basie’s alto saxophonist which included both strings and a swinging rhythm section.
However, as
rock and roll
gained ascendancy in the 1960s, Jenkins’ lush string arrangements fell
out of favour and he worked only sporadically, though Sinatra, who had
left Capitol to start his own label,
Reprise Records , continued to call upon the arranger’s services at various intervals over the next two decades, on albums such as
All Alone
(1962), the critically-acclaimed
September of My Years
(1965), for which Jenkins won a
Grammy , Sinatra’s 1973 comeback album,
Ol’ Blue Eyes Is Back
and
She Shot Me Down
(1981) – regarded by many “Sinatraphiles” as the singer’s last great work. Jenkins also worked with
Harry Nilsson , arranging and conducting
A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night
(1973), an album of jazz standards. The Nilsson sessions, with Jenkins
conducting, were recorded on video and later broadcast as a television
special by the
BBC .
“Maybe You’ll Be There”
Although best known as an arranger, Jenkins also wrote well-known several songs including “ P.S. I Love You “, “ Goodbye ” ( Benny Goodman ‘s sign-off tune), “Blue Prelude”, “This Is All I Ask”, and “ When a Woman Loves a Man “. Jenkins also composed the “Future” suite for Sinatra’s 1980
concept album Trilogy: Past Present Future .
enkins died in
Malibu, California
in 1984 at age 73 of
Lou Gehrig’s disease .
In November 2005, Gordon’s son Bruce (a sports columnist for the
San Francisco Chronicle ) published a
biography
of his father titled
Goodbye: In Search of Gordon Jenkins .
Other living relatives include sons Page and Gordon Jr., daughter
Susan, nieces Phoebe Barnum and Leslie Mason, and grandson “Pogi” Tony.

Joan Sutherland
Dame Joan Alston Sutherland ,
OM ,
AC ,
DBE
(7 November 1926 – 10 October 2010 [1] ) was an Australian
dramatic coloratura
soprano
noted for her contribution in the renaissance of the
bel canto
repertoire from the late 1950s through to the 1980s. She died in Switzerland on 10th October 2010.
One of the most remarkable female opera singers of the 20th century, she was dubbed
La Stupenda
by a
La Fenice
audience in 1960 after a performance as
Alcina . She possessed a voice of beauty and power, combining extraordinary agility, accurate intonation, “pin point
staccatos , [2]
a splendid
trill
and a tremendous upper register, although music critics often complained about the imprecision of her diction. Her friend
Luciano Pavarotti
once called Sutherland the “ Voice of the Century “, while
Montserrat Caballé
described the
Australian’s
voice as being like “heaven”. Her highest note was a high F sharp in
altissimo . [3]
The Great Joan Sutherland
Joan Sutherland was born in
Sydney , Australia, of Scots parents, where she attended
St Catherine’s School . As a child, she listened to and copied the singing exercises of her mother, a
mezzo-soprano
who had studied but never considered making a career. Sutherland was 18
when she started studying voice seriously with John and Aida Dickens.
She made her concert debut in Sydney, as Dido in
Purcell ‘s
Dido and Aeneas , in 1947. In 1951, she made her stage debut in
Eugene Goossens ‘s
Judith .
In 1951, after winning Australia’s most important competition, the Sun
Aria, she went to London to further her studies at the Opera School of
the
Royal College of Music
with
Clive Carey . She was engaged by the
Royal Opera House ,
Covent Garden , as a utility soprano, and made her debut there on 28 October 1952, as the First Lady in
The Magic Flute , followed in November by a few performances as Clotilde in
Vincenzo Bellini ‘s
Norma , with
Maria Callas
as Norma.
From Anna Bolena 1984
During her early career, she was training to be a
Wagnerian
dramatic soprano, following the steps
of
Kirsten Flagstad , whom she greatly admired. In December 1952, she sang her first leading role at the Royal Opera House, Amelia in
Un ballo in maschera . Other roles included Agathe in
Der Freischütz , the Countess in
The Marriage of Figaro , Desdemona in
Otello , Gilda in
Rigoletto , Eva in
Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg , and Pamina in
The Magic Flute . In 1953, she sang in
Benjamin Britten ‘s
Gloriana
a few months after its world premiere, and created the role of Jennifer in
Michael Tippett ‘s
The Midsummer Marriage , on 27 January 1955.
Sutherland married Australian conductor and pianist,
Richard Bonynge , on 16 October 1954. They had a son, Adam, born in 1956. Bonynge gradually convinced her that Wagner might not be her
Fach
after all, since she had such great ease with high notes and
coloratura , and that she should perhaps explore the
bel canto
repertory.
Lucia di Lammermoor 1972
In 1957, she appeared in
Handel ‘s
Alcina
with the Handel Opera Society, and in
Donizetti ‘s
Emilia di Liverpool ,
in which performances her bel canto potential was clearly demonstrated,
vindicating her husband’s judgement. The following year she sang Donna
Anna in
Don Giovanni
in Vancouver.
Caro Nome Rigoletto 1960
In 1958, at the Royal Opera House, she “stopped the show” with “Let the Bright Seraphim” from Handel’s
Samson ,
an exceedingly difficult and demanding aria. The crowd was on its feet
for ten minutes and the show came to a stop. It was one of the most
extraordinary ovations that house had seen. Her future as a diva at the
Royal Opera House seemed assured afterwards.
In 1959, she was invited to sing
Lucia di Lammermoor
at the
Royal Opera House
in a production conducted by
Tullio Serafin
and staged by
Franco Zeffirelli . The role of Edgardo was sung by her fellow Australian
Kenneth Neate , who had replaced the scheduled tenor at short notice. [4]
It was a breakthrough for Sutherland’s career, and, upon the completion
of the famous Mad Scene, she had become a star. In 1960, she recorded
the album
The Art of the Prima Donna , which remains today one of the most recommended opera albums ever recorded: the double LP set won the
Grammy Award
for Best Classical Performance — Vocal Soloist in 1962. The album, a
collection consisting mainly of coloratura arias, provides an
opportunity to listen to the young Sutherland at the beginning of her
international career. It displays her seemingly effortless coloratura
ability, high notes and opulent tones, as well as her exemplary trill,
by which she is identified and for which she is widely admired.
With Pavaratti
By the beginning of the 1960s, Sutherland had already established a
reputation as a diva with a voice out of the ordinary. She sang Lucia to
great acclaim in
Paris
in 1960 and, in 1961, at
La Scala
and the
Metropolitan Opera . Also in 1960, she sang a superb Alcina at
La Fenice ,
Venice , where she was nicknamed
La Stupenda
(“The Stunning One”). Sutherland would soon be praised as
La Stupenda
in newspapers around the world. Later that year (1960), Sutherland sang
Alcina at the Dallas Opera, with which she made her US debut.
Her Metropolitan Opera debut took place on 26 November 1961, when she sang
Lucia .
After a total of 217 performances in a number of different operas, her
last appearance there was on 19 December 1987, when she sang in
Il trovatore .
During 1978–82 period her relationship with the Met severely
deteriorated when Sutherland had to decline the role of Constanze in
Mozart ‘s
Die Entführung aus dem Serail ,
more than a year before the rehearsals were scheduled to start. The
opera house management then declined to stage the operetta
The Merry Widow
especially for her, as requested; subsequently, she did not perform at
the Met during that time at all, even though a production of
Rossini ‘s
Semiramide
had also been planned, but later she returned there to sing in other operas. [5]
Tosca
During the 1960s, Sutherland had added the greatest heroines of
bel canto
(“beautiful singing”) to her repertoire: Violetta in
Verdi ‘s
La traviata , Amina in
Bellini ‘s
La sonnambula
and Elvira in Bellini’s
I puritani
in 1960; the title role in Bellini’s
Beatrice di Tenda
in 1961; Marguerite de Valois in
Meyerbeer ‘s
Les Huguenots
and the title role in Rossini’s
Semiramide
in 1962; Norma in Bellini’s
Norma
and Cleopatra in
Handel ‘s
Giulio Cesare
in 1963. In 1966 she added Marie in
Donizetti ‘s
La fille du régiment , which became one of her most adored roles, because of her perfect
coloratura
and lively, funny interpretation.
In 1965, Sutherland toured Australia with the Sutherland-Williamson Opera Company. Accompanying her was a young tenor named
Luciano Pavarotti , and the tour proved to be a major milestone in Pavarotti’s career. Every performance featuring Sutherland sold out.
Singing Dvorak, “Songs My Mother Taught Me”
During the 1970s, Sutherland strove to improve her diction, which had
often been criticised, and increase the expressiveness of her
interpretations. She continued to add dramatic bel canto roles to her
repertoire, such as Donizetti’s
Maria Stuarda
and
Lucrezia Borgia , as well as
Massenet ‘s extremely difficult
Esclarmonde , a role that few sopranos attempt. She recorded a very successful
Turandot
in 1972 under the baton of
Zubin Mehta , though she never performed that role on stage.
Sutherland’s early recordings show her to be possessed of a
crystal-clear voice and excellent
diction. However, by the early 1960s
her voice lost some of this clarity in the middle register, and she
often came under fire for having unclear diction. Some have attributed
this to sinus surgery; however, her major sinus surgery was done in
1959, immediately after her breakthrough
Lucia
at Covent Garden. [6]
In fact, her first commercial recording of the first and final scene of
Lucia
reveals her voice and diction to be just as clear as prior to the sinus
procedure. Her husband Richard Bonynge stated in an interview that her
“mushy diction” occurred while striving to achieve perfect legato.
According to him, it is because she earlier had a very Germanic
“un-legato” way of singing. [7]
She clearly took the criticism to heart, as, within a few years, her
diction improved markedly and she continued to amaze and thrill
audiences throughout the world.
In the late 1970s, Sutherland’s voice started to decline and her
vibrato loosened to an intrusive extent. However, thanks to her vocal
agility and solid technique, she continued singing the most difficult
roles amazingly well. During the 1980s, she added
Anna Bolena , Amalia in
I masnadieri
and
Adriana Lecouvreur
to her repertoire, and repeated
Esclarmonde
at the
Royal Opera House
performances in November and December 1983. Her last performance was as Marguerite de Valois ( Les Huguenots ) at the
Sydney Opera House
in 1990, at the age of 63, where she sang
Home Sweet Home
for her encore. Her last public appearance, however, took place in a gala performance of
Die Fledermaus
on New Year’s Eve, 1990, at Covent Garden, where she was accompanied by her colleagues Luciano Pavarotti and the mezzo-soprano
Marilyn Horne .
Oh Si Les Fleurs Avaient Des Yeux
According to her own words, given in an interview with
The Guardian
newspaper in 2002 [8] , her biggest achievement was to sing the title role in
Esclarmonde . She considered those performances and recordings her best.
After retirement, Sutherland made relatively few public appearances, preferring a quiet life at her home in
Switzerland . One exception was her 1994 address at a lunch organised by
Australians for Constitutional Monarchy .
In that address, she complained about having to be interviewed by a
clerk of Chinese or Indian background when applying to renew her
Australian passport. Her comments caused controversy among some sections
of the community at the time. [9] [10]
Sutherland had a leading role as Mother Rudd in the 1995
comedy film
Dad and Dave: On Our Selection
opposite
Leo McKern
and
Geoffrey Rush . [11]
In 1997 she published an autobiography,
The Autobiography of Joan Sutherland: A Prima Donna’s Progress . While it received generally scathing reviews for its literary merits, [12]
it does contain a complete list of all her performances, with full cast lists.
In 2002 she appeared at a dinner in London to accept the
Royal Philharmonic Society ‘s gold medal, and gave an interview to
The Guardian
in which she lamented the lack of technique in young opera singers, and the dearth of good teachers. [8]
By now, no longer giving master classes herself, she was asked why this
was by Italian journalists in May 2007, replying: “Because I’m 80 years
old and I really don’t want to have anything to do with opera any more,
although I do sit on the juries of singing competitions.” [13]
The
Cardiff Singer of the World
competition was the one that Sutherland was most closely associated
with after her retirement. She began her regular involvement with the
event in 1993, serving on the jury five consecutive times and later, in
2003, became its patron. [14]
With Marilyn Horne
On 3 July 2008, she fell and broke both of her legs while gardening at her home in Switzerland. [15]
She completely recovered and attended the luncheon hosted by Her
Majesty The Queen in honour of Members of the Order of Merit at
Buckingham Palace in 2009. She died on 10 October 2010 at her home near Geneva, in Switzerland. [1]
She had been in poor health since a fall. Her death was announced by
her family on 11 October and they plan to hold a small funeral. [16] [1]
From Alcina 1959
During her career and after, Sutherland received many honours and awards.
In 1961, she was made a Commander of the
Order of the British Empire
(CBE). [17]
That year she was also named the
Australian of the Year .
In the Queen’s Birthday Honours of 9 June 1975, she was in the first group of people to be named Companions of the
Order of Australia
(AC) (the order had been created only in February 1975). [18]
She was elevated within the Order of the British Empire from
Commander to Dame Commander (DBE) in the New Year’s Honours of 1979. [19]
On 29 November 1991, the
Queen
bestowed on Dame Joan the
Order of Merit
(OM). [20]
In January 2004 she received the
Australia Post
Australian Legends Award
which honours Australians who have contributed to the Australian
identity and culture. Two stamps featuring Joan Sutherland were issued
on
Australia Day
2004 to mark the award. Later in 2004, she received a
Kennedy Center Honor
for her outstanding achievement throughout her career.
Sutherland House and the Dame Joan Sutherland Centre, both at
St Catherine’s School, Sydney , and
The Joan Sutherland Performing Arts Centre
(JSPAC),
Penrith , are all named in her honour. [21]

Jane Powell
Jane Powell
(born
Suzanne Lorraine Burce ; April 1, 1929) is an American singer, dancer and actress.
After rising to fame as a singer in her home state of
Oregon , Powell was signed to
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
while still in her teens. Once there, the studio utilized her vocal,
dancing and acting talents, casting her in such musicals as
Royal Wedding , with
Fred Astaire ,
A Date with Judy , with friend
Elizabeth Taylor , and
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers , with
Howard Keel . In the late 1950s, her film career slowed, only to be replaced with a busy theater and television career.
As of 2010, Powell lives with her fifth husband, former child star
Dickie Moore , in New York City and Connecticut, and is still active in television and theater.
The only child born to Paul E. Burce (a
Wonder Bread
employee) and Eileen Baker Burce (a housewife) in
Portland, Oregon ,
Powell began dance lessons at the age of two. Powell was born a
brunette, with straight hair. In an attempt to liken her appearance to
Shirley Temple ,
Powell’s mother took her to get her first permanent the same year she
began dance lessons. It wasn’t until she starred in Technicolor pictures
that she became a blonde. [1]
At five, she appeared on the children’s radio program
Stars of Tomorrow .
She also took dance lessons with Agnes Peters, and it was there that
the Burce family met Scotty Weston, a talent scout and dance instructor.
He convinced the family to move to Oakland for Powell to take dance
lessons, in hopes of her being discovered. However, Weston’s lessons
were held in a large, dark, damp ballroom packed full of other starlet
hopefuls, and after three months of living in a hotel room and eating
meals cooked on a hot plate, the family moved back to Portland. Paul
Burce had quit his job of 14 years to move to Oakland, and was unable to
get it back when they returned. The family moved into an apartment
building owned by friends, and Paul soon became the manager after the
friends left. While there, and while helping her father take the garbage
out, Powell would sing. Tenants insisted that Powell should take
lessons, and after saving their money, began singing lessons for her. [2]
At 12, Powell had her career taken over by a local promoter, Carl
Werner, who helped her get selected as the Oregon Victory Girl. She
traveled around the state for two years, singing and selling victory
bonds. It was during this time that she first met
Lana Turner .
Powell presented her with flowers and sang for her. Years later, when
they met again at MGM, Turner did not remember her. According to Powell,
even after meeting her many times, Turner never remembered who she was. [2]
During her time as the Oregon Victory Girl, Powell had two weekly
radio shows. During the first, she sang with an organ accompaniment, and
during the second, she sang with an orchestra and other performers. [2]
She had attended Beaumont Grade School in Portland and
Grant High School (Portland, Oregon) .
During the summer of 1943, Paul and Eileen Burce took their daughter on vacation to
Hollywood .
There, she appeared on
Janet Gaynor ‘s radio show
Hollywood Showcase: Stars over Hollywood . [3]
The show was a talent competition, and among the other contestants were
Kathie Lee Gifford ‘s mother, Joan Epstein. Powell won the competition, and soon auditioned with
Louis B. Mayer
at
MGM
as well as
David O. Selznick . Without even taking a screen test, Powell was then signed to a seven-year contract with MGM. [4] [5]
Within two months, Powell had been loaned out to
United Artists
for her first film,
Song of the Open Road . [6]
“How Could You Believe Me?”
From Royal Wedding
Powell’s character in
Song of the Open Road
was named Jane Powell, and it was from this that her stage name was taken. [7]
In 1945, Powell sang
Because
at the wedding of
Esther Williams
and
Ben Gage . [8]
Within her first few years at MGM, Powell made six films, appeared on
radio programs, performed in theatre productions (including
The Student Prince ) [9]
and even sang at the inauguration ball for President
Harry S. Truman
on January 20, 1949. When not making films, Powell traveled to theaters
around the country doing a vaudeville act, which she hated.
[10]
“Love Is Where You Find It”
Powell’s second film was
Delightfully Dangerous , which Powell called the “worst movie she’s ever made.” [2]
During her third film,
Holiday in Mexico , Powell met her future friend,
Roddy McDowall .
Holiday in Mexico
was her first Technicolor film; her first two films had been black and white.
“Jitterbug Whodunit” with Judy Garland and Ray Bolger
Powell’s charm and spunk made her stand out in her follow-up vehicle
Three Daring Daughters , originally titled
The Birds and the Bees , [11]
in which she co-starred with
Jeanette MacDonald , who took the young performer under her wing. The film proved another hit and she was given top billing in a string of
Joe Pasternak -produced musicals including
A Date with Judy
(1948) with schoolmate
Elizabeth Taylor , and
Nancy Goes to Rio
(1950) with
Ann Sothern .
Powell worked side by side with
Fred Astaire
in
Royal Wedding
(1951), when she was brought in to replace
June Allyson , who had become pregnant, and then
Judy Garland , who dropped out due to illness. According to film historian
Robert Osborne ,
in a six-minute scene in the movie, Powell and Astaire match witty
banter, sing and dance in a performance that showcased the actress’s
energy and talent. “We can also see her comic ability, in that number”,
Osborne said. “She’s hilarious — chewing gum, swinging her hips, and
acting like a ‘tough broad’. It’s too bad MGM didn’t capitalize more on
her comedic side.” [5]
Her best-known film is probably
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers
(1954), opposite
Howard Keel , which gave her the opportunity to play a more mature character than previous films. Her other films include:
Rich, Young and Pretty
(1951),
Small Town Girl
(1953),
Three Sailors and a Girl
(1953),
Athena
(1954),
Deep in My Heart
(1954),
Hit the Deck
(1955), and
The Girl Most Likely
(1957). In 1956 Powell recorded a song, “True Love”, that rose to 15 on
the Billboard charts and 107 on the pop charts for that year, according
to the
Joel Whitburn
compilation. This was her only single to make the charts.
“Wonder Why” with Vic Dimone
In 1956, Powell performed the song “I’ll Never Stop Loving You” at the
28th Academy Awards . [12]
Her roles include the touring productions of
Unsinkable Molly Brown ,
Most Happy Fella ,
The Boy Friend ,
Brigadoon ,
The Sound of Music ,
Oklahoma! ,
My Fair Lady ,
Carousel ,
Meet Me in St. Louis ,
Peter Pan ,
The Girl Next Door and How She Grew , and
Irene , in which she made her
Broadway
debut, following
Debbie Reynolds
in the title role. [13]
She and
Howard Keel
also appeared on stage together in a revival of
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers ,
I Do! I Do! [13] [14]
and
South Pacific [13]
Powell also toured in 1964 in a musical review entitled, “Just 20
Plus Me!” It was done to a recorded track and featured Powell with 20
handsome “chorus boys”. Asked after the performance if the production
was going to be made available on a commercial recording, she said
simply, “No.”
“Peanut Vendor” with Xaviar Cugat
In the early 1980s she toured in the comedies
Same time next year ,
Marriage-go-round
and
Chapter Two .

Debbie Reynolds
Debbie Reynolds
(born April 1, 1932) is an
American
actress ,
singer , and
dancer
who was an
MGM
contract star. She is also a collector of movie memorabilia. Reynolds was born Mary Frances Reynolds in
El Paso, Texas , the second child of Maxine N. ( née
Harmon; 1913–1999) and Raymond Francis Reynolds (1903–1986), who was a
carpenter
for the
Southern Pacific Railroad . [1] [2]
Reynolds was a
Girl Scout
and a troop leader (a scholarship in her name is offered to high-school age Girl Scouts). Her family moved to
Burbank ,
California , in 1939, and she was raised in a strict
Nazarene
faith. At age 16, while a student at Burbank’s
John Burroughs High School , Reynolds won the Miss Burbank
Beauty Contest , a contract with
Warner Brothers , and acquired her new first name.
Debbie Reynolds regularly appeared in
movie musicals
during the 1950s and had several hit records during the period. Her song “ Aba Daba Honeymoon ” (featured in the 1950 film
Two Weeks with Love
as a duet with
Carleton Carpenter ) was a top-three hit in 1951. Her most high-profile film role was in
Singin’ in the Rain
(1952) as Kathy Selden. In
Bundle of Joy
(1956) she appeared with her then-husband,
Eddie Fisher .
Her recording of the song “ Tammy ” (from her 1957 film
Tammy and the Bachelor ) earned her a
gold record , [3]
and was the best-selling
single
by a female vocalist in 1957. It was number one for five weeks on the
Billboard
pop charts. In the movie (the first of the
Tammy
film series ) she co-starred with
Leslie Nielsen .
Debbie Reynolds talks about “Singing In The Rain”
In 1959 Reynolds recorded her first album for
Dot Records , simply called
Debbie , which included her own selection of 12 standards including “S’posin'”, “Moonglow”, “Mean To Me” and “Time After Time”.
Bing Crosby
paid tribute to Reynolds in the sleeve notes accompanying the album thus:
“
Someone recently said, and
with reasonable accuracy I would think, that good singers make good
actors. Evidence in support of this belief is available in the recent
performances of
Sinatra
and
Martin ,
for instance, but I would like to put forth also the proposition that
the reverse is quite true: good actors make good singers. Assuming they
can carry a tune. We all know that Debbie is better than a good actress —
she’s VERY good, and we all know she can sing with a lilt and a
listenable quality that’s genuinely pleasant and agreeable. Witness
“Tammy”. It was small surprise to me then that when I listened to this
beautiful album she has etched for Dot, I found myself captivated and
enchanted. Quite obviously Debbie had spent a great deal of time
selecting the songs to be included, because she’s made them her own, and
invested them with a sincerity that’s inescapable — of contrasting
moods to be sure, but the moods are there, and to me, mighty effective.
And that, mes amis, is artistry.
”
Reynolds also scored two other top-25
Billboard
hits with “ A Very Special Love ” (1958) and “ Am I That Easy to Forget ” (1960) — a
pop-music
version of a
country-music
hit made famous by both
songwriters
Carl Belew
(in 1959),
Skeeter Davis
(in 1960), and several years later by singer
Engelbert Humperdinck . During these years she also
headlined
in major
Las Vegas
showrooms .
“Tammy”
Her starring role in
The Unsinkable Molly Brown
(1964) led to a nomination for the
Academy Award for Best Actress . She then portrayed
Jeanine Deckers
in
The Singing Nun
(1966).
In what Reynolds has called the “stupidest mistake of my entire career”, [4]
she made headlines in 1970 after instigating a fight with the NBC television network over cigarette advertising on her
eponymous television series ; NBC cancelled the show. [4]
Marilyn Michaels and Debbie Reynolds on Love Boat
She continues to make appearances in film and television. On the
NBC
series
Wings , she played
Deedee Chapel , the mother of
Helen Chapel -played by
Crystal Bernard
and the mother of
Casey Chapel Davenport -played by
Amy Yasbeck . The November 1994 episode was called
If It’s Not One Thing, It’s Your Mother . From 1999 to its 2006
series finale , she played
Grace Adler ‘s ditzy mother
Bobbi Adler
on the NBC
sitcom
Will & Grace
(1998–2006), which earned her a
Emmy Award
nomination for
Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series
in
2000 . She also plays a recurring role in the
Disney Channel Original Movie
Halloweentown
film series
as Aggie Cromwell. Reynolds made a guest appearance as a presenter at the
69th Academy Awards
in 1997.
Reynolds has released several albums of both her vintage performances and her later recordings.
She is currently performing in her West End show Debbie Reynolds: Alive and Fabulous.
“You Made Me Love You”
Reynolds won the
National Board of Review
Award for Best Supporting Actress
for her role in
The Catered Affair
(1956).
She has received various nominations for awards including: an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for
The Unsinkable Molly Brown
(1964), a
Golden Globe Award
nomination for
Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy
for
The Debbie Reynolds Show
(1970), a Golden Globe nomination for
Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy
for
Mother
(1996) and a
Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series , for her role of
Bobbi Adler
in the
sitcom
Will & Grace
(2000). In 1996 and 1997, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award in Comedy, in the
American Comedy Awards .
“Dream of You”
Her foot and hand prints are preserved at the
Grauman’s Chinese Theatre
in
Hollywood ,
California . She also has a star on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame
at 6654 Hollywood Boulevard.
In November 2006, Reynolds received the “Lifetime Achievement Award” from
Chapman University
( Orange , California). On May 17, 2007, she was awarded an
honorary degree
of
Doctor of Humane Letters
from the
University of Nevada, Reno , ( Reno , Nevada) where she had contributed for many years to the
film-studies
program. In her acceptance speech, she referred to the University as “Nevahda…Arizona”.
“I Wanna Be Loved By You”
Reynolds has been married three times. She and
Eddie Fisher
were married in 1955. They are the parents of
Carrie Fisher
and Todd Fisher. A public scandal ensued when Fisher and
Elizabeth Taylor
fell in love, and Reynolds and Fisher were divorced in 1959. Her second
marriage, to millionaire businessman Harry Karl, lasted from 1960 to
1973. At its end, she found herself in financial difficulty because of
Karl’s gambling and bad investments. (Under the
community property
laws of California, both spouses in a marriage are legally responsible for debts incurred by either.) Reynolds was married to
real estate developer
Richard Hamlett from 1984 to 1996. They purchased
Greek Isles Hotel & Casino , a small hotel and casino in Las Vegas, but it was not a success. In 1997, Reynolds was forced to declare
bankruptcy . [5]
Reynolds has been active in the
Thalians Club , a charitable organization.
“Are You For Real”
She has amassed a large collection of movie memorabilia and displayed
them, first in a museum at her Las Vegas hotel and casino during the
1990s and later in a museum close to the
Kodak Theater
in
Los Angeles . On several occasions she has
auctioned
off items from the collection. The collection is scheduled to re-open in the
Gatlinburg ,
Tennessee , area in the future.
She resides in Los Angeles next door to her daughter Carrie.

Nana Mouskouri
Nana Mouskouri
( Greek : Nάνα Μούσχουρη), born
Ioánna Moúschouri
( Greek : Ιωάννα Μούσχουρη) on October 13, 1934, in
Chania ,
Crete ,
Greece ,
is a
singer
who is confirmed to have sold between 200 and 300 million
records worldwide in a career spanning over five decades, making her one
of the
best-selling music artists
of all time. [1] [2] [3] .
She was known as Nána to her friends and family as a child. (Note that
in Greek her surname is pronounced with the stress on the first syllable
– MOOS-hoo-ree – rather than the second.) She has recorded songs in
many different languages, including
Greek ,
English ,
German ,
Dutch ,
French ,
Italian ,
Catalan ,
Spanish ,
Hebrew ,
Welsh
and
Maori .
Nana Mouskouri’s family lived in Chania, Crete, where her father,
Constantine, worked as a film projectionist in a local cinema. Her
mother, Alice also worked in the same local cinema as an
usherette . When Mouskouri was three, her father moved the family to
Athens .
Mouskouri’s family worked extremely hard in order to send Nana and her elder sister, Jenny, to the prestigious
Athens Conservatoire .
Mouskouri had displayed exceptional musical talent from the age of 6.
However, her sister, Jennie, initially appeared to be the more gifted of
the two. Financially unable to support both girls’ studies, the parents
eventually asked their tutor which one should continue. The tutor
conceded that Jennie had the better voice, but Nana was the one with the
true inner need to sing. Mouskouri has said that a medical examination
revealed a difference in her two
vocal cords
and this could well account for her remarkable singing voice (in her younger years ranging from a husky, dark
alto , which she later dropped, to a ringing
coloratura
mezzo ), as opposed to her breathy, raspy speaking voice. [4]
Autumn Leaves
Mouskouri’s childhood was stamped by the German
Nazi
occupation of Greece. Her father became part of the anti- Nazi
resistance movement in Athens. Mouskouri began singing lessons at age
12. As a child, she listened to radio broadcasts of singers such as
Frank Sinatra ,
Ella Fitzgerald ,
Billie Holiday , and
Édith Piaf .
“Only Love”
In 1950, she was accepted at the Conservatoire. She studied classical music with an emphasis on
singing
opera . After eight years at the Conservatoire, Mouskouri was encouraged by her friends to experiment with
jazz
music. She soon began singing with her friends’ jazz group at night and
they even managed to get a radio slot. However, when Mouskouri’s
Conservatory professor found out about Mouskouri’s involvement with a
genre of music that was not in keeping with her classical studies, he
prevented her from sitting for her end-of-year exams.
Mouskouri left the Conservatoire and began performing at the Zaki club in Athens.
She began singing jazz in nightclubs with a bias towards Ella Fitzgerald repertoire. In 1957, she recorded her first song,
Fascination , in both Greek and English for Odeon/EMI Greece. By 1958 while still performing at the Zaki, she met Greek
composer
Manos Hadjidakis .
Hadjidakis was immensely impressed by Nana’s phenomenal voice and
immediately offered to write songs for her. In 1959 Mouskouri performed
Hadjidakis’
Kapou Iparchi I Agapi Mou
(co-written with poet
Nikos Gatsos ) at the inaugural
Greek Song Festival . The song won first prize, and Mouskouri began to be noticed.
“Love Changes Everything”
At the 1960 Greek Song Festival, she performed two more Hadjidakis compositions,
Timoria
and
Kiparissaki . Both these songs tied for first prize. Mouskouri performed
Kostas Yannidis ‘ composition,
Xypna Agapi Mou , at the
Mediterranean Song Festival , held in
Barcelona
that year. The song won first prize, and she went on to sign a recording contract with
Paris -based
Philips-Fontana .
In 1961, Mouskouri performed the soundtrack of a
German
documentary about Greece. This resulted in the German-language single
Weiße Rosen aus Athen
(“White Roses from Athens”). The song was originally adapted from a
folk melody by Hadjidakis. It became a success, selling over a million
copies in Germany. The song was later translated into several different
languages and it went on to become one of Mouskouri’s signature tunes.
Mouskouri married Yorgos (“George”) Petsilas in 1961. Mouskouri and
Petsilas had two children, a son, Nicolas, born on 13 February 1968 and a
daughter, Hélène, nicknamed Lénou, born on 6 July 1970. In 1974,
Mouskouri and Petsilas separated and in 1975 were officially divorced.
Mouskouri currently lives primarily in Switzerland, with her second
husband, André Chapelle, whom she married on 13 January 2003.
“Plaisir d’Amour”
In 1962, she met
Quincy Jones , who persuaded her to travel to
New York City
to record an album of American jazz titled
The Girl From Greece Sings . Following that she scored another hit in the
United Kingdom
with
My Colouring Book .
“The White Rose of Athens”
In 1963 she left Greece to live in Paris. Mouskouri performed
Luxembourg ‘s entry in the
Eurovision Song Contest 1963
that year,
À Force de Prier . The song achieved success, and helped win her the prestigious
Grand Prix du Disque
in France. Mouskouri soon attracted the attention of French composer
Michel Legrand , who composed for her two major French hits
Les Parapluies de Cherbourg
(1964) and an arrangement of
Katherine K. Davis ‘
Carol of the Drum ,
L’Enfant au Tambour
(1965).
In 1965 she recorded her second English-language album to be released in the United States, entitled
Nana Sings . American
calypso
musician
Harry Belafonte
heard and liked the album. Belafonte brought Mouskouri on tour with him
through 1966. They teamed for a live duo album entitled
An Evening With Belafonte/Mouskouri . During this tour, Belafonte suggested that Mouskouri remove her signature black-rimmed
glasses
when on stage. She was so unhappy with the request that she wanted to
quit the show after only two days. Finally, Belafonte relented and
respected her wishes to perform while wearing glasses.
Mouskouri’s 1967 French album
Le Jour Où la Colombe
raised her to
super-stardom
in France. This album featured many of her French songs,
Au Cœur de Septembre ,
Adieu Angélina ,
Robe Bleue, Robe Blanche
and the French pop classic
Le Temps des Cerises . Mouskouri made her first appearance at Paris’ legendary
Olympia
concert theatre the same year, singing French pop, Greek folk, and Hadjidakis numbers.
“The Rose”
In 1968, Mouskouri was invited to host a
BBC
TV series called
Presenting Nana Mouskouri . The next year she released a full-length British LP,
Over and Over . It became a smash hit that spent almost two years on the UK charts. She expanded her concert tour to
Australia
(where she met
Frank Hardy ,
who followed her to the south of France in 1976), New Zealand and
Japan. She recorded several Japanese songs for the Japanese market.
In France, she released a series of top-selling albums that included
Comme un Soleil ,
Une Voix Qui Vient du Cœur ,
Vielles Chansons de France , and
Quand Tu Chantes! .
In 1979, Mouskouri released another English-language album named
Roses and Sunshine . This
album consisting largely of folk and country material, and included work from such diverse sources as
Neil Young ,
Dolly Parton ,
Bob Dylan
and
John Denver . It was very well received in Canada, and one of the album’s tracks, “Even Now” (not the same song as the 1978
Barry Manilow
hit), became a staple on
beautiful music
radio stations in the United States. She scored a worldwide hit in 1981 with
Je Chante Avec Toi, Liberté ,
which was translated into several languages after its widespread
success in France. The momentum from this album also helped boost her
following German album,
Mein Lieder sind mein Leben . In 1984, Mouskouri returned to Greece for her first live performance in her homeland since 1962.
In 1985, Mouskouri recorded
Only Love , the theme song to the BBC TV series
Mistral’s Daughter
— based upon the novel by
Judith Krantz
— that reached #2 in the UK charts. The song was also a hit in its foreign language versions:
L’Amour en Héritage
(French),
Come un’eredità
(Italian),
La dicha del almor
(Spanish), and
Aber die Liebe bleibt
(German). The German version was also recorded with an alternate set of lyrics under the title
Der wilde Wein
but was withdrawn in favour of
Aber die Liebe bleibt .
“Parlez Moi d’Amour”
That same year, Mouskouri made a play for the Spanish-language market with the hit single
Con Todo el Alma . The song was a major success in
Spain ,
Argentina
and
Chile .
She released five albums in different languages in 1987, and the
following year returned to her classical conservatory roots with the
double LP
The Classical Nana
(aka
Nana Classique ), which
featured adaptations of classical songs and excerpts from opera. By the
end of 1987, she had performed a series of concerts in Asia, including
South Korea ,
Taiwan ,
Singapore ,
Hong Kong ,
Malaysia
and
Thailand .
A French language autobiography appeared in 1989 titled
“Chanter ma vie”
(Singing my life).
In 2006, Greek publisher A.A. Livanis published a biography in Greek
titled “To onoma mou ine Nana” (My name is Nana). In autumn 2007, the
French and English versions of this biography appeared under the titles
“Nana Mouskouri — Memoires — La fille de la Chauve-souris” (XO
publishers) and “Nana Mouskouri — Memoirs” (Orion Publishing Group). [5]
Mouskouri’s 1991 English album,
Only Love: The Best of Nana Mouskouri
became her best-selling release in the United States. She spent much of
the 1990s touring the globe. Among her early 1990s albums were
spiritual music,
Gospel
(1990), the Spanish-language
Nuestras Canciones , the multilingual, Mediterranean-themed
Côté Sud, Côté Coeur
(1992),
Dix Mille Ans Encore ,
Falling in Love Again: Great Songs From the Movies .
Falling in Love
featured two duets with Harry Belafonte.
She recorded several more albums over 1996 and 1997, including the Spanish
Nana Latina
(which featured duets with
Julio Iglesias
and
Mercedes Sosa ), the English-language
Return to Love , and the French pop classics,
Hommages . In 1997, she staged a high-profile
Concert for Peace
at the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine
in New York. This concert was later released as an album, and aired as a TV special on
PBS
in the U.S.
In 1993, Mouskouri recorded the album,
Hollywood . Produced by
Michel Legrand
it was a collection of famous songs from films, and served not only as a
tribute to the world of cinema, but also as a .personal reference to
childhood memories of sitting with her father in his projection room in
Crete
Mouskouri was appointed a
UNICEF
Goodwill Ambassador in October 1993. [6]
She took over from the previous ambassador, the recently deceased actress
Audrey Hepburn . Mouskouri’s first U.N. mission took her to
Bosnia
to draw attention to the plight of children affected by Bosnian war. She went on to give a series of fund-raising concerts in
Sweden
and
Belgium .
She was elected a Member of the
European Parliament
from 1994 until 1999, when she resigned from her position as an MEP.
Several reasons have been given for this, one being her pacifism, and
another being that she felt ill-equipped for the day-to-day work of a
politician. [7]
Mouskouri currently lives in
Switzerland
with Chapelle, and up until her final performance in 2008 performed
hundreds of concerts every year throughout her career. In 2004, her
French record company released an unprecedented 34- CD
box set of more than 600 of Mouskouri’s mostly-French songs. In 2006 she made a guest appearance at that year’s
Eurovision Song Contest
which was held, for the first time ever, in her native Greece. In the
same year, she announced her plans to retire. From 2006 until 2008, she
conducted a farewell concert tour of
Europe ,
Australia ,
Asia ,
South America , the
United States , and
Canada . On July 23, 2008, Mouskouri gave her final ‘Farewell Concert’ performance at the ancient Herodes Atticus Theatre, in
Athens ,
Greece ,
before a packed stadium, including Greece’s prime minister and Athens
mayor, plus the mayors of Berlin, Paris and Luxembourg, along with fans
from around the world and thousands of her Athenian admirers. [2]
Universal Music Group ,
which has over the decades come to acquire virtually all the labels
under which Mouskouri recorded, claims that Nana Mouskouri has sold more
than 300 million discs worldwide [2] [8] , recording about 1,500 songs in 15 languages on 450 albums. She has more than 230
gold and platinum albums
worldwide, making her a candidate for the best-selling female recording artist of all time. [3]

Connie Boswell
Constance Foore “Connee” Boswell
(December 3, 1907,
Kansas City, Missouri
– October 11, 1976,
New York ) was an
American
female vocalist born in
Kansas City
but raised in
New Orleans, Louisiana . With her sisters,
Martha
and
Helvetia “Vet” Boswell , she performed in the 1930s as
The Boswell Sisters
and became a highly influential singing group during this period via
recordings and radio. Connee herself is widely considered one of the
greatest jazz female vocalists and was a major influence on
Ella Fitzgerald
who said, “My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it….I tried so hard to sound just like her.” [1]
Connie Boswell and the Victor Young Orchestra, “Blue Moon” 1935
In 1936, Connee’s sisters retired and Connee continued on as a solo
artist (having also recorded solos during her years with the group).
The Boswells came to be well known locally while still in their early
teens, making appearances in New Orleans theaters and radio. They made
their first recordings for
Victor Records
in 1925, which included “Cryin’ Blues” where Connee is featured singing
in the style of her early influence, the
African American
singer
Mamie Smith .
The Boswell Sisters became stage professionals that year when they were
tapped to fill in for an act at New Orleans’ Orpheum Theatre. They
received an invitation to come to Chicago and perform in 1928 and honed
their act on the Western Vaudeville Circuit. When their tour ended they
traveled to San Francisco. The hotel that had been recommended had a
less than savory reputation, and the man at the desk suggested that
these three young ladies might be better off in another hotel. That man,
Harry Leedy, would later become their manager on a handshake and become
a permanent part of Connee’s life.
1931 -“I’m All Dressed Up With A Broken Heart”
The Boswell Sisters travelled to Los Angeles where they performed on
local radio and “side-miked” for the soundies, including the 1930
production “Under Montana Skies.” They did not attain national
attention, however, until they moved to New York City in 1930 and
started making national radio broadcasts. After a few recordings with
Okeh Records , they made numerous recordings for
Brunswick Records
from 1931-1935. In 1935, the sisters had a #1 hit with “ The Object of My Affection “, the biggest of twenty top 20 records they would enjoy.
“I Can’t Give You Anything But Love”
In 1936, the group signed to
Decca Records
and after just three releases called it quits (the last recording was
February 12, 1936).
Connee Boswell
continued to have a successful solo
career as a singer for Decca.
All through her career with The Boswell Sisters, and well into the
1940s, her name was spelled “Connie”. She later changed the spelling to
Connee, reputedly because it made it easier to sign autographs.
Connee Boswell was also an arranger (the Boswell Sisters harmony arrangements are hers) and a composer.
Connee sang from a wheelchair – or seated position – during her entire career, due to either a childhood bout with
polio
or a childhood accident (sources differ). The general public was not
aware of her condition although Boswell herself did not keep this
secret. During
World War II ,
she tried to get involved with the U.S.O. tours but was not given
permission to travel overseas. The Army thought it might not be a
morale-booster to have a singer who used a wheelchair perform for the
troops.
“I’ll Get By”
Connee Boswell was a favorite duet partner of
Bing Crosby
and they frequently sang together on radio as well as recording several
hit records as a duo in the 1930s and 1940’s. Boswell, Crosby, and
Eddie Cantor
recorded a version of
Alexander’s Ragtime Band
that was a #1 hit in 1938.In 1939, Crosby and Boswell had three hit duet records that each climbed into the top 12 on
Billboard ; “An Apple For The Teacher” climbed all the way to #2.
“Its The Talk Of The Town”
Boswell also had several dozen solo hits, including “Moonlight Moon”
in 1942. Boswell’s career slackened in the 1950s but she still recorded
occasionally and would be featured on a number of television broadcasts
including a regular stint on the 1959 series “Pete Kelly’s Blues”.
Connee Boswell died from
stomach cancer
at age 68 in 1976, in New York. A number of her recordings are now
available on CD, both as a soloist and part of the Boswell Sisters.
“Stardust”

The Boswell Sisters
The Boswell Sisters
were a
close harmony
singing group, consisting of sisters
Martha Boswell
(June 9, 1905 – July 2, 1958),
Connee Boswell
(original name Connie) (December 3, 1907 – October 11, 1976), and
Helvetia “Vet” Boswell
(May 20, 1911 – November 12, 1988), noted for intricate harmonies and
rhythmic experimentation. They attained national prominence in the
USA
in the 1930s.
“Cheek To Cheek”
They were raised by a middle-class family on Camp Street in uptown
New Orleans, Louisiana . Martha and Connie were born in
Kansas City, Missouri . Helvetia was born in
Birmingham, Alabama . (Connee’s name was originally spelled Connie until she changed it in the 1940s.)
“Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter”
They came to be well known in New Orleans while still in their early teens, making appearances in local theaters and
radio . They made their first record for
Victor Records
in 1925. However, the Boswell Sisters did not attain national attention until they moved to
New York City
in 1930 and started making national radio broadcasts. After a few recordings with
Okeh Records
in 1930, they made numerous recordings for
Brunswick Records
from 1931-1935. These Brunswick records are widely regarded as
milestone recordings of vocal jazz. Connee’s ingenious reworkings of the
melodies and rhythms of popular songs, together with
Glenn Miller’s
hot arrangements, and first rate New York jazz musicians (including
The Dorsey Brothers ,
Benny Goodman ,
Bunny Berigan ,
Fulton McGrath ,
Joe Venuti ,
Arthur Schutt ,
Eddie Lang ,
Joe Tarto ,
Manny Klein ,
Dick McDonough , and
Carl Kress ),
made these recordings unlike any others. Melodies were rearranged and
slowed down, major keys were changed to minor keys (sometimes in
mid-song) and rhythmic changes were par for the course. They were among
the very few performers who were allowed to make changes to current
popular tunes as during this era, music publishers and record companies
pressured performers not to alter current popular song arrangements.
Connee also recorded a series of more conventional solo records for
Brunswick during the same period.
“Alexander’s Ragtime Band”
The name of their 1934 song “ Rock and Roll ” is an early use of the term. It is not one of their hotter numbers; it refers to “the rolling rocking rhythm of the sea”.
In 1936, the group signed to Decca and after just 3 records, broke up (the last recording was February 12, 1936).
Connie Boswell continued to have a successful solo career as a singer
for Decca. She later changed the spelling of her name from Connie to
Connee in the 1940’s, reputedly because it made it easier to sign
autographs. (It’s interesting to note that Connee sang from a wheelchair
– or seated position – during her entire career, due to an accident she
suffered as a young child. Amazingly, when she tried to get involved
with the overseas U.S.O tours. during World War II, she was not given
permission to travel overseas due to her disability.)
“Sleepy Time Down South”
The Boswell Sisters chalked up 20 hits during the 1930s including the number one record “The Object of My Affection” in 1935.
During the early 1930’s the Boswell Sisters,
Three X Sisters , and
Pickens Sisters
were the talk of early radio female harmonizing. The
Andrews Sisters
started out as Boswell Sisters imitators. Young
Ella Fitzgerald
loved the Boswell Sisters and in particular idolized Connee, after whose singing style she patterned her own.
Current groups The Pfister Sisters, Stolen Sweets, and Boswellmania,
or the Italian trio Sorelle Marinetti continue to imitate the sisters’
recordings.
The Ditty Bops
have covered Boswell sisters songs in concert.
In 2001,
The Boswell Sisters , a major musical based on their lives, was produced at the Old Globe Theatre in
San Diego, California . The play starred Michelle Duffy, Elizabeth Ward Land, and
Amy Pietz
and was produced by the same team that produced
Forever Plaid . The show was a hit with audiences and a critical success, but failed to be picked up for a much hoped-for Broadway run.
The Boswell Sisters were inducted into the
Vocal Group Hall of Fame
in 1998. At a ceremony covered by the Pfister Sisters, the Boswells were inducted into the
Louisiana Music Hall of Fame
in 2008.
