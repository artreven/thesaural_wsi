Elizabeth Sharonov performs during a bel canto master class at UH
Some of the finest voices in the country are assembled at the University of Houston this week. Thanks to Le Chiavi – The Keys to Bel Canto, advanced student singers have gathered on campus to learn from a collection of opera professionals, star vocalists and music veterans.
The institute is part of the
Immanuel and Helen Olshan Texas Music Festival
and has steadily grown since it was founded four years ago. It is dedicated to the instruction of
bel canto , the influential era of opera personified by the works of
Rossini ,
Bellini
and
Donizetti . This year, 27 singers are participating in the rigorous three-week program. They’re trained in stage movement, dramatic technique, individual coaching, health care classes, the history of bel canto and more.
At 7:30 p.m., June 8, these singers will showcase what they’ve learned to Houston audiences during a concert of arias, songs and ensembles. The performance will take place in
Dudley Recital Hall .
Le Chiavi faculty include the institute’s founders and UH Moores School of Music professors
Melanie Sonnenberg
and
Joseph Evans . Additional instructors include international opera stars
Ruth Ann Swenson
and
Nova Thomas ,
Moores Opera Center director Buck Ross
and other noted professionals.
“I’m very pleased that we can offer something like this,” Evans said. “To my knowledge, no other institute provides this level of training. It’s a very focused training program that prepares only the best singers.”
