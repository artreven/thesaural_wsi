Nightcap at Brussels
After a good meal at my favourite secret Thai restaurant (which I would think about revealing the location if I decide to be generous one day), we decide to go for a nightcap at
Brussels
Beer cafe at JayaOne. It was such a good meal but the day was still young and so we went for a drink. The nearest, would of course be JayaOne which is quite convenient for everyone. Why do I looked so serious here?!! It's been months since I last met up with Calvin whom is now working in Singapore. I didn't manage to meet up with him during my last trip to the island and thus this dinner gathering, I could not give it a pass. It was very nice of him to but the 3 girls a dinner and nightcap at Brussels! RM90/bottle At Brussels, I took the liberty to order a bottle of Canella Bellini which I have not heard before and have not given a try. It was actually a wine-based cocktail bottled in a clear glass showing it's peachy pink hue. Named after the drink made famous by Ernest Hemingway, it is a Venetian custom to down a few Bellinis before or after a meal. The
Bellini
is a mixture of Italian Prosecco and peach puree. This spritzy fruit cocktail is consists of 30% fresh fruit juice and fruit solids and is high on anti-oxidants. It can easily be passed off as a health drink! Let's drink to health! Cheers...
Haha... I think Gee and Li Wei didn't quite like the drink. It's a little sweet and probably it wasn't chilled enough when it was served to us. We were lucky because it's a Sat night and Brussels was crowded and packed. Then I managed to spot one of the bosses and he gave me his reserved table which is one of the best spots that overlooked Bar Madrid.
Tham
was there too and he was taking very good care of us. Was truly delighted to have such a good time together. A great catch up with friends for the weekend!

I had this La Trappe Quadrupel beer brewed my monks in France. It's around RM 50, comes in a corked bottle like champagne and it's a damn strong beer. Pretty good.

Hi Eiling, you're right! One of the most important things to know before drinking a Bellini is that it's best when chilled. Please take a look at the eight tips to enjoy Bellini: http://www.thepeachtree.it/?p=595&lang=en

Fatboybakes: It's a female's drink because it's peachy and pink? haha.. It's not My Elephant either. Cath J: Drink more! Monica Canella: Yep. A drink like this should be chilled to at least 7-8 degrees celcius, just like white wine or champagne. Foongpc: Wah everyone wants to know the secret Thai restaurant.So many Thai food fans here or we are running out of good thai food to eat?
