Milan
( English
/ m ɨ ˈ l æ n /
or
US
/ m ə ˈ l ɑː n / ; [ 3 ]
Italian :
Milano
[miˈlaːno]  (
listen ) ;
Milanese :
Milan
[miˈlã] ), the
second-most populous
city in
Italy , serves as the capital of
Lombardy . The city proper has a population of about 1.3 million, while its
urban area
(the
5th-largest
in the
EU ) comprises an estimated 5,264,000 people. [ 4 ]
The enormous suburban sprawl that followed the
post-war boom
of the 1950s–1960s and the growth of a vast commuter belt suggest that socioeconomic linkages have expanded well beyond the boundaries of its administrative limits and its agglomeration, creating a polycentric metropolitan area of 7 to 10 million people, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
stretching over the provinces of
Milan ,
Bergamo ,
Como ,
Lecco ,
Lodi ,
Monza and Brianza ,
Pavia ,
Varese
and
Novara . The Milan metropolitan region is part of the so-called
Blue Banana , the area of
Europe
with the highest population and industrial density. In terms of
GDP , Milan has the
third largest economy
among EU cities and the largest among European non-capital cities. [ 9 ]
Milan was founded by Celts known as
Insubres . The Romans later conquered the city, which they knew as
Mediolanum , and which eventually became the capital (286 - 402 CE) of the
Western Roman Empire . During the
Middle Ages , Milan flourished as a commercial and banking center. [ 10 ]
In the course of the following centuries, it had been alternatively dominated by
France ,
Habsburg Spain , and
Austria , until 1859 when the city joined the rising
Kingdom of Italy . During the early 1900s, Milan led the industrialization process of the young nation, being at the very center of the economic, social, and political debate. Badly affected by
World War II , and suffering a harsh Nazi occupation, the city became the main centre of the
Italian Resistance . [ 11 ] [ need quotation to verify ]
In post-war years the city enjoyed a prolonged economic boom, attracting large flows of workers from
Southern Italy . [ 12 ]
During recent decades Milan has seen a huge rise in the number of international immigrants, and as of 2011 [update]
more than one sixth of its population was foreign born. [ 2 ]
Milan is the main industrial, commercial, and financial centre of Italy and a leading
global city . [ 13 ]
Its business district hosts the
Borsa Italiana
(Italy's main stock exchange) and the headquarters of the largest national banks and companies. The city is a major world
fashion [ 14 ]
and design [ 15 ]
capital. Milan's museums, theatres and landmarks (including the
Milan Cathedral , the fifth-largest cathedral in the world, and
Santa Maria delle Grazie , decorated with
Leonardo da Vinci
paintings such as
The Last Supper , a
UNESCO World Heritage Site ) attract over 8 million visitors annually. [ 16 ]
The city hosts numerous cultural institutions and universities, with 185,000 enrolled students in 2011, i.e. 11 percent of the national total. [ 17 ]
The city is also well known for several international events and fairs, including
Milan Fashion Week
and the
Milan Furniture Fair , the largest of its kind in the world, [ 18 ]
and is the host for the second time of a
Universal Exposition , the
Expo 2015 . Milan is home to two of the world's major football teams,
A.C. Milan
and
Inter Milan .

Toponymy
The etymology of Milan is very uncertain. While the modern name of the city is clearly derived from its
Latin
name
Mediolanum , apparently from the Latin words
medio , meaning "in the middle", and
planus , "plain", [ 19 ] [ unreliable source? ]
it has been suggested that its original roots could lie more deeply in the city's Celtic heritage. Indeed, the name "Mediolanum" is borne by about sixty Gallo-Roman sites all over
France , such as
Saintes
( Mediolanum Santonum ) and
Évreux
( Mediolanum Aulercorum ), as every Celtic community had its sacred assembly place of law and justice, usually placed at the midpoint of their territory. [ 20 ]
In addition, some scholars have suggested that the second element of the Latin name,
lanum , could be identified with the Celtic root
lan , signifying an enclosure or demarcated territory (source of the
Welsh
word 'llan', meaning a sanctuary or church) in which Celtic communities used to build shrines. [ 21 ]
Hence,
Mediolanum
could signify the central town or sanctuary of a particular Celtic tribe.
Another theory links the origin of the name to the
boar sow
(the
Scrofa semilanuta ) an ancient emblem of the city, fancifully accounted for in
Andrea Alciato 's
Emblemata
(1584), beneath a woodcut of the first raising of the city walls, where a boar is seen lifted from the excavation, and the etymology of
Mediolanum
given as "half-wool", [ 22 ]
explained in Latin and in French. The foundation of Milan is credited to two
Celtic peoples , the
Bituriges
and the
Aedui , having as their
emblems
a ram and a boar; [ 23 ]
therefore "The city's symbol is a wool-bearing boar, an animal of double form, here with sharp bristles, there with sleek wool." [ 24 ]
Alciato credits
Ambrose
for his account. [ 25 ]
Antiquity
Ruins of the Emperor's palace in Milan. Here
Constantine I
and
Licinius
issued the
Edict of Milan .
Around 400 BC, the Celtic
Insubres
settled Milan and the surrounding region. [ 26 ]
In 222 BC, the Romans conquered the settlement, which was then renamed
Mediolanum . After several centuries of Roman control, Milan was declared the capital of the
Western Roman Empire
by Emperor
Diocletian
in 286 AD. Diocletian chose to stay in the
Eastern Roman Empire
(capital
Nicomedia ) and his colleague Maximianus ruled the Western one. Immediately
Maximian
built several gigantic monuments, like a large circus 470 m × 85 m (1,542  ft
× 279 ft), the Thermae Herculeae, a large complex of imperial palaces and several other services and buildings.
With the
Edict of Milan
of 313, Emperor
Constantine I
guaranteed
freedom of religion
for Christians. [ 27 ]
After the city was besieged by the
Visigoths
in 402, the imperial residence was moved to the more strategic city of
Ravenna . In 452, the
Huns
overran the city. In 539, the
Ostrogoths
conquered and destroyed Milan in the course of the
Gothic War
against
Byzantine
Emperor
Justinian I . In the summer of 569, the
Lombards
(from which the name of the Italian region
Lombardy
derives), a
Teutonic tribe
conquered Milan, overpowering the small
Byzantine army
left for its defence. Some Roman structures remained in use in Milan under Lombard rule. [ 28 ]
Milan surrendered to the
Franks
in 774 when
Charlemagne , in an utterly novel decision, took the title of "King of the Lombards" as well (before then the Germanic kingdoms had frequently conquered each other, but none had adopted the title of King of another people). The
Iron Crown of Lombardy
dates from this period. Subsequently, Milan became part of the
Holy Roman Empire .
Middle Ages
Milan as it appeared in 1493, woodcut from the
Nuremberg Chronicle .
During the
Middle Ages , Milan prospered as a centre of trade due to its command of the rich plain of the Po and routes from Italy across the Alps. The war of conquest by
Frederick I Barbarossa
against the Lombard cities brought the destruction of much of Milan in 1162. After the founding of the
Lombard League
in 1167, Milan took the leading role in this alliance. The war between the German emperor and the
Italian communes
went on with mixed fortunes for years, ending with the Italian victory at the
battle of Legnano . As a result of the independence that the Lombard cities gained in the
Peace of Constance
in 1183, Milan became a duchy. In 1208
Rambertino Buvalelli
served a term as
podestà
of the city, in 1242
Luca Grimaldi , and in 1282
Luchetto Gattilusio . The position could be fraught with personal dangers in the violent political life of the
medieval commune : in 1252 Milanese heretics assassinated the Church's Inquisitor, later known as
Saint Peter Martyr , at a ford in the nearby
contado ; the killers bribed their way to freedom, and in the ensuing riot the
podestà
was very nearly lynched. In 1256 the archbishop and leading nobles were expelled from the city. In 1259
Martino della Torre
was elected
Capitano del Popolo
by members of the
guilds ; he took the city by force, expelled his enemies, and ruled by dictatorial powers, paving streets, digging canals, successfully taxing the countryside. His policy, however, brought the Milanese treasury to collapse; the use of often reckless mercenary units further angered the population, granting an increasing support for the Della Torre's traditional enemies, the Visconti. It is worthy of note that the most important industries throughout the period were major armaments and wool production, a whole catalogue of activities and trades is given in Bonvesin della Riva's "de Magnalibus Urbis Mediolani".
The
Biscione : the coat of arms of the House of Visconti, from the Archbishops' palace in
Piazza Duomo .
On 22 July 1262
Ottone Visconti
was created
archbishop of Milan
by
Pope Urban IV , against the Della Torre candidate, Raimondo della Torre,
Bishop of Como . The latter thus started to publicize allegations of the Visconti's closeness to the heretic
Cathars
and charged them of high treason: the Visconti, who accused the Della Torre of the same crimes, were then banned from Milan and their properties confiscated. The ensuing civil war caused more damage to Milan's population and economy, lasting for more than a decade. Ottone Visconti unsuccessfully led a group of exiles against the city in 1263, but after years of escalating violence on all sides, finally, after the victory in the
Battle of Desio
(1277), he won the city for his family. The
Visconti
succeeded in ousting the
della Torre
forever, ruling the city and its possession until the 15th century.
Much of the prior history of Milan was the tale of the struggle between two political factions: the
Guelphs and the Ghibellines . Most of the time the Guelphs were successful in the city of Milan. However, the Visconti family were able to seize power (signoria) in Milan, based on their "Ghibelline" friendship with the German Emperors. [ 29 ]
In 1395, one of these emperors, Wenceslas (1378–1400), raised the Milanese to the dignity of a duchy. [ 30 ]
Also in 1395,
Gian Galeazzo Visconti
became duke of Milan. The Ghibelline Visconti family was to retain power in Milan for a century and a half from the early 14th century until the middle of the 15th century. [ 31 ]
In 1447
Filippo Maria Visconti ,
Duke of Milan , died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the
Ambrosian Republic
was enacted. The Ambrosian Republic took its name from St. Ambrose, popular patron saint of the city of Milan. [ 32 ]
Both the Guelph and the Ghibelline factions worked together to bring about the Ambrosian Republic in Milan. However, the Republic collapsed when in 1450, Milan was conquered by
Francesco Sforza , of the
House of Sforza , which made Milan one of the leading cities of the Italian
Renaissance . [ 32 ] [ 33 ]
Early modern
The late 16th-century city encircled by the
Spanish walls .
Milan's last independent ruler,
Lodovico il Moro , called French king
Charles VIII
into Italy in the expectation that France might be an ally in inter-Italian wars. The future king of France,
Louis of Orléans , took part in the expedition and realized Italy was virtually defenceless. This prompted him to
come back a few years later
and claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, his grandmother having been a member of the ruling
Visconti
family. At that time, Milan was also defended by
Swiss mercenaries . After the victory of Louis's successor François I over the Swiss at the
Battle of Marignan , the duchy was promised to the French king
François I . When the Spanish Habsburg
Charles V
defeated François I at the
Battle of Pavia
in 1525,
northern Italy , including Milan, passed to
Habsburg Spain . [ 34 ]
In 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son
Philip II
and his brother
Ferdinand I . Charles's Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and remained with the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand's Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire.
The
Great Plague of Milan
in 1629–31 killed an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000. This episode is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long
pandemic
of plague that began with the
Black Death . [ 35 ]
In 1700 the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of
Charles II . After his death, the
War of the Spanish Succession
began in 1701 with the occupation of all Spanish possessions by French troops backing the claim of the French
Philippe of Anjou
to the Spanish throne. In 1706, the French were defeated in
Ramillies
and
Turin
and were forced to yield northern Italy to the
Austrian Habsburgs . In 1713, the
Treaty of Utrecht
formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Spain's Italian possessions including
Lombardy
and its capital, Milan.

Austrian
troops during the
Five Days
Napoleon
invaded Italy in 1796, and Milan was declared capital of the
Cisalpine Republic . Later, he declared Milan capital of the
Kingdom of Italy
and was crowned in the Duomo. Once Napoleon's occupation ended, the
Congress of Vienna
returned Lombardy, and Milan, along with
Veneto , to Austrian control in 1815. [ 36 ]
During this period, Milan became a centre of lyric opera. Here in the 1770s
Mozart
had premiered three operas at the
Teatro Regio Ducal . Later
La Scala
became the reference theatre in the world, with its premières of
Bellini ,
Donizetti ,
Rossini
and Verdi.
Verdi
himself is interred in the
Casa di Riposo per Musicisti , his present to Milan. In the 19th century other important theatres were
La Cannobiana
and the
Teatro Carcano .
On 18 March 1848, the Milanese rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called " Five Days " ( Italian:
Le Cinque Giornate ), and Field Marshal
Radetzky
was forced to withdraw from the city temporarily. The
Kingdom of Sardinia
stepped in to help the insurgents; a
plebiscite
held in Lombardy decided in favor of unification with Sardinia. However, after defeating the Sardinian forces at
Custoza
on 24 July, Radetzky was able to reassert Austrian control over Milan and northern Italy. A few years on, however, Italian nationalists again called for the removal of Austria and
Italian unification . Sardinia and France formed an alliance and defeated Austria at the
Battle of Solferino
in 1859. [ 37 ]
Following this battle, Milan and the rest of Lombardy were incorporated into the Kingdom of Sardinia, which soon gained control of most of Italy and in 1861 was rechristened as the
Kingdom of Italy .
The
political unification of Italy
cemented Milan's commercial dominance over northern Italy. It also led to a flurry of railway construction that had started under Austrian partronage (Venice–Milan; Milan–Monza) that made Milan the rail hub of northern Italy. Thereafter with the opening of the
Gotthard
(1881) and
Simplon
(1906) railway tunnels, Milan became the major South European rail focus for business and passenger movements e.g. the Simplon Orient Express. Rapid industrialization and market expansion put Milan at the centre of Italy's leading industrial region, though in the 1890s Milan was shaken by the
Bava-Beccaris massacre , a riot related to a high
inflation rate . Meanwhile, as Milanese banks dominated Italy's financial sphere, the city became the country's leading
financial centre .
Late modern and contemporary
Piazza del Duomo
in the 1920s.
In 1919, Fascist leader
Benito Mussolini
organized his
Blackshirts
in Milan, that rallied for the first time in
Piazza San Sepolcro , a small square near
Milan Cathedral . Subsequently, Mussolini led his
March on Rome
starting from the city. During the
Second World War
Milan suffered extensive damage from Allied bombings. [ 38 ]
When Italy
surrendered
in 1943, German forces occupied most of Northern Italy until 1945. As a result, antifascist resistance groups formed and started guerilla warfare against Nazi and
Italian Social Republic 's troops. [ 11 ]
As the war came to an end, the American
1st Armored Division
advanced on Milan as part of the
Po Valley Campaign . But before they arrived, members of the resistance seized control of the city and executed Mussolini along with several members of his collaborationist government. On 29 April 1945, the corpses of Mussolini, his mistress
Clara Petacci
and other Fascist leaders were hanged in
Piazzale Loreto , where a year before fifteen partisans had been executed.
The
Pirellone , symbol of the modernity and audacity of the
Italian economic miracle .
During the post-war economic boom, a large wave of internal migration (especially from rural areas of
Southern Italy ), moved to the city, bringing the population from 1.3 million in 1951 to 1.7 million in 1967. [ 12 ]
During this period, Milan saw a quick reconstruction of most of its destroyed facilities, with the building of several innovative and modernist
skyscrapers , such as the
Torre Velasca
and the
Pirelli Tower , that soon became symbols of the boom. [ 1 ]
The economic prosperity was however overshadowed in the late 1960s and early 1970s during the so-called
Years of Lead , when Milan witnessed an unprecedented wave of street violence,
labour strikes
and
political terrorism . The apex of this period of turmoil occurred on 12 December 1969, when
a bomb
exploded at the National Agrarian Bank in Piazza Fontana, killing seventeen people and injuring eighty-eight.
In the 1980s, as several fashion firms based in the city became internationally successful (such as
Armani ,
Versace
and
Dolce & Gabbana ), Milan became one of the world's fashion capitals. The city saw also a marked rise in international tourism, notably from America and Japan, while the stock exchange increased its market capitalization more than five-fold. [ 39 ]
This short-lived period of collective euphoria and the new international image of the city led the mass media to nickname the metropolis
"Milano da bere" , literally "Milan to drink". [ 40 ]
However, in the 1990s, Milan was badly affected by
Tangentopoli , a large political scandal in which many local and national politicians and businessmen were tried for alleged corruption. The city was also affected by a severe financial crisis and a steady decline in textiles, automobile and steel production, that led to a deep reorganization of its economy. [ 1 ]
In the early 21st century, Milan underwent a series of sweeping redevelopments, with the moving of its exhibition centre to a much larger site in the satellite town of
Rho , [ 41 ]
and the construction of new business districts such as
Porta Nuova
and
CityLife . [ 42 ]
Despite the decline in Milan's manufacturing production, the city has found alternative and successful sources of revenue, including publishing, finance, banking, fashion design, information technology, logistics, transport and tourism. [ 43 ]
The 2010 official announcement of Milan hosting
Expo 2015 [ 44 ]
has brightened prospects for the city's future, with several new plans of regeneration and the planned construction of numerous futuristic structures. In addition, the city's decades-long population decline seems to have come to an end in recent years, with signs of recovery as it grew by seven percent since the last census. [ 2 ]
Geography
Topography
Panorama of Milan with the Alps in the background.
Map of central Milan.
Milan is located in the north-western section of the
Po Valley , approximately half-way between the river
Po
to the south and the first reliefs of the
Alps
with the great lakes ( Lake Como ,
Lake Maggiore ,
Lake Lugano ) to the north, the
Ticino
river to the west and the
Adda
to the east. The municipal territory is entirely flat, the highest point being at 122 m (400.26 ft)
above sea level . The administrative commune covers an area of about 181 square kilometres (70 sq mi), with a population, in 2013, of 1,324,169 and a population density of 7,315 inhabitants per square kilometre (18,950/sq mi). A larger urban area, comprising parts of the provinces of Milan, Monza e Brianza, Como, Lecco and Varese is 1,891 square kilometres (730 sq mi) wide and has a population of 5,264,000 with a density of 2,783 inhabitants per square kilometre (7,210/sq mi). [ 4 ]
Modern Milan has a central area focused on residential and tertiary activities, with a financial district that hosts the stock exchange and the headquarters of banks and insurance companies, shopping centres and educational institutions. In the concentric layout of the city centre is still evident the influence of
Navigli , an ancient system of navigable and interconnected canals, now mostly covered. [ 45 ]
Around the city proper, and beyond its railway and motorway rings, lies a vast urbanized valley that expands mainly to the north, engulfing many communes in a continuous urban landscape. The contiguous built-up area trespass by far the city limits, forming a vast urban agglomeration that stretches northeast and northwest to reach Varese, Como, Lecco and Bergamo. [ 46 ]
Climate
Palazzo Dugnani and
Montanelli Gardens
covered in snow in 2006.
Milan has a semi-continental climate ( Köppen climate classification : cfa). Milan's climate is similar to much of northern Italy's inland plains, where hot, sunny summers and cold, wet and foggy winters prevail. The
Alps
and
Apennines
mountains form a natural barrier that protects the city from the major circulations coming from northern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea. [ 47 ]
During winter, average temperatures can fall below freezing levels (0 °C or 32 °F) and accumulations of snow can occur: the historic average of Milan's area is 25 centimetres (10 in) in the period between 1961 and 1990, with a record of 90 centimetres (35 in) in January, 1985. In the suburbs the average can reach 36 centimetres (14 in). [ 48 ]
In the stereotypical image, the city is often shrouded in the heavy fog typical of cold seasons in the
Po Basin , [ 1 ]
although the removal of rice paddies from the southern neighborhoods and the
urban heat island
effect have reduced this occurrence in recent decades, at least in the city centre. Occasionally, bursts of
Foehn
winds cause the temperatures to rise unexpectedly: on 22 January 2012 the daily high reached 16 °C (61 °F) while on 22 February 2012 it reached 21 °C (70 °F). [ 49 ]
The city receives on average seven days of snow per year. [ 50 ]
Air pollution levels rise significantly in wintertime when
cold air clings to the soil , causing Milan to be one of Europe’s most polluted cities. [ 51 ]
Summers can be quite sultry, when humidity levels are high and peak temperatures can reach temperatures above 35°C (95 °F). [ 52 ]
Usually this season enjoys clearer skies and more than 13 hours of daylight on average; [ 53 ]
when precipitations occur though, there is a higher likelihood of them being thunderstorms and
hailstorms . [ 53 ]
Springs and autumns are well marked and generally pleasant, with temperatures ranging between 10 and 20 °C (50 and 68 °F); these seasons are characterised by higher precipitation averages, especially in April and May. [ 54 ]
Relative humidity typically ranges between 45% (comfortable) and 95% (very humid) throughout the year, rarely dropping below 27% (dry) and reaching as high as 100% [ 53 ]
Wind is generally absent: over the course of the year typical wind speeds vary from 0 mph to 9 mph (calm to gentle breeze), rarely exceeding 18 mph (fresh breeze), except during summer thunderstorms when winds can blow strong. In the spring, gale-force windstorms may happen, generated either by
Tramontane
blowing from the Alps or by
Bora -like winds from the north. [ 53 ]

Giuliano Pisapia , mayor since 2011.
The city's nine Boroughs.
The legislative body of the
municipality
is the City Council ( Consiglio Comunale ), which is composed by 48 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, contextually to the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee ( Giunta Comunale ), composed by 16
assessors , that is nominated and presided over by a directly elected
Mayor . The current mayor of Milan is
Giuliano Pisapia , a left-wing independent leading a progressive alliance composed by the
Democrats ,
Left Ecology Freedom , the
Greens
and
Federation of the Left .
The municipality of Milan is subdivided into nine administrative Borough Councils ( Consigli di Zona ), down from the former twenty districts before the 1999 administrative reform. [ 58 ]
Each Borough Council is governed by a Council ( Consiglio ) and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor. The urban organization is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114), the Municipal Statute [ 59 ]
and several laws, notably the Legislative Decree 267/2000 or Unified Text on Local Administration ( Testo Unico degli Enti Locali ). [ 60 ]
The Borough Councils have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous funding in order to finance local activities.
Provincial and Regional government
Milan is the capital of the eponymous
administrative province
and of
Lombardy , one of the twenty
regions
of Italy. While the Province of Milan has a population of 3,195,211, making it the second most populated province of Italy after Rome, Lombardy is by far the most populated region of Italy, with more than ten million inhabitants, almost one sixth of the national total. The seat of the regional government is
Palazzo Lombardia
that, standing at 161.3 metres (529 feet), [ 61 ]
is the second tallest building in Milan.
According to the last governmental dispositions concerning administrative reorganization, the urban area of Milan is one of the 15
Metropolitan municipalities
( città metropolitane ), new administrative bodies fully operative since 1 January 2015. [ 62 ]
The new Metro municipalities, giving large urban areas the administrative powers of a province, are conceived for improving the performance of local administrations and to slash local spending by better coordinating the municipalities in providing basic services (including transport, school and social programs) and environment protection. [ 63 ]
In this policy framework, the Mayor of Milan is designated to exercise the functions of Metropolitan mayor ( Sindaco metropolitano ), presieding over a Metropolitan Council formed by 16 mayors of municipalities within the Metro municipality.
The Metropolitan City of Milan is headed by the Metropolitan Mayor ( Sindaco metropolitano ) and by the Metropolitan Council ( Consiglio metropolitano ). Since 1 January 2015
Giuliano Pisapia , as mayor of the capital city, has been the first mayor of the Metropolitan City.

There are only few remains of the ancient
Roman
colony, notably the well-preserved
Colonne di San Lorenzo . During the second half of the 4th century,
Saint Ambrose , as bishop of Milan, had a strong influence on the layout of the city, reshaping the centre (although the cathedral and baptistery built in Roman times are now lost) and building the great basilicas at the city gates:
Sant'Ambrogio ,
San Nazaro in Brolo ,
San Simpliciano
and
Sant'Eustorgio , which still stand, refurbished over the centuries, as some of the finest and most important churches in Milan.
Milan's Cathedral , built between 1386 and 1577, is the fifth largest cathedral in the world [ 64 ]
and the most important example of
Gothic architecture
in Italy. The gilt bronze statue of the
Virgin Mary , placed in 1774 on the highest pinnacle of the Duomo, soon became one of the most enduring symbols of Milan. [ 65 ]
In the 15th century, when the
Sforza
ruled the city, an old Viscontean fortress was enlarged and embellished to become the
Castello Sforzesco , the seat of an elegant Renaissance court surrounded by a walled hunting park. Notable architects involved in the project included the
Florentine
Filarete , who was commissioned to build the high central entrance tower, and the military specialist Bartolomeo Gadio. [ 66 ]
The alliance between Francesco Sforza and Florence's
Cosimo de' Medici
bore to Milan Tuscan models of Renaissance architecture, apparent in the
Ospedale Maggiore
and Bramante's work in the city, which includes
Santa Maria presso San Satiro
(a reconstruction of a small 9th-century church), the tribune of
Santa Maria delle Grazie
and three cloisters for Sant'Ambrogio. [ 67 ]
The
Counter-Reformation
in the 16th-17th century was also the period of
Spanish domination
and was marked by two powerful figures:
Saint Charles Borromeo
and his cousin,
Cardinal Federico Borromeo . Not only did they impose themselves as moral guides to the people of Milan, but they also gave a great impulse to culture, with the creation of the
Biblioteca Ambrosiana , in a building designed by
Francesco Maria Ricchino , and the nearby
Pinacoteca Ambrosiana . Many notable churches and Baroque mansions were built in the city during this period by the architects,
Pellegrino Tibaldi ,
Galeazzo Alessi
and Ricchino himself. [ 68 ]
Empress
Maria Theresa of Austria
was responsible for the significant renovations carried out in Milan during the 18th century. [ 69 ]
This profound urban and artistic renewal included the establishment of
Teatro alla Scala , inaugurated in 1778 and today one of the world's most famous
opera houses , and the renovation of the
Royal Palace . The late 1700s
Palazzo Belgioioso
by
Giuseppe Piermarini
and
Royal Villa of Milan
by
Leopoldo Pollack , later the official residence of Austrian vice-roys, are often regarded among the best examples of
Neoclassical architecture
in Lombardy. [ 70 ]
The
Napoleonic
rule of the city in 1805-1814, having established Milan as the capital of a satellite
Kingdom of Italy , took steps in order to reshape it accordingly to its new status, with the construction of large boulevards, new squares ( Porta Ticinese
by
Luigi Cagnola
and Foro Bonaparte by
Giovanni Antonio Antolini ) and cultural institutions ( Art Gallery
and the
Academy of Fine Arts ). [ 71 ]
The massive
Arch of Peace , situated at the bottom of Corso Sempione, is often compared to the
Arc de Triomphe
in
Paris . In the second half of the 19th century, Milan quickly became the main industrial center in of the new Italian nation, drawing inspiration from the great European capitals that were hubs of the
second industrial revolution . The great
Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II , realized by
Giuseppe Mengoni
between 1865 and 1877 to celebrate
Vittorio Emanuele II , is a covered passage with a glass and cast iron roof, inspired by the
Burlington Arcade
in London. Another late 19th century eclectic monument in the city is the
Cimitero Monumentale
graveyard, built in a
Neo-Romanesque
style between 1863 and 1866.
The tumultuous period of early 20th century brought several, radical innovations in Milanese architecture.
Art Nouveau , also known as
Liberty
in Italy, is recognisable in
Palazzo Castiglioni , built by architect
Giuseppe Sommaruga
between 1901 and 1904. [ 72 ]
Other remarkable examples include Hotel Corso [ 72 ]
and Berri-Meregalli house, the latter built in a traditional Milanese Art Nouveau style combined with elements of neo-Romanesque and Gothic revival architecture, regarded as one of the last such types of architecture in the city. [ 73 ]
A new, more eclectic form of architecture can be seen in buildings such as Castello Cova, built the 1910s in a distinctly neo-medioeval style, evoking the architectural trends of the past. [ 74 ]
An important example of
Art Deco , which blended such styles with
Fascist architecture , is the huge
Central railway station
inaugurated in 1931.
The post–World War II period saw rapid reconstruction and fast economic growth, accompanied by a nearly two-fold increase in population. In the 1950s and 1960s, a strong demand for new residential and commercial areas drove to extreme urban expansion, that has produced some of the major milestones in the city's architectural history, including
Gio Ponti 's
Pirelli Tower
(1956–60),
Velasca Tower
(1956–58), and the creation of brand new residential satellite towns, as well as huge amounts of low quality public housings. In recent years, de-industrialization, urban decay and gentrification led to a vast urban renewal of former industrial areas, that have been transformed into modern residential and financial districts, notably
Porta Nuova
in downtown Milan and
FieraMilano
in the suburb of
Rho . In addition, the old exhibition area is being completely reshaped according to the
Citylife
regeneration project, featuring residencial areas, museums, an urban park and three skyscrapers designed by international architects, and after whom they are named: the 202m
Isozaki Tower
– when completed, the tallest building in Italy, [ 75 ]
the twisted
Hadid Tower , [ 76 ]
and the curved
Libeskind Tower . [ 77 ]
Parks and gardens
Sempione Park , with the
Arch of Peace
in the background.
The largest parks in the central area of Milan are
Sempione Park , at the north-western edge, and
Montanelli Gardens , situated northeast of the city. English-style Sempione Park, built in 1890, contains a Napoleonic Arena, the Milan City Aquarium, a steel lattice panoramic tower, an art exhibition centre, a Japanese garden and a public library. [ 78 ]
The Montanelli gardens, created in the 18th century, hosts the
Natural History Museum of Milan
and a
planetarium . [ 79 ]
Slightly away from the city centre, heading east, Forlanini Park is characterized by a large pond and a few preserved shacks which remind of the area's agricultural past. [ 80 ]
In addition, even though Milan is located in one of the most urbanised regions of Italy, it's surrounded by a belt of green areas and features numerous gardens even in its very centre. Since 1990, the farmlands and woodlands north (Parco Nord Milano) and south ( Parco Agricolo Sud Milano ) of the urban area have been protected as regional parks. West of the city, the Parco delle Cave (Sand pit park,) has been established on a neglected site where gravel and sand used to be extracted, featuring artificial lakes and woods.

With rapid industrialization in post-war years, the population of Milan peaked at 1,743,427 in 1973. [ 88 ]
Thereafter, during the following thirty years, almost one third of the population moved to the outer belt of new suburbs and satellite settlements that grew around the city proper. There were an estimated 1,324,169 official residents in the commune of Milan at the end of 2013. [ 2 ]
However, Milan's continuous urban area extends beyond the borders of its administrative commune and was home to 5,264,000 people in 2013, [ 4 ]
while its wider
metropolitan area
has a population of between 7 [ 5 ]
and 10 [ 8 ]
million depending on the definition used.
Ethnic groups
As of 2011, the Italian national institute of statistics
Istat
estimated that 236,855 foreign-born residents lived in Milan, [ 89 ]
representing almost 20% of the total resident population, a rapid increase from recent years levels. [ 90 ]
After World War II, Milan experienced two main distinct epochs of considerably high immigration: the first period, dating from the 1950s to the early 1970s, saw a large influx of immigrants from poorer and rural areas within Italy; the second period, starting from the late 1980s, has been characterized by the preponderance of foreign-born immigrants.
The early period coincided with the so-called Italian economic miracle of postwar years, an era of extraordinary growth based on rapid industrial expansion and great public works, that brought to the city a large influx of over 400,000 people, mainly from rural and overpopulated
Southern Italy . [ 1 ]
In the last three decades, the foreign born share of the population soared. Immigrants came mainly from
Africa
(in particular Egyptian, Moroccans, Senegalese, and Nigerian), and the former socialist countries of
Eastern Europe
(notably Albania, Romania, Ukraine, Macedonia, Moldova), in addition to a growing number of
Asians
(in particular Chinese, Sri Lankans and Filipinos) and
Latin Americans
(Mainly South Americans). At the beginning of the 1990s, Milan already had a population of foreign-born residents of approximately 58,000 (or 4% of the then population), that rose rapidly to over 117,000 by the end of the decade (about 9% of the total). [ 91 ]
Decades of continuing high immigration have made the city the most cosmopolitan and multicultural in Italy. Milan notably hosts the oldest and largest
Chinese community
in Italy, with almost 21,000 people in 2011. [ 90 ]
Situated in the
9th district , and centered on
Via Paolo Sarpi , an important commercial avenue, the Milanese Chinatown was originally established in the 1920s by immigrants from
Wencheng County , in the
Zhejiang
province, and used to operate small textile and leather workshops. [ 92 ]
Milan has also a substantial English-speaking community (more than 3,000 American, British and Australian expatriates [ 90 ] ), and several English schools and language publications, such as Hello Milano, Where Milano and
Easy Milano .

Milan's population, like that of Italy as a whole, is mostly
Catholic . It is the seat of the
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan . The city is also home to sizeable
Orthodox , [ 93 ]

Milan has its own historic Catholic rite known as the
Ambrosian Rite
(Italian:
Rito ambrosiano ). It varies slightly from the typical Catholic rite (the
Roman , used in all other western regions), with some differences in the
liturgy
and mass celebrations, in the Canons are Easter and Lent, in the colour of liturgical vestments, peculiar use of incense, marriage form, office for the dead, baptism by immersion, and in the calendar (for example, the date for the beginning of
lent
is celebrated some days after the common date, so the carnival has different date). The season of Advent is of six weeks duration and starts on the Sunday after the feast of Saint Martin (11 November). The Ambrosian rite is also practiced in other surrounding locations in Lombardy, parts of Piedmont and in the
Swiss
canton of
Ticino . The sounding of church bells uses a peculiar technique. Another important difference concerns the
liturgical music . The
Gregorian chant
was completely unused in Milan and surrounding areas, because the official one was its own
Ambrosian chant , definitively established by the
Council of Trent
(1545–1563) and earlier than the Gregorian. [ 100 ]
To preserve this music there has developed the unique
schola cantorum , a college, and an Institute called PIAMS (Pontifical Ambrosian Institute of Sacred Music), in partnership with the
Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music
(PIMS) in Rome. [ 101 ]
The Milan Synagogue was designed by
Luca Beltrami
in 1892. The Anglican Episcopal Church of All Saints Milan was built in 1896. In 2014 the City Council agreed on the construction of a
mosque
next to the area of the former sport venue
Palatrussardi . [ 102 ]

Milan is currently undergoing a great urban renewal.
FieraMilano , the historical city trade fair operator, owned a
fairground
known as " FieraMilanoCity ", which was dismantled to be house for a major
urban development ,
CityLife
district. The new trade exhibition center, built in the north-western suburb of
Rho

There was such a revolutionary change that Milan’s fashion exports accounted for $726 million (U.S. currency) in 1952, and by 1955 that number grew to $2.5 billion. [ 118 ]
Modern skyscrapers, such as the

Bruno Munari ,
Lucio Fontana ,
Enrico Castellani
and
Piero Manzoni
gathered in the city. [ 119 ]

Languages and literature
Main article:
Milanese literature
Monument to
Alessandro Manzoni
in Piazza San Fedele.
In the late 18th century, and throughout the 19th, Milan was an important centre for intellectual discussion and literary creativity. The
Enlightenment
found here a fertile ground.
Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria , with his famous
Dei delitti e delle pene , and Count
Pietro Verri , with the periodical
Il Caffè
were able to exert a considerable influence over the new
middle-class
culture, thanks also to an open-minded Austrian administration. In the first years of the 19th century, the ideals of the
Romantic movement
made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus
Romantic poetry . Here, too,
Giuseppe Parini , and
Ugo Foscolo
published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship. Foscolo's poem
Dei sepolcri
was inspired by a Napoleonic law that—against the will of many of its inhabitants—was being extended to the city. In the third decade of the 19th century,
Alessandro Manzoni
wrote his novel
I Promessi Sposi , considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre, and
Carlo Porta
wrote his poems in
Lombard Language . The periodical
Il Conciliatore
published articles by
Silvio Pellico ,
Giovanni Berchet ,
Ludovico di Breme , who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics. After the
Unification of Italy
in 1861, Milan lost its political importance; nevertheless it retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus
Realism
and
Naturalism
gave birth to an Italian movement,
Verismo . The greatest
verista
novelist,
Giovanni Verga , was born in Sicily but wrote his most important books in Milan.
In addition to Italian, approximately 2 million people in the Milan metropolitan area can speak the
Milanese dialect
or one of its
Western Lombard
variations. [ 125 ]
Cuisine

tomato
or
fish . Milanese traditional dishes includes
cotoletta alla milanese ,
a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese " Wienerschnitzel "). Other typical dishes are

(braised
veal
shank served with a condiment called
gremolata ),
risotto alla milanese
(with
saffron
and beef marrow),
busecca
(stewed

(fried spherical cookies) for
Carnival ,
colomba
(glazed cake shaped as a dove) for
Easter ,
