EPHESUS, TURKEY: A SPLENDOR OF ANTIQUITY
BY: JANET STEINBERG
"So much of Ephesus remains that, no one in one lifetime
with the volumes of knowledge could absorb it."   S. Turkoglu - E. Atalay
On our recent Crystal
Serenity cruise, Kusadasi was the port of choice as its gateway to the ancient
archaeological site of Ephesus.  Kusadasi, (pronounced koo-SHAHD-ah-sea) a lovely town on
the Aegean Sea, is a 25-minute drive through the Asia Minor countryside to the
fabled remains of the ancient city of Ephesus.

ISTANBUL, TURKEY: WHERE EAST MEETS WEST
BY: JANET STEINBERG
Who would have dreamed it?
Certainly, I could not have!
As a young girl, bored to death
in a geography class that spoke of sultans, straits, and seven continents, I
could never have dreamed where I would be six decades later.
THERE I
WAS...IN ISTANBUL
But there I was…sitting in a
genuine Ottoman Sultan’s palace on the continent of Europe, overlooking a
panoramic view of the majestic Bosphorus
Strait, and gazing at the coastline of
the continent of Asia, an almost veritable
stone’s throw away.  Yes, moments after
checking into the incredible Ciragan Palace Kempinski that is exactly what I
was doing.

CRYSTAL SERENITY: FROM THREE SEAS TO THREE 3 C’s
BY: JANET STEINBERG
THE THREE
SEAS:
AEGEAN…MEDITERRANEAN…ADRIATIC…
Three majestic, magnificent seas brought me triple delights
on my Crystal Serenity cruise from Istanbul, Turkey to Venice, Italy. In
addition to sailing me to far away places with strange sounding names (like
Kusadasi, Kotor, and Thira), these three seas afforded me a chance to enjoy
three of my favorite things
THE THREE C’s
CRYSTAL …
Let me make it Crystal clear that there is little wonder
why the readers of
Condé Nast Traveler
magazine rated Crystal Cruises the “Best Cruise
Line” (Mid-Sized) for 2011. The ultra-luxe cruise line’s score marks the
18 th
time the company has won its category--more than any other
cruise line, hotel, or resort in the magazine’s
history.

LAGUNA BEACH: PUTTIN’ ON THE RITZ
SoCal
So Cool: 50 Miles of Pure Pleasure
LAGUNA BEACH: PUTTIN’ ON
THE RITZ
BY: JANET STEINBERG
Part four of a series
On the last leg of our 50-mile Southern
California (SoCal) journey, we opted for three days of utter
indulgence.  Exhaustion was setting in
from all we had seen and done in the last ten days.  Therefore, we decided, it was time for a
truly hedonistic, sybaritic vacation in an idyllic sanctuary on the California
Riviera.
With that being said, we began our “operation
recovery” with an upgrade to the Captain’s Lounge on the Catalina Express
vessel that was to take us from Catalina Island to Dana Point.  This private lounge, available on only four
of the fleet’s boats, is located on the top deck directly behind the Captain.  Bloody Mary’s, Captain Tony, and a doting
stewardess were at our service as we pre-boarded and lounged on leather
banquettes in what seemed like our own private catamaran.
