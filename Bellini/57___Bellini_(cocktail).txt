Venice Food
A post on Venice food as promised! So sorry about the huge delay I’ve been busy with two art shows this month, my
post-graduate show
and
Out Of Sight .
Anyway, gelato is the most important food of Venice especially if you’re a broke student. I practically lived on it.
Small bakeries are great places to stop when you’re lost in Venice and tired after walking for hours.
Pasta at the supermarket in Venice :P
Fucking tiny lasagna. Beware of overpriced and touristy restaurants that serve tiny quantities of food. I paid twelve euros for this!
A chocolate shop :)
Hotel snacks before our night out. Also don’t forget to try lots of  Bellini , it’s an awesome mix of peach and champagne.
Cafe’s are a good place to grab a quick bite of affordable pizza and/or a sandwich when you’re on the go, which was most of the time for us since we were obsessed with seeing as much art as possible in six days.
