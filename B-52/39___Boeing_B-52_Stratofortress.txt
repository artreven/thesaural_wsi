Crosswind landing
Aircraft  are generally  directionally stable  and have a tendency to point into the wind direction. In situations where a  crosswind  is present, the aircraft will adopt a  yaw  orientation with respect to the runway and will drift laterally as it approaches the runway. These pose significant safety issues when safe operation of the  undercarriage  requires the body and the velocity of the aircraft to be aligned with the runway at touch down. The landing gear on the  B-52  included an unusual feature to counteract the problem: all landing gear bogies could be steered, allowing the aircraft to land with the wheels facing the direction of travel even if the nose was not pointed in the same direction.
crosswind landing
is a
landing
maneuver in which a significant component of the prevailing wind is perpendicular to the
runway
centerline.
