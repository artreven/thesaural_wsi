سی-۱۳۰ هرکولس
هواپیمای ترابری
نظامی با چهار موتور
توربوپراپ
است که توسط شرکت
لاکهید
در
آمریکا
طراحی و ساخته شده‌است.
سی-۱۳۰ یکی از موفق‌ترین
هواپیماهای نظامی
تاریخ به شمار می‌رود که تولید آن از اوایل دهه ۱۹۵۰ تاکنون ادامه یافته و در عملیاتهای نظامی، غیرنظامی و بشردوستانه بی‌شماری از آن استفاده شده‌است. این هواپیما که تا سال ۲۰۰۹ حدود ۲۳۰۰ فروند از آن ساخته شده طولانی‌ترین دوره تولید مستمر را در بین تمامی هواپیماهای نظامی به خود اختصاص داده‌است. در سال ۲۰۰۷ این هواپیما پنجمین هواپیمای نظامی (پس از
اینگلیش الکتریک کانبرا ،
بی-۵۲ ،
توپولف-۹۵
و
بوئینگ کی‌سی-۱۳۵ ) شد که به پنجاهمین سال فعالیت مستمر نظامی خود در کشور کاربر اصلی آن (آمریکا) رسیده‌است. سی-۱۳۰ مدتهاست که در بسیاری از کشورهای دنیا هواپیمای اصلی حمل‌ونقل تاکتیکی محسوب می‌شود. بیش از ۴۰ مدل و نسخه از هرکولس ساخته شده و در بیش از ۶۰ کشور دنیا فعالیت کرده‌اند.
سی-۱۳۰ تطبیق‌پذیری بالایی را در زمینه انجام نقش‌ها و ماموریت‌های متفاوت و متنوع از خود به نمایش گذاشته‌است و نسخه‌هایی از آن برای ماموریت‌هایی چون انتقال نیروها برای یورش هوابرد، جستجو و نجات، تحقیقات علمی، شناسایی آب‌وهوا، سوخت‌رسانی هوایی، گشت دریایی و آتش‌نشانی هوایی ساخته شده‌اند. حتی مدل مسلحی از این هواپیما با نام
ای‌سی-۱۳۰
با قدرت آتش فوق‌العاده برای ماموریت‌های
تهاجمی
ساخته شده‌است.

Developed into
Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules
The
Lockheed C-130 Hercules
is a four-engine
turboprop
military transport aircraft
designed and built originally by
Lockheed , now
Lockheed Martin . Capable of using unprepared
runways
for takeoffs and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop,
medivac , and cargo transport aircraft. The versatile
airframe
has found uses in a variety of other roles, including as a
gunship
( AC-130 ), for
airborne assault ,
search and rescue , scientific research support, weather reconnaissance,
aerial refueling ,
maritime patrol , and
aerial firefighting . It is now the main
tactical airlifter
for many military forces worldwide. Over 40 models and variants of the Hercules serve with more than 60 nations.
The C-130 entered service with U.S. in the 1950s, followed by Australia and others. During its years of service, the Hercules family has participated in numerous military, civilian and
humanitarian aid
operations. The family has the longest continuous production run of any military aircraft in history. In 2007, the C-130 became the fifth aircraft—after the
English Electric Canberra ,
Boeing B-52 Stratofortress ,
Tupolev Tu-95 , and
Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker , all designs with various forms of aviation
gas turbine
powerplants—to mark 50 years of continuous use with its original primary customer, in this case, the
United States Air Force . The C-130 is one of the few military aircraft to remain in continuous production for over 50 years with its original customer, as the updated
C-130J Super Hercules .

(February 2014)
Background and requirements
The
Korean War , which began in June 1950, showed that
World War II -era
piston-engine
transports— Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars ,
Douglas C-47 Skytrains
and
Curtiss C-46 Commandos —were inadequate for modern warfare. Thus, on 2 February 1951, the
United States Air Force
issued a General Operating Requirement (GOR) for a new transport to
Boeing ,
Douglas ,
Fairchild ,
Lockheed ,
Martin ,
Chase Aircraft ,
North American ,
Northrop , and
Airlifts Inc . The new transport would have a capacity of 92 passengers, 72 combat troops or 64 paratroopers in a cargo compartment that was approximately 41 feet (12 m) long, 9 feet (2.7 m) high, and 10 feet (3.0 m) wide. Unlike transports derived from passenger airliners, it was to be designed from the ground-up as a combat transport with loading from a hinged loading ramp at the rear of the fuselage.
A key feature was the introduction of the
Allison T56
turboprop
powerplant, first developed specifically for the C-130. At the time, the turboprop was a new application of
turbine engines
that used exhaust gases to turn a propeller, which offered greater range at propeller-driven speeds compared to pure
turbojets , which were faster but consumed more fuel. As was the case on helicopters of that era, such as the UH-1 Huey,
turboshafts
produced much more power for their weight than piston
engines . Lockheed would subsequently use the same engines and technology in the
Lockheed L-188 Electra . That aircraft failed financially in its civilian configuration but was successfully adapted into the
Lockheed P-3 Orion
maritime patrol and submarine attack aircraft where the efficiency and endurance of turboprops excelled.
Design phase
The Hercules resembled a larger four-engine brother to the
C-123 Provider
with a similar wing and cargo ramp layout that evolved from the
Chase XCG-20 Avitruc , which in turn, was first designed and flown as a cargo glider in 1947. [ 4 ]
The
Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter
also had a rear ramp, which made it possible to drive vehicles onto the plane (also possible with forward ramp on a
C-124 ). The ramp on the Hercules was also used to airdrop cargo, which included low-altitude extraction for
Sheridan tanks
and even dropping large improvised " daisy cutter " bombs.
The new Lockheed cargo plane design possessed a range of 1,100 nmi (1,270 mi; 2,040 km), takeoff capability from short and unprepared strips, and the ability to fly with one engine shut down. Fairchild, North American, Martin, and Northrop declined to participate. The remaining five companies tendered a total of ten designs: Lockheed two, Boeing one, Chase three, Douglas three, and Airlifts Inc. one. The contest was a close affair between the lighter of the two Lockheed (preliminary project designation L-206) proposals and a four-turboprop Douglas design.
The Lockheed design team was led by
Willis Hawkins , starting with a 130-page proposal for the
Lockheed L-206 . [ 5 ]
Hall Hibbard , Lockheed vice president and chief engineer, saw the proposal and directed it to
Kelly Johnson , who did not care for the low-speed, unarmed aircraft, and remarked, "If you sign that letter, you will destroy the Lockheed Company." [ 5 ]
Both Hibbard and Johnson signed the proposal and the company won the contract for the now-designated Model 82 on 2 July 1951. [ 6 ]
The first flight of the
YC-130
prototype
was made on 23 August 1954 from the
Lockheed
plant in
Burbank , California. The aircraft,
serial number
53-3397 , was the second prototype, but the first of the two to fly. The YC-130 was piloted by Stanley Beltz and Roy Wimmer on its 61-minute flight to
Edwards Air Force Base ;
Jack Real
and Dick Stanton served as flight engineers. Kelly Johnson flew chase in a
Lockheed P2V Neptune . [ 7 ]
After the two prototypes were completed, production began in
Marietta , Georgia, where over 2,300 C-130s have been built through 2009. [ 8 ]
The initial production model, the
C-130A , was powered by
Allison T56 -A-9 turboprops with three-blade
propellers
and originally equipped with the blunt nose of the prototypes. Deliveries began in December 1956, continuing until the introduction of the
C-130B
model in 1959. Some A models were re-designated
C-130D
after being equipped with
skis . The newer C-130B had
ailerons
with increased boost—3,000  psi
(21 MPa) versus 2,050 psi (14 MPa)—as well as uprated engines and four-bladed propellers that were standard until the J-model's introduction.
Improved versions

As the C-130A became operational with
Tactical Air Command
(TAC), the C-130's lack of range became apparent and additional fuel capacity was added in the form of external pylon-mounted tanks at the end of the wings.
The C-130B model was developed to complement the A models that had previously been delivered, and incorporated new features, particularly increased fuel capacity in the form of auxiliary tanks built into the center wing section and an AC electrical system. Four-bladed Hamilton Standard propellers replaced the Aeroproducts three-bladed propellers that distinguished the earlier A-models. An electronic reconnaissance variant of the C-130B was designated C-130B-II. A total of 13 aircraft were converted. The C-130B-II was distinguished by its false external wing fuel tanks, which were disguised signals intelligence (SIGINT) receiver antennas. These pods were slightly larger than the standard wing tanks found on other C-130Bs. Most aircraft featured a swept blade antenna on the upper fuselage, as well as extra wire antennas between the vertical fin and upper fuselage not found on other C-130s. Radio call numbers on the tail of these aircraft were regularly changed so as to confuse observers and disguise their true mission.
The extended-range
C-130E
model entered service in 1962 after it was developed as an interim long-range transport for the Military Air Transport Service. Essentially a B-model, the new designation was the result of the installation of 1,360 US
gal
(5,150 L)
Sargent Fletcher
external fuel tanks under each wing's midsection and more powerful
Allison
T56-A-7A turboprops. The hydraulic boost pressure to the
ailerons
was reduced back to 2050 psi as a consequence of the external tanks' weight in the middle of the wingspan. The E model also featured structural improvements,
avionics
upgrades and a higher gross weight. Australia took delivery of 12 C130E Hercules during 1966–67 to supplement the 12 C-130A models already in service with the RAAF. Sweden and Spain fly the TP-84T version of the C-130E fitted for aerial refueling capability.
Refueling versions
The
KC-130
tankers , originally
C-130F s procured for the
US Marine Corps
(USMC) in 1958 (under the designation
GV-1 ) are equipped with a removable 3,600 US gal (13,626 l)
stainless steel
fuel tank
carried inside the cargo compartment. The two wing-mounted hose and drogue aerial refueling pods each transfer up to 300 US gal per minute (19 l per second) to two aircraft simultaneously, allowing for rapid cycle times of multiple-receiver aircraft formations, (a typical tanker formation of four aircraft in less than 30 minutes). The
US Navy 's
C-130G
has increased structural strength allowing higher gross weight operation.
More improvements
Royal Australian Air Force
C-130H, 2007
The
C-130H
model has updated Allison T56-A-15 turboprops, a redesigned outer
wing , updated avionics and other minor improvements. Later
H
models had a new, fatigue-life-improved, center wing that was retrofitted to many earlier H-models. For structural reasons, some models are required to land with certain amounts of fuel when carrying heavy cargo, reducing usable range. [ 9 ]
The H model remains in widespread use with the
United States Air Force
(USAF) and many foreign air forces. Initial deliveries began in 1964 (to the
RNZAF ), remaining in production until 1996. An improved C-130H was introduced in 1974, with Australia purchasing 12 of type in 1978 to replace the original 12 C-130A models, which had first entered RAAF Service in 1958.
The United States Coast Guard employs the HC-130H for long-range search and rescue, drug interdiction, illegal migrant patrols, homeland security, and logistics.
C-130H models produced from 1992 to 1996 were designated as C-130H3 by the USAF. The "3" denoting the third variation in design for the H series. Improvements included ring laser gyros for the INUs, GPS receivers, a partial
glass cockpit
(ADI and HSI instruments), a more capable APN-241 color radar,
night vision device
compatible instrument lighting, and an integrated radar and missile warning system. The electrical system upgrade included Generator Control Units (GCU) and Bus Switching units (BSU)to provide stable power to the more sensitive upgraded components. [ citation needed ]
Royal Air Force
C-130K (C.3)
The equivalent model for export to the UK is the
C-130K , known by the
Royal Air Force
(RAF) as the
Hercules C.1 . The
C-130H-30
( Hercules C.3
in RAF service) is a stretched version of the original Hercules, achieved by inserting a 100 in (2.54 m) plug aft of the cockpit and an 80 in (2.03 m) plug at the rear of the fuselage. A single C-130K was purchased by the
Met Office
for use by its Meteorological Research Flight, where it was classified as the
Hercules W.2 . This aircraft was heavily modified (with its most prominent feature being the long red and white striped atmospheric probe on the nose and the move of the weather radar into a pod above the forward fuselage). This aircraft, named
Snoopy , was withdrawn in 2001 and was then modified by
Marshall of Cambridge Aerospace
as flight-testbed for the
A400M
turbine engine, the
TP400 . The C-130K is used by the
RAF Falcons
for parachute drops. Three C-130K (Hercules C Mk.1P) were upgraded and sold to the Austrian Air Force in 2002. [ 10 ]
Later models
The
MC-130E Combat Talon
was developed for the USAF during the
Vietnam War
to support
special operations
missions in Southeast Asia, and led to both the
MC-130H Combat Talon II
as well as a family of other special missions aircraft. 37 of the earliest models currently operating with the
Air Force Special Operations Command
(AFSOC) are scheduled to be replaced by new-production MC-130J versions. The
EC-130 Commando Solo
is another special missions variant within AFSOC, albeit operated solely by an AFSOC-gained wing in the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard , and is a psychological operations/information operations (PSYOP/IO) platform equipped as an aerial radio station and television stations able to transmit messaging over commercial frequencies. Other versions of the
EC-130 , most notably the
EC-130H Compass Call , are also special variants, but are assigned to the
Air Combat Command
(ACC). The
AC-130 gunship
was first developed during the
Vietnam War
to provide
close air support
and other
ground-attack
duties.
USAF HC-130P refuels a
HH-60G Pavehawk
helicopter
The
HC-130
is a family of long-range search and rescue variants used by the USAF and the U.S. Coast Guard. Equipped for deep deployment of
Pararescuemen
(PJs), survival equipment, and (in the case of USAF versions) aerial refueling of combat rescue helicopters, HC-130s are usually the on-scene command aircraft for combat SAR missions (USAF only) and non-combat SAR (USAF and USCG). Early USAF versions were also equipped with the
Fulton surface-to-air recovery system , designed to pull a person off the ground using a wire strung from a helium balloon. The John Wayne movie
The Green Berets
features its use. The Fulton system was later removed when aerial refueling of helicopters proved safer and more versatile. The movie
The Perfect Storm
depicts a real life SAR mission involving aerial refueling of a
New York Air National Guard
HH-60G
by a New York Air National Guard HC-130P.
The
C-130R
and
C-130T
are U.S. Navy and USMC models, both equipped with underwing external fuel tanks. The USN C-130T is similar, but has additional avionics improvements. In both models, aircraft are equipped with Allison T56-A-16 engines. The USMC versions are designated
KC-130R
or
KC-130T
when equipped with underwing refueling pods and pylons and are fully
night vision
system compatible.
The RC-130 is a
reconnaissance
version. A single example is used by the
Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force , the aircraft having originally been sold to the former
Imperial Iranian Air Force .
The
Lockheed L-100 (L-382)
is a civilian variant, equivalent to a C-130E model without military equipment. The L-100 also has two stretched versions.
Next generation
Main article:
Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules
In the 1970s, Lockheed proposed a C-130 variant with
turbofan
engines rather than turboprops, but the U.S. Air Force preferred the takeoff performance of the existing aircraft. In the 1980s, the C-130 was intended to be replaced by the
Advanced Medium STOL Transport
project. The project was canceled and the C-130 has remained in production.
Building on lessons learned, Lockheed Martin modified a commercial variant of the C-130 into a High Technology Test Bed (HTTB). This test aircraft set numerous short takeoff and landing performance records and significantly expanded the database for future derivatives of the C-130. [ 11 ]
Modifications made to the HTTB included extended chord ailerons, a long chord rudder, fast-acting double-slotted trailing edge flaps, a high-camber wing leading edge extension, a larger dorsal fin and dorsal fins, the addition of three spoiler panels to each wing upper surface, a long-stroke main and nose landing gear system, and changes to the flight controls and a change from direct mechanical linkages assisted by hydraulic boost, to fully powered controls, in which the mechanical linkages from the flight station controls operated only the hydraulic control valves of the appropriate boost unit. [ 12 ]
The HTTB first flew on 19 June 1984, with civil registration of N130X. After demonstrating many new technologies, some of which were applied to the C-130J, the HTTB was lost in a fatal accident on 3 February 1993, at
Dobbins Air Reserve Base , in Marietta, Georgia. [ 13 ]
The crash was attributed to disengagement of the rudder fly-by-wire flight control system, resulting in a total loss of rudder control capability while conducting ground minimum control speed tests (Vmcg). The disengagement was a result of the inadequate design of the rudder's integrated actuator package by its manufacturer; the operator's insufficient system safety review failed to consider the consequences of the inadequate design to all operating regimes. A factor which contributed to the accident was the flight crew's lack of engineering flight test training. [ 14 ]
In the 1990s, the improved
C-130J Super Hercules
was developed by Lockheed (later Lockheed Martin). This model is the newest version and the only model in production. Externally similar to the classic Hercules in general appearance, the J model has new turboprop engines, six-bladed propellers, digital avionics, and other new systems. [ 15 ]
Upgrades and changes
In 2000, Boeing was awarded a
US$1.4 billion
contract to develop an Avionics Modernization Program kit for the C-130. The program was beset with delays and cost overruns until project restructuring in 2007. [ 16 ]
On 2 September 2009,
Bloomberg
news reported that the planned Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) upgrade to the older C-130s would be dropped to provide more funds for the F-35, CV-22 and airborne tanker replacement programs. [ 17 ]
However, in June 2010,
Department of Defense
approved funding for the initial production of the AMP upgrade kits. [ 18 ] [ 19 ]
Under the terms of this agreement, the USAF has cleared Boeing to begin low-rate initial production (LRIP) for the C-130 AMP. A total of 198 aircraft are expected to feature the AMP upgrade. The current cost per aircraft is
US$14 million
although Boeing expects that this price will drop to US$7 million for the 69th aircraft. [ 16 ]
An engine enhancement program saving fuel and providing lower temperatures in the T56 engine has been approved, and the US Air Force expects to save $2 billion and extend the fleet life. [ 20 ]
Replacement
In October 2010, the Air Force released a capabilities request for information (CRFI) for the development of a new airlifter to replace the C-130. The new aircraft is to carry a 190 percent greater payload and assume the mission of mounted vertical maneuver (MVM). The greater payload and mission would enable it to carry medium-weight armored vehicles and drop them off at locations without long runways. Various options are being considered, including new or upgraded fixed-wing designs, rotorcraft,
tiltrotors , or even an
airship . Development could start in 2014, and become operational by 2024. The C-130 fleet of around 450 planes would be replaced by only 250 aircraft. [ 21 ]
The Air Force had attempted to replace the C-130 in the 1970s through the
Advanced Medium STOL Transport
project, which resulted in the
C-17 Globemaster III
that instead replaced the
C-141 Starlifter . [ 22 ]
The
Air Force Research Laboratory
funded Lockheed and Boeing demonstrators for the
Speed Agile
concept, which had the goal of making a STOL aircraft that can take off and land at speeds as low as 70 kn (130 km/h; 81 mph) on airfields less than 2,000 ft (610 m) long and cruise at Mach 0.8-plus. Boeing's design used upper-surface blowing from embedded engines on the inboard wing and blown flaps for circulation control on the outboard wing. Lockheed's design also used blown flaps outboard, but inboard used patented reversing ejector nozzles. Boeing's design completed over 2,000 hours of windtunnel tests in late 2009. It was a 5 percent-scale model of a narrowbody design with a 55,000 lb (25,000 kg) payload. When the AFRL increased the payload requirement to 65,000 lb (29,000 kg), they tested a 5% scale model of a widebody design with a 303,000 lb (137,000 kg) take-off gross weight and an " A400M -size" 158 in (4.0 m) wide cargo box. It would be powered by four
IAE V2533
turbofans. [ 23 ]
In August 2011, the AFRL released pictures of the Lockheed Speed Agile concept demonstrator. A 23% scale model went through wind tunnel tests to demonstrate its hybrid powered lift, which combines a low drag airframe with simple mechanical assembly to reduce weight and better aerodynamics. The model had four engines, including two
Williams FJ44
turbofans. [ 22 ] [ 24 ]
On 26 March 2013, Boeing was granted a patent for its swept-wing powered lift aircraft. [ 25 ]
As of January 2014,
Air Mobility Command ,
Air Force Materiel Command
and the
Air Force Research Lab
are in the early stages of defining requirements for the
C-X
next generation airlifter program to replace both the C-130 and C-17. An aircraft would be produced from the early 2030s to the 2040s. If requirements are decided for operating in contested airspace, Air Force procurement of C-130s would end by the end of the decade to not have them serviceable by the 2030s and operated when they can't perform in that environment. Development of the airlifter depends heavily on the Army's "tactical and operational maneuver" plans. Two different cargo planes could still be created to separately perform tactical and strategic missions, but which course to pursue is to be decided before C-17s need to be retired. [ 26 ]

Military
USMC KC-130F Hercules performing takeoffs and landings aboard the aircraft carrier
Forrestal
in 1963. The aircraft is now displayed at the
National Museum of Naval Aviation .
The first production aircraft, C-130As were first delivered beginning in 1956 to the
463d Troop Carrier Wing
at
Ardmore AFB , Oklahoma and the
314th Troop Carrier Wing
at
Sewart AFB , Tennessee. Six additional squadrons were assigned to the
322d Air Division
in Europe and the
315th Air Division
in the Far East. Additional aircraft were modified for electronics intelligence work and assigned to
Rhein-Main Air Base , Germany while modified RC-130As were assigned to the
Military Air Transport Service
(MATS) photo-mapping division.
In 1958, a U.S. reconnaissance C-130A-II of the
7406th Support Squadron
was
shot down over Armenia
by
MiG-17s . [ 27 ]
Australia became the first non-American force to
operate the C-130A Hercules
with 12 examples being delivered from late 1958. These aircraft were fitted with AeroProducts three-blade, 15-foot diameter propellers. The
Royal Canadian Air Force
became another early user with the delivery of four B-models (Canadian designation C-130 Mk I) in October / November 1960. [ 28 ]
In 1963, a Hercules achieved and still holds the record for the largest and heaviest aircraft to land on an
aircraft carrier . [ 29 ]
During October and November that year, a USMC KC-130F (BuNo
149798 ), loaned to the U.S. Naval Air Test Center, made 29
touch-and-go landings , 21
unarrested
full-stop landings and 21 unassisted take-offs on
Forrestal
at a number of different weights. [ 30 ]
The pilot, LT (later
RADM )
James H. Flatley III , USN, was awarded the
Distinguished Flying Cross
for his role in this test series. The tests were highly successful, but the idea was considered too risky for routine " Carrier Onboard Delivery " (COD) operations. Instead, the
Grumman C-2 Greyhound
was developed as a dedicated COD aircraft. The Hercules used in the test, most recently in service with Marine Aerial Refueler Squadron 352 ( VMGR-352 ) until 2005, is now part of the collection of the
National Museum of Naval Aviation
at
NAS Pensacola , Florida.
In 1964, C-130 crews from the 6315th Operations Group at
Naha Air Base , Okinawa commenced
forward air control
(FAC; "Flare") missions over the
Ho Chi Minh Trail
in Laos supporting USAF strike aircraft. In April 1965 the mission was expanded to
North Vietnam
where C-130 crews led formations of
B-57
bombers on night reconnaissance/strike missions against communist supply routes leading to South Vietnam. In early 1966 Project Blind Bat/Lamplighter was established at
Ubon
RTAFB,
Thailand . After the move to Ubon the mission became a four-engine FAC mission with the C-130 crew searching for targets then calling in strike aircraft. Another little-known C-130 mission flown by Naha-based crews was
Operation
Commando Scarf , which involved the delivery of chemicals onto sections of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos that were designed to produce mud and landslides in hopes of making the truck routes impassable. [ citation needed ]
In November 1964, on the other side of the globe, C-130Es from the 464th Troop Carrier Wing but loaned to
322d Air Division
in France, flew one of the most dramatic missions in history in the former
Belgian Congo . After communist
Simba rebels
took white residents of the city of
Stanleyville
hostage,
the U.S. and Belgium developed a joint rescue mission
that used the C-130s to airlift and then drop and air-land a force of
Belgian
paratroopers to rescue the hostages. Two missions were flown, one over Stanleyville and another over
Paulis
during Thanksgiving weeks. [ 31 ]
The headline-making mission resulted in the first award of the prestigious
MacKay Trophy
to C-130 crews.
In the
Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 , as a desperate measure the transport No. 6 Squadron of the
Pakistan Air Force
modified its entire small fleet of C-130Bs for use as heavy bombers, capable of carrying up to 20,000 lbs (9,072 kg) of bombs on pallets. These improvised bombers were used to hit Indian targets such as bridges, heavy artillery positions, tank formations and troop concentrations. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]
Some C-130s even flew with anti-aircraft guns fitted on their ramp, apparently shooting down some 17 aircraft and damaging 16 others. [ 34 ]
The C-130 Hercules were used in the
Battle of Kham Duc
in 1968, when the North Vietnamese Army forced U.S.-led forces to abandon the Kham Duc Special Forces Camp.
In October 1968, a C-130Bs from the 463rd Tactical Airlift Wing dropped a pair of
M-121
10,000 pound bombs that had been developed for the massive
B-36
bomber but had never been used. The U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force resurrected the huge weapons as a means of clearing landing zones for helicopters and in early 1969 the 463rd commenced
Commando Vault
missions. Although the stated purpose of COMMANDO VAULT was to clear LZs, they were also used on enemy base camps and other targets. [ citation needed ]
During the late 1960s, the U.S. was eager to get information on Chinese nuclear capabilities. After the failure of the
Black Cat Squadron
to plant operating sensor pods near the
Lop Nur
Nuclear Weapons Test Base using a
Lockheed U-2 , the
CIA
developed a plan, named
Heavy Tea , to deploy two battery-powered sensor pallets near the base. To deploy the pallets, a
Black Bat Squadron
crew was trained in the U.S. to fly the C-130 Hercules. The crew of 12, led by Col Sun Pei Zhen, took off from
Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base
in an unmarked U.S. Air Force C-130E on 17 May 1969. Flying for six and a half hours at low altitude in the dark, they arrived over the target and the sensor pallets were dropped by parachute near Anxi in Gansu province. After another six and a half hours of low altitude flight, they arrived back at Takhli. The sensors worked and uploaded data to a U.S. intelligence satellite for six months, before their batteries wore out. The Chinese conducted two nuclear tests, on 22 September 1969 and 29 September 1969, during the operating life of the sensor pallets. Another mission to the area was planned as Operation
Golden Whip , but was called off in 1970. [ 35 ]
It is most likely that the aircraft used on this mission was either C-130E serial number 64-0506 or 64-0507 (cn 382-3990 and 382-3991). These two aircraft were delivered to
Air America
in 1964. [ 36 ]
After being returned to the U.S. Air Force sometime between 1966 and 1970, they were assigned the serial numbers of C-130s that had been destroyed in accidents. 64-0506 is now flying as 62-1843, a C-130E that crashed in Vietnam on 20 December 1965 and 64-0507 is now flying as 63-7785, a C-130E that had crashed in Vietnam on 17 June 1966. [ 37 ]
The A-model continued in service through the
Vietnam War , where the aircraft assigned to the four squadrons at
Naha AB , Okinawa and one at
Tachikawa Air Base , Japan performed yeoman's service, including operating highly classified special operations missions such as the BLIND BAT FAC/Flare mission and FACT SHEET leaflet mission over Laos and North Vietnam. The A-model was also provided to the South Vietnamese Air Force as part of the Vietnamization program at the end of the war, and equipped three squadrons based at
Tan Son Nhut AFB . The last operator in the world is the
Honduran Air Force , which is still flying one of five A model Hercules (FAH
558 , c/n 3042) as of October 2009. [ 38 ]
As the Vietnam War wound down, the 463rd Troop Carrier/Tactical Airlift Wing B-models and A-models of the 374th Tactical Airlift Wing were transferred back to the United States where most were assigned to
Air Force Reserve
and
Air National Guard
units.
U.S. Marines disembark from C-130 transports at the
Da Nang Airbase
on 8 March 1965
Another prominent role for the B model was with the
United States Marine Corps , where Hercules initially designated as GV-1s replaced C-119s. After Air Force C-130Ds proved the type's usefulness in
Antarctica , the U.S. Navy purchased a number of B-models equipped with skis that were designated as LC-130s. C-130B-II electronic reconnaissance aircraft were operated under the SUN VALLEY program name primarily from Yokota Air Base, Japan. All reverted to standard C-130B cargo aircraft after their replacement in the reconnaissance role by other aircraft.
The C-130 was also used in the 1976
Entebbe raid
in which
Israeli
commando
forces carried a surprise assault to rescue 103 passengers of an airliner hijacked by
Palestinian
and German terrorists at
Entebbe Airport , Uganda. The rescue force — 200 soldiers, jeeps, and a black
Mercedes-Benz
(intended to resemble Ugandan
Dictator
Idi Amin 's vehicle of state) — was flown over 2,200 nmi (4,074 km; 2,532 mi) almost entirely at an altitude of less than 100 ft (30 m) from Israel to Entebbe by four
Israeli Air Force
(IAF) Hercules aircraft without mid-air refueling (on the way back, the planes refueled in
Nairobi , Kenya).
During the
Falklands War
( Spanish :
Guerra de las Malvinas ) of 1982,
Argentine Air Force
C-130s undertook highly dangerous, daily re-supply night flights as blockade runners to the Argentine garrison on the
Falkland Islands . They also performed daylight maritime survey flights. One
was lost
during the war. Argentina also operated two KC-130
tankers
during the war, and these refueled both the
Douglas A-4 Skyhawks
and Navy
Dassault-Breguet Super Étendards ; some C-130s were modified to operate as bombers with bomb-racks under their wings. The British also used RAF C-130s to support their logistical operations.

During the
Gulf War
of 1991 ( Operation
Desert Storm ), the C-130 Hercules was used operationally by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, along with the air forces of Australia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the UK. The
MC-130 Combat Talon
variant also made the first attacks using the largest conventional
bombs
in the world, the
BLU-82
"Daisy Cutter" and
GBU-43/B
"Massive Ordnance Air Blast" bomb, (MOAB). Daisy Cutters were used to clear landing zones and to eliminate
mine fields . The weight and size of the weapons make it impossible or impractical to load them on conventional
bombers . The GBU-43/B MOAB is a successor to the BLU-82 and can perform the same function, as well as perform strike functions against hardened targets in a low air threat environment.
Since 1992, two successive C-130 aircraft named
Fat Albert
have served as the support aircraft for the U.S. Navy
Blue Angels
flight demonstration team.
Fat Albert I
was a
TC-130 G ( 151891 ), [ 39 ]
while
Fat Albert II
is a C-130T ( 164763 ). [ 40 ]
Although
Fat Albert
supports a Navy squadron, it is operated by the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) and its crew consists solely of USMC personnel. At some
air shows
featuring the team,
Fat Albert
takes part, performing flyovers. Until 2009, it also demonstrated its
rocket-assisted takeoff
(RATO) capabilities; these ended due to dwindling supplies of rockets. [ 41 ]
The AC-130 also holds the record for the longest sustained flight by a C-130. From 22 to 24 October 1997, two AC-130U gunships flew 36 hours nonstop from Hurlburt Field Florida to Taegu (Daegu), South Korea while being refueled seven times by KC-135 tanker aircraft. This record flight shattered the previous record longest flight by over 10 hours while the two gunships took on 410,000 lb (190,000 kg) of fuel. The gunship has been used in every major U.S. combat operation since Vietnam, except for
Operation
El Dorado Canyon , the 1986 attack on Libya. [ 42 ]

During the
invasion of Afghanistan in 2001
and the ongoing support of the
International Security Assistance Force
( Operation
Enduring Freedom ), the C-130 Hercules has been used operationally by Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, the UK and the United States.
During the
2003 invasion of Iraq
( Operation
Iraqi Freedom ), the C-130 Hercules was used operationally by Australia, the UK and the United States. After the initial invasion, C-130 operators as part of the
Multinational force in Iraq
used their C-130s to support their forces in Iraq.
Since 2004, the Pakistan Air Force has employed C-130s in the
War in North-West Pakistan . Some variants had
forward looking infrared
(FLIR Systems Star Safire III EO/IR) sensor balls, to enable close tracking of
Islamist
militants. [ 43 ]

The
U.S. Forest Service
developed the
Modular Airborne FireFighting System
for the C-130 in the 1970s, which allows regular aircraft to be temporarily converted to an
airtanker
for fighting
wildfires . [ 44 ]
In the late 1980s, 22 retired USAF C-130As were removed from storage at
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base
and transferred to the U.S. Forest Service who then sold them to six private companies to be converted into air tankers (see
U.S. Forest Service airtanker scandal ). After one of these aircraft crashed due to wing separation in flight as a result of fatigue stress cracking, the entire fleet of C-130A air tankers was permanently grounded in 2004 (see
2002 airtanker crashes ). C-130s have been used to spread chemical dispersants onto the massive oil slick in the Gulf Coast in 2010. [ 45 ]
A recent development of a C-130–based
airtanker
is the
Retardant Aerial Delivery System
developed by
Coulson Aviation USA . The system consists of a C-130H/Q retrofitted with an in-floor discharge system, combined with a removable 3,500- or 4,000-gallon water tank. The combined system is FAA certified. [ 46 ]

List of accidents and incidents involving the Lockheed C-130 Hercules
The C-130 Hercules has had a low accident rate in general. The Royal Air Force recorded an accident rate of about one aircraft loss per 250,000 flying hours over the last 40 years, placing it behind
Vickers VC10s
and
Lockheed TriStars
with no flying losses. [ 54 ]
USAF C-130A/B/E-models had an overall attrition rate of 5% as of 1989 as compared to 1-2% for commercial airliners in the U.S., according to the
NTSB , 10% for
B-52
bombers, and 20% for fighters ( F-4 ,
F-111 ), trainers ( T-37 ,
T-38 ), and helicopters ( H-3 ). [ 55 ]
A total of 70 aircraft were lost by the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Marine Corps during combat operations in the Vietnam War in Southeast Asia. By the nature of the Hercules' worldwide service, the pattern of losses provides an interesting barometer of the global hot spots over the past 50 years. [ 56 ]

C-130E, AF Ser. No. 62-1787; on display at the
National Museum of the United States Air Force ,
Wright-Patterson AFB , Ohio, was flown to the museum on 18 August 2011. One of the greatest feats of heroism during the
Vietnam War
involved the C-130E, call sign "Spare 617". [ N 1 ]
The C-130E attempted to airdrop ammunition to surrounded South Vietnamese forces at An Loc, Vietnam. Approaching the drop zone, Spare 617 received heavy enemy ground fire that damaged two engines, ruptured a bleed air duct in the cargo compartment, and set the ammunition on fire. Flight engineer TSgt Sanders was killed, and navigator 1st Lt Lenz and co-pilot 1st Lt Hering were both wounded. Despite receiving severe burns from hot air escaping from the damaged air bleed duct, loadmaster TSgt Shaub extinguished a fire in the cargo compartment, and successfully jettisoned the cargo pallets, which exploded in mid-air. Despite losing a third engine on final approach, pilot Capt Caldwell landed Spare 617 safely. For their actions, Caldwell and Shaub received the
Air Force Cross , the U.S. Air Force's second highest award for valor. TSgt Shaub also received the William H. Pitsenbarger Award for Heroism from the
Air Force Sergeants Association . [ 67 ]
