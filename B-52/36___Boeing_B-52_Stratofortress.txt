AVENGED
SEVENFOLD SET TO RETURN TO THE FAR AND MIDDLE EAST THIS SPRING
Avenged Sevenfold
announced today that they will be returning to the Far and Middle East
beginning April 16th in Tokyo, Japan, for a tour that will culminate in a
special show in Abu Dhabi, UAE on May 4th.
“We are excited
to go back to the Far and Middle East,” said Avenged Sevenfold front man M.
Shadows. "We played to some of the most amazing crowds when we toured the
album there, and we can't wait to bring our live show back to our friends in
those regions.”
Long time friends
Metallica have asked Avenged Sevenfold to perform at the first ever Orion Music
+ More at Bader Field in Atlantic City, NJ, on June 24th. M. Shadows had this
to say: "We really hadn't planned to play the United States in 2012. But
after Lars called to describe their plans for Orion and asked us to join them,
we decided there's no way we would miss it." The band toured with
Metallica in 2006 as part of Metallica’s “Escape From The Studio Tour” and that
year M. Shadows and Metallica’s James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich were featured
together on the cover of Revolver Magazine. 3 years later, Avenged Sevenfold toured
with Metallica on their “World Magnetic” tour.
In July 2010,
Avenged Sevenfold released their fifth studio album Nightmare, which earned the
band its highest-ever debut on the Billboard album chart when it bowed at No. 1
and topped the Rock, Hard Rock, and Digital charts. It has been certified gold
by the RIAA and has scanned upwards of 660,000 units. The album spawned three
hit singles – the gold-certified singles “Nightmare” and “Welcome To The
Family,” and “So Far Away” – each of which peaked at Number 1 on the Media Base
Active Rock chart. The title track was the most-played current song at Media
Base Active Rock for 2010. Avenged Sevenfold have toured incessantly on their
“Buried Alive” and “Welcome to the Family” tours selling out arenas around the
world. They also headlined the Uproar Tour and the first annual Carolina
Rebellion Festival in 2011 where the band played to a sold-out crowd of over
30,000 fans. The band also toured Iraq with the USO and has played to nearly
1,000,000 people in the last two years. Their breakout album City of Evil and
the Live In The LBC DVD have both been certified platinum and the band’s
self-titled album has been certified gold.

terpaksa berganti dari yang scream & growl menjadi lebih bernyanyi,
melodius dan sedikit scream dengan sedikit bantuan dari scream Jimmy The Rev.
Begitu juga di album keempat mereka “Self Titled”. Barulah di album terbaru
mereka yang berjudul “Nightmare”, Shadows mulai berani screaming lagi bahkan
lebih berat dan keras dibanding album Waking The Fallen, seperti di lagu God

Biografi :
Avenged Sevenfold
adalah grup musik yang awalnya beraliran heavy metal.
Belakangan, grup yang dibentuk di Huntington Beach, California pada 1999 ini
berubah aliran menjadi pop. Personelnya terdiri atas
M. Shadows
(vokal),
Synyster Gates
(lead guitar),
Zacky Vengeance
(guitar),
Johnny
Christ
(bass), dan
The Reverend
(drum). Serta dua mantan personelnya
Dameon Ash
dan Justin Sane yang telah hengkang dari grup ini.
Band ini terus mengeksplorasi suara baru dengan mengeluarkan yang berjudul
Avenged Sevenfold dan menikmati kesuksesan mainstream lanjutan sampai akhirnya
pada tanggal 28 Desember 2009,
Avenged Sevenfold
berduka. Sang drummer,
The
Reverend
atau bernama asli
James Owen Sullivan
meninggal.
Ia ditemukan sudah tak bernyawa di rumahnya, kawasan Huntington Beach.
Berdasarkan hasil otopsi,
Sullivan
dinyatakan meninggal karena penyakit
jantung dan dampak gabungan dari obat dan alkohol di tubuhnya pada tahun 2009.
Berita ini sempat membuat banyak insan musik, termasuk sahabat
Sullivan ,
Zacky Vegeance
sangat berduka.
Meskipun demikian, band ini melanjutkan dengan bantuan kemudian mantan drummer
Dream
Theater, Mike Portnoy
untuk merilis dan melakukan tur dalam mendukung
Nightmare, album kelima mereka pada tahun 2010 yang memulai debutnya di tempat
atas, Billboard 200 yang berada di tempat pertama.

Karir
Walaupun telah
terbentuk sejak tahun 1999, namun album pertama
Avenged Sevenfold , yang
berjudul
SOUNDING THE SEVENTH TRUMPET
baru dirilis tahun 2002.
Peluncuran album ini disusul album kedua
WAKING THE FALLEN (2003) . Dalam
album kedua grup ini tampil bersama
Xl Rose, Kylie Minogue
dan
Chris
Cornell . Disusul kemudian album
CITY OF EVIL (2005)
dan
AVENGED
SEVENFOLD (2007) .
Grup yang pernah mangung di Jakarta pada 7 Agustus 2007 itu, belakangan memilih
jalur musik pop. Hal ini, konon setelah menuai kritik akibat banyak karyanya
'mengadopsi' efek suara yang telah hit sebelumnya. Mereka mengaku heavy metal
tidak cocok bagi dirinya, dan lebih menyukai musik pop.
Sejak itu, band ini terus berkarya dan menelurkan berbagai album yang cukup
sukses diterima di pasaran. Di Indonesia sendiri,
Avenged Sevenfold
populer dengan singelnya yang berjudul
Dear God
yang sempat menjadi
single terlaris di pasaran musik Indonesia.
Sesaat setelah itu, kabar duka tentang meninggalnya
Sullivan
cukup
mempengaruhi karir
Avenged Sevenfold . Band ini seolah sangat terpukul
dengan kepergian salah satu personilnya tersebut. Namun setahun kemudian,
suasana duka tersebut teraktualisasi dalam sebuah karya yang bertajuk
NIGHMARE .
Salah satu singlenya,
Nightmare , sempat merajai pasaran dengan meraih
peringkat pertama dalam tangga Billboard.

Beberapa Lirik Lagu Avenged
Sevenfold
"Dear
God"
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love purpose hard to find
While I recall all the words you spoke to me
Can't help but wish that I was there
Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
to hold her when I'm not around
when I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
But I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again
There's nothing here for me on this barren road
There's no one here while the city sleeps
and all the shops are closed
Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
to hold her when I'm not around
when I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again
Some search, never finding a way
Before long, they waste away
I found you, something told me to stay
I gave in, to selfish ways
And how I miss someone to hold
when hope begins to fade...
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love purpose hard to find
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
to hold her when I'm not around
when I'm much too far away
We all need the person who can be true to you
I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again
"Scream"
Caught up in this madness too blind to see
Woke animal feelings in me
Took over my sense and I lost control
I'll taste your blood tonight
You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me baby
but know it's too late you've wasted all your time, yeah
Relax while you're closing your eyes to me
So warm as I'm setting you free
With your arms by your side there's no struggling
Pleasure's all mine this time
You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me baby
but know it's too late you've wasted all your time
Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency
Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure unmask your desire
perishing
We've all had a time where we've lost control
We've all had our time to grow
I'm hoping I'm wrong but I know I'm right
I'll hunt again one night
You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me baby
but know it's too late you've wasted all your time
Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency
Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure unmask your desire
perishing
Some live repressing their instinctive feelings
Protest the way we're built don't point the blame on me
Scream, Scream, Scream the way you would
if I ravaged your body
Scream, Scream, Scream the way you would
if I ravaged your mind
Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency
Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure unmask your desire
perishing
"So
Far Away"
Never feared for anything
Never shamed but never free
A life to heal the broken heart with all that it could
Lived a life so endlessly
Saw beyond what others see
I tried to heal your broken heart with all that I could
Will you stay?
Will you stay away forever?
How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away
Plans of what our futures hold
Foolish lies of growing old
It seems we're so invincible
The truth is so cold
A final song, a last request
A perfect chapter laid to rest
Now and then I try to find a place in my mind
Where you can stay
You can stay away forever
How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away
Sleep tight, I'm not afraid
The ones that we love are here with me
Lay away a place for me
Cause as soon as I'm done I'll be on my way
To live eternally
How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
And the light you left remains but it's so hard to stay
When I have so much to say but you're so far away
I love you
You were ready
The pain is strong and urges rise
But I'll see you
When He lets me
Your pain is gone, your hands untied
So far away
And I need you to know
So far away
And I need you to, need you to know
"Nightmare"
Nightmare!
(Now your nightmare comes to life)
Dragged ya down below, down to the devils show,
To be his guest forever (Peace of mind is less than never!)
Hate to twist your mind, but God ain't on your side,
An old acquaintance severed (burn the world your last endeavor!)
Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air,
Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head,
you're now a slave until the end of time here,
Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning, pull the trigger!
You should have known the price of evil,
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Oooooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare!
(While your nightmare comes to life)
Can't wake up in sweat, cause it ain't over yet,
still dancin' with your demons (Victim of your own creation)
Beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason (loathing self-assassination)
You've been lied to just to rape you of your site,
and now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)
So sedated as they medicate your brain
and while you slowly go insane the tell ya:
Given with the best intentions help you with your complications!
You should have known the price of evil,
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah.
No one to call, everybody to fear,
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah.
Oooooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare, ha-ha-ha-ha!
Fight (fight), not to fail (fail), not to fall (fall)
Or you'll end up like the others.
Die (die), die again (die), drenched in sin (sin)
With no respect for another.
Down (down), feel the fire (fire), feel the hate (hate)
Your pain is what we desire.
Lost (lost), hit the wall (wall), watch you crawl (crawl)
Such a replaceable liar.
And I know you hear their voices (calling from above),
And I know they may seem real (these signals of love),
But our life's made up from choices (some without appeal),
They took for granted your soul, and it's ours now to steal
(As your nightmare comes to life!)
You should have known the price of evil,
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah.
No one to call, everybody to fear,
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Oooooh, it's your fucking nightmare!

Sayang...
Aku berusaha menjadi yang terbaik untukmu

Karena cintaku yang begitu besar padamu

enjata Masa kini ;)

Feb
Hmm…oke kali ini kita bakal bahas masalah senjata.
Definisi senjata dalam otak saya adalah
segala sesuatu yang dapat kita andalkan disaat apapun. Pengertian itu ga
begitu melencengkan dari arti sebenarnya kan? karena arti sebenarnya
berdasarkan wikipedia “Senjata adalah suatu alat yang digunakan untuk
melukai, membunuh,
atau menghancurkan suatu benda. Senjata dapat digunakan untuk menyerang
maupun untuk mempertahankan diri, dan juga untuk mengancam dan
melindungi.”
Kira-kira beginilah gambaran senjata menurut banyak orang
Nah,klo itu kan dalam bentuk nyata…
Berhubung saya sedang terkena musibah minggu ini tiba-tiba saya terpikir
salah satu senjata yang luar biasa hebatnya dan saya telah saya gunakan
akhir-akhir ini namun bentuknya tidak nyata yaitu DOA.
Mengapa doa?saya akan menjelaskan alasannya :
1.      Doa dapat menjadi senjata saat sedih dan bingung
Percayalah dengan berdoa hati kita pasti
akan tenang. Saat kita tidak sedih,bingung harus mengungkapkan isi hati
kita kepada siapa karena tidak semua orang bisa terbuka akan masalahnya,
maka doa bisa menjadi senjata yang ampuh. Seperti yang saya alami saat
ini, saya tidak dapat menceritakan masalah saya kepada orangtua tapi
rasanya hati saya masih kurang tenang, lalu saya berdoa dan hasilnyaa
hati saya langsung tenang (maaf ya curhat,hehe)
Yuk kita lanjut ke alasan kedua kenapa saya bilang doa itu sebagai senjata
2.      Doa dapat menjadi senjata saat kita tertimpa musibah
Siapapun orangnya pasti tidak ingin
terkena musibah karena musibah hanya mengakibatkan ketidak tenangan hati
yang berakibat kesedihan. Musibah selalu datang tiba-tiba tanpa ada
yang dapat menghentikannya. Salah satu senjata yang paling ampuh untuk
meminimalisir,menghindari atau mencegah datangnya musibah adalah dengan
DOA.
Dalam Kitab Al-Hakim, Ibnul Qayyim al-Jauziyah diriwayatkan hadist dari Ibnu Umar RA bahwa Nabi Muhamad SAW bersabda,
‘Doa itu bermanfaat bagi musibah yang
telah turun dan yang belum turun. Oleh karena itu wahai hamba Allah,
kalian harus berdoa.’ (HR. Bukhari & Muslim).
Dan diriwayatkan Aisyah RA, bahwa Nabi Muhamad SAW bersabda,
‘Kewspadaanmu tidak ada gunanya dalam
menghadapi takdir. Berdoalah yang berguna untuk mengantisipasi musibah
yang turun maupun yang belum turun. Sesungguhnya musibah ketika turun
dihadapi oleh doa dan keduanya bertarung hingga hari kiamat.’ (HR.
Bukhari & Muslim).
3.      Doa dapat menjadi senjata untuk menyembuhkan sakit
Bagaimana mungkin dengan mudahnya berdoa dapat menyembuhkan penyakit?
Ya ternyata jaringan syaraf menunjukkan
bahwa doa mengaktifkan sistem limbik otak yang mengatur kesadaran
seseorang akan diri, waktu dan lingkungan. Metabolisme tubuh secara
menyeluruh juga bergerak menuju keseimbangan sekaligus mewujudkan
kesembuhan.
Menggali sumber-sumber psikoterapi dalam
doa dapat dilihat dalam formula yang dibaca dalam doa dapat mendatangkan
ketenangan jiwa, ketenangan jiwa inilah yang menyembuhkan dari
penyakit.  Hal ini disebabkan orang yang memanjatkan doa yakin Allah SWT
mengabulkan permintaannya.
Dan apabila hamba-hamba-Ku bertanya
kepadamu tentang Aku, maka (jawablah), bahwasanya Aku adalah dekat. Aku
mengabulkan permohonan orang yang mendoa apabila ia berdoa kepada-Ku,
maka hendaklah mereka itu memenuhi (segala perintah)-Ku dan hendaklah
mereka beriman kepada-Ku, agar mereka selalu berada dalam kebenaran.
(QS.  Al- Baqarah:186).
4.      Doa menjadi senjata saat kita bahagia
Manusia sering terlena akan kebahagiaan.
Berdoa hanya bila sedang sedih dan lupa akan doa saat sedang senang.
Begitu lah manusia. Tapi apabila kita mengetahui salah satu keutamaan
doa adalah memupuk amalan dan pahala yang baik justru saat senang
seharusnya kita lebih banyak berdoa dan bersyukur. Jangan sampai Allah
merenggut kebahagiaan kita karena kita yang terlena dan takabur oleh
kebahagaiaan itu. Doa dapat menjadi senjata saat kita bahagaia untuk
menjaga agar kebahagiaan itu tidak pernah lepas dari kehidupan kita
Luar biasa bukan senjata saya ini?Dengan
berdoa berserah diri kepada Allah SWT dan senantiasa bersyukur atas
semua karuniaNya segala masalah, Insya Allah bisa terjadi terselesaikan
dengan cepat dan hati kita dapat menjadi tenang. Mari kita budayakan
berdoa dalam keadaan apapun

YF-16
U.S. Air Force
YF-16 and YF-17, 1982
Two single-seat YF-16 prototypes were built for the
Light Weight Fighter
(LWF) competition. The first YF-16 was rolled out at Fort Worth on 13
December 1973 and accidentally accomplished its first flight on 21
January 1974, followed by its scheduled “first flight” on 2 February
1974. The second prototype first flew on 9 March 1974. Both YF-16
prototypes participated in the flyoff against the
Northrop YF-17
prototypes, with the F-16 winning the Air Combat Fighter (ACF) competition, as the LWF program had been renamed. [ 1 ]
[ edit ]
F-16 FSD
In January 1975, the Air Force ordered eight full-scale development
(FSD) F-16s – six single-seat F-16A and a pair of two-seat F-16B – for
test and evaluation. The first FSD F-16A flew on 8 December 1976 and the
first FSD F-16B on 8 August 1977. Over the years, these aircraft have
been used as test demonstrators for a variety of research, development
and modification study programs. [ 2 ]

F-16A/B
The F-16A (single seat) and F-16B (two seat) were initially equipped with the
Westinghouse
AN/APG-66
pulse-doppler radar ,
Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-200
turbofan, rated at 14,670 lb f
(64.9 kN) and 23,830 lb f
(106.0 kN) with afterburner. The USAF bought 674 F-16As and 121 F-16Bs, with delivery completed in March 1985.
[ edit ]
F-16A/B Block 1/5/10
Early blocks (Block 1/5/10) featured relatively minor differences
between each. Most were later upgraded to the Block 10 configuration in
the early 1980s. There were 94 Block 1, 197 Block 5, and 312 Block 10
aircraft produced. Block 1 is the early production model with the nose
cone painted black.
A dual-seat
F-16 Fighting Falcon B.PAF F-16B over Lahore City
It was discovered that the Block 1 aircraft’s black nose cone became
an obvious visual identification cue at long range, so the color of the
nose cone was changed to the low-visibility grey for Block 5 aircraft.
During the operation of F-16 Block 1, it was discovered that rain water
could accumulate in certain spots within the fuselage, so drainage holes
were drilled in the forward fuselage and tail fin area for Block 5
aircraft.
The Soviet Union significantly reduced the export of titanium during
the late 1970s, so the manufacturers of the F-16 used aluminum instead
wherever practical. New methods were also used: the corrugated aluminum
is bolted to the epoxy surface for Block 10 aircraft, replacing the old
method of
aluminum honeycomb
being glued to the epoxy surface used in earlier aircraft.
[ edit ]
F-16A/B Block 15
The first major change in the F-16, the Block 15 aircraft featured larger horizontal stabilizers, the addition of two
hardpoints
to the chin inlet, an improved
AN/APG-66(V)2
radar, and increased capacity for the underwing hardpoints. The Block 15 also gained the
Have Quick II
secure
UHF
radio. To counter the additional weight of the new hardpoints, the
horizontal stabilizers were enlarged by 30%. Block 15 is the most
numerous variant of the F-16, with 983 produced. The last one was
delivered in 1996 to Thailand.
[ edit ]
F-16A/B Block 20
USAF F-16C
Block 20 added some F-16C/D block 50/52 capabilities: improved
AN/APG-66(V)3
radar with added CW mode to guide two types of BVR missiles — AIM-7M Sparrow missiles and AIM-120 AMRAAM, carriage of
AGM-84 Harpoon
missiles, as well as the
LANTIRN
navigation and targeting pod. The Block 20 computers are significantly
improved in comparison to that of the earlier versions that later
integrated into post 1997 Block 50/52, and also getting color MFD. The
Republic of China
( Taiwan ) received 150 F-16A/B Block 20 aircraft. [ 3 ]

F-16C/D Block 25
U.S. Air Force F-16C Block 25 "Lethal Lady", 2007
The Block 25 F-16C first flew in June 1984 and entered USAF service in September. The aircraft are fitted with the Westinghouse
AN/APG-68
radar and have improved precision night-attack capability. Block 25
introduced a very substantial improvement in cockpit avionics, including
improved
fire-control
and stores management computers, an Up-Front Controls (UFC) integrated data control panel, data-transfer equipment,
multifunction displays ,
radar altimeter ,
and many other changes. Block 25’s were first delivered with the Pratt
& Whitney F100-PW-200 engine and later upgraded to the
Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220E . With 209 models delivered, today the USAF’s
Air National Guard
and
Air Education and Training Command
are the only remaining users of this variant. One F-16C, nicknamed the "Lethal Lady", had flown over 7,000 hours by April 2008. [ 4 ]
[ edit ]
F-16C/D Block 30/32
Three
U.S. Air Force
F-16 Block 30 aircraft fly in formation over South Korea, 2008
This was the first block of F-16s affected by the Alternative Fighter
Engine project under which aircraft were fitted with the traditional
Pratt & Whitney engines or, for the first time, the
General Electric F110-GE-100 .
From this point on, blocks ending in "0" (e.g., Block 30) are powered
by GE, and blocks ending in "2" (e.g., Block 32) are fitted with
Pratt & Whitney
engines.
The first Block 30 F-16 entered service in 1987. Major differences include the carriage of the
AGM-45 Shrike ,
AGM-88 HARM, and the AIM-120 missiles. From Block 30D, aircraft were
fitted with larger engine air intakes (called a Modular Common Inlet
Duct) for the increased-thrust GE engine. Since the Block 32 retained
the Pratt and Whitney F-100 engine, the smaller (normal shock inlet) was
retained for those aircraft. A total of 733 aircraft were produced and
delivered to six countries. The Block 32H/J aircraft assigned to the
USAF
Thunderbird
flight demonstration squadron were built in 1986 and 1987 and are some
of the oldest operational F-16s in the Air Force. The Air National Guard
procured many upgrades for their fleet of aging block 30/32s including
the addition of improved
inertial guidance systems , improved
electronic warfare
suite ( AN/ALQ-213 ), and upgrades to carry the
Northrop Grumman
LITENING targeting pod . The standard Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) was first changed to a
ring laser gyro , and later upgraded again to an Embedded GPS/INS (EGI) system which combines a
Global Positioning System
(GPS) receiver with an
Inertial Navigation System
(INS). The EGI provided the capability to use
Joint Direct Attack Munition
(JDAM) and other
GPS -aided
munitions (see Block 50 list below). This capability, in combination
with the LITENING targeting pod, greatly enhanced the capabilities of
this aircraft. The sum of these modifications to the baseline Block 30
is commonly known as the F-16C++ (pronounced "plus plus") version.
[ edit ]
F-16C/D Block 40/42
U.S. Air Force F-16C Block 40 over Iraq, 2008
Entering service in 1988, the Block 40/42 is the improved all-day/all-weather strike variant equipped with
LANTIRN
pod; also unofficially designated the F-16CG/DG, the night capability
gave rise to the name "Night Falcons". This block features strengthened
and lengthened undercarriage for LANTIRN pods, an improved radar, and a
GPS receiver. From 2002, the Block 40/42 increased the weapon range
available to the aircraft including JDAM,
AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon
(JSOW),
Wind-Corrected Munitions Dispenser
(WCMD) and the (Enhanced)
EGBU-27 Paveway
“bunker-buster”. Also incorporated in this block was the addition of cockpit lighting systems compatible with
Aviator's Night Vision Imaging System
(ANVIS)
equipment . The USAF’s Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) that added the
night vision (NVIS)-compatible systems
was completed in 2004. A total of 615 Block 40/42 aircraft were delivered to 5 countries.
[ edit ]
F-16C/D Block 50/52
Republic of Singapore Air Force
F-16C Block 52, 2008
The first Block 50/52 F-16 was delivered in late 1991; the aircraft
are equipped with improved GPS/INS, and the aircraft can carry a further
batch of advanced missiles: the AGM-88 HARM missile, JDAM, JSOW and
WCMD. [ 5 ]
Block 50 aircraft are powered by the
F110-GE-129
while the Block 52 jets use the
F100-PW-229 .
[ edit ]
F-16C/D Block 50/52 Plus
Israeli Air Force
Block 52+ based F-16I with CFTs and dorsal spine
This variant, which is also known as the Block 50/52+. Its main differences are the addition of support for
conformal fuel tanks
(CFTs), a dorsal spine compartment, the
APG-68(V9)
radar, an On-Board Oxygen Generation (OBOGS) system and a JHMCS helmet. [ 5 ]
The CFTs are mounted above the wing, on both sides of the fuselage
and are easily removable. They provide an additional 440 US gallon or
approximately 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg) of additional fuel, allowing
increased range or time on station and frees up hardpoints for weapons
instead of underwing fuel tanks. [ 6 ]
All two-seat "Plus" aircraft have the enlarged avionics dorsal spine
compartment which is located behind the cockpit and extends to the tail.
It adds 30 cu ft (850 L) to the airframe for more avionics with only
small increases in weight and drag. [ 7 ]
Polish Air Force
F-16C Block 52+, 2006
Poland took delivery of its first F-16C Block 52+ aircraft on 15
September 2006. The "Poland Peace Sky program" includes 36 F-16Cs and 12
F-16Ds. All 48 aircraft were delivered in 2008. [ 8 ]
The
Hellenic Air Force
took delivery of its first F-16C Block 52+ aircraft on 22 May 2008. The
total Greek order is for 20 F-16Cs and 10 F-16Ds. The remaining 26
aircraft should be delivered by March 2010. [ 9 ]
Pakistan Air Force
has order 18 F-16C/D Block 52+ which include 12 F-16C and 6 F-16D. [ 10 ]
The Israeli F-16I and its
Singapore
equivalent variant are based on the block 52+ aircraft.
[ edit ]
F-16E/F
F-16E (single seat) and F-16F (two seat). Originally, the single-seat version of the
General Dynamics F-16XL
was to have been designated
F-16E , with the twin-seat variant designated
F-16F . This was sidelined by the Air Force's selection of the competing
F-15E Strike Eagle
in the Enhanced Tactical Fighter fly-off in 1984. The 'Block 60'
designation had also previously been set aside in 1989 for the A-16, but
this model was dropped. [ 11 ]
The F-16E/F designation now belongs to a special version developed especially for the
United Arab Emirates , and is sometimes unofficially called the "Desert Falcon".
[ edit ]
F-16E/F Block 60
United Arab Emirates
F-16 Block 60 taking off after taxiing out of the
Lockheed Martin
plant in Fort Worth, TX ( NAS Fort Worth JRB )
Based on the F-16C/D Block 50/52, it features improved radar and
avionics and conformal fuel tanks; it has only been sold to the
United Arab Emirates .
At one time, this version was incorrectly thought to have been
designated "F-16U." A major difference from previous blocks is the
Northrop Grumman
AN/APG-80
Active Electronically Scanned Array
(AESA) radar, which gives the airplane the capability to simultaneously
track and destroy ground and air threats. The Block 60's
General Electric F110-GE-132
engine is a development of the -129 model and is rated at 32,500 lbf (144 kN). The
Electronic Warfare
system is supposed to be quite advanced and includes the Northrop Grumman Falcon Edge Integrated Electronic Warfare Suite
RWR
together with the
AN/ALQ-165
Self-Protection Jammer. Falcon Edge, which was developed by Northrop
Grumman specifically for the Block 60, is capable of showing not only
the bearing of any threat but also the range. The Block 60 allows the
carriage of all Block 50/52-compatible weaponry as well as
AIM-132 Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile
(ASRAAM) and the
AGM-84E Standoff Land Attack Missile
(SLAM). The CFTs provide an additional 450 US gallon (2,045 L) of fuel,
allowing increased range or time on station. This has the added benefit
of freeing up hardpoints for weapons that otherwise would have been
occupied by underwing fuel tanks. The
MIL-STD-1553
data bus
is replaced by
MIL-STD-1773
fiber-optic
data bus which offers a 1000 times increase in data-handling
capability. UAE funded the entire $3 billion Block 60 development costs,
and in exchange will receive royalties if any of the Block 60 aircraft
are sold to other nations. According to press reports quoted by
Flight International , this is "the first time the US has sold a better aircraft [F-16] overseas than its own forces fly". [ 12 ]
Like the F-35, the Block 60 F-16 has a built in FLIR/laser targeting
system rather than using a dedicated pod that would occupy a hardpoint,
increase drag and RCS. [ 13 ]

Major modification variants
Royal Thai Air Force
F-16ADF with AIM-120 AMRAAM
[ edit ]
F-16A/B Block 15 ADF
The F-16 Air Defense Fighter (ADF) was a special variant of the Block 15 optimized for the United States
Air National Guard 's
fighter interception
mission. Begun in 1989, 270 airframes were modified. Avionics were upgraded (including the addition of an
Identification Friend or Foe
(IFF) interrogator with "bird-slicing" IFF antennas), and a spotlight
fitted forward and below the cockpit, for night-time identification.
This was the only US version equipped with the
AIM-7 Sparrow
air-to-air missile. Beginning in 1994, these aircraft began to be
replaced by newer F-16C variants. By 2005, only the North Dakota ANG was
flying this variant, with these last examples retired by 2007. [ 14 ]
[ edit ]
F-16A/B Block 15 OCU
Beginning in January 1988, all Block 15 F-16A/B were delivered with an
Operational Capability Upgrade (OCU) .
The Block 15 OCU aircraft incorporate the wide-angle HUD that was first
introduced on the F-16C/D Block 25, more reliable F100-PW-220
turbofans, updated defensive systems, and the ability to fire the
AIM-120 AMRAAM, the
AGM-65 Maverick
air-to-ground missile , and the
AGM-119 Penguin Mk.3
anti-shipping missile
developed by the Norwegian company
Kongsberg . Many foreign customers upgraded their aircraft to the F-16A/B Block 15OCU standard. [ 15 ]
[ edit ]
F-16AM/BM Block 15 MLU
In 1989 a two-year study began regarding possible mid-life upgrades for the USAF’s and
European Partner Air Forces ’
(EPAF’s) F-16A/Bs. The resulting F-16 Mid-Life Update (MLU) package was
designed to upgrade the cockpit and avionics to the equivalent of that
on the F-16C/D Block 50; add the ability to employ radar-guided
air-to-air missiles; and to generally enhance the operational
performance and improve the reliability, supportability and
maintainability of the aircraft. Aircraft receiving this set of updates
are designated F-16AM or F-16BM.
Development began in May 1991 and continued until 1997; however, the
USAF withdrew from the MLU program in 1992, although it did procure the
modular mission computer for its Block 50/52 aircraft. [ 16 ] [ 17 ]
The first of five prototype conversions flew on 28 April 1995, and
installation of production kits began in January 1997. The original
plans called for the production of 553 kits (110 for Belgium, 63 for
Denmark, 172 for the Netherlands, 57 for Norway, and 130 for the USAF),
however, final orders amounted to only 325 kits (72 for Belgium, 61 for
Denmark, 136 for the Netherlands, and 56 for Norway). The EPAFs
redesignated the F-16A/B aircraft receiving the MLU as F-16AM/BM,
respectively. Portugal later joined the program and the first of 20
aircraft was redelivered on 26 June 2003. In recent years, Chile,
Jordan, and Pakistan have purchased
surplus
Dutch and Belgian F-16AM/BM for their air forces. [ 17 ]
Development of new software and hardware modifications continues
under the MLU program. The M3 software tape was installed in parallel
with the Falcon STAR structural upgrade to bring the F-16AM/BM up to the
standards of the USAF’s Common Configuration Implementation Program
(CCIP). A total of 296 M3 kits (72 for Belgium, 59 for Denmark, 57 for
Norway, and 108 for the Netherlands) were ordered for delivery from
2002–2007; installation is anticipated to be completed in 2010. A M4
tape has also been developed that adds the ability to use additional
weapons and the
Pantera
targeting pod; Norway began conducting flying combat operations in
Afghanistan with these upgraded aircraft in 2008. A M5 tape is in
development that will enable employment of a wider array of the latest
smart weapons, and the first aircraft upgraded with it are due to be
delivered in 2009. [ 17 ]

F-16C/D Block 30 F-16N/TF-16N
TOPGUN F-16 and A-4 aircraft in formation
The U.S. Navy acquired 22 modified Block 30 F-16Cs for use as adversary assets for
dissimilar air combat training
(DACT); four of these were TF-16N two-seaters. These aircraft were delivered in 1987-1988. Fighter Squadron 126 ( VF-126 ) and the
Navy Fighter Weapons School
(NFWS) (or
TOPGUN ) operated them at
NAS Miramar , California on the West Coast; East Coast adversary training squadrons were Fighter Squadron 43 ( VF-43 ) at
NAS Oceana , Virginia and Fighter Squadron 45 ( VF-45 ) at
NAS Key West ,
Florida. Each squadron had five F-16N and one TF-16N, with the
exception of TOPGUN which had six and one, respectively. Due to the high
stress of constant combat training, the wings of these aircraft began
to crack and the Navy announced their retirement in 1994. By 1995, all
but one of these aircraft had been sent to the
309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group
(AMARG) for preservation and storage; one F-16N was sent to the
National Museum of Naval Aviation
at
NAS Pensacola ,
Florida as a museum article. As adversary aircraft, the Navy’s F-16Ns
were notable for their colorful appearance. Most Navy F-16N aircraft
were painted in a three-tone blue-gray "ghost" scheme. TOPGUN had some
of the more colorful ones: a three-color desert scheme, a light blue one
and a green
splinter camouflage
version with Marine Corps markings. VF-126 also had a unique blue example.
In 2002, the Navy began to receive 14 F-16A and B models from the
Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center
(AMARC) that were originally intended for Pakistan before being
embargoed. These aircraft (which are not designated F-16N/TF-16N) are
operated by the
Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center
(NSAWC) / (TOPGUN) for adversary training and like their F-16N predecessors are painted in exotic schemes.

F-16CJ/DJ Block 50D/52D
An unknown number of Block 50/52 aircraft have been delivered to the USAF modified to perform the
Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses
(SEAD) mission, replacing the
F-4G
‘ Wild Weasel ’ aircraft; these were unofficially designated F-16CJ/DJ. Capable of launching both the
AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile
(HARM) and
AGM-45 Shrike
anti-radiation missiles , the F-16CJ/DJ are equipped with a Lockheed Martin
AN/AAS-35V Pave Penny
laser spot tracker and the
Texas Instruments
AN/ASQ-213 HARM Targeting System (HTS), with the HTS pod being mounted on the port intake hardpoint. The first F-16CJ ( serial number 91-0360 ) was delivered on 7 May 1993. [ 18 ] [ 19 ]

The F-16I is a two-seat variant of the Block 52 developed for the
Israeli Defense Force – Air Force
(IDF/AF). [ 20 ]
Israel issued a requirement in September
1997
and selected the F-16 in preference to the
F-15I
in July
1999 . An initial "Peace Marble V" contract was signed on
14 January
2000
with a follow on contract signed on
19 December
2001
for a total procurement of 102 aircraft. The F-16I, which is called
Sufa
(Storm) by the IDF/AF, first flew on
23 December
2003 , and deliveries to the IDF/AF began on
19 February
2004 . [ 21 ]
The F-16I has an estimated unit cost of approximately US$70 million (2006). [ 22 ]
The F-16I's most notable difference from the standard Block 52 is that approximately 50% of the American
avionics
have been replaced by Israeli-developed avionics (such as the Israeli Aerial Towed Decoy replacing the
ALE-50 ). The addition of Israeli-built autonomous
aerial combat maneuvering instrumentation
systems enables the training exercises to be conducted without dependence on ground instrumentation systems, and the
helmet-mounted sight
is also standard equipment. The helmet-mounted sight,
head-up display
(HUD), mission computer, presentation computer, and digital map display are made by
Elbit Systems
of Israel. Furthermore, the F-16I is able to employ
Rafael's
new
Python 5
imaging infrared-guided high-agility
air-to-air missile . The F-16I also has the
Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) -built removable
conformal fuel tanks
(CFT) added to extend its range; removal takes two hours. Key American-sourced systems include the
F100-PW-229
turbofan
engine, which offers commonality with the IDF/AF's
F-15Is , and the
APG-68(V)9
radar. [ 23 ]

Special mission variants
[ edit ]
A-16
The A-16 began as a late-1980s GD project to develop a
close air support
(CAS) version of the basic F-16 by adding armor and strengthening the wings for a heavier weapons load, including a 30 mm
cannon
and 7.62 mm
Minigun
pods. Two F-16A Block 15 aircraft were modified to this configuration. Envisioned as a successor to the
A-10 ,
the type was to have received the ‘Block 60’ designation; however, the
A-16 never went into production due to a 26 November 1990
Congressional
directive to the
U.S. Air Force
mandating that it retain two
wings
of A-10s. [ 24 ]
[ edit ]
F/A-16
A second outcome of that directive was a decision by the Air Force
that, instead of upgrading the A-10, it would seek to retrofit 400 Block
30/32 F-16s as with new equipment to perform both CAS and
battlefield air interdiction
(BAI) missions. The new systems for this “F/A-16” Block 30 included a
digital terrain-mapping
system [ 25 ]
and
Global Positioning System
(GPS) integration for improved navigational and weapons delivery
accuracy, as well as an Automatic Target Handoff System (ATHS) to allow
direct digital target/mission data exchange between the pilot and ground
units. This approach, however, was dropped in January 1992 in favor of
equipping Block 40/42 F-16C/Ds with
LANTIRN
pods. [ 11 ]
[ edit ]
Other CAS initiatives
In 1991, 24 F-16A/B Block 10 aircraft belonging to the
174th TFW , a
New York Air National Guard
unit that had transitioned from the A-10 in 1988, were armed with the 30 mm
GAU-13/A
four-barrel derivative of the seven-barrel
GAU-8/A
cannon used by the A-10A. This weapon was carried in a
General Electric
GPU-5/A Pave Claw
gun pod
on the centerline station, and was supplied with 353 rounds of
ammunition. There were also plans to convert F-16C’s to this
configuration and to incorporate the A-10’s
AN/AAS-35V Pave Penny
laser spot tracker. The vibration from the gun when firing proved so
severe as to make both aiming and flying the aircraft difficult, and
trials were suspended after two days. Although the 174th’s aircraft were
employed for CAS during
Operation Desert Storm , they did not use the gun pods in action, and the Block 10 F/A-16 was phased out after the war. [ 11 ] [ 26 ]
[ edit ]
F-16A(R)
About two dozen F-16As of the
Royal Netherlands Air Force
(RNLAF) were supplied with indigenous Oude Delft Orpheus low-altitude tactical
reconnaissance
pods transferred from its retiring
RF-104G .
Designated F-16A(R), the first example flew on 27 January 1983, and
they entered service with the RNLAF’s 306 Squadron in October 1984. The
aircraft were common with the regular F-16's. However they were equipped
with an extra panel in the cockpit to control the center line mounted
pod. Under the MLU program a more standardized interface was introduced
so every aircraft could be used to operate the Orpheus pod or any other
pod with the standardized interface.
Beginning in 1995, the
Belgian Air Force
replaced its own
Mirage 5BR
reconnaissance aircraft with at least a dozen F-16A(R) equipped with
loaned Orpheus pods and Vinten cameras from the Mirages; these were
replaced with more capable Per Udsen modular recce pods from 1996–1998.
The F-16A(R) remained primarily combat aircraft with a secondary
reconnaissance role. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ]
[ edit ]
F-16 Recce
The first reconnaissance variant was a USAF F-16D experimentally
configured in 1986 with a centerline multi-sensor bathtub-style pod; it
was referred to as “F-16 Recce” (and not “RF-16D” as it has sometimes
been misreported). The USAF decided in 1988 to replace the aging
RF-4C Phantom
fleet with F-16C Block 30s fitted with the
Control Data Corporation’s
Advanced Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance System
(ATARS) centerline pod, which could carry a variety of sensors.
Problems with the ATARS program, however, led to the USAF’s departure in
June 1993. During the mid-1990s, the U.S. Air Force experimented with a
series of centerline recce pod designs, beginning with a prototype pod,
the Electro-Optical 1 (EO-1) pod. This was followed by four “Richmond
recce pods”, which saw service in the Balkans. The USAF finally settled
on what would become the definitive AN/ASD-11
Theater Airborne Reconnaissance System
(TARS). The first F-16 flight with a prototype TARS flew on 26 August
1995, and on 27 September 1996 the USAF placed its first production
order for the pods. Block 30s and Block 25s of five
Air National Guard
(ANG) squadrons have received the system since mid-1998. The USAF, however, does not designate them “RF-16s”. [ 27 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]
[ edit ]
RF-16A/C
The designation RF-16A is used, though, by the
Royal Danish Air Force . In early 1994, 10 Danish F-16A were redesignated as RF-16A tactical recce aircraft, replacing the
RF-35
Drakens
withdrawn at the end of 1993. As a temporary measure they were originally fitted with the
Drakens’
optical cameras and electro-optical (E-O) sensors repackaged in a Per
Udsen ‘Red Baron’ recce pod, which were replaced a few years later by
Per Udsen’s Modular Reconnaissance Pod (MRP). [ 27 ] [ 30 ]

Flight control variants
[ edit ]
YF-16 CCV
The initial YF-16 prototype was reconfigured in December 1975 to
serve as the USAF Flight Dynamics Laboratory's Control-Configured
Vehicle (CCV) testbed. The CCV concept entails “decoupling” the
aircraft’s
flight control surfaces
so that they can operate independently. This approach enables unusual
maneuvers such as being able to turn the airplane without banking it.
The ability to maneuver in one plane without simultaneously moving in
another was seen as offering novel tactical performance capabilities for
a fighter. The CCV YF-16 design featured twin pivoting ventral fins
mounted vertically underneath the air intake, and its triply redundant
fly-by-wire
(FBW)
flight control system
(FCS) was modified to permit use of
flaperons
on the wings’ trailing edges which would act in combination with an all-moving
stabilator . The fuel system was redesigned to enable adjustment of the aircraft’s
center of gravity
by transferring fuel from one tank to another. The CCV aircraft
achieved its first flight on 16 March 1976. The flight test program ran
until 30 June 1977, and was marred only by a hard landing on 24 June
1976 that delayed testing until repairs were effected. The CCV program
was judged successful and led to a more ambitious follow-on effort in
the form of the "Advanced Fighter Technology Integration" (AFTI) F-16. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ]

HiMAT
A research derivative aircraft that had strong similarities to F-16 design was the
HiMAT
(for "Highly Maneuverable Aircraft Technology"). This joint USAF and
NASA
remotely piloted
program used
canards
and other research technologies like
synthetic vision
with a lightweight composite structure that helped it to achieve high performance goals such as
sustaining
an 8-g turn. Two vehicles were built by
Rockwell International
and were flown from 1979 to 1983, for a total of 26
B-52
drop-test missions at
Dryden .
[ edit ]
F-16 SFW
General Dynamics was one of several U.S. aircraft makers awarded a contract by the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) in 1976 to develop proposals for an experimental
forward-swept wing
test aircraft. GD’s entry, the Swept Forward Wing (SFW) F-16, had a
slightly lengthened fuselage to accommodate the larger, advanced
composites wing. In January 1981, DARPA selected
Grumman’s
entry, which became known as the
X-29A .
Although the SFW F-16 was not chosen, the X-29 incorporated some of the
F-16’s features, particularly its FBW flight control system and its
undercarriage. [ 34 ]
[ edit ]
F-16XL
Main article:
General Dynamics F-16XL
The F-16XL featured a novel ‘cranked-arrow’ type of
delta wing
with more than twice the area of the standard F-16 wing. Developed
under a program originally known as the Supersonic Cruise and
Maneuvering Program (SCAMP), the design was intended to offer low
drag
at high subsonic or supersonic speeds without compromising low-speed maneuverability. As a result, the F-16XL can
cruise efficiently at supersonic speeds
without use of an
afterburner . [ 35 ]
In late 1980, the USAF agreed to provide GD with the third and fifth
FSD F-16s for modification into single-seat and twin-seat F-16XL
prototypes. To accommodate the larger wing, the aircraft was lengthened
56 in (142 cm) by the addition of a 30-inch (76 cm) plug in the forward
fuselage and a 26-inch (66 cm) section to the aft fuselage just behind
the landing gear bulkhead. The rear fuselage was also canted up by three
degrees to increase the angle of attack on takeoff and landing. The
F-16XL could carry twice the
payload
of the F-16 on 27
hardpoints ,
and it had a 40% greater range due to an 82% increase in internal fuel
carriage. The single-seat F-16XL first flew on 3 July 1982, followed by
the two-seater on 29 October 1982. The F-16XL competed unsuccessfully
with the
F-15E Strike Eagle
in the Enhanced Tactical Fighter (ETF) program; if it had won the
competition, the production versions were to have been designated
F-16E/F. [ 36 ]
Following the February 1984 selection announcement, both examples of the F-16XL were placed in flyable storage. [ 37 ]
In late 1988, the two prototypes were taken out of storage and turned over to the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) for use in a program designed to evaluate
aerodynamic
concepts for improving
laminar airflow
over the wing during sustained supersonic flight. From 1989–1999, both
aircraft were used by NASA for several experimental research programs,
and in 2007, NASA was considering returning the single-seat F-16XL to
operational status for further aeronautical research. [ 37 ] [ 38 ]
[ edit ]
F-16AT Falcon 21
In 1990 General Dynamics proposed the F-16AT 'Falcon 21' as a low-cost alternative for the
Advanced Tactical Fighter
(ATF) program that would eventually lead to the
F-22 Raptor . It was a single-engined fighter based on the F-16XL, but with a trapezoidal wing. [ 39 ]

NF-16D / VISTA / MATV
Main article:
General Dynamics F-16 VISTA
In the late 1980s, General Dynamics and General Electric began exploring the application of
thrust vector control
(TVC) technology to the F-16 under the F-16 Multi-Axis Thrust-Vectoring
(MATV) program. Originally the Israel Defense Force/Air Force was going
to supply an F-16D for this effort; however, the USAF, which had
initially declined to support the program, changed its mind and took
over the MATV project in 1991 and Israel withdrew from it the following
year. [ 40 ]
(The IDF was involved later when
Ilan Ramon , who later became an astronaut on the ill-fated
STS-107 , flew the MATV F-16 during flight testing at Edwards AFB.)
Meanwhile, General Dynamics had received a contract in 1988 to
develop the Variable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft
(VISTA). The
F-16 VISTA
effort was funded by the USAF, the U.S. Navy, and NASA.
Calspan ,
a subcontractor to GD, fitted a Block 30 F-16D belonging to Wright Labs
with a center stick (in addition to the sidestick controller), a new
computer, and a digital flight control system that allowed it to
imitate, to a degree, the performance of other aircraft. Redesignated
NF-16D , its first flight in the VISTA configuration occurred on 9 April 1992. [ 31 ] [ 40 ]
In 1993, the variable-stability computers and center stick were
temporarily removed from the VISTA for flight tests for the MATV
program, under which the first use of thrust-vectoring in flight was
accomplished on 30 July. Thrust-vectoring was enabled through the use of
the Axisymmetric Vectoring Exhaust Nozzle (AVEN). Following the
conclusion of MATV testing in March 1994, the VISTA variable-stability
computers were reinstalled. In 1996 a program was begun to fit the
NF-16D with a multi-directional thrust-vectoring nozzle, but the program
was canceled due to lack of funding later that year. Although the F-16
VISTA program was considered successful, thrust vectoring was not taken
up for the F-16 by the U.S. Air Force. [ 40 ] [ 41 ]
[ edit ]
F-16U
In F-16U was one of several configurations proposed for the United
Arab Emirates in the early 1990s. The F-16U was a two-seat aircraft that
combined many features of the F-16XL and the delta wing of the F-16X. [ 42 ]
[ edit ]
F-16X Falcon 2000
In 1993 Lockheed Martin proposed development of a new version of the
venerable F-16. This F-16X ‘Falcon 2000’ featured a delta-wing
planform
like that of the F-22; together with the fuselage stretch to
accommodate the new wing design, the F-16X would have 80% more internal
fuel volume. The design also permitted conformal carriage of the
AIM-120 AMRAAM . LM claimed the F-16X could be built for two-thirds the cost of the
F/A-18E/F Super Hornet . [ 19 ] [ 43 ]
[ edit ]
F-16 Advanced Fighter Technology Integration
In March 1980, General Dynamics began converting the sixth FSD F-16A
to serve as the technology demonstrator aircraft for the joint Flight
Dynamics Laboratory-NASA Advanced Fighter Technology Integration (AFTI)
program. The AFTI F-16 built upon GD’s experience with its YF-16 CCV
program, and the AFTI F-16 even received the twin pivoting vertical
ventral fins from the CCV aircraft, which were likewise installed under
the air intake. The aircraft was also fitted with a narrow dorsal
fairing along its spine to house additional electronics. Technologies
introduced and tested on the AFTI F-16 include a full-authority triplex
Digital Flight Control System (DFCS), a six-degree-of-freedom Automated
Maneuvering Attack System (AMAS), a 256-word-capacity Voice-Controlled
Interactive Device (VCID) to control the avionics suite, and a
helmet-mounted target designation sight that permitted the
forward-looking infrared
(FLIR) device and the radar to be automatically “slaved” to the pilot’s
head movement. First flight of the AFTI F-16 occurred on 10 July 1982.
The
Air Force Association
gave its 1987 Theodore von Karman Award for the most outstanding achievement in science and engineering to the AFTI F-16 team. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]
The AFTI F-16 participated in numerous research and development programs: [ 46 ]
AFTI Phase I testing (1981–1983): a two-year effort focused on proving the DFCS system.
AFTI Phase II testing (1983–1987): evaluation of the wing-root-mounted FLIR and the AMAS system.
CAS/BAI (1988–1992): a five-phase evaluation program testing a
variety of low-level close air support/battlefield air interdiction
(CAS/BAI) techniques, including an Automatic Target Handoff System
(ATHS) (which transferred target data from ground stations or other
aircraft to the AFTI F-16) and off-axis weapons launch.
Talon Sword Bravo (1993–1994): demonstration of cooperative
engagement techniques where the aircraft fires at a target based on
targeting information
datalinked
from a distant sensor; the weapon principally investigated was the
AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile
(HARM).
EGI (1994 & 1997): testing of embedded GPS/INS (EGI) navigation
systems, including evaluation of the reliability of GPS in jamming
environments.
AGCAS (1994–1996): testing of an Automatic Ground Collision
Avoidance System (AGCAS or Auto-GCAS) to help reduce the incidence of
“controlled flight into terrain" (CFIT); lessons learned from this
program were further evolved on the F-16 GCAS.
J/IST (1997–2000): testing of the world’s first all-electric flight
control system under the Joint Strike Fighter Integrated Subsystem
Technologies (J/IST) program.
[ edit ]
F-16 GCAS
Due to the unavailability of the AFTI F-16 following the
AGCAS
effort, a Block 25 F-16D was modified for continued investigation of
ground collision-avoidance system (GCAS) technologies to reduce CFIT
incidents; this joint effort by the USAF, Lockheed Martin, NASA and the
Swedish Air Force
was conducted during 1997–1998. [ 47 ]
It has recently been reported that the US Air Force had decided to
upgrade the F-16, F-22 and F-35 (all Lockheed Martin-designed,
fly-by-wire fighters) with the AGCAS system. [ 48 ]
[ edit ]
F-16 Agile Falcon
The F-16 Agile Falcon was a variant proposed by General Dynamics in
1984 that featured a 25% larger wing, uprated engines, and some already
planned
MSIP IV
improvements for the basic F-16. Unsuccessfully offered as a low-cost alternative for the
Advanced Tactical Fighter
(ATF) competition, some of its capabilities were incorporated into the
F-16C/D Block 40, and the Agile Falcon would serve as the basis for
developing Japan’s
F-2
fighter. [ 39 ]
[ edit ]
F-16 ES
The F-16 Enhanced Strategic (ES) was an extended-range variant of the
F-16C/D fitted with conformal fuel tanks that granted it a 40% greater
range over the standard Block 50. The F-16ES also featured an internal
FLIR system, which offered the capabilities of the LANTIRN navigation
and targeting system without the drag associated with external pods.
Unsuccessfully offered to Israel as an alternative to the
F-15I Strike Eagle
in late 1993, it was one of several configuration options offered to
the United Arab Emirates that would ultimately lead to the development
of the F-16E/F Block 60 for that nation. An F-16C Block 30 was modified
to the ES configuration to test the conformal tanks and simulated FLIR
sensor turrets fitted above and below the nose of the aircraft. The
F-16ES first flew on 5 November 1994 and flight testing was completed in
January 1995. [ 49 ] [ 50 ]
[ edit ]
F-16 LOAN
The F-16 Low-Observable Asymmetric Nozzle (LOAN) demonstrator was an
F-16C fitted in late 1996 with a prototype nozzle with significantly
reduced radar and infrared signatures and lowered maintenance
requirements. It was tested in November 1996 to evaluate the technology
for the
Joint Strike Fighter
(JSF) program. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]

F-16D ‘CK-1’
MANAT ,
the Israeli Air Force’s flight test center, is known to operate a
specially built Block 40 F-16D delivered in 1987 as a testbed aircraft
designated ‘CK-1’. It is used by the IAF for testing new flight
configurations, weapon systems and avionics. [ 39 ]

F-16/79
In response to President
Jimmy Carter 's
February 1977 directive to curtail arms proliferation by selling only
reduced-capability weapons to foreign countries, General Dynamics
developed a modified export-oriented version of the F-16A/B designed for
use with the outdated General Electric
J79
turbojet
engine.
Northrop
competed for this market with its
F-20 Tigershark .
Accommodating the J79-GE-119 engine required modification of the F-16’s
inlet, the addition of steel heat shielding, a transfer gearbox (to
connect the engine to the existing F-16 gearbox), and an 18-inch (46 cm)
stretch of the aft fuselage. First flight occurred on 29 October 1980.
The total program cost to develop the F-16/J79 was $18 million (1980),
and the unit flyaway cost was projected to be about $8 million. South
Korea, Pakistan and other nations were offered these fighters but
rejected them, resulting in numerous exceptions being made to sell
standard F-16s; with the later relaxation of the policy under President
Carter in 1980 and its cancellation under President
Ronald Reagan , no copies of either the F-16/79 or the F-20 were ultimately sold. [ 53 ]
[ edit ]
F-16/101
In February 1979, General Electric was awarded a $79.9 million (1979)
contract under the joint USAF/Navy Derivative Fighter Engine (DFE)
program to develop a variant of its
F101
turbofan engine, originally designed for the
B-1A
bomber, for use on the F-16 (in lieu of the standard P&W F100) and the
F-14A
(in place of the P&W
TF30 ). The first Full-Scale Development (FSD) F-16A ( serial number 75-0745 )
was fitted with the F101X DFE engine and made its maiden flight on 19
December 1980. Although the F101 performed better than the F100, it was
not adopted for use; however, data from testing the F-16/101 assisted in
the development of the
F110
turbofan, for which the F101 would serve as the core, and the F110 would become an alternate engine for both the F-16 and F-14. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]

Indian MRCA competition
USAF F-16 on ground taxies to the runway for take off at Aero India 2011, Yelahanka Air force Base Bangalore.
Lockheed Martin has proposed an advanced variant, the F-16IN, as its candidate for India’s 126-aircraft
Indian Air Force Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft
(MMRCA) competition. According to Chuck Artymovich, the company's
business development director for the program, "The F-16IN is the most
advanced F-16 ever." Notable F-16IN features include an
AN/APG-80
Active Electronically Scanned Array
(AESA) radar, advanced
electronic warfare
suites, and an
infrared search and track
(IRST) system. [ 56 ]
If selected as the winner of the competition, Lockheed Martin will
supply the first 18 aircraft, and will set up an assembly line in India
in collaboration with Indian partners for production of the remainder.
The program is reportedly worth up to
Rs.
55,000
crore
( US$ 14 billion). [ 57 ] [ 58 ]
The F-16IN Super Viper was showcased in the
Aero India , 2009. [ 59 ]
India initially sent the RFI for a F-16C/D Block 52+ configuration aircraft for the ongoing
Indian MRCA competition
to supply the
Indian Air Force
with 126 Multi-Role Combat Aircraft. On 17 January 2008, Lockheed Martin offered a customized version of the F-16, the
F-16IN Super Viper
for the Indian MMRCA contract. [ 60 ]
The F-16IN, which is similar to the F-16 Block 60, will be a 4.5 generation aircraft.
Lockheed Martin has described the F-16IN as “the most advanced and
capable F-16 ever.” Based closely on the F-16E/F Block 60 as supplied to
the UAE, the features on the F-16IN include
Conformal Fuel Tanks
(CFTs); AN/APG-80
active electronically scanned array
(AESA) radar, [ 61 ]
GE F110-132A
engine with 32,000 pounds (143 kN) of thrust with
FADEC
controls; electronic warfare suite and infra-red searching (IRST);
advanced all-color glass cockpit with three large displays; and a
helmet-mounted cueing system. [ 62 ]
Lockheed Martin’s vice-president-Business Development (India) Orville
Prins has said that “I can assure you, the Super Viper is much more
advanced in all aspects than the [Block 50/52] F-16s being given to
Pakistan". [ 63 ]
In September 2009, F-16IN Super Viper completed a part of the field
trials. Lockheed Martin officials stated that phase I of field trials
was over and the week-long training phase was in preparation for Phase
II of field trials, which began 7 September and lasted two weeks.

KF-16
Korean Aerospace Industries
(KAI) produced 140 KF-16C/D Block 52 fighters under license from Lockheed Martin in the 1990s. The
F/A-18 Hornet
had originally won the Korea Fighter Program (KFP) competition, but
disputes over costs and accusations of bribery led the Korean government
to withdraw the award and select the F-16 instead. Designated the KF-16
the first 12 aircraft were delivered to
Republic of Korea Air Force
(ROKAF) in December 1994. [ 64 ]
Almost 2,500 parts are changed from the original F-16C/D. [ 64 ]
Originally, the KF-16 was equipped with the F100-PW-229 Improved
Performance Engine, ASPJ internal ECM, APG-68(V)7 radar, LANTIRN
targeting and navigation system, AMRAAM, HARM, and SLAM anti-ship
missile capabilities, and advanced IFF. [ 65 ]
JDAMs capability was added by ROKAF later on; ROKAF developed the
software, successfully carried out 3 tests, and finished pilot training
at the end of January 2011. The South Korean JDAMs are equipped with
wing kits, which are absent from normal JDAMs, but not from the 2,000
pound
JDAM Extended Range
kit, which is being developed by Boeing and South Korea. [ 66 ]
The South Korean F-16s can also employ LIG Nex1's ALQ-200K radar jammer
and other locally developed tactical ELINT and EO/IR targeting pods. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]
In late 2011, Korea kicked off the contest for KF-16's mid-life upgrade, which will incorporate, among others, a new AESA radar. [ 69 ]
The radar will be chosen between Raytheon's RACR and Northrop Grumman's
SABR. The variant to which the planes will be improved is reported to
be Lockheed Martin's newly developed F-16V. [ 70 ]
The KF-16 will also be integrated with stealth cruise missiles. [ 71 ]
The proposed budget for the avionics upgrades and weapons integration of 135 KF-16 planes is $1 billion. [ 72 ]
ROKAF had requested a separate upgrade of its 35 F-16 Block 32 in 2009,
which would allow the upgraded planes to employ JDAM, AMRAAM, improved
data modem, secure voice capabilities, test and support equipment, and
other related training and logistics support. The estimated cost of the
upgrade was $250 million. [ 73 ]

GF-16
Small numbers of each type of F-16A/B/C are used for non-flying ground instruction of maintenance personnel.

QF-16
The USAF plans to convert older-model F-16s into full-scale
target drones
under the QF-16 Air Superiority Target (AST) program. These AST drones
are used in Weapon System Evaluation Programs (WSEP) for assessing
upgrades or replacements for air-to-air missiles (AAM), and they are
also useful for giving pilots the experience of a live AAM shot and kill
prior to entering combat. QF-16s would replace the current
QF-4
drones, the last of which are expected to be expended around 2015. [ 74 ]
The Air Force’s Air Armament Center hosted its first “Industry Day” for interested vendors at
Eglin AFB , Florida on 16–19 July 2007. [ 75 ]
The DoD awarded the nearly $70 million QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) contract to
Boeing
on March 8, 2010, [ 76 ]
with the first delivery scheduled for 2014. [ 74 ]
On 22 April 2010, the first F-16 to be converted to an
aerial target
arrived at Boeing's facility at
Cecil Field ,
Jacksonville, Florida . [ 77 ]
Six F-16s will be modified during the development phase, as prototypes
for engineering tests and evaluation. From 2014, up to 126 QF-16 drones
will be created.

Major upgrade programs
[ edit ]
F-16 MSIP
In 1980, General Dynamics, the USAF’s F-16 System Program Office (SPO), and the
EPG partners
initiated a long-term Multinational Staged Improvement Program (MSIP)
to evolve new capabilities for the F-16, mitigate risks during
technology development, and ensure its currency against a changing
threat environment. The F-16 Falcon Century program, a survey and
evaluation of new technologies and new capabilities that began in 1982,
was also relied upon to identify new concepts for integration onto the
F-16 through the MSIP derivative development effort. Altogether, the
MSIP process permitted quicker introduction of new capabilities, at
lower costs, and with reduced risks compared to traditional stand-alone
system enhancement and modernization programs. [ 78 ]
The first stage, MSIP I, began in February 1980 and it introduced the
new technologies that defined the Block 15 aircraft. Fundamentally,
MSIP I improvements were focused on reducing the cost of retrofitting
future systems. These included structural and wiring provisions for a
wide-field-of-view
raster
HUD;
multi-function displays
(MFD); advanced fire control computer and central weapons interface
unit; integrated Communications/Navigation/Identification (CNI) system;
beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missiles, electro-optical and
target acquisition pods, and internal electronic countermeasures (ECM)
systems; and increased-capacity environmental control and electrical
power systems. Delivery of the first USAF MSIP I Block 15 aircraft
occurred in November 1981, and work on the first EPG MSIP I aircraft
began in May 1982. [ 19 ] [ 79 ]
MSIP II, begun in May 1981, led to the F-16C/D Block 25/30/32. For
the Block 25, it basically added the systems which the MSIP I provisions
had enabled. The first MSIP II F-16C Block 25 was delivered in July
1984. The Block 30/32 take advantage of the Alternative Fighter Engine
program that offered a choice between two engines for the F-16: the
General Electric F110-GE-100 (Block 30) as well as the newly upgraded
Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220 (Block 32). To take full advantage of
the higher-thrust GE engine, a larger, modular air inlet duct was fitted
on the Block 30s. MSIP II capabilities introduced on the Block 30/32
also included the ability to target multiple aircraft with the AMRAAM;
range, resolution and signal processor improvements to the AN/APG-68
radar; a ring laser gyroscope; ALQ-213 electronic warfare system; added
cooling air capacity for the more powerful avionics suite; and
employment of the
AGM-45 Shrike
anti-radiation missiles . The first Block 30 was delivered in July 1986. [ 19 ] [ 80 ]
MSIP III produced the Block 40/42/50/52. Initiated in June 1985, the
first MSIP III Block 40 was delivered in December 1988, and the first
Block 50 followed in October 1991. Introduced in the MSIP III Block
40/42 were LANTIRN navigation and targeting pods, along with the related
diffractive optics
HUD; the increased-reliability APG-68V fire-control radar; an aft-seat
HUD monitor in the F-16D; a four-channel digital flight-control system;
GPS; advanced EW and
Identification Friend or Foe
(IFF) equipment; and further structural strengthening to counter the
aircraft’s growing weight. The Block 50/52 received uprated F100-GE-129
and F110-PW-229 engines; an upgraded programmable display generator with
digital terrain mapping; an improved APG-68V5 fire-control radar; an
automatic target hand-off system; an anti-jam radio; the ALE-47
chaff
dispenser; and integration of
AGM-88 HARM
anti-radiation missiles. [ 81 ]
Although only three stages had been originally planned, GD proposed
an MSIP IV segment (marketed as ‘Agile Falcon’), but this was rejected
by the Air Force in 1989. However, most of its elements – such as
extensive avionics upgrades, color displays, an electronic warfare
management system (EWMS), reconnaissance pods,
AIM-9X Sidewinder
infrared air-to-air missile integration, and helmet-mounted sights – have been introduced since that time. [ 19 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ]
[ edit ]
Pacer Loft I & II
F-16A/B Blocks 1 and 5 were upgraded to the Block 10 standard under a
two-phase program: Pacer Loft I (1982–1983) and Pacer Loft II
(1983–1984). [ 15 ]
[ edit ]
Falcon UP
Although the F-16 was originally designed with an expected service
life of 8000 flying hours, actual operational usage has proven to be
more severe than expected and this has been exacerbated by its growing
weight as more systems and structure have been added to the aircraft. As
a result, the anticipated average service life of the F-16A/B had
fallen to only 5500 flying hours. Beginning in the early 1990s, the
Falcon UP program restored the 8000-hour capability for the USAF’s Block
40/42 aircraft. Pleased with the results, the USAF extended the Falcon
UP effort to provide a Service Life Improvement Program (SLIP) for its
Block 25 and 30/32 aircraft to ensure 6000 flying hours, and a Service
Life Extension Program (SLEP) for its F-16A/B aircraft to assure their
achieving 8000 hours. [ 84 ] [ 85 ]
[ edit ]
Falcon STAR
Falcon STAR (STructural Augmentation Roadmap) is a program to repair
and replace critical airframe components on all F-16A/B/C/D aircraft;
like Falcon UP, it is intended to ensure an 8000-hour service life, but
it is based on more recent operational usage statistics. The first
redelivery occurred in February 2004, and in 2007 the USAF announced
that it would upgrade 651 Block 40/42/50/52 F-16s; this is expected to
extend the Falcon STAR program, which began in 1999, through 2014. [ 84 ] [ 85 ]
[ edit ]
F-16 ACE
Israel Aircraft Industries developed an
open-architecture
avionics suite upgrade for its F-16s known as the Avionics Capabilities
Enhancement (ACE). It introduced the first “full-glass cockpit” on an
operational F-16, and featured an advanced
fire-control radar ,
an Up Front Control Panel (UFCP), and an option for a wide-angle HUD or
a helmet-mounted display. First flight of an F-16B equipped with ACE
was accomplished in May 2001. The ACE upgrade was not taken up by the
Israeli Air Force, which ordered a second batch of the F-16I instead;
IAI offered ACE to Venezuela, but the U.S. government blocked it and
stated that it would only permit elements of ACE, not the whole suite,
to be exported. [ 86 ] [ 87 ]
[ edit ]
F-16 Falcon ONE
Singapore Technologies Aerospace
(ST Aero) has also developed a state-of-the-art, “glass cockpit”
avionics suite as an alternative to the MLU offering. The Falcon ONE
suite includes a wide-angle HUD that can display FLIR imagery, the
Striker Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD), a datalink capability, and the
FIAR
Grifo
radar. First revealed at the
Farnborough Air Show
on 25 July 2000, it has yet to find a customer. [ 88 ] [ 89 ]
[ edit ]
F-16 CCIP
The Common Configuration Implementation Program (CCIP) is a $2
billion modernization effort that seeks to standardize all USAF Block
40/42/50/52 F-16s to a common Block 50/52-based avionics software and
hardware configuration for simplified training and maintenance. Lockheed
Martin received a contract to develop the first phase CCIP
configuration upgrade packages in June 1998; kit production work started
in 2000, and deliveries began in July 2001. [ 90 ] [ 91 ]
In 2007,
Korean Air
was awarded a USAF contract for F-16 upgrades, which included both
CCIP, Falcon-STAR, and Drop In Maintenance works. 100 USAF F-16s were to
be upgraded and maintained by Korean Air under the contract. The
upgrade program would extend the F-16’s flying hours from 6,000 to 8,000
hours. The work would continue for six years until 2013. [ 92 ]
Phase 1 of the CCIP added new Modular Mission Computers, color
cockpit display kits and advanced IFF systems to domestically based
Block 50/52 aircraft, and introduced the new
Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod
(ATP). The ability of the F-16CJ/DJ to employ GPS-guided weapons was
extended to the rest of the Block 50/52 fleet. Upgraded Phase 1 aircraft
redeliveries began in January 2002. The second phase extended these
upgrades to overseas-based Block 50/52 Falcons, and redeliveries ran
from July 2003 to June 2007. Phase II also included the introduction of
autonomous
beyond-visual-range
air-intercept capability, the
Link-16
datalink, and the
Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System
(JHMCS). [ 90 ]
The ongoing Phase 3 effort is focused on Block 40/42 F-16s.
Development began in July 2003 and by June 2007 Lockheed Martin had
completed roughly a quarter of the USAF’s Block 40/42 fleet. Phase 3
incorporates the M3+
Operational Flight Program
(OFP) which extends the capabilities of the first two phases to the Block 40/42 fleet and adds
Multifunctional Information Distribution System
(MIDS), the new
NATO -standard datalink network. Development of an M4+ OFP began in late 2002; this update will allow use of the
Raytheon AIM-9X
on Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft.
Northrop Grumman
was awarded a contract in early 2004 to develop an M5+ upgrade kit to
update the AN/APG-68(V)5 radars on the Block 40/42/50/52 Falcons to the
AN/APG-68(V)9 standard; upgrading of Block 40/42 aircraft began in 2007
and is to become operational on the Block 50/52 aircraft by 2010. An M6+
OFP is under consideration, and could include integration of the
GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb
(SDB) on CCIP aircraft, which is planned to begin in fiscal year 2012. [ 90 ]
Turkey became the first international customer for the CCIP update
with the signing of a $1.1 billion contract on 26 April 2005 to upgrade
an initial 76 Block 40/50 and 41 Block 30 F-16C/Ds to an equivalent of
the Phase 3/M5+ OFP standard under the "Peace Onyx III"
Foreign Military Sales
(FMS) program. This work will be performed by
Turkish Aerospace Industries
(TAI) and is due to be completed in 2012; however, Turkey holds on
option on the upgrade of the remainder of its 100 Block 40s, which could
extend the program. [ 90 ] [ 93 ]

CUPID
The Combat Upgrade Plan Integration Details (CUPID) effort is an ongoing initiative to bring older U.S. Air National Guard and
Air Force Reserve Command
Block 25/30/32 F-16s closer to Block 50/52 specifications. CUPID
focuses on adding improved precision attack capabilities, night vision
equipment, datalinks, carriage of the
Litening II
infrared targeting pod, and laser- and GPS-guided weapons. [ 84 ] [ 85 ]

Derivative fighters
The performance and flexibility of the F-16 has been an important and
visible influence on aircraft development programs of three nations
seeking to advance the design and manufacturing skills of their
indigenous aerospace industries. These programs have partnered with
Lockheed Martin
to develop
airframes , that while not officially designated F-16s, share design elements and a development path with the F-16.
[ edit ]
AIDC F-CK-1A/B
Ching Kuo
Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF)
Main article:
AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo
Due to U.S. refusal to supply the
Republic of China
(Taiwan) with either the F-16/79 or F-20, the Republic of China government tasked its
Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation
(AIDC) to develop an indigenous fighter. Preliminary design studies
began in 1980, and the Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) program was
launched two years later. Since Taiwanese industry had not developed a
sophisticated fighter before, AIDC sought design and development
assistance from General Dynamics and other major American aerospace
companies. With such assistance, a design was finalized in 1985. The IDF
design is by no means a copy of the F-16, but it was clearly influenced
by the F-16, such as the layout of control surfaces, yet it also
features design elements from the F-5, like its twin-engine
configuration. In December 1988 the IDF aircraft was designated F-CK-1
and named after the late President
Chiang Ching-Kuo . The first of four prototypes (3 single-seat and 1 twin-seat) flew on 28 May 1989. A total of 130
Ching Kuo
fighters (102 F-CK-1A single-seaters and 28 F-CK-1B two-seaters) were delivered from 1994–2000. [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 96 ]
[ edit ]
Mitsubishi F-2A/B (FS-X/TFS-X)
Main article:
Mitsubishi F-2
In 1982, Japan’s Technical Research and Development Institute (TRDI)
initiated studies of options for an indigenous fighter design to replace
the
Mitsubishi F-1
strike fighter. This initiative would later be designated FS-X (Fighter
Support Experimental). (The two-seat trainer version was originally
designated ‘TFS-X’.) Determining that an entirely indigenous development
effort would be cost-prohibitive, the
Japanese Defense Agency
(JDA) sought an off-the-shelf fighter for its FS-X requirement, but
none proved entirely acceptable. As a result, the JDA sought a
co-development program based on a variant of an existing fighter type,
and on 21 October 1987 announced its selection of a modified version of
the F-16C/D based on General Dynamics’ " Agile Falcon "
concept. The FS-X is larger and heavier than the F-16, has a greater
wing area, and is mainly fitted with Japanese-developed avionics and
equipment. The program was launched a year later and the first of four
XF-2A/B prototypes flew on 7 October 1995. The Japanese Cabinet
authorized production on 15 December 1995, with the designation F-2A/B
being allocated to the single- and two-seat models, respectively. First
flight of an F-2A occurred on 12 October 1999, and production aircraft
deliveries began on 25 September 2000. Originally, 141 F-2A/B (83 F-2A
and 58 F-2B) were planned, but only 130 (83/47 F-2A/B) were approved in
1995; due to high costs, in December 2004, the total was capped at 98
aircraft, and in early 2007 this was reduced to 94. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 100 ]

KAI FA-50 Golden Eagle (KTX-2)
Main article:
T-50 Golden Eagle
Building on its licensed manufacture of KF-16s, in 1992
Samsung Aerospace
began work on designing a tandem-seat, supersonic, combat-capable jet trainer to replace the
BAE Hawk 67 , Northrop
T-38 Talon ,
A-37 Dragonfly , and eventually
F-4 Phantom II
and
F-5E/F Tiger II
operated by the
Republic of Korea Air Force
(ROKAF). Samsung worked closely with Lockheed and the basic KTX-2
design had been laid out by 1995. At this point the aerospace units of
Samsung,
Daewoo
and
Hyundai
were combined to form
Korea Aerospace Industries
(KAI) to ensure sufficient industrial “critical mass” existed to
successfully develop the KTX-2. The T-50 resembles an 80%-scale F-16,
but has a number of differences, not least being the fact that it has an
engine air intake under each wing root, instead of a single under-belly
intake, as well as a leading-edge extension more similar to that on the
F/A-18 Hornet. The South Korean government gave its approval on 3 July
1997, and full-scale development work got underway in October. In
February 2000, the KTX-2 was designated the T-50 Golden Eagle, and the
first of two T-50 flight-test prototypes flew on 20 August 2002; the
maiden flight of the first of two T-50 Lead-In Fighter Trainer (LIFT)
prototypes – designated ‘A-50’ by the ROKAF and capable of combat –
followed on 29 August 2003. The RoKAF plans to acquire T-50 advanced
trainers, T-50B aerobatic demonstrators, TA-50 LIFT/light attack
aircraft, and FA-50 multirole fighters. Its first production contract,
for 25 T-50s, was placed in December 2003 and the first pair of T-50
aircraft was delivered 29 December 2005, with the type entering
operational service in April 2007. In December 2006, the ROKAF placed a
second production contract for T-50, T-50B, and TA-50 variants. The
development of the FA-50 to replace the remaining old fighters is
ongoing as of 2010. [ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ]
