Jews: only .2% (but running the world)
( AP ) VATICAN CITY (March 30) - Islam has surpassed Roman Catholicism as the world's largest religion, the Vatican newspaper said Sunday. "For the first time in history, we are no longer at the top: Muslims have overtaken us," Monsignor Vittorio Formenti said in an interview with the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano. Formenti compiles the Vatican's yearbook. He said that Catholics accounted for 17.4 percent of the world population — a stable percentage — while Muslims were at 19.2 percent."It is true that while Muslim families, as is well known, continue to make a lot of children, Christian ones on the contrary tend to have fewer and fewer," the monsignor said. Formenti said that the data refer to 2006. The figures on Muslims were put together by Muslim countries and then provided to the United Nations, he said, adding that the Vatican could only vouch for its own data. When considering all Christians and not just Catholics, Christians make up 33 percent of the world population, Formenti said. Spokesmen for the Vatican and the United Nations did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment Sunday. The Muslims and Christians are followed by Hindus (13%), Buddhists (6%), and Jews ( at a mere .2% ).
A look back at some of those
.2% 's
contribution to society ... Over 22% of Nobel Prize Winners (29% since 1950) Over 10% of the US Senate Since 1917, over 17% of US Supreme Court Justices have been Jewish Of the 2003 CEOs of Fortune's 100 largest companies, 10 to 15 percent are Jews Of Fortune's 2003 list of the twenty-five most powerful people in business, six (24 percent) are Jews 30% of the Fifty Greatest All Time Standup Comics. 23% of Forbes 400 Richest. Enrollment in Ivy League schools at over 21%. Jews may be less than 1% of NBA Players, but they are over 33% of NBA team owners. And some notable .2%'ers...

invest in a baseball player...
( AP ) Randy Newsom
has never thrown a pitch above AA ball. Still, he wants to put himself on the market. The stock market, that is. A minor-league pitcher with the Cleveland Indians, Newsom was working in obscurity this month on the crowded back fields at spring training in Winter Haven, Fla., distinguished from hundreds of hopefuls only by the red No. 41 on the back of his sweat-soaked blue uniform shirt... In January, his company,
Real Sports Investments , sold 1,800 shares of stock in Newsom's future. For $20, anyone could buy a share of the 25-year-old's career, an investment that could net 0.0016% of his future major-league earnings.
How much could investors make? The average major-league salary was $2,866,544 in 2006 and $2,944,556 and 2007, so a 0.0016% investment based on those figures would have paid off $92.98 over two years. However, average baseball salaries generally increase sharply from year to year. I like this idea for blue chip prospects, as well. Imagine if you could have invested in Jose Reyes, David Wright or Derek Jeter while they were just budding prospects... What if you owned .005% shares of A-Rod? His recent $300 Million contract alone (not including the $200 Million plus he made previously with the Rangers and Mariners) would have made you $1,500,000! But why would a hot prospect want to sell shares of himself, you ask? Well, what if that prospect's career goes south the way of Bill Pulsipher or Drew Henson or Reuben Rivera? There's no such thing as a sure-thing in baseball. This "investment" money would be the ball player's insurance policy if things don't work out as expected. (Just see how many busts there are in
Baseball America's top 100
over the past few years.) This could work the same way as the real stock market. Buy shares in a player's career on the cheap (after injury or late-round prospect) and hope they blossom. Conversely, the big name prospects would obviously have to be priced on the high.

the nazi pilot and the little prince...
( NY Daily News ) A 64-year-old French and German mystery now has a sprinkling of Greek tragedy: An ace Nazi World War II pilot learned that one of his 28 kills was also his favorite writer. Horst Rippert , now 88, says he only just found out that the P-38 he says he shot down on July 31, 1944, over the Mediterranean was piloted by
Antoine de Saint Exupery , best known as the author of the classic " The Little Prince ."
"If I had known it was Saint Exupery, I would never have shot him down," Rippert told the Daily Mail. "I loved his books. He was probably my favorite author at the time. "I am shocked and sorry. Who knows what other great books he would have gone on to write?"
...interestingly,
Antoine's
plane wreckage which was found off the coast of Marseille in 2004, showed traces of neither shooting nor aerial combat.

have we officially gone mad?
... a
letter to Yeshiva World's editor : Dear Yeshiva world editor, I ask you to please post this letter, as I think it is extremely important and raises a major issue that is affecting the Jewish Community at large. As my wife was flipping through the pages of the Jewish Press one Friday night,
she was shocked
at a certain advertisement and called me over to have a look. What I saw might not cause such a reaction to many people, which is a problem in itself, but for this advertisement to appear in a “Frum” weekly newspaper was mind boggling to me. The ad was a picture of two women who where modeling shaitels for a certain Shaitel macher. I can’t understand how the Jewish Press allows such ads in their paper. The women are posing in such immodest ways;
the advertisement belongs in People magazine not the “Jewish Press”. I am definitely not someone who is on a level to give mussar and tell people what’s right and wrong, however I feel very strongly about this.
Advertisements like this have to be part of the reason why the Jewish community is suffering so much pain recently . Tzinous is so very important and having the Jewish Press advertisement immodesty for a few bucks shows how far our community has fallen. In the words of Rabbi Yaakov Salomon….”Something to Think About” Ari Taub Brooklyn, New York This was followed up by these brilliant comment: Yes,
this major issue is affecting the Jewish Community at large . It rivals the great controversy over the 4 pictures of women wearing wigs in a store window on Coney Island Ave, whose ramifications are still
reverberating
in the neighborhood. Let’s hope this latest outrage will be successfully resolved,
least our community suffer some grave misfortune .
If you read the Yated or Hamodia and leave the Jewish Press to yellow on the news sellers shelves they may get the message
I agree, you cant even switch on the radio anymore.
and one comment I agree with... I am more offended by the ads for diamond encrusted watches that cost tens of thousands of dollars. These ads are mixed in with articles preaching modesty, unlavish lifestyles, and tzniut. And, do not forget the ads for the Pesach vacations.
how much longer till we're all wearing
Burkas ?

this is a great PR move. beat the media to the punch. just imagine if a few weeks from now, this came out via the media. it would be chaos all over again. when the

came out a few months ago, all the players that
admitted to taking steroids , pretty much got off clean. no big deal in the media. however, roger

Chassidic actor dumps Natalie Portman, amid protests from his community: R.D.A.A.M - Webba Rebba Exlusive!
Community pressure from Satmar has forced good old Abe Karpen to quit the movie, many people would kill themselves before they would leave a role as Oscar nominated Natalie Portman's husband in a film, but Williamsburg resident Abe Karpen leshem Kedusas Hashem, has to do just that. Karpen, who is a Chasidic Jew from the Satmar sect,
told the Daily News ,
"It's not acceptable in my community. It's a lot of pressure I am getting. They [the rabbis] didn't like the idea of a Chasidic guy playing in Hollywood." The scene in Williamsburg when the movie company was shooting
New York, I Love You , with Portman and Karpen... which is a film about love in the Big Apple. Karpen told people that he was always creative and met Portman in a Miztvah Tank, (of all places) where they got to talking and exchanged numbers, Portman later thought of Karpen for the role.
As far as Karpen being well behaved on set, we can report that he was always acting as a good Chassid should .. and at no time did he forget who he was or where he comes from, in fact when he was asked to hold Portman's hand he refused, saying " It's against our religion. You can't even hold your wife's hand on the street. " A Rabbi also told him his kids would be kicked out of their schools if he continued to film his role, so Karpen, a
kitchen cabinet salesman , is kissing his silver screen dreams good-bye. He and his family left the city for the weekend (a friend said,
"The community wants to kill him"
although this is probably just the Daily news trying to sensationalize the news.).
One Chasidic acitvist told the News,
"We don't watch television. We don't go to the movies, so to be in a movie is the worst thing. It's a shame for any Chassid." Two Satmar Chassidim on the scene, were conflicted, on the one hand they thought it was very cool that karpen is in a Hollywood movie with Portman, they confessed to us that with the advent on the internet and mini DVD players they many in the sect watch movies, however
"Watching a movie and being in a movie are 2 very different things"
they went on to say.
Now that Karpen has left the movie who will fill in as her Chassidish hubby,
any takers?

oy vey!
Israeli born and all-around tzadeikes,
natalie portman
and
some lucky chassid
are set to star in an upcoming movie called,
New York, I Love You . Some facts: she attended a Jewish elementary school, the
Solomon Schechter Day School
of
Glen Cove, New York . in June 2003, Portman graduated from
Harvard University
with a bachelor's degree in psychology, and pursued graduate studies at the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem
in the spring of 2004. she has said that she feels more Jewish in the Holy Land and that she would like to raise her children in the Jewish religion:
"A priority for me is definitely that I'd like to raise my kids Jewish, but the ultimate thing is to have someone who is a good person and who is a partner...
I get much more Jewish in Israel ".

some more on Obama...
Is Barack Obama
good for Israel ? (from
Andrea Peyser ...) DOES
Barack Obama
have an Israel problem? The golden-throated senator has pledged unflagging loyalty to the Jewish state on his campaign Web site, and unequivocal support for Israel's right to defend itself. As far as his staff is concerned, end of story. But an e-mail has lately flown through the in-boxes of hundreds of influential New Yorkers, mainly Democrats, that poses a simple question: Would a President Obama be good for the Jews? ... Issue No. 1:
Obama can't shake his affiliation with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright of Chicago, the spiritual leader from whose sermon Obama took the title of his book "Audacity of Hope." Last year, Wright bestowed an award on the Rev. Louis Farrakhan - the man who called Judaism a "gutter religion" and Jews "bloodsuckers." He declared Farrakhan one who "epitomized greatness." ...Issue No. 2 : Obama's had trouble distancing himself from Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, who claims the United States' special relationship with Israel is the result of Jewish pressure, not mutual good. While the campaign admits Brzezinski has advised Obama, staffers insist his influence begins and ends on the situation in Iraq.

Celebrity All-Star Teams or How to Fix The State of Baseball...
Life-long NY Yankees fan,
Billy Crystal was signed by the Yankees
to a one-game contract. The
Daily News
reports that: "Crystal will join the
Yankees
as a player - yes, a player - Wednesday, signing a one-day contract that includes an invitation to spring training. According to the Yankees' press release, the "contract" was approved by commissioner
Bud Selig ."
This led me to thinking (a la'
Bill Veek ), wouldn't other teams - teams, perhaps not as popular or
profitable
as the Yankees - be better off by following suit? Imagine a team like the Tampa Bay Rays, or the Kansas City Royals, or the Pittsburgh Pirates - teams that have absolutely no shot at winning their division, making the playoffs, or attracting large groups of fans - doing exactly what the Yankees are doing with Crystal. Imagine them signing a celebrity... But, rather than doing it as a "one-game in spring training" promotion, they sign the celebrity for the entire season. Now imagine, not one celebrity, but an entire team of celebrities. Presumably, they would have to be B-Listers... the big name celebrities would want no part in a grueling 162 game schedule. They could be your classic has-beens from the 80's, Dancing With The Stars or
Celebrity Rehab
celebrities. The ones desperate enough for attention to actually agree to this radical idea.
Imagine a team made up of Gary Coleman,
Chuck Norris , Corey Feldman, Vanilla Ice, Flavor Flav,
Verne Troyer , and Mr. T. We could even include some athletes from other sports, if need be -
Dennis Rodman , Hulk Hogan,
Tie Domi , and Ricky Williams. And to give the team a shot at competing, let's toss in some washed up baseball players -
John Rocker , Barry Bonds,
Jose Canseco , Rickey Henderson, Darryl Strawberry, and
John Kruk . And for manager, let's play it safe and go with someone like Don Zimmer or
Bobby Valentine
to teach them the fundamentals. Granted, the prospects of my "dream team" winning too many games (okay, any games) look bleak. However, the odds of the Royals or the Pirates winning are arguably just as bleak. The betting
odds
at the moment for the Rays, Pirates, and Royals to reach the World Series are all 200-1. Replace anyone of their rosters with mine and their odds drop to what? 500-1? 1,000-1? 1,000,000-1? Does it really matter? Is there a big difference between .05% and .0000001% ? Not in my eyes. But look at all the positives of a celebrity dream team... They are guaranteed to
sell more tickets
than they do now. The
media coverage
following them will be huge (imagine an ESPN reporter standing next to the reporter from
TMZ ). They are sure to be covered more than any other team in baseball, which will get Hank Steinbrenner pretty mad. Payroll spending could be cut back . Currently the Kansas City Royals payroll sits at approximately $67,000,000. By paying our celebrities $2.5 Million each, the payroll would drop to $62,500,000. A $4.5 Million savings! Name recognition.
Right now can you honestly name more than two players on either the Royals or the Pirates? Exactly. While no one has a clue who
John Van Benschoten
is - everyone will be talking about Mr. T yelling "I pity the fool!" at the umpire. They don't even need their own network.
VH1
will turn into the team's network , replacing such hit shows as Flavor of Love, Hogan knows Best, and Scott Baio is 46 and Pregnant.
Baseball hostory.
Baseball purists will now have the chance of witness ing baseball history, such as the first back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back perfect games. Most walks in a season (by
Verne Troyer ). Most brawls in a season (courtesy of Rodman, the Hulkster, Domi, and Mr. T). Really, what do these teams have to lose?

nicolas sarkozy
from an email i received... Have you heard what the
French President
has been saying lately? On Wednesday, he declared that he won't shake hands with people who refuse to recognize Israel, a snub directed at Muslim leaders. On the same day he warned that France may join the U.S. and Canada in boycotting the UN's anti-Israel hatefest (known officially as an anti-racism conference) in Durban, South Africa: France will not allow a repetition of the excesses and abuses of 2001.
He has pledged to attend Israel's 60th anniversary celebrations in May, and after the recent suicide bombing in Dimona, sent a condolence letter to Shimon Peres in which he went out of his way to declare that he will always stand with Israel against terrorism. His rhetoric on Iran of late has surpassed President Bush's in its spirit of determination: Proliferation is a grave threat to international security. We cannot sit by and do nothing while Iran develops technologies which are in violation of international law. Sarkozy made some of the above comments at the annual dinner of the CRIF, the umbrella organization of the French Jewish community it was the first time a French president had ever attended. And there's more.
The opening paragraph of a
New York Times story
on February 16th reads: President Nicolas Sarkozy dropped an intellectual bombshell this week, surprising the nation and touching off waves of protest with his revision of the school curriculum: beginning next fall, he said, every fifth grader will have to learn the life story of one of the 11,000 French children killed by the Nazis in the Holocaust.
All of this is the opposite of his predecessor's approach, which involved a meticulous attention to detail when it came to denigrating and insulting the Jewish state. It was only a couple of years ago, two days into Israel's war with Hezbollah, that Jacques Chirac sat in a garden in Paris and announced to the press that Israel's opening salvos were completely disproportionate and added that One could ask if today there is not a sor t of will to destroy Lebanon. Three days later he sent Dominique de Villepin on a solidarity mission to Beirut. Chirac, though, was simply following tradition French leaders have always held Israel in public contempt, such acts being viewed as necessary to earning an advantageous relationship with the Arab world (relations, it's worth adding, that never worked out very well for France what did Chirac and his predecessors ever get from their courtships of Saddam Hussein, Yasser Arafat, and Ayatollah Khomeini?).

david vs joe-liath?
trouble making Toronto blue jay shortstop,
David Eckstein
is
at it again ... trying to outdo ( soon to be Hall of Famer )
Super Joe McEwing
as the best "Little Man to Ever Play the Game."
some quotes from the Toronto Sun and Wikipedia...
Some hills that Eckstein has climbed:
Despite winning the state high school championship, he didn't receive a scholarship offer. And when Eckstein reached the U of Florida in 1994, he was more student than athlete, making the Gators as a walk-on and getting only 10 at-bats his freshman season.
(RDAAM:
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Joe McEwing made County College of Morris in Randolph, NJ as a walk on, as well. Big Deal. ) A 19th-round selection of the Boston Red Sox in 1997, Eckstein reached double-A Trenton, where coach Arnie Beyler told him his swing wouldn't work and changed it.
(RDAAM:
Joe McEwing wasn't even drafted, he worked his way up from bat boy to utility player of the Savannah Sand Gnats in 3 short years, where his coach Billy Bob Hicks once mistook him for the mascot, Sandy the Sand Gnat. ) Eckstein was selected to the Jewish All-American team, despite the fact he is Catholic, and not Jewish.
(RDAAM:
Interestingly, Joe McEwing was once selected as the starting Utility Player to the all Irish-Catholic team, despite the fact that Joe is Jewish and not Irish .) Nice try, Eckstein. But this games only big enough for one little over achieving player.

why there can't be peace with the Palestinians...
From
Michael Goodwin of the NY Daily News ... We have gotten so numbed to the endless violence in the Mideast that we often close our minds as well as our eyes. If we have any response at all, it is something like, "Why can't those people just get along?" The answer lies in the sickening contrast of Thursday's massacre and celebration. They can't get along because too many Palestinians embrace a culture of death. It is a culture stuck in the Dark Ages of ancient hatreds and unspeakable violence.
...Every society has its madmen, its gangsters and killers. But in functioning societies, they are shunned and punished as an example of how not to behave.

fearless prediction...
John Maine , a throw-in in the Kris Benson trade a few years ago,
will have the best year of all the NY Mets starting pitchers . yep, better than Johan, Pedro, El Duke', and Oliver Perez... and he's making a relatively measly $450,000 this season. Just a
$59,000 raise
after winning 15 games last year. Compare that with the
average annual salaries
of other NY Mets: Santana - $23,000,000
Pedro - $14,000,000 Oliver Perez - $6,500,000 Orlando Hernandez - $5,000,000 and none of these guys had more wins than Maine last year.

Mrs. Obama regards America as "just downright mean," and Americans as "guided by fear," America is a nation of cynics, sloths, and complacents, "and it's gotten worse over my lifetime.... The life that I'm talking about that most people are living has gotten progressively worse since I was a little girl." the

on "Who do we want in the White House?" and an excerpt from
Obama's Church website ... "We are a congregation which is Unashamedly Black and Unapologetically Christian..." I imagine if McCain or Hillary's churches were

john mccain as a POW
I dunno if McCain will be a good president, but his story as a prosoner of war in Vietnam is pretty incredible... Prisoner of war (courtesy of wikipedia...) John McCain's capture and imprisonment
began on
October 26 ,
1967 . He was flying his twenty-third bombing mission over
North Vietnam , when his
A-4E Skyhawk
was shot down by a Soviet-made
SA-2
anti-aircraft missile over
Hanoi . McCain
fractured
both arms and a leg, and then nearly drowned when he parachuted into
Truc Bach Lake
in Hanoi. After he regained consciousness, a mob gathered around, spat on him, kicked him, and stripped him of his clothes. Others crushed his shoulder with the butt of a rifle and bayoneted him in his left foot and abdominal area; he was then transported to Hanoi's main
Hoa Loa Prison , nicknamed the "Hanoi Hilton" by American POWs. Although McCain was badly wounded, his captors refused to give him medical care unless he gave them military information, beating and interrogating him. Only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was a top admiral did they give him medical care and announce his capture. His status as a POW made the front pages of
The New York Times
and
The Washington Post . McCain spent six weeks in the Hoa Loa hospital, receiving marginal care. Now having lost 50 pounds, in a chest cast, and with his hair turned white, McCain was sent to a different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi in December 1967, into a cell with two other Americans who did not expect him to live a week; they nursed McCain and kept him alive. In March 1968, McCain was put into
solitary confinement , where he would remain for two years. In July 1968, McCain's father was named commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater. McCain was immediately offered a chance to return home early: The North Vietnamese wanted a worldwide propaganda coup by appearing merciful, and also wanted to show other POWs that elites like McCain were willing to be treated preferentially. McCain turned down the offer of repatriation; he would only accept the offer if every man taken in before him was released as well. McCain's refusal to be released was even remarked upon by North Vietnamese senior negotiator
Le Duc Tho
to U.S. envoy
Averell Harriman
during the ongoing
Paris Peace Talks . In August of 1968, a program of severe torture methods began on McCain, using rope bindings into painful positions, and beatings every two hours, at the same time as he was suffering from
dysentery . McCain made an anti-American propaganda "confession" that said he was a "black criminal" and an "air pirate". He has always felt that his statement was dishonorable, but as he would later write, "I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine." His injuries left him permanently incapable of raising his arms above his head. He subsequently received two to three beatings per week because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements. Other American POWs were similarly tortured and maltreated in order to extract "confessions", with many enduring even worse treatment than McCain. McCain refused to meet with various anti-war peace groups coming to Hanoi, not wanting to give either them or the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory based on his connection to his father. From late 1969 on, treatment of McCain and some of the other POWs became more tolerable after disclosures to the world press of the conditions to which they were being subjected. McCain and other prisoners were moved around to different camps at times, and later cheered the
B-52 -led
U.S. "Christmas Bombing" campaign
of December 1972 as a forceful measure to force North Vietnam to terms. Altogether, McCain was held as a
prisoner of war
in North Vietnam for five and a half years. The
Paris Peace Accords
were signed on
January 27 ,
1973 , ending direct U.S. involvement in the war, but the
Operation Homecoming
arrangements for POWs took longer; McCain was finally released from captivity on
March 15 ,
1973 .

The Vaad HaChumras D' Greater TriState Area , has decided to ban the latest trouble making musician,
Uncle Moishy . Reb Yankel Shnicklesfeld, spokesperson for the Vaad since its inception in 1987, said that the Vaad HaChumras will not stop their ban onslaught until Moshiach comes. "It is our duty as the self-appointed Vaad Hachumras to keep churning out bans as quickly as society keeps churning out anything with some sort of entertainment or amusement value."
The Vaad's impressive list of bans to-date includes music, Internet, pants, smiling, Miami, bike riding, high fiving, ice cream, jelly beans, rainbows, and unicorns. When asked about the latest Uncle Moishy ban, Reb Shnicklesfeld quickly referred to controversial lyrics from such hits as
Hashem is here, Hashem is there. Hashem is here, Hashem is there, Hashem is truly everywhere... "How can Uncle Moishy claim to know the exact whereabouts of Hashem?" Reb Shnicklesfeld asked our reporter. "This type of kefirah is exactly what's ruining our pure children's' neshamos. Look at this
video , for example, where Uncle Moishy is clearly encouraging unlicensed children to operate bulldozers and other assorted heavy machinery (0:10)! And I won't even mention the safety hazards involved in that scene where he is violently shaking a child (0:25)." Although Uncle Moishy could not be reached for comment, we did speak with a former member of his entourage,
Mr. Gedalya Gumberg . He did confess that Uncle Moishy wasn't exactly the best role model for him. "Uncle Moishy was like a... well, like... an uncle to me, you might say. He took me in off the streets. Taught me how to make brachos, the aleph bet... things were going good. I trusted him. He told me I could be a Mitzvah Man if I played my cards right." Gedalyah begins to choke up at this point. "But then there was the weight problem. I started putting on a few pounds. He started calling me 'Big Gedalya' or Big Gedalya Gumberg. The other Mitzvah Men would laugh. Even Dr. Green would joke that maybe he should've invented a weight loss machine rather than the Midos machine. I took it hard. Really hard."

For the heretics...
Moses was high on drugs: Israeli researcher High on Mount Sinai, Moses was on psychedelic drugs when he heard God deliver the Ten Commandments, an Israeli researcher claimed in a study published this week. Such mind-altering substances formed an integral part of the religious rites of Israelites in biblical times, Benny Shanon, a professor of cognitive psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem wrote in the Time and Mind journal of philosophy. "As far Moses on Mount Sinai is concerned, it was either a supernatural cosmic event, which I don't believe, or a legend, which I don't believe either, or finally, and this is very probable, an event that joined Moses and the people of Israel under the effect of narcotics," Shanon told Israeli public radio on Tuesday. Moses was probably also on drugs when he saw the "burning bush," suggested Shanon, who said he himself has dabbled with such substances. "The Bible says people see sounds, and that is a clasic phenomenon," he said citing the example of religious ceremonies in the Amazon in which drugs are used that induce people to "see music." He mentioned his own experience when he used ayahuasca, a powerful psychotropic plant, during a religious ceremony in Brazil's Amazon forest in 1991. "I experienced visions that had spiritual-religious connotations," Shanon said. He said the psychedelic effects of ayahuasca were comparable to those produced by concoctions based on bark of the acacia tree, that is frequently mentioned in the Bible. Source:

Lights out for L.I.P.A.
What's a guy got to do to make a buck these days? They don't shut down the chamsa boys, or The Chevra, but poor Lipa just can't catch a break, first he gets ousted from his Chassidic sect, now they cancel his concert last minute, resulting in almost $1 Million is losses. Oh and by the way, although my name Webbe Rebbe was one of the signitures, I did not authorize it!
Christian Hansen for The New York Times A billboard in Brooklyn advertises a concert featuring Lipa Schmeltzer, which will not happen.
By DAN LEVIN Published: March 3, 2008 For thousands of Orthodox Jews, the “Big Event” — a concert featuring the popular Hasidic entertainer Lipa Schmeltzer — was supposed to happen next Sunday at the WaMu Theater at Madison Square Garden. But fans and organizers were shocked to learn late last month that a group of rabbis had issued an edict against the show, effectively canceling it.
The decree, published in Hebrew in the Orthodox newspaper Hamodia and signed by 33 rabbis, warned that the sight of dancing and singing performers would cause “ribaldry and lightheadedness” that would lure young people away from spiritual purity. It prohibited Orthodox Jews from attending the concert and called on Mr. Schmeltzer to back out. The ban has inflamed tensions among ultra-Orthodox Jews over how to address the influences of popular culture, and it has thrust what has largely been an internal debate into public view. Assemblyman
Dov Hikind , whose Brooklyn district includes many Hasidic neighborhoods, said the ban had triggered unprecedented dissent and outrage among Hasidim. “In all my 26 years of representing this community, I can’t remember anything that has so shaken the people,” Mr. Hikind said on Sunday. The growing fame of Mr. Schmeltzer, who weaves pop melodies with traditional Hasidic songs, has troubled some Hasidim, who have chided him for introducing Jewish youth to secular musical styles. Others fear his popularity could rival that of the rabbis, who wield spiritual authority over Hasidic daily life.
In an effort to assuage those fears and uphold the religious practice of modesty, the concert organizers had promised separate entrances and seating for the more than 5,000 men and women who had been expected to attend, and Mr. Schmeltzer had agreed to perform only traditional Hasidic songs.
But that was not enough to prevent two community leaders in Brooklyn from mobilizing opposition to the show, which was raising money for an Israeli charity that finances weddings for orphans. In late February, the two men, Asher Friedman and Rabbi Avraham Shor, demanded that the concert be canceled. Using the text of an edict that had been used to ban a concert in
Israel , they warned that the concert would “strip the youth of every shred of fear of heaven.” They said they were acting on behalf of a group of Israeli rabbis, and ultimately, 33 American rabbis signed the edict. Sheya Mendlowitz, the concert’s producer, said Mr. Friedman and Mr. Shor had known about the concert for months but had acted without warning, just two weeks before the show, causing $700,000 in losses. “These two activists stirred up all the trouble,” said Mr. Mendlowitz, who has worked in the Hasidic music business for 27 years. “They just wanted to sabotage us.” Days later, Mr. Schmeltzer, who lives in Monsey, N.Y., announced that he would not perform. In an interview on Rabbi Zev J. Brenner’s syndicated radio program, he said that he had no choice but to obey the decree. “I have a career, I have a wife and kids to support, I have a mortgage to pay, I have to get out of the fire,” Mr. Schmeltzer said. He then withdrew from a concert in London as well.
When Mr. Mendlowitz canceled the show, he insisted that advertisers, Madison Square Garden and the more than 3,000 ticket holders — who paid between $50 and $500 — would be reimbursed. He added that Mr. Friedman had offered to help offset the losses — but only if Mr. Mendlowitz agreed to retire from the Hasidic concert business, a condition Mr. Mendlowitz rejected.
A man answering Mr. Friedman’s cellphone, who declined to identify himself, refused to discuss the concert.
The controversy has provided a rare glimpse into the deeply secretive Hasidic world. In recent days, debate over the ban has raged on blogs and on the radio, which provide participants the anonymity to challenge their religious leaders. “The rabbis are dictators,” said one writer on the blog Vos Iz Neias. Others defended their spiritual leaders, saying that they were protecting young people. “Our rabbis must know more than we do, what effect this concert, or the performers in general have on our children,” wrote another. Some critics say the rabbis were manipulated, and one signer, Rabbi Shmuel Kamenetzky of Philadelphia, told Hamodia that the rabbis did not verify the claim that the edict had been approved by Israeli rabbis. “Usually we meet together. This time, with time pressing, we did not meet together, and maybe it was not the right thing,” he said, according to Hamodia. But Rabbi Brenner said that despite any misgivings, there was no indication that the rabbis were prepared to rescind the ban, which could call their infallibility into question. “They have the weight of the Torah behind them,” he said. “I don’t recall a ban ever being lifted.” Assemblyman Hikind said he planned to meet with the rabbis involved. “Suddenly, when it comes to faith in the rabbis, there is this big question mark,” he said. “And when you don’t explain to the young people, you lose them, plain and simple.
