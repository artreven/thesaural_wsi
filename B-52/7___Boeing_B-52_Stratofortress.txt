JOVIAL
is a high-order
computer
programming language
similar to
ALGOL , but specialized for the development of
embedded systems
(specialized computer systems designed to perform one or a few dedicated functions[1], usually embedded as part of a complete device including mechanical parts).
JOVIAL is an acronym for “ J ules
O wn
V ersion of the
I nternational
A lgorithmic
L anguage.” [1]
The “International Algorithmic Language” was a name originally proposed for
ALGOL 58 . It was developed to compose software for the electronics of military aircraft by
Jules Schwartz
in 1959.
During the 1960s JOVIAL was a part of the US Military
L-project
series, in particular
465L , the
SACCS
project due to a lack of real-time languages available. 95% of the SACCS project, managed by ITT with software primarily written by SDC, was written in JOVIAL. The software project took two years and fewer than 1400 programmer years, less than half of the equivalent time in the
SAGE
L-project. [2]
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the
U.S. Air Force
adopted a standardized
CPU , the
1750A , and nowadays JOVIAL normally produces programs for that processor. JOVIAL was standardized during 1973 with
MIL-STD-1589
and was revised during 1984 with
MIL-STD-1589C . It is still much used to update and maintain software on older military vehicles and aircraft. There are three dialects in common use: J3, J3B-2, and J73.
As of 2009 [update] , JOVIAL is still maintained actively and distributed by the
USAF JOVIAL Integrated Tool Set (ITS) Program Office , and a commercially supported
JOVIAL Compiler System
is available from
DDC-I
and
Software Engineering Associates, Inc. (SEA) . The program office helps organizations reuse their old, reliable JOVIAL software by rehosting and retargeting the software to newer, more modern computer platforms and environments. The Jovial Program Office (JPO) is still active, until August of 2009. JOVIAL rehosting and retargeting for the JPO is currently done by
Software Engineering Associates, Inc. (SEA) .
The current standard package (the “integrated tool set” or ITS) contains a compiler, a
MIL-STD-1750A
assembler, linker, and simulator/debugger. It is available hosted from (runs on) either a
DEC
VAX ,
Sun
SPARC ,
Apple Mac ,or a
PC
running DOS or Windows. Versions are also available that target (produce executable code for) the
Intel 80386
(and derivatives),
MIPS R4000 ,
PowerPC ,
AP-101 ,
Zilog Z8002 ,
Motorola 68000 , and IBM
System z
processors.
Notable systems using JOVIAL include the
Milstar Communications Satellite ,
Advanced Cruise Missile ,
B-52 ,
B-1B ,
B-2
bombers,
C-130 ,
C-141 , and
C-17
transport aircraft ,
F-111 ,
F-15 ,
F-16
(prior to Block 50), and
F-117
fighter aircraft,
LANTIRN ,
U-2
aircraft,
E-3 Sentry
AWACS
aircraft, Navy
Aegis
cruisers, Army Multiple Launch Rocket System ( MLRS ), Army
UH-60 Black Hawk
helicopters,
F100 ,
F117 , and
F119
jet engines , the
NORAD
air defense & control system (Hughes HME-5118ME system) and
RL-10
rocket engines. Airborne
radar
systems with embedded JOVIAL software include the
APG-70 ,
APG-71
and
APG-73 [3] .
The
National Airspace System
(NAS), the flight data processing program at the heart of the US and UK Air Traffic Control System, uses JOVIAL.
