SBF Glossary: J

J j
J
SI -approved standard symbol and abbreviation
for the SI-approved energy unit -- joule.
A joule is 8.86 inch-pounds, in
universal American units.
In the boring system, a joule is a newton meter.
In terms of the earlier
boring system, a joule would have been 10 7
erg.
Because metric
units ignored Thomas Jefferson's (and others') wise suggestion and were not
selected to make the acceleration of gravity at the earth's surface unity, one
joule is 0.10972 kg-f × m, to reflect the conventional value of 9.80665
m/s 2
for the acceleration of gravity (that's
g n
-- the standard acceleration of free fall).
[kg-f is the weight of one
kilogram of mass.]
One joule is also 1 Wh/3600, but that's the fault of Sumerians, who bequeathed
us (they're all dead now -- perhaps that's significant) a time-system that uses
base 60.
If you believe in a calorie that is 4.1868 J, then
1 J = 0.238846 cal.
You could have figured that out, I'm
sure, but who could figure out the
real
calorie ?
All my life, I've pronounced joule with an initial zh.
Eventually I noticed
that the
eponym
was James Prescott Joule, an
Englishman, and that dictionaries give pronunciations of his name only with an
ordinary j.
I guess my pronunciation is an error due to phonetic bleed-through
from the
French
name
Jules , but I decided
to stay with my solecism.
If I have to keep hearing ``rih-JEEM'' (for
regime ) from newsfaces, I figure I've earned the right.
J
Jahwist .
German spelling of
Yahwist .
Refers to a component
of the Pentateuch, and its supposed author.
The three other major components,
to the extent that agreement exists, are
E
(Elohist),
D (Deuteronomist) and P (Psalmist).
E and J texts are concentrated in the
early books, particularly Genesis, and distinguished by the use of JHWH
(tetragrammaton for His unspeakable name) and Elohim (an alternate designation,
literally `gods').
The Deuteronomist uses both names.
It was one of the
great nineteenth-century innovations of the Biblical text criticism (begun in
Germany then) to suppose that stories with two tellings in the Bible are
typically due to two different authors (a heresy, of course).
In
The Book of J , Harold Bloom speculated that the Jahwist was a woman
in King Solomon's court.
J
Joint
noun :
a marijuana cigarette.
Abbreviation pronounced
and spelled `jay.'
adjective:
involving coordination of distinct
military services.
( E.g. :
JAAP ,
JAN ,
JANUS ,
JAOC ,
JCCC ,
JCMEC ,
JCS ,
JDA ,
JDAL ,
JDEC ,
JDISS ,
JEZ ,
JFAST ,
JIEO ,
JLOTS ,
JOPES ,
JSF ,
JTA ,
and a
different
JTA .)
It's more than just a word; it's a philosophy of cooperation at
all levels, rather than just coordination at the top (the Joint
Chiefs of Staff).
Under the Goldwater-Nichols Reorganization
Act of 1986, the JCS is an advisory body and the chain of
command runs from
the President
through the Secretary of Defense
directly
to the
commander of the combatant command.
(The Secretaries of the
Military Departments assign all fighting forces to joint
combatant commands.)
J
Juliette.
Not an abbreviation here, just the FCC-recommended ``phonetic
alphabet.''
I.e. , a set of words chosen to represent alphabetic
characters by their initials.
You know, ``Alpha Bravo Charlie ... .''
The idea behind the choice is to have words that the listener will be able
to guess at or reconstruct accurately even through noise (or narrow
bandwidth, like a telephone).
Even though there are not as many words
beginning in jay as there are beginning in some more popular alphabetic
characters (like you-know-who and we-can-keep-a-secret), there are nevertheless
quite enough thank you.
The recommendation for R is ``Romeo.''
J
A
Scrabble tile worth
eight points (or more,
on a double- or triple- letter or word space, or if it's used in multiple
words) (or negative eight, to the holder, if someone else uses up his or her
tiles first).
Therefore, it behooves you to
study this important
resource
(words in the
OSPD
that contain the
letter J).
In every Scrabble set, exactly one of the 100 tiles is a J.
The other
high-value letters (one tile each) are
X
(also 8
pts. ), and
Q
and
Z
(ten
points each).
JA
Job Approval.
JA
Junior Achievement .
JAA
Japanese Archaeological Association.
Being a Japanese archaeologist must
be a little bit like being the cherished daughter of a dictator.
The Japanese
government spends over a
billion
dollars
annually on archaeological digs.
(Why -- do you realize that's over a tenth of
a trillion yen!?!)
However, the most interesting archaeological sites, and the
most controversial, are some 250 grave sites of the imperial family.
These are
guarded and regularly inspected by personnel of the
Imperial Household Agency , and mostly off limits
to everyone else.
It gives one a different perspective on the dog in the manger.
Who knows
what's hidden under that hay?
And in case you're wondering: after a number of marriages and countries,

A Hutt.
Back in the 1980's and 1990's, there was a fad among Toyota light truck owners
of personalizing their trucks by painting over one or some letters of the logo
on the tailgate, so they would read
T O Y
or
O Y
A
or any of the 60 other possibilities.
In April 2001, some Hooters restaurants owned by Gulf Coast Wings Inc. in
Florida held a motivational contest for their employees.
The names of the ten
waitresses who sold the most beer in April at each of the area Hooters were
entered in a drawing for a Toyota.
The drawing was won by Jodee Berry, 26, a
top-selling waitress at the Panama City Beach Hooters.
Her boss, restaurant
manager Jared Blair, had told his waitresses that he didn't know what kind of
Toyota it would be -- a car, truck or van -- but the winner would be
responsible for the tax on the vehicle.
Jodee learned in May that she had won the drawing.
She was blindfolded and led
to the restaurant parking lot, where the blindfold was removed and she saw that
she had won a
toy Yoda doll
worth $40.
The manager was inside laughing.
She quit the next week.
The above information was provided to the
AP
by
Jodee Berry and her lawyer Stephen West.
If
I
had been the source, you
can be sure
I
would have called the waitresses ``waitpersons.''
I mean,
just because you serve drinks at a place whose name and promotional campaigns
imply that its servers are sexy ``girls'' (I
used
scare quotes!) doesn't
give people the right to make
assumptions
about you.
After all, the
advertising might not be accurate.
As of April 2002, the case was on its way to trial, and
a local
newspaper published an update
with a demoralizing overview of the course of
the typical lawsuit.
The next month
a
settlement was announced .
According to David Noll, an attorney for Berry,
she could go to a local car dealership and ``pick out whatever type of Toyota
she wants.''
Full details were not released, which is not unusual.
What is
unusual is that any details were released; a sweeping confidentiality agreement
is a standard part of out-of-court settlements.
Noll said he thought it was
``a recognition of the fact that there's been such an amazing amount of
attention focused on this case.... There's not a whole lot of reason to try to
hide its existence.''
Here's a legal
analysis of the case
by Keith A. Rowley, published in the
NLJ .
Yeah, yeah -- a Yoda is not a Hutt.
This webpage
has a
review by ``Yoda'' of some aftermarket products for Toyotas.
The Toyota
Company was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda.
Akio Toyoda,
his
grandson , became the youngest member of Toyota's board of directors in
Summer 2000 (age 43 or so).
The Sakichi
Toyoda Memorial House
is a part of the
Toyota Automobile Museum .
The
Toyoda
Model AA
was Toyota's first vehicle.
It was a stylish vehicle, but it was
designed for city driving and didn't have a bra.
Anyway,
AA
is a small bra size, certainly not appropriate for
hooters.
If you want more (alleged) instances of someone named J. Blair who commits a
fraud and then laughs over the discovery of his triumph, here's something from
the Jayson Blair interview mentioned at the
CSPI
entry.
Blair had described the home of rescued POW Pvt. Jessica Lynch as
overlooking ``tobacco fields and cattle pastures.''
As a
New York Times
self-investigation reported, though
he filed with a Palestine, W.Va. dateline,
Blair never visited.
Blair is quoted in the
Observer
interview:
``That's my favorite, just because the description was so far off from the
reality.
And the way they described it in The Times story -- someone read a
portion of it to me -- I couldn't stop laughing.'

jamón
Spanish
for ` ham ,'
in the common food sense.
See also
Jamón, jamón .
jamona
A slangy
Spanish
word for a woman who is not
too young and not too thin.
The word is formed as the feminine form of
jamón .
The term is usually not
complimentary.
In Puerto Rico it has the specific sense of `old maid.'
But
connotations drift, and words may be used ironically.
On the set for the
filming of
Jamón,
jamón , the sexy older actresses and young Penélope Cruz
were all refered to jokingly as
jamonas.
Jamón, jamón
Spanish
for ``Ham, ham,'' and the title of a
Spanish
film that climaxed in a fight between the
two male leads (Jordi Mollà and Javier Bardem) wielding hams as weapons.
Actually, the hams used in the movie were made of latex.
One of them has most
of the ersatz meat off and is basically a bone.
Raúl (played by Bardem)
has the bigger ham (nudge nudge, wink wink) and he wins.
You might say he
slaughtered the other guy, but the other guy (``José Luis, played by
Mollà) got (to keep) the girl, and the girl was played by young
Penélope Cruz.
[I thought of punning here on
Pyrrhic
and
pyre
(to cook the
ham , you know), but I figured
it would be too
rebuscado. ]
I think that's how it turned out, but I'm not sure.
I'm basing myself on a
quick skim of a book entitled
El poderoso influjo de Jamón
jamón
[`The Powerful Influence of
Jamón
jamón '], and also a fast-forward viewing of the DVD, which had a
slightly ambiguous straining-for-artsiness ending.
The ham fight scene starts
in the storage building for hams (Raúl's day job is there), and there
are other connections with ham.
Ham smell even gets a mention during a love
scene.
According to a storyboard frame,
``Se besan -- es exageradamente
largo y ruidoso''
[`They kiss -- it is exaggeratedly long and noisy.']
This would be a good place to point out that in Spanish, the word
jamón
is not associated with overacting, as
ham
is in
English.
Still, the movie only runs 95 minutes, so the exaggerated length of
the kiss may be another one of those artistic efforts that was left on the
cutting-room floor.
Or maybe it was never filmed.
Judging from other sections of storyboard
reproduced in the book, in this scene one of protagonists (``Raúl,'' who
was
interpretado,
as they often say in Spanish, by Javier Bardem) was
originally supposed to be clad only in cotton briefs, but he wore jeans in the
film.
Underpants play an unusually prominent role in the movie.
José
Luis is an executive in his parents' underpants factory and Silvia (played by
Penélope Cruz Sánchez, sixteen years old when the movie was
filmed -- so it's not child porn if the nudity is above the waist?) is a worker
in the plant.
José Luis gets her pregnant and promises to marry her.
His mother (played by Stefania Sandrelli) hires Raúl to seduce Silvia
and break up the prospective marriage.
Raúl is a prospective underpants
model and aspiring bullfighter.
In answer to the obvious question: it's not
exploitation because it's
art,
see?
Heck, those scenes in which the
character brought to life by Jordi Mollà munches on the breasts of the
character brought to life by Penélope Cruz?
Inspired by
``La
Caritá romana''
of Bernardo Strozzi (1581-1644).
So there: art.
The movie features both male and female frontal nudity and bull testicles.
That's male mountain oysters, not ``male and female'' ones.
The ``male and
female'' only modifies ``frontal nudity.''
My apologies to those readers who
were able to figure this out on their own.
The bull testicles are not featured
as food.
They belong to a giant bull profile (about 12 or 13 meters high) on
a hilltop ( ``el toro de Osborne en Candasnos'' ; there's a photo of it
facing page 128 in the book).
Another of the plates in the book shows the
authentic iron
cojones
of the bull next to the wooden ones that were
substituted for them in the movie.
I didn't notice why a substitution was
needed.
In case you were thinking of acquiring the book, it was written by Javier
Angulo Barturen and published in 2007 by
El Tercer Nombre and all you really
need to know is that it begins with three dictionary definitions.
The
significance of the last fact is the same for a book written in Spanish as for
one written in English and probably in any other language.
An author who
begins a book with dictionary definitions is not intentionally insulting his
readers; he is merely indicating that he is a very simple person who does not
mind or is unmindful of stating the obvious and ignoring shades of meaning.
(On the subject of meaning... Angulo -- the first surname in the preceding
paragraph -- means `angle' in English.
I'd like to make a joke about, but I
can't come up with the right angle.)
I've seen a number of books that begin with one definition.
This one begins
with definitions of
influjo,
influir,
and
jamón.
At least it didn't involve turning lots of pages.
Evidently,
influir
is
in there because it occurs in the definition of
influjo.
The
definitions were excerpted from the
DLE , which
is better than some random ``Webster's.''
But
three
(3) definitions?!
The back cover blurbiage includes the following statement:
``Se trata de un
libro de lectura fácil y amena.''
Loosely: `this book is easy to
read and the unpleasant task of reading actual words is broken up by pictures.'
Maybe the definitions
are
meant as an insult.
For those of you who followed the link here from the
jamón
entry and are still reading,
here's the short definition for
jamón :
``carne curada de la
pierna de cerdo''
(`cured meat of hog leg').
Isn't it only the back leg?
Mollà was born in Barcelona, which probably accounts for the grave
accent.
In the book (as in the Castilian language generally), his Catalonian
surname is naturalized by the use of an acute accent (Mollá).

jam sandwich
Mnemonics
for the order of planets (in
order of average distance to the sun
[ Ftnt. 28 ]) are typically
sentences about jam sandwiches (Jupiter Saturn).
E.g. :
Mother very thoughtfully made a jam sandwich under no protest.
``[T]houghtfully'' here stands for
Terrarium , the
Latin
name for the Earth.
Another example of the
use of this word is in the famous encyclical letter issued by Pope John XXIII,
entitled
Pacem In Terrarium , which urged all animals living in a
confined space with limited resources to please calm down.
Something like
that, anyway.
I was going to mention that the pope issued a
papal
encyclical, but it
seems that's the only kind he issues, and he seems to have a monopoly on the
practice, at least for the last few centuries ( c. ).
Another:
Most volcanoes erupt mouldy jam sandwich under normal pressure.
There is a certain balancing act in this glossary -- in order to create a
certain level of amusement, I find it useful, even necessary, to introduce
certain ... inaccuracies ... into the definitions.
On the other hand, in order
to preserve the fiction of utility of this `` resource '' (hah!) it is somewhat desirable that
the inaccuracies so introduced be of a blatant, easily identified sort.
This
entry contains an inaccuracy that does not satisfy this last criterion.
For
the benefit of some (idiots) I must note explicitly that the
Latin
for Earth is
Terra
(nominative case) and
that the Pope's encyclical letter, of April 11, 1963, was entitled
Pacem in
Terris .
It is available in English as publication No. 342-6 ( ISBN
1-55586-342-6) from the Office for Publishing and
Promotion Services, United States Catholic Conference, Washington,
DC .
I was going to write ``Washington, DC, zip
code unknown,'' but I thought better of it.
Someone would probably write out
``zip code unknown'' as part of the address.

Jan
A given name or two or three.
As a man's given name, Jan is common in Holland.
That name is pronounced
roughly like the English word
yon , but with a vowel of shorter duration
(say half that of the ah sound in the English word).
Jan has been a common nickname for Janice, pronounced like the first syllable
of the longer name.
I imagine you knew that, so I'm not going to do a long
song and dance explaining the pronunciation, etc., blah, blah, blah, and so
forth.
That would just be wasting your time.
William Jan Berry was half of the surfer-rock duo Jan and Dean.
You can learn
a lot about them on the web, much of it true, and much more than I care to
repeat.
I will mention that Jan Berry
graduated
UCLA
in
1964 and enrolled in California Medical College, because that gives me a chance
to link to two (2) other moderately meaty entries in the glossary, see?
There's an official Jan-and-Dean site; as I write this in May 2004, it doesn't
yet mention that Jan died late last March, age 62.
My condolences to his
life-long musical collaborator Dean O. Torrence.
Their official site was
evidently designed by Dean, who got a
BFA
(1964)
from
USC .
It is one of the most asinine sites on
the web.
From the slow-loading start page, you click to a kiosk window of
fixed dimensions and no normal controls.
Most of the text content is served as
heavy graphics (which are also hard to keep up to date).
The
British Library
won awards for doing this in its
Turning the
Pages
project.
But sometimes what works for the Diamond Sutra or the
Luttrell Psalter does not work so well for Immortal Mispellings of And Dean.
To save yourself some grief,
click to index2
instead.
Better yet, just read the excerpt below, which contains all you need to know.
The biography section on the site (written by Dean) begins
Jan Berry and I both attended University High School in West Los Angeles,
California.
We met while playing for the University High School Football Team
"The Warriors".
Jan played
tight end
and
I played
wide receiver
on
offense
and
free safety
on
defense .
Did you ever read that before?........
didn't think so.
Our coach, Milton
"Uncle
Milty"
Anisman who later when asked about what it was like to have Jan
and Dean on his football team, he said who? gee I don't remember having a girl
on any of my football teams.
After practice, a bunch of us teammates would all get together and harmonize
some of the hit platters of the day while taking a shower.
...
Jan and Dean had their first hit as a duo in 1959.
The surfer thing came a
little later.
They were very successful and bought cool new cars.
On April
12, 1966, Jan drove his new Stingray into the back of a parked truck (at a
high rate of speed ).
When he regained
consciousness a few weeks later, he couldn't walk or talk.
Dean put his degree
to use, founding Kittyhawk Graphics.
Jan presumably put some of his medical
training to use over a decade of rehab.
After
CBS
aired the television movie
`` Deadman's Curve '' (1978)
based on their story, they started touring and recording again.
As everyone
used to say, Jan could sing again pretty well ``considering.''
It's inspiring
and very interesting for, uh, die-hard fans, I'm sure.
Oh yeah -- Jan got into
drugs and derailed the comeback, and Dean teamed up with Mike Love of the Beach
Boys for some commercial gigs as Mike and Dean.
Dennis Wilson had a fatal
diving accident before he could get himself cleaned up, but Jan graduated from
rehab, and Jan and Dean spent the next couple of decades on the nostalgia
circuit.

Jarritos
A Mexican brand of sodas, and the only such widely available in the US.
The word
jarritos
means `little jars' where I come from (Argentina), and
little bottles are
``botellitas.''
I'll have to check with my Mexican
``informants,'' as we linguistic anthropologists call them, to find out how
jarritos
is construed in Mexico.
Okay, back from research.
It turns out that yes, it has the same meaning in
Mexican Spanish, and there are even some other people who have noticed the
oddity of the name and are bothered by it.
I've only ever seen
Jarritos
in fruit flavors, but one informant informs
me that they sell a nonalcoholic sangría-flavored soda.
That's one of
the exciting things about field work: the unexpected insights!
I neglected to
ask if he's ever seen any diet sodas from Jarritos.

The initials of J.A.T. Robinson, an

gospels were all written before the destruction of the second temple in 70 CE.
He argued that an event of that magnitude would surely have gotten bigger
play in the gospels, at a time when Christianity and Judaism were not
completely resolved as distinct religions, if it had occurred before these were
written.
It's hard to credit this, since some, at least, of the Christian
scriptures were written after the destruction and none mention it explicitly.
Usually,

second Temple destruction; this is taken as one of the most important among the

On the whole, although all its compilers are pre-beta-level buggy, and it
displays security-inspired obstacles at every turn, handles strings obscenely
clumsily, handles complex numbers not at all, makes most easy things strenuous,
is not at all platform-independent as advertised, and though its design
incorporates more really bone-headed choices than there is space in this vast
glossary to describe, and even though object-orientedness is mostly hype, and
even though

Java cannot be said, in the strictest sense of the word, to be utterly
evil , probably.
It should find utility as the ultimate punishment in
countries that permit torture.
In a country whose main export commodity was
once coffee, but is now white, how appropriate to make Java fit the crime.

merely capital.

JBL
James Bullough Lansing.
Founder of the company that makes JBL speakers.
Lansing was born James Martini in 1902, but when he was 25, he changed his name
to James Lansing at the suggestion of the woman who would become his wife.
You
might say he took his wife's name, even though his wife's name was Glenna
Peterson.
When he changed his last name, he also adopted the middle name
Bullough from the name of a family he lived with for a short time as a child.
He adopted the new name shortly before registering a company called the Lansing
Manufacturing Company (on March 9, 1927) with his partner Ken Decker.
That
company manufactured loudspeakers, but it was not exactly the forerunner of
JBL, Inc.
Lansing Manufacturing went downhill after Decker died in a 1939
plane crash, and in 1941 Altec Service Corporation bought it for the parts.
That is, as components manufacturer for its own loudspeakers.
They also hired
Lansing himself as VP of Engineering with a five-year contract.
When his contract with Altec Lansing expired in 1946, J.B. Lansing left and
began a new loudspeaker company initially called Lansing Sound, Inc.
Altec
Lansing thought that infringed their trademark, and the name was lengthened to
James B. Lansing Sound, Inc.
Lansing designed new loudspeakers initially very
similar to ones he had designed for Altec Lansing, and at first tried to sell
them under the ``Iconic'' brand name that he had come up with for, and that was
used by, Altec Lansing.
As this suggests, and as the decline of his first
company after Decker's death is also supposed to show, he was a much better
engineer than businessman; for this reason, or simply because of poor economic
conditions, the new company did not prosper in its first three years.
This
contributed to the despair that led to Lansing's suicide in September of 1949.
The company survived, however.
I think the company name is still legally James
B. Lansing Sound, Inc., but it sells its speakers under the JBL brand and does
business as the JBL Company.
Other very very important details: James was the ninth of fourteen children,
many of whom changed their last name to Martin.
A couple of his brothers
named Martin went to California to work for Lansing at some point.
Be careful
what you say to your coworkers about the boss -- you never know.
Steve Martin, well-known as a comedian and actor, wrote a best-selling novella
called
The Shopgirl
(2001).
(It was made into a movie, 2005.)
At the
start of the story, Jeremy (a vertex of the central romantic triangle) works
stenciling logos for a struggling Los Angeles-based amplifier manufacturer.
(When Jeremy proposes to go on the road to promote sales, his boss Chet is
thinking of hiring a nephew to replace him.)
The author, who grew up in the
Los Angeles area, was born Stephen Glenn Martin in Waco, Texas, in 1945; he is
the son of Glenn Vernon Martin, who was probably too young to be a brother of
James Lansing.
I can find no indication on the Internet that Steve Martin is
related to Lansing, and I guess he isn't.
And the fictional manufacturer has
the rather lame name of ``The Doggone Amplifier Company.''

HIV , JC virus migrates in some way to the bone
marrow, from which it makes its way to the brain within B lymphocytes.
This virus
does not

JC
See
Jaycees .
JC
Jean
Chrétien .
A possible answer to a tough trivia question in the US:
name a twentieth-century
Canadian
prime minister
other than Pierre Trudeau.
If you can't remember, you might get away with ``oh, it's on the tip of my
tongue -- the initials are Jay, uh, Cee -- it's uhh....''
J and C have been a
popular pair of initials for Canadian PM's.
An interesting borderline case is
John
Turner .
After serving in a few Liberal governments, in 1975 he resigned in
protest from a Pierre Trudeau government and went to work in the private
sector.
He returned to full-time politics in 1984 when Pierre Trudeau retired.
That June he defeated Jean Chrétien (remember him?) to be elected leader
of the Liberal Party, and so became PM.
How did he defeat Jean
Chrétien?
Well, a number of unsatisfactory theories have been proposed,
but I think the name is key.
Even though he was apparently born John Napier
Turner (in Sussex, England), he was also known as John Christopher Turner.
Perhaps that provided the margin of victory.
You could hardly believe it, but in just a few short months, Turner was
engulfed in scandal, and the next September he was replaced as PM by
Progressive Conservative Party leader Brian Mulroney.
(So Turner was PM
``1984-1984.''
Parliamentary systems have their lighter side.)
It should have
been obvious that Mulroney's successor in June 1993, Kim Campbell, had to use
the nickname
Jane
when she faced Jean Chrétien the following
November.
PM ``1993-1993.''
She was overwhelmed because her opponent was
Joseph Jacques Jean Chrétien.
It was overdetermined.
What we see here is that a partial JC may sometimes be able to defeat a full
JC, probably not a replete JC, while a BM may defeat a partial JC.
Probably a
BM wouldn't stand a chance against a full JC.
(Oh, of course Pierre Trudeau
defeated Joe Clark.
Get real.)
With Paul Martin, it seems the
Grit s were experimenting with PM for PM (it might
explain BM).
Hmmm.
After less than a year, it didn't seem to be working out very well.
He
was replaced in 2006 by another partial JC (Steven Joseph Harper).
However,
since most people just think of him as Stephen Harper, he had to form a
minority government.
On the other hand, he's an evangelical
Christian , so he won reelection handily in 2011.
In 2015, the Liberals were led by Justin Trudeau.
Since it was a contest of
partial JC's, it looked to be a close race, with the winner expected to be
forced to form a minority government.
In the closing days of the campaign,
however, Justin Trudeau promised to use deficit spending to reform Question
Period by replacing it with new daily Doonesbury strips, and his party won in a
plurality rout.
The JC effect is equally effective in US elections.
When Ronald W. Reagan
defeated Jimmy Carter in 1980, it was the first time that a major-party
candidate with initials J.C. was defeated by someone with neither a J nor a C
since 1920, when Warren G. Harding defeated James M. Cox.
Both elections were
won in landslides, which just goes to show how strong a candidacy has to be to
overcome the JC effect.
JC, J.C.
Jesus Christ.
In the same way that (okay not really in the same way that)
J.R. have been popular initials in the US lately, it seems that around the
first century BCE (if only you knew it), if you wanted to be an important
personage
J.C. were the initials
to have.
Jesus
is essentially the
Latin
transliteration of the Greek name
Iêsoûs .
(The circumflex
on the e is to indicate that it's a Greek letter eta; the second circumflex is
just a circumflex accent.
Sorry.
For what it's worth,
accents
weren't indicated graphically in Greek until
centuries later.)
The Greek name, in turn, comes from the Aramaic name
Yeshua
used among Jews (and which therefore may be regarded as a Hebrew
name of that time).
That name, in turn, is a version of the older Hebrew name,
in use to this day,
Y'hoshua .
This is normally rendered as
Joshua
in English.
Interestingly, coincidentally, suspiciously,
providentially, or significantly, depending on your
POV ,
Joshua
means something along the lines of
`[the Lord] saves.'
The first famous Joshua, of course, was the son of Nun,
and that makes a good pun (pone?) in English, when you consider that Mary was a
virgin when she was inseminated or whatever by a holy ghost, so she was as
celibate as a nun.
Nancy Freedman had some fun with
Joshua, Son of
None , which she used as the title of a 1973 novel.
In her book, some cells
are saved from the dying
JFK
and cloned.
The
resulting child is named Joshua.
The idolatry surrounding that guy is
astounding.
From Hellenistic times, Greek (more precisely
Koine ) had been the widely used
lingua franca
of the eastern Mediterranean from Egypt to Greece.
The Greek name
Iesus
(the borrowed version of
Joshua , remember?) was adopted into
Latin
(as a fourth-declension
noun , I'm sure you wanted to know).
In the usual way,
consonantal I came to be written J after that letter was invented, and
pronounced as a voiced fricative in English.
While there are many versions of
Latin pronunciation, Church Latin coincides with (our reconstruction of)
Classical Latin for this name, pronounced YEH-soos (the oo is the oo of Sue;
for vowel quantities you're on your own).
Christ
means messiah.
The English word messiah is derived from
the Hebrew word
meshiah
(or maybe the Aramaic, I'll check details
later).
The Semitic word means `annointed [person],' a term with an
interesting Biblical history.
The word was readily translated into the Greek
christos , etymon of the English word
Christ .

`` Joseph Cyril Bamford
launched
the construction and agricultural equipment manufacturing company
that bears his initials, in 1945.''
The
company
is also in materials handling equipment these days, but in the
UK
the
initialism has come to be used as an
antonomasia
for
backhoe-equipped digger,
which the company pioneered.
On page 10 of
Harm Done , an Inspector Wexford Mystery by Ruth Rendell,
the inspector is driving his grandsons to school.
One of them expresses his
pleasure about some road-building work.
``I liked the diggers.
I'm going to
drive a JCB when I'm grown up and then I'll dig up the whole world.''
Boys, as Ruth Rendell has observed through Wexford's thoughts, take longer to
reach an age where they are able to appreciate pretty landscapes.
(Wexford is
a wuss.)
Incidentally, this novel is not recommended.
At various points the
writing is confusing, possibly for effect, but the immediate effects are
confusion and irritation.
Also, it is drearily obsessed with what bad people
men are to women.
(Only
some
men!
Don't want to appear insensitively
sensitive.
And not any more often than once every page or so.)
As you can
imagine, correctly, the book is almost excruciatingly politically correct.
Of
course, for the sort of people who like to read that sort of book, this is the
sort of book they would like to read.
To help you decide if that's you, here
is some of Inspector Wexford's thought from page 4:
If she had been, well, a different sort of girl, Wexford wouldn't
have paid so much attention.
If she had been more like her friends.
He
hesitated about the phrase he used even in his own mind, for he liked to keep
to his personal brand of political correctness in his thoughts as well as his
speech.
Not to be absurd about it, not to use ridiculous expressions like
intellectually challenged , but not to be insensitive either and call a
girl such as Lizzie Cromwell mentally handicapped or
retarded .
...
Stupid.
That will do.

JCER
Jewish Council for Education &
Research .
A political action committee that no one ever heard of until
2008.
The website doesn't indicate when the organization was founded, but is
worded in a way that seems to try to suggest that it is a long-established
organization.
(That is, it emphasizes that the issues it addresses are of long
standing, and mentions the experience -- in other organizations -- of JCER's
leaders.)
JCER is basically a nominally (and no doubt by the letter of the law)
independent organization campaigning for Democratic presidential candidate
Barack Obama ``and six other [ sic ] Congressional candidates.''
I
suppose that if JCER were only supporting a single candidate they couldn't
register as an independent
PAC .
Obama is apparently relatively unpopular among Jews, polling at around 65%.
Jews have for decades been among the most loyally Democratic voters, and 65% in
the general would be a poor showing, comparable in recent decades only to the
support received by unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidates like
Michael Dukakis (who lost in 1988).
JCER has churned out a number of pro-Obama, er, heavily researched educational
videos.
As I write this, on October 6, 2008, the one featured on its website
is ``Israel's Generals Speak.''
In the same day's edition of
Israel
Hayom
(`Israel Today'),
Dan
Lavi reports
that ``misrepresents several former Israeli security officials
by claiming that they back Obama.''
[All English quotes are translations by
Aaron Lerner of
IMRA .]
Former IDF Deputy Chief of Staff Uzi Dayan complained that ``the announcement
of my support for Obama is a lie and deception.
I never supported him or
his positions.
I demand that the organization drop me from the video and I
will consider legal action.''
Former Mossad chief Ephraim Halevy, who also appeared in the video, said
that ``there is a complete misrepresentation of what I said.
I said nothing
that could be interpreted as support for Obama in the US presidential
elections.''
It would be very hard to produce an honest video showing substantial Israeli
support for Obama.
Because Israel is heavily dependent on the US for its
security, and because there is a strong possibility that Israeli government
will have to deal with an Obama administration, people in the Israeli
government (and even in parties that have any hope of forming part of the
government in the future) are diplomatically ambivalent in expressing opinions
on the US presidential contest.
Polling of the Israeli public, however,
reveals what Israeli politicians concede privately: Israeli support is strongly
for John McCain.
One idiosyncratic reason for this support is McCain's history
as a prisoner of war.
This is a condition Israelis have regular occasion to
think about and sympathize with, and a survivor of the experience is naturally
respected.
More programmatically, McCain benefits from his association with George Bush.
Bush 43 has been the US president most supportive of Israel since Richard
Nixon's emergency airlift of arms in 1974 saved Israel in the Yom Kippur War.
Israelis, like Kurds and other groups the US
MSM
are less likely to think of when assessing Bush's effect on the international
standing of the US, generally respect and like George W. Bush.
Properly
speaking, of course, McCain benefits very little from Israeli satisfaction with
Bush.
There are a few thousand American Jews living in Israel, though, and
they are expected to cast a majority of their votes for McCain.
Palestinian leaders and elites generally expect or claim that the Palestinian
public (presumably including Arab Israelis) support Obama.
You'd imagine that
someone with a middle name of Hussein would start with a natural advantage.
Reports from the ground, however, suggest that this support is tepid if it
exists.

At one time this was the

Since the

This law resolved
an ambiguous situation that had been evolving since
WWII , when the the JCS exercised direct executive
authority.
The National Security Act of
1947 treated the JCS as a planning and advisory group, but its members had
continued to exercise executive power in their separate roles as chiefs of
military services.
Since 1986, their status as military advisors --
i.e. , as members of the JCS, takes precedence over their other duties to
the exclusion of an executive role specifically in the direction of combatant
forces (though not in other management tasks).

Quoting from the same
informative page (text harvested September 2004):
NEED FOR THIS JOURNAL
Current U.S. retention figures have not improved over time, even with large
amounts of money expended by colleges and universities on programs and services
to retain students.
In spite of these programs and services, retention figures
have not improved.
[Why does the content of this sentence sound familiar?]
In
fact, only about 66% of
high school
graduates attend
college and about 50% of those who attend college earn a bachelor degrees.
[ Sic .
I just cut and paste, okay?]
Put in real numbers [is that with
the natural topology?], about 2,800,000 students will graduate from high school
this year, 1,850,000 will attend college and only 925,000 of these students
will earn a bachelor [ sic ; it's not some funny font glitch,
afaik ] degree.
Colleges are looking for ways to keep
the students that they recruit.
The Journal will provide the educational
community with current theoretical foundations, research and practice results,
which will help educators and institutions to retain students.
Let me add a note here, since there is something not mentioned that needs to be
explained.
The fact that ``retention figures have not improved over time''
despite ``large amounts of money expended'' on ``programs and services'' does
not
reflect poorly on the trained professionals who run the programs and
provide the services.
Based on Department of Education statistics, I think ``college'' in the quoted
text excludes junior colleges.
Roughly half as many associate's degrees are
granted per year as bachelor's degrees.
Most AA's are awarded by junior
colleges, and about one third of these are university-parallel or general
humanities degrees, designed to allow immediate transfer into the junior year
of a four-year college.
The remaining two thirds are business, technical,
professional associate degrees and the like, for students planning to work
immediately afterwards.
The abbreviation JCSR isn't all that common,

be just as well .

JD
Julian Day.
A chronological system apparently invented by the astronomer
John F. Herschel, and based on counting days and fractions of days from the
first day of the Julian period.
In Herschel's original scheme, dating begins at noon (at the Greenwich
meridian) in order that an entire night of observing (at least for Herschel
and his European colleagues) occurred on a Julian day.
For Western historians, counting the beginning of a day from noon is
inconvenient.
Hence historians came to define Julian days that began at
midnight.
Historians also use the abbreviation JD, but the scheme is
distinguished by calling its days ``chronological Julian days,'' as opposed to
``astronomical Julian days.''
As you can imagine, in practice one rarely
sees these terms except in explanations of the difference.
To be precise, I should say that chronological Julian days begin at midnight
twelve hours before the start of the corresponding astronomical Julian day.
Most discussions of Julian days are phrased with the implicit understanding
that the twelve hours before the first (astronomical) day of the Julian period
are already in the first Julian day.
That is, people implicitly think in terms
of a day that begins before noon.
Surprise.
In the neverending search for convenience and saving two keystrokes, historians
have also defined an
MJD .

awarded the J.D.

JEAL
James Edward Austen-Leigh, born 1798, died 1874.
Nephew and important
biographer of Jane Austen.
He was the eldest son of James Austen, Jane
Austen's eldest brother.
The Austen family tree had a lot of rather leafy
branches, and they tended to overuse some names.
(Then again, in the period
1750-1799 a fifth of all English boys were christened William and almost a
quarter of girls were christened Mary, so this can't have been a peculiarity.)
Within the family, JEAL was called Edward.
The mother of Jane and James Austen was born Cassandra Leigh (1739-1827).
Her
brother James Leigh (1735-1817) changed his name to James Leigh Perrot in 1751
in order to inherit the estate of his maternal great-uncle Thomas Perrot.
When
Mrs. Leigh Perrot died in 1836, JEAL inherited Scarlets (the Leigh Perrots'
Berkshire estate) on the condition that he add the name Leigh to his own.
This
stuff happened repeatedly.
For example, JEAL was originally named after his
uncle Edward Austen (1767-1852).
However, uncle Edward had been adopted in
childhood by his cousin Mr. Knight, and became Edward Knight in 1812.
A rose
by some other name may smell a lot sweeter with a comfortable legacy.
(And on
the subject of clichés, see about Bulwer Lytton's name at the entry for
`` It was a dark and stormy night .'')
I haven't seen specific instructions on the pronunciation of the Leigh surname.
However, a celebrated cousin, Dr. Theophilus Leigh, was master of Balliol
College, Oxford for over fifty years.
(When elected, he'd been expected to be
just a temporary placeholder, as he was thought to be in poor health.
He lived
to be over 90.)
In a letter to Dr. Samuel Johnson, local resident Mrs. Thrale
wrote his name as ``Dr. Lee,'' so there's a clue.
Jane Austen died on July 18, 1817.
Jane Austen's last surviving sibling,
Admiral Sir Francis Austen, died in August 1865 at the age of 91.
With a
consciousness that the last of those who had any personal memory of Jane Austen
would soon be passing away, and with some concern about what distant family or
non-family might write about her, the family decided that a biographical memoir
of Jane Austen should be prepared.
As a schoolboy, JEAL had once -- with Aunt Jane's encouragement -- begun to
write a novel, though he never finished it.
Late in life, he had published
Recollections of the Vine Hunt
(1865), and this success probably
encouraged him in his efforts toward a biography.
As the only son of JA's
eldest sibling (this is sounding a little like a mafia story, isn't it?), JEAL
took the task as his duty.
His
A Memoir of Jane Austen
was based on his
own and two of his sisters' recollections (his sister Caroline and his
half-sister Anne), as well as those of some cousins.
There were also a few
relatives alive who for various reasons did not cooperate, and one consequence
of this was that JEAL did not have access to all of JA's surviving
correspondence.
JEAL began writing the memoir on 30 March 1869 and was done in early September.
According to his daughter's memoir of him [Mary Augusta Austen-Leigh:
James
Edward Austen-Leigh: A Memoir , privately published in 1911], JEAL's
A Memoir
was published on 16 December 1869 -- what would have been JA's
94th birthday.
The volume contains a postscript dated 17 November 1869, JEAL's
own 71st birthday.
In any event, the volume, published in a small print run of
about 1000, bore the publication year 1870.
A revised second edition of the
memoir, published or at least printed on JEAL's 72nd birthday, dated 1871.
(This sort of forward-dating is common in book-publishing, at least partly
because it makes books seem fresher longer.
Another book I can think of that
was forward-dated was Sigmund Freud's
The Interpretation of Dreams
-- it
was published on November 4, 1899, but the date in the book is 1900.)
Don't
tell me you didn't need to read all this -- it's too late.
Two important documents that contributed to JEAL's memoir were written by JA's
favorite brother Henry, who had seen her novels through to publication,
including
Northanger Abbey
and
Persuasion , which were published
posthumously.
Henry wrote a ``Biographical Notice'' that prefaced the two
posthumous novels.
(The four previous novels had been published anonymously,
though their common authorship was indicated as they appeared successively.)
Henry Austen's ``Memoir'' of 1833 was largely a shorter reworking of the 1818
notice, padded back up with quotes of favorable reviews, for inclusion in a
new publication of
Sense and Sensibility .
Ordained in 1823, JEAL was a clergyman his entire life.
Yes, some clergymen
hunted.
Those who could, I think.
Chaplain Groves (US Army), father of
General Leslie R. (``Dick'') Groves, of the Manhattan Engineer District, was a
severe Presbyterian who considered ``any leisure-time activity other than
reading, hunting, and fishing to be a frivolous waste of time if not downright
diabolical.''
[I quote William Lawren from p. 45 of a book mentioned at
this MED
entry.]
Interestingly, from 1852 on,
JEAL was the vicar of Bray, sir!
[The datum on names in 1750-1799 is lifted from a book by Maggie Lane:
Jane
Austen and Names

jean

(``Jea''?), I wonder if this has anything to do with pants called jeans.
In
any case, the plural

all three major Scrabble dictionaries ,
but of these three only

and
TWL 2006 accept jeaned (as an adjective).
That word

There's no mention of

in any of the above-named dictionaries.
Jeb
A nickname that is sometimes given to males with the initials J.E.B.
The
most famous instance is probably still the Confederate Army general James Ewell
Brown ``Jeb'' Stuart.
So Jeb can be an acronym.
In the case of John Ellis Bush, better known by his
nickname Jeb, it gives rise to ``Jeb Bush,'' an
acronym-assisted Aap pleonasm.
(Jeb, who
served as the 43rd governor of Florida, is brother of
dubya , who served as the 43rd president of the US.
The number
42
is special, though it is neither
perfect nor prime.
The father, George H.W., served as the 41st president of
the US.)
Jeb also occurs directly as a given name.
That's the case with Jeb Stuart
Magruder, who achieved notoriety in the Watergate scandal.
According to his
memoir,
[m]y brother Don, who was named for our father, was born in June of 1930, and I
arrived in November of 1934.
Since my father was both a Civil War buff and a
horseman, he named me for his favorite Confederate general, Jeb Stuart, his
ideal of a hard-riding cavalry officer.
I can remember seeing my father ride a
few time when I was quite young.
He was into middle age by then but he rode
beautifully, always wearing a treasured pair of riding boots from his days in
Squadron A.
[ An American Life: One Man's Road to Watergate
(New York: Atheneum,
1974), p. 15.
Earlier Jeb Magruder explains that in 1916, Donald Dilworth
Magruder had joined the New York National Guard's famous Squadron A, the last
cavalry division in the US Army, but that he saw service in
WWI
as a sergeant in the 27th Infantry Division.
I'm not sure what ``last cavalry division'' is supposed to mean; horse-mounted
cavalry were used by the US in WWI and WWII, although modern weapons did render
old-stye cavalry charges obsolete.]
Don senior grew up in Staten Island, New York, but from his choice of a
CSA
general's name for his second son, you might
suspect a Southern background.
In fact, the Magruder family was established in
Maryland in 1659 by family patriarch Alexander Magruder.
Thomas Jefferson
Magruder, Jeb's great-grandfather, smuggled shoes and boots into Virginia
during the American Civil War, and another ancestor, John Bankhead Magruder,
was one of Robert E. Lee's generals (p. 13).
Alexander, incidentally, arrived
from Scotland as an impounded prisoner, and 1659 was the last year of
Cromwell's rule -- the year before the restoration of the Stuarts to power.
So
there's another nominal connection.
Moreover, after he was released from
prison, Jeb Magruder pursued a career in the Presbyterian Church.
(The
Presbyterians are originally Scottish Calvinists.
They were generally less
regicidally disposed to Charles I, not necessarily because the Stuarts were a
Scottish line of royalty.)
I myself met Robert E. Lee personally when he visited the Engineering Research
Center at
Arizona State University
in the late 80's.
He was introduced as Robert Lee, but I noticed a middle initial E on his
briefcase and asked him if he was one of the Virginia Lees.
He said no, his
parents just liked the name.
When Lee Iacocca (actually Lido Anthony Iacocca)
was working his way up the corporate ladder at Ford, he spent some time in the
South, where his Italian surname was regarded as difficult.
He would break the ice by joking about being or not being part of the famous
Lee family.
(That's from memory; I suppose I read it in his best-selling 1984
autobiography.)
The point, if there is one, is that you can't conclude too
much from a name, although the collocation of ``Jeb'' and ``Stuart'' is rather
suggestive, especially when Stuart is a given name.
That brings us to Jeb Stuart.
He was born in 1956 in Little Rock, Arkansas,
and is a scriptwriter probably best known for the screenplay of
Die
Hard,
based on a novel by Roderick Thorp.
(This is the 1988 action movie
-- the first in a franchise that will eventually include 23 sequels and an
unknown number of prequels.
For
Die Hard
XV through XXIV, a stunt
double will be used for all scenes which require Bruce Willis to walk without
assistance.
Later, he will shill for the DieHard automobile battery company,
which will have been spun off from Sears, which will have died around 2013.)
This was Jeb Stuart's first script, or at least his first that was commercially
produced.
I hesitate to say that it's been downhill since then.
The point is (okay, this isn't the point, but I just ought to point this out),
that those who do not remember history are condemned to use ``Jeb'' as a
sealed acronym .
Also, if it's true (as
some claim) that ``Jeb'' arose independently as a short form of ``Jacob,'' then
it might be a
backronym .
My head hurts when I
try to figure out whether it could possibly be a sealed backronym.

Jeep
It seems to be generally believed that the word jeep, as a common noun or
proper noun for the vehicle, originated as a pronunciation of an abbreviation
GP (GP ... ``Gee Pee'' ... ``Jeep'').
If so, the GP stood for either
General Purpose
(vehicle) or as a
manufacturer's internal designation of the vehicle for part numbering, the G
standing for government.
It might have stood for both, if quartermasters
correctly misinterpreted the manufacturer's code.
Originally introduced by Sir Harold Austin as a rugged utility vehicle for
the American market, it never quite caught on in the twenties and thirties;
the American Austin company, reorganized under some other name I forgot,
continued to make them in small numbers right up to the war.
They achieved a
small cult following.
When the US went to war, bids were requested for a
general-purpose
4WD
military vehicle, to be produced
in unheard-of numbers.
The successful bids were all for minor variations on
that American Austin vehicle.
Ford and Willys produced 75 per day, and from
1942, when civilian production was halted
for the duration
of the war, that was
the closest thing to a car that American industry produced.
After the war,
Willys continued to manufacture a
2WD
version for
the civilian market, instead of returning to conventional car production.
They
eventually made some small ``improvements'' like roll-down windows.
In the 70's, the military finally replaced the Jeep with the
HMMWV
( Humvee ).
WWII -surplus jeeps in the Philippines were
converted to small, garishly decorated open buses called jeepneys.
Here's a page with lots of
Philippine Jeepneys .
A similar vehicle is used in Puerto Rico.
It's
Willys
and not
Willy's ,
after owner John North
Willys.
Jeep, the vehicle and brand, has been a kind of curse -- a
perennial survivor of the auto companies that manufactured it.
American Motors
( AMC ) had the Jeep for a number of years after
Willys folded, and introduced the highly successful Wagoneer series.
Renault
tried to make a go of American Motors, and when they sold AMC to the Chrysler
Corporation, Jeep was the only product line that eventually survived (I think
they also kept up the Eagle line for a little bit).
In 1999, Chrysler ``merged
with'' ( i.e.,
was diplomatically taken over by) Daimler-Benz, which
unloaded it for a loss in 2007.
Chrysler's Plymouth brand was an immediate
casualty of the takeover, but Jeep keeps on truckin'.

Jenney
Short for a four-year series of
Latin
textbooks.
They had their origin in Minnie L. Smith's
First Latin
lessons
(1904).
Charles Jenney, Jr., authored revisions to later versions of that book at least
as early as 1954, and eight years later, it was still being published as
Smith and Thompson's First year Latin, revised by Charles Jenney, Jr.
(Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1962).
Jenney's second-year book then was called
Scudder's Second year Latin, revised by Charles Jenney, Jr.
Allyn and Bacon had a front-page advertisement for the set on the 1948-49
school year's first issue of
Classical Weekly
( CW ).
The advertisement bore the caption ``Latin and
World Peace.''
Those were the days.
The days of dodgy reasoning, among other
things.
It's not like that any more.
From the ad, I infer that the third-year
book was by Kelsey and Meinecke by then, and the fourth-year by Carlisle and
Richardson.
I have no idea how well coordinated the original ``well-tested
Series'' was.
The books have continued to be revised by an army of successors, but (or
perhaps
therefore ) the only author whose name appears on the cover
nowadays is Jenney's ( Jenney's First Year Latin,
etc.), and there are
workbooks available for the first two years.
(In 1948 there was a workbook by
Thompson and Peters, and an associated volume of classical myths compiled by
Herzberg.)
Your opinion of the books is bound to depend strongly on your
opinion regarding the value of the traditional
``grammar-translation'' approach.
It is a very traditional book based on
``real Latin'' -- excerpts from classical literature -- rather than made-up
readings.
Other texts typically introduce ``real Latin'' in the fourth year.
Here's
a detailed review.
(There is some sentiment that the 1984 edition is
better than the subsequently improved versions.)

Victorian Novel; Victorian Poetry; The Novel and the Long 19th Century;
Literature of Empire), on-line texts (including short stories by Lady
Jane Wilde and Mary Elizabeth Braddon), images, external links, and a
theory archive.''] Okay, so Richardson is pre-Victorian; it's close.

Babbitt
entry.
In her mid-twenties, she was cast as the
fourteen-year-old Bernadette in the 1943
Song of Bernadette .
This
is a story about the creation of the religious attraction at Lourdes,
and as such you expect it to have taken place in medieval times, but
Bernadette reported her vision in 1858.
Madonna named her daughter
Lourdes.
It seems to run in the family.
Once I mentioned to Sabine
that I had met a woman named Bernadette in

loud -- Bernadette seemed such an old-fashioned name to her.

Jessica Mitford
Jessica Mitford is one of the famous Mitford sisters.
They're so famous
that they really don't need a glossary entry.
(However, as their
floruit
recedes into the past, such an entry may become necessary as
early as next week.)
We already have Jessica Mitford content elsewhere in the
glossary.
The most important bits are at the
Lady Bird
entry and within the
U and non-U
entry (specifically at
this point,
where ``You-All and Non-You-All''
and
Poison Pen
are discussed).
Jessica's (and all her sisters') mother had the given name Sydney.
Around
1982, I myself met a woman whose name was Sydney.
This Sydney was American,
and I would guess she was born in the 1950's.
I asked her how she felt about
her name.
I can't remember her exact words, but she seemed to rather resent
her parents' having given it to her.
I didn't ask why she didn't change it.
Apparently she was waiting for 1995 and the release of
`` The American President, ''
in which Annette Benning played the love interest of Michael Douglas, as the
lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade to his President Andrew Shepherd.
Jessica Mitford herself was always known personally as ``Decca.''
Her first
child, who died in infancy, was named ``Julia Decca Romilly.''
Her surviving
children called her ``Decca'' or ``Dec'' rather than anything like ``mom.''
(Her daughter was called ``Dinky Donk'' and variants or pieces of that.)
The
kids
got
some press
when they helped to promote Peter Sussman's
Decca: The
Letters of Jessica Mitford,
published in 2006.
In early 1995, Jessica Mitford and her backing band recorded an album as
``Decca and the Dectones.''
The band was described
by
Patricia Holt in the San Francisco
Chronicle
as
``a kazoo-and-cowbell orchestra led by San Francisco author escort [the SBF
glossary does not know what that means] and recording producer Kathi Kamen
Goldmark.
(Goldmark has done other similar projects; some are linked from
this webpage , where you can order
the two-song album in CD or MP3 format.)
Yeah, Mitford was 77 at the time.
That's not such a big deal; my mother was still singing (soprano in choirs)
into her mid-80's.
Mitford was wheelchair-bound with a broken ankle when she
did her recordings, and she died of lung cancer a year-and-a-half later, aet.
78.
Holt wrote, ``certainly the term `barrel-voice' comes to mind.''
I don't know how Jessica Mitford came by her nickname, but Decca was a
well-known name in music for much of the twentieth century.
In 1914, the
musical instrument maker Barnett Samuel and Sons patented a portable record
player called the Decca Dulcephone.
The word Decca is said to have been coined
by Wilfred S. Samuel, who merged the word
Mecca
with the initial D of
their logo ``Dulcet'' or their trademark ``Dulcephone.''
I don't know what
motivated an etymology based on Mecca.
Barnett Samuel and Son was eventually
renamed ``The Decca Gramophone Co., Ltd.'' and in 1929 it was sold to former
stockbroker Edward Lewis.
I suppose 1929 was a good year for former
stockbrokers who still had their shirts to get into another line of business.
Lewis fared well; his ``Decca Records, Ltd.'' [I guess there were partners]
became the second-largest record label in the world.
I used to own many of
their records from the 1950's.
I'm not sure precisely when Jessica Mitford used a married name, but she does
describe at least one occasion in
Poison Penmanship.
Vivian Cadden, an
editor at
McCall's,
invited her to do an article on Elizabeth Arden's
Maine Chance
(a weight-loss spa located, against toponymic expectation,
in Arizona):
... a slight feeling of paranoia took hold at the moment
of actually picking up the phone to call Elizabeth Arden's for a reservation.
Maine Chance would surely be, for me, enemy territory [she had earned a
reputation as a muck-raking journalist]; what if my identity were discovered by
the reservations people?
Would they refuse my application?
I could use my
married name, but this would be scanty cover at the local Arden salon in San
Francisco [she lived in Oakland], where they might easily make the connection
with Jessica Mitford.
So I telephoned to the New York office and announced
myself as Mrs. Robert Treuhaft, which was how I was introduced to the other
slimmers at Maine Chance.
One day at lunch I overheard a woman asking another,
``Who is that?''
``Oh, that's Mrs. Fruehauf'' came the reply.
``Her husband
is very big in trucking.''

JHPIEGO
JHPIEGO, the Johns Hopkins Program for

I know, I know: it's a
little bit difficult to extract the initials G-O from the words
Reproductive
Health .
I only found this expansion in an article from 1999.
Since then,
they're even more reluctant to give an expansion.
A few pages have the
expansion, but the easiest way to find a page that gives it is to guess the
expansion correctly first.
It's the ``Johns Hopkins Program for International
Education in Gynecology and Obstetrics.''
When they were founded, in 1973 or so, this was okay; since then, I guess the
gee and oh terms have become increasingly politically fraught, so they're
covering their, uh, asses.
We live in a crazy world, but what's the
alternative?
This particular craziness is what we have come to recognize as a
sealed acronym,
but the seal is very
slightly ajar or nonhermetic or something:
Googling in January 2005, I found
that for every page that revealed the original expansion of JHPIEGO, there were
300 that used JHPIEGO without the original expansion (whether without any
expansion, or with the appositive and partially accurate expansion).
That's unusual, but here at SBF it's our
bread and butter, or anyway our virtual bread and butter.
[In January 2013, it
looks like someone has virtually eaten our breakfast, because that 300 is down
to less than 20.]
Many webpages explain that JHPIEGO is ``pronounced `ja-pie-go'.''
When I learn
how ``ja'' is pronounced (elsewhere than Jamaica), I'll let you know.

jill
An alternate spelling of the volume unit normally spelled
gill .
Like
gaol
(British spelling of
jail,
pronounced ``jail''),
gill
is pronounced with a ``soft gee.''
So even though few people will
recognize the unit in this alternate spelling, at least they'll know how to
pronounce it.
Also, it's accepted by
all
three major Scrabble dictionaries .
The gill is now generally taken to be equal to a quarter of a pint: 4 fluid
ounces in the God-Ordained Tradition! System of Weights and Measures in use in
the US, or 5 fluid ounces in the old British Imperial system.
(Note that those
are different fluid ounces: the fluid ounce of the US customary system is a
volume equal to 1.8046875 cu. in., while the British fluid ounce measures
1.733871 cu. in., approximately.)
A half a gill (an eighth of a pint) is a noggin... in some places.
In others
it's equal to twice or four times that.
Ain't it great?
At various times and places, mostly in the past and England, a gill has also
been a half pint, and in those places a quarter pint was a jack.
In
Tour of the Hebrides
for September 20, 1773, Boswell records
Johnson's saying ``Each man called for his own half-pint of wine, or gill, if
he pleased.''
I don't know how ``or'' was meant there ( i.e.,
I don't
know whether it is implied that a gill is a half pint), but I think it's worth
pointing out that until British Imperial units were introduced, the Scots pint
was a volume about equal to 1.80 US quarts.
Let's consider the spellings.
English spelling generally reflects etymology,
so that the pronunciation of certain letter sequences depends on the origin (or
sometimes the mistakenly imputed origin) of the word.
The initial letter
sequence
gi
is a case in point.
The g is normally ``hard'' (or ``guttural'') in words of Germanic origin.
Examples include
giddy,
gift,
gild, gilt,
gird, girdle, girth,
girl,
and
give.
The g is ``soft'' in words taken from French, Italian, or
Latin
(even if they only passed through one of these
languages on their way from Arabic or Greek).
Relatively simple examples
include
giant, gibbet, giblet, gigantic, gigolo, ginger,
and
gingivitis.
Gill itself is from the Old French
gille,
from the
medieval Latin
gillus,
a wine vessel.
Some exceptions to the rule can
be explained on the basis of gui- spellings in Old
French , including
gimlet, gingham,
and
probably
gizzard.
More complicated things have happened as well (see
gaol ).
I suppose all this information really belongs at a
gill
entry rather
than at this
jill
``alternate spelling'' entry.
Therefore, its presence
here is a bonus.
Just to round out the entry, I should point out that in seventeenth-century
England, the
gill
was once a unit used to measure quantities of tin, and
in that application it corresponded to a full pint.

JINR
Joint Institute for Nuclear Research.
JINR is a research center in Dubna, Russia.
The first major research instrument was built at Dubna in 1947-1949, and the
USSR Academy of Sciences eventually had two research institutes there: the
Institute for Nuclear Problems (INP) and the Electrophysical Laboratory.
CERN
was created in 1954, and in 1956, keeping up
with the Joneses of the West, the Soviet Union used those two Academy
institutes as the basis on which to establish JINR.
Initially, JINR could be
regarded by the Soviets as their CERN, but over time they diverged.
In
particular, CERN eventually had showcase high-energy accelerators for
elementary particle research, whereas Dubna stayed in what became the
medium-energy regime -- nuclear physics.
Probably the thing for which Dubna is
best known is the discovery of new transuranic elements.
This defines its
peers: initially (like its prececessor INP), it competed with Berkeley
( LBL ) for discovery of and naming rights to new
elements.
Berkeley eventually moved in different directions also, and now
Dubna's main peer institutions are
GSI
in Germany
and the
RIKEN Nishina Center
(Heavy Ion Nuclear
Physics Laboratory) in Japan.
The ``Joint'' in the name originally referred to various parts of the Soviet
Empire: some, at least, of the republics of the USSR, and Soviet bloc member
states.
In a couple of days, I hope to find out about possible members or
``participants'' that are no longer such.
I wonder in particular about the
Baltic republics.
It seems there may have been a little hesitation evem among
those that re-upped: sovereign but not-especially independent Belarus renewed
or continued its participation in 1991, seven other current participants that
had been Soviet Republics did so only in 1992.
(These were Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan).
Russia, where Dubna is
located, was always a participant by dint of the owner and operator, the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, becoming the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Nine other
countries participate formally: Bulgaria, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Mongolia,
North Korea, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Vietnam.
Most of these, or their
Soviet-era predecessors, have been members since 1956; Cuba joined in 1976; and
for North Korea (the ``Democratic People's Republic'' and mass prison),
appropriately enough, no details are available.
Most of my life, I've heard JINR referred to simply as ``Dubna.''
The 1962
accident that ended Lev Landau's career took place when he was being driven to
Dubna.
He was being driven by a graduate student, so you might suppose Dau was
going to JINR.
I think he was, but he was probably mixing business with
pleasure.
As his widow Kora Landau-Drobantseva explained in ch. 4 of her 1983
memoir ( Akademik Landau.
Kak mi zhili,
`Professor Landau: How We Lived'), the Landaus had an
open marriage.
That fateful morning of January 7, 1962, he told her that she
shouldn't answer the door -- he would do so.
This was what she called a `stop
sign' or `red light' -- evidently a warning not to be too inquisitive about his
plans.)

JIT
Just In Time.
A manufacturing strategy that minimizes the capital invested
in inventory by substituting close coordination with suppliers.
First widely
implemented in
Japan , where many companies belong to
keiretsu
(loose conglomerates, very loosely speaking) that engender
broad cooperation.
There are both horizontal and vertical (integration)
keiretsu, and some of both kinds would probably be in violation of antitrust
law in the US.
Most allegations of predatory practices by Keiretsu are never
proven.
It reminds me of Big Jule in ``Guys and Dolls'':
``Well, I used to be
bad when I was a kid, but ever since then I've gone straight, as has been
proved by my record: Thirty-three arrests and no convictions!''
The acronym is also used in computer programming.
In general it refers to the
second stage in certain two-stage compilations.
In the first stage, the source
code of a stand-alone program or module is ``compiled'' to byte code.
In the
second stage, which occurs at run time, the byte code is ``JIT compiled'' or
``jitted'' into an executable.
This sort of two-stage compilation, and the
term JIT, are characteristic of Java in general, and of all programming
languages running within Microsoft's .NET framework.

JJ coupling
A procedure for treating the
LS coupling
in high- Z
atoms (and essentially all nuclei), which for
some electrons (nucleons) is so strong as to rival the residual Coulomb
(internuclear) interaction magnitude.
The procedure consists in first treating
the LS coupling of individual electrons (nucleons), to define states of
definite L, S, J and J z , and then to treat the residual interaction
as a perturbation coupling different J states.

W. H. Eccles and

They called the circuit a ``trigger.''
JKR
J. K. Rowling .
J. K. Rowling
Pen name of Joanne Rowling, author of the hugely successful children's book
series about the young wizard Harry Potter.
It was supposed that boys would be
less inclined to buy a book if they thought the author was a woman, hence the
use of initials.
Since a single initial tends to look unbalanced or inadequate,
Rowling used the initials J. and K.
The kay honors her late paternal
grandmother Kathleen.
Rowling, seemingly inappropriately, rhymes with
bowling
rather than
howling.
In college, Rowling read French with a Classics
subsid
(majored in French and minored in Classics; you could do a Classics
subsid at Exeter without studying Latin).
In one interview no longer at its
old
URL
she said,
I went to Exeter University straight after school, where I studied French.
This was a big mistake.
I had listened too hard to my parents, who thought
languages would lead to a great career as a
bilingual
secretary.
Her books are full of Latinate invented words, and she gave Hogwarts school
the Latin motto
Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus
(`Never Tickle a
Sleeping Dragon').
As she put it in a March '99
interview at the
Mothers Who Think
website,
I taught for about four years, mainly teenagers.
It is my own memories of
childhood that inform my writing, however; I think I have very vivid recall of
what it felt like to be 11 years old.
The classics part of my degree at Exeter
College did furnish me with a lot of good names for characters -- not exactly
the use my lecturers expected me to put it to, however.
It was announced in December 2001 that
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's
Stone , the first book in the Harry Potter series, would be published in
Latin (in 2003) and ancient Greek (later).
The stated intention is to help
children overcome the common dread of studying the two dead languages.
(Gives
you a whole different take on ``scary stories,'' huh?)
Peter Needham, who
taught
Latin
and
Greek
at Eton College for more than 30 years, was contracted
to do the Latin version.
Needham is ``calling Harry Harrius Potter.
Arrius is
a Latin name -- there's an Arrius in a Catullus poem -- and it declines
perfectly well so that, for example, we have Harrium Potterum.
The literal
translation of Potter would be Figulus but I very much hope that Potter will
survive.''
(This is a bit of sly humor.
In poem 84, Catallus ridicules Arrius
for his speech defect: he inserts an aitch -- a rough breathing rather than a
sound, as the
Greeks and many Romans
thought of it
-- before words beginning in
a vowel.
Hence, he'd have pronounced his own name Harrius.)
For more on Roman attitudes to aitch, see comments in the
Noctes Atticae
(`Attic Nights') of Aulus Gellius, bk. II, iii.1-5, Quintilian, IO 1.5.19.
One
secondary source that I can think of, just speculation really, is E. S.
Sheldon, ``H as a Mute in
Latin ,'' vol. 5
HSCP
(1894), pp. 167-168.
Our small contribution to Harry Potter studies is the

entry.

presentation, see

Names,''

It turns out the ``J. Rowling'' might have implied, depending on circumstances,
that the author was self-derogatory or masochistic.
``J. K. Rowling'' is a
form that may (as it does in this case) indicate a desire to avoid revealing
oneself.
Ezra Pound gave Hilda Doolittle the pen name
H.D.
I'm not clear whether this was intended to help get her work published; her
first three published poems all appeared in the literary
magazine
Poetry , published by Pound's friend
Harriet Monroe.
Other famous authors who have used a pseudonym that concealed the fact that
they were women:
George
Eliot [Mary Ann Evans],
George Sand, Collette.
(No, ``Collette'' doesn't dissimulate the author's
gender, but read on.)
Samuel (Erewhon) Butler argued that
The Odyssey
(yeah, ``Homer's Odyssey'') was written by a woman (the title sort of kills the
suspense of the argument:
The Authoress of the Odyssey ).
A somewhat
different case is presented by the Pentateuch, redacted from texts written by a
number of authors (possibly not all male) and attributed to Moses (see
J
entry).
Amandine-Aurore-Lucile Dupin (neé Dudevant) co-wrote her first novel
with her then-lover Jules Sandeau, published under the single pseudonym Jules
Sand.
Her second novel,
Indiana
( my state of
residence! ), and subsequent novels, she single-authored as George Sand.
She was famous not only for her novels but for her sexual iconoclasm -- smoking
cigars, affecting male clothing, and engaging in multiple affairs with a lack
of secretiveness unusual for women of her class.
She had a prodigious output
-- she wrote for the money.
As Dr. Samuel Johnson said -- ``No man but a
blockhead ever wrote except for money.''
Sidonie Gabrielle Claudine first wrote several books published under her
husband's name (Henri Gauthier-Villars).
After her divorce, she published
first under her maiden name and then as Collette.
In her memoirs she wrote
Born into an unmonied family, I never learned a métier.
I knew how to
climb, whistle, and run, but no one ever suggested that I earn my living as
a squirrel or a deer.
The day necessity put a pen in my hand, and in return
for my written pages I was given a little money, I realized that every day
thereafter I would slowly, tractably, patiently have to write . . .
(Did I mention Dr. Johnson?
Have I pointed out that a major irritant in the
long feud between Dostoyevsky and Turgenev was the fact that the latter was
better-paid for his work?
Dostoyevsky complained that Turgenev was paid five
times as much per word.
I wouldn't have complained if Fyodor had written
shorter novels.)
George Sand, Collette, and J. K. Rowling all had unhappy first marriages,
divorced and were poor, and wrote to make money.
Mary Ann or Marian Evans, who
wrote under the pen name George Eliot, never had a legally sanctioned first
marriage -- unhappy or otherwise -- but she lived happily with George Henry
Lewes from 1854 until his death in 1878.
(He was unable to obtain a divorce
from his first wife; his sinful cohabitation with Evans was a scandal.)
There
must be a pattern or a lesson in all this, but I can't imagine what it is.
Joanne Rowling was married on Friday, October 16, 1992.
In
Harry Potter and
The Prisoner of Azkaban , Professor Trelawney tells Lavender Brown, ``That
thing you are dreading -- it will happen on Friday the 16th of October.''
Some of the people who write romance novels are men, but none of the names of
authors listed on the covers of romance novels are men's names.
If you'll just
do the arithmetic, you'll see that this means that there are men writing under
female pseudonyms.
In the traditional romance novel, the heroine finds
happiness in her first marriage.
(Although there does now exist a
``second chance'' subgenre.)
I read three romance novels once, almost, and later
I thought, ``Hey, I can turn out shlock like this too!''
My cousin Victoria
(raking in the big bucks as a schoolteacher) encouraged me in this enterprise,
sort of, and came up with a good pen name for me.
Eventually, however, I
realized that to write what you can't bear to read any more of can really put a
damper on your working life, so that project is on hold everlasting.
There's a bound typescript publication by Alice Kahler Marshall,
Pen Names
of Women Writers from 1600 to the Present

Don't
worry if you find this confusing.

many years ago (1980's, probably), and I
think the title was Laura Riding Roughshod.

Superman's parents perished when his home planet was destroyed, and Batman's
parents were murdered.
They're both very unhappy about these violent demises
of course.
I don't know about the other superheroes, but I think I see a
pattern of childhood fantasy here that would not want to recognize itself.
Harry Potter is a sort of boy superwizard; his parents are killed at the
beginning of the first Harry Potter book.
Incidentally, you know that according to oral history as handed down and
reported by Flavius Josephus (Antiq. Jud. 1.13, 2), Isaac was twenty-five
years old when Abraham set out to sacrifice him.
Also according to the oral
history, they came down Mt. Moriah in silence and never spoke to each other
again.
I mean, like, what do you expect?
[I think it's just so cool how, by proceeding methodically in alphabetical
order, all of these unexpected connections just automatically reveal
themselves.

There must be something to literacy.]
J. K. Rowling's

moved in with another woman what-many-regarded-as indecently soon after, and

It seems they talk infrequently, if ever.
I'd say more, but

JLI
Japanese-Language Instruction.
According to
ACTFL
figures mentioned in
this
report by Kyoko Toriyama
(1992), it experienced a surge in the 1980's.
By
1985 US high-school enrollments for Japanese had surpassed those for Russian,
making Japanese the sixth-most-studied foreign language, with a total
enrollment of 8,558.
As of 2000, Japanese was still in sixth (at 0.8% of
FL
enrollments), after
Spanish
(70.8%, including
SNS ),
French
(18.3%), German (4.8%), Latin (2.7%), and Italian (1.2%).
The source for the Y2K percentages in the last paragraph is
the ACTFL report
quoted
at the SNS entry, which does not list Japanese-language enrollments
for 1985.
It appears that enrollments continued to surge in the early 1990's
and then began to stabilize: total public high-school enrollments were 24,123
in 1990, 42,290 in 1994, and 50,884 in 2000.
(Yes, the ACTFL does these
studies rather irregularly.
In my experience, US Education statistics are
gathered at haphazard intervals.)
California public high schoools had the most students studying -- about 10,000.
Hawaii had 7400, which probably represents the highest percentage of students.
The 1992 study by Toriyama was primarily based on a survey sent to 29 high
schools; usable responses were obtained from 17 schools.
These schools
reported using 11 different textbook series.
The most popular textbooks were
designed for the college level, and there was evident dissatisfaction with the
available texts designed for English-speaking high-school students.
Most schools were allocating 3 to 6 weeks to learn
hiragana
and an
additional 2 to 6 weeks for
katakana.
There was enormous variation in
the rate at which kanji were introduced.
The focus was generally on speaking
and understanding first.

Joad
Surname of the family at the center of John Steinbeck's 1939 novel
The Grapes of Wrath.
The title of the novel is borrowed from the song ``The Battle Hymn of the
Republic.'' (``Oh mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. / He
is tramping out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.
/ He has
loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword. / His truth is
marching on.''
These are not the lyrics exactly as Julia Ward Howe wrote them,
but as I have always heard them.)
The lyrics allude to Rev. 14:19, which
mentions a ``great winepress of the wrath of God'' (in the
KJV ) that yielded blood (Rev. 14:20).
There are
plenty of other Biblical allusions, and the name Joad sounds somewhat Biblical
too, echoing Joab, Moab, Job, Joed, and a very large number of personal and
place names ending in -ad.
job
Here's an unusual use of the English language:
I got a job by accident.
When we were graduate students in physics, and we observed as each student in
turn disappeared beyond the event horizon of the final public oral
( FPO ), to be torn apart by the tidal forces of the
job-market black hole, one of the few triangulation points we learned was the
following datum:
Job offers are
bosons .
That is, they obey Bose-Einstein ( B-E ) statistics:
if you are in a one-job-offer state, your probability of transitioning to
a two-job-offer state is twice the probability that the poor guy with no job
offer will get even one; if you are in a two-job-offer state, your chances of
getting another offer are three times his chance of getting a first job offer.
The injustice of this situation is obvious, since the person with no job offers
needs a job offer much more than the person with two, who is going to turn down
one of the offers anyway.
It is said that the market is cold, and while no
precise temperature measurement has been reported, it appears that we may be
close to the Bose Condensation ( BEC ) regime, where
all the job offers condense on one applicant.
On the basis of this
observation, I think that an effective jobs program would be to give that one
applicant a secretary.
That would not only open up a secretary position, but
the excess job offers could be turned down promptly, creating a population
inversion, etc.
Even I get tired of teeteringly extended metaphors, and I hadn't even discussed
lasing .
It is probably fair to note that early
research on job offer statistics is implied in the classic research of Saint
Matthew ( Matthew Principle )
However, I
first learned about quantum job-offer statistics from Steve, a student of
Arthur S. Wightman, so it may be that the principle has now been placed on a
rigorous axiomatic field-theory foundation.
New research suggests that
MOTAS
statistics are
also bosonic.
For more detail on job stats, try following the link at the
BLS
entry.
Although they're not pronounced identically, it seems appropriate that the
Biblical Job and the quotidian
job
should have the same spelling.
Both
are associated with great suffering.
Incidentally, the English word
job
has been borrowed into German as a masculine noun.
This loan is reputed to
have a German pronunciation simmilar to the English (something like what would
be spelled ``jawp'').
But it's a very common word, and without researching the
matter, I suspect that as usual its pronunciation will go a bit native and
start to resemble that of the name of the Biblical character (also spelled
Job
or almost equivalently
Hiob ).

He was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight.
JOHNNIAC
JOHN von Neumann Integrator and Automatic Computer.
An early computer
built by the RAND corporation and based on the
IAS
architecture developed by John von Neumann and
named in his honor.
Like all computers of its era, it was a one-of-a-kind
machine that could not exchange programs with other computers
(even other IAS machines).
Then again, the programs were pretty short.
JOHNNIAC operated from 1953 until February 11, 1966, logging over 50,000
operational hours.
The machine currently takes up space at
the Computer History Museum
in
Mountain View, California.
The preceding information, but not the crucially important attitude component,
was cribbed from the
JOHNNIAC
entry
at
Wikipaedia, the
free encyclopaedia , with an extra vowel because this is
SBFary, the free glossary .
According to the
Giant Computers
file , this computer contained about 3000
tubes ,
no
crystals, and about 200 relays, and occupied 250 square feet.
It was
used for scientific calculations for general research.
Johnny Rotten
Gerard is taken with the album title:
Never mind the bollocks.
JR got back together with the rest of the Sex Pistols for a recording session
or concert or something, in 1997, so he could insult them and give a filip to
his sagging solo career.
Johnson
Johnson is the
second
most common surname in the US .
When Gary and Susan married in Scottsdale, one of my tasks, as a local, was to
taxi some of the out-of-town guests, including Gary's sister.
Sitting in the
back seat, she asked about the frilly black garter on the floor of my car.
I
had to explain about how a famed composer of liturgical music, David A.
Johnson, had passed away not long before, and how, as a direct and unavoidable
consequence of the
Law of Unintended Consequences , a letter of
condolence had arrived at
CSSER , where another
David A. Johnson was an
ASU
graduate student in
EE .
It was decided to celebrate David's passing with
a memorial quaff at a nearby bar, within walking distance of EE for the badly
decomposed body himself.
Seeking to show the proper respect, I called a few
funeral homes for information, but they all said it was an east coast thing, or
an
Italian
thing, and they had no idea where I
could get a black armband, so I went out and bought a black garter as the
next-best thing.
Then Gary's sister asked me about the castanets.
One of the problems with having a popular name like David Johnson, in addition
to people mistaking you for another David Johnson, is people mistaking you for
another David Johnson
when it's really you .
This happened to Orioles
manager Davey Johnson, who on the same day at the end of the 1997 season (a)
was fired from his job and (b) won the American League Manager-of-the-Year
honors.
It was
the same guy , but the team owner obviously thought that
the Davey Johnson who did such a good job was a different Davey Johnson than
the one he was firing.
I guess.
Perhaps owner Angelos was confused because
the same Davey Johnson had managed teams in both American and National Leagues
(none of which had ever finished lower than second place).
Perhaps Mr. Angelos
was confused because Davey Johnson had managed the team to a second-place
finish the previous year, but this year the team was in first place from the
first day of the season to the last.
Perhaps Mr. Angelos was just confused.
Maybe Davey Johnson can pretend to be the different DJ who won the award and
get his old job back as a new DJ.
Reminds me of the new
Richard Nixon .
There ought to be some way to take advantage of this kind of thing.
Legally, I mean.

``The Great Race'' (1965) was directed by Blake Edwards and had an all-star

Jón Gnarr
This entry is among the j's rather than the g's because it starts with J,
see?
Anyway, in many languages the pronunciations of j and g overlap.
Granted, that's not the case in Icelandic: the initial g in Gnarr is unvoiced.
( I.e. , it's pronounced /k/.
Interestingly, all the stop consonants in
Modern Icelandic are unvoiced, and the distinction between voiced and unvoiced
consonants that is typical in other European languages is replaced by a
phonemic aspirated/unaspirated distinction.)
Nice try, though.
Honestly, I've
put the entry here because I wanted another j entry.
Also, this is the name of
a person whose last name is not Gnarr.
The full name is Jón Gnarr
Kristinsson.
As you may have gathered, it's an Icelandic name, so Kristinsson
is a patronymic and not a family name.
Jón was named Jón
Gunnar
Kristinsson at birth (on January 2, 1967), but in 2005 he had the
middle name legally changed to Gnarr, which is the way his mother pronounced it
when he was kid.
How did she pronounce it later?
I don't know.
For the moment, most of our substantive information about Jón Gnarr is

Joseph
Joseph was a snitch.
It says so at Genesis, ch. 37, verse 2:
he would go
and rat to Dad on his own older brothers.
That's the real reason they hated
him.
It wasn't
the coat .
No one likes a snitch.
His own brothers wouldn't even talk to him (37:3).
God
spake directly to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Joseph?
Let him interpret dreams.
Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat
Joseph's father gave him a garment that was described in Hebrew as
[transliterated; I'll get around to
Unicode
in a
decade or two]
k'tonet passim .
The first word means `garment' of some
sort, but the second word is a mystery, at least as of 1995, which is the most
recent literature I've looked at.
(Of course, some speculations are expressed
confidently.
Shame on me for being taken in.)
The Septuagint ( LXX ) translates the term with
chiton polikilon , `many-colored coat.'
But the Septuagint translation
came many centuries after the text of Genesis was first composed (the Hebrew
continued evolving, though), and it appears that `many-colored' was a guess.
(Most of the relevant Genesis chapter, 37, appears to have been written by the
J
author.
In fact, the sentence that introduces
the famous garment calls Joseph's father ``Israel,'' and that is generally
regarded as a reliable indication that the author was J.
However, the other
two contexts of
k'tonet passim
in this chapter are E, so the clause with
this phrase is considered E.
Textual criticism, ugh.)
Another traditional interpretation is that
passim
here means `with
sleeves,' and that is the translation favored by, for example, the
revised standard version
(``robe with sleeves'').
Yick.
No one ever seems to mention that -im is a plural ending, and for
`sleeves' one might expect the dual ending -ayim.
I mean, to the extent that
the -ayim is possible or probable, its absence counts as weight in the balance
against the sleeve interpretation.
(Ah say, ah say gimme that ollllllld time
relijun!
The
KJV , in His Own English,
says ``coat of many colors.''
Yea and Amen!)
For a word like
passim , it's natural to seek
occurrences elsewhere in the Bible.
In addition to the three occurrences in
the Joseph story (ch. 37, vss. 3, 23, 32),
k'tonet passim
occurs in
II Sam. 23:18, where it describes a garment worn by the daughters of
kings.
That's the uncertain state of affairs as it stood, in limbo for a couple of
millennia.
In the twentieth century, there was some new old information.
Among cuneiform inventories (written in Akkadian, another Semitic language),
one kind of clothing listed is
kitu pishannu
and
kiutinnu
pishannu
[details in
JNES
vol.
8 ,
p. 177 (1949)].
These were ceremonial robes for draping over the statues of
goddesses, and
pishannu
apparently denoted gold appliqué
ornaments.
(The ornaments were sewn on; they would come undone and require
resewing, at which time they would appear in the inventories.)
I'm not sure how firm this Akkadian stuff is, but it's good enough for me.
Anyway, you can see that title ``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor
Dreamcoat,'' for a
musical by Andrew
Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice , takes no unusual liberties in translation.

journalistic balance
In a
1984
conversation with Edna O'Brien,
Philip Roth commented ( Shop Talk ,
p. 109) that she ``write[s] about women without a taint of ideology or, as far
as I can see, any concern with talking a correct position.''
Her reply began
thus:
The correct position is to write the truth, to write what one feels regardless
of any public consideration or any clique.
I think an artist never takes a
position either through expedience or umbrage.
Artists detest and suspect
positions because you know that the minute you take a fixed position you are
something else--you are a journalist or you are a politician.
journalistic instinct
The courage to ask a question which accurately reflects the ignorance
of one's audience, combined with the wisdom to accept an answer only if it
is consonant with one's own sincerest prejudices.
jovial

JOVIAL
entry -- that's about a computer
language.
See the
JPO
entry instead.
JOVIAL, Jovial
Jules's Own Version of
IAL .
IAL was the original
name of
Algol , and Jovial was similar to Algol 60.
I don't know who this fellow Jules is, or perhaps was, but he was apparently
associated with the
US Air Force , since that was
the main customer for Jovial.
And is!
The felicitously named
USAF JOVIAL Program Office,
based at Hill
AFB , has
a
webpage
that was updated as recently as April 2006.
Then again, the
B-52
was last
manufactured in 1962, and the plan is for the Air Force to still be flying it
in 2040, so I suppose this isn't all that surprising.
Jowett
Benjamin Jowett, of course, born in London, 1817.
Often referred to as
``Jowett of Balliol,'' the college at Oxford where he was master from 1870
until his death in 1893.
A Church of England clergyman, he also served as vice
chancellor of Oxford.
The following bit of doggerel, written about him during his early years as a
lecturer, expresses something of his personality and the pronunciation of his
name:
First Come I
My name is Jowett;
It is not knowledge
If I don't know it.
Another instance of poetry used to elucidate the pronunciation of an English
name is given at the
Pepys
entry.
The poems
convey the pronunciation information in rhyme as well as meter.
Of course,
many kinds of poetry do not use rhyme.
That is particularly true of poetry in
Ancient Greek (which will become relevant to this entry later) and
in
Latin
(whose most prestigious poetic forms were
adapted from Greek).
As Dante wrote in
Vita nuova , in his day (around
1300), the ``poet'' word was reserved for writers of Latin verse, and the rest
were mere ``rimatori.''
Japanese poetry also doesn't make much use of rhyme.
(Frankly, with mostly
synthetic verb conjugation and with a verb-last syntax, rhyme might get pretty
boring and even silly, though it seems to work in German despite the
V2
structure.)
So haiku is based on syllable
counts.
For an instance of pronunciation clarified by haiku, see
the
homogeneous
entry.

Joyce ACC
Edmund P. Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center Fieldhouse.
It's located
west of the
Notre Dame
Football stadium.
(At one
time, Juniper Road ran behind the west of where the stadium now, stands.
Then,
to accommodate the expanding campus, Juniper Road was shifted east, and the
parts of it that remained inside the campus were renamed ``Old Juniper Road.''
The stadium was on the west side of the new Juniper Road, and later the
Joyce ACC was built on the east side across from the stadium.
Juniper Road was
normally a two-way street, but for many hours on football Saturdays it was
one-way ``in'' (toward the stadium) or ``out.''
Other buildings continued to
be built east of Juniper, and in 2006 or so, to accommodate the expanding
campus, most of Juniper Road was torn up and grassed over, or otherwise
landscaped or repaved as part of the new parking configuration.
As of 2008,
Joyce ACC is separated from the stadium by a plaza, so it looks like part of a
stadium complex.
Joyce ACC is frequently mis-expanded (or at least
unofficially expanded) as ``Joyce Athletic and Convention Center.''
When
WNDU -TV's first transmission tower was
completed in June 1955, its blinking red beacon was installed eighteen inches
below the apex rather than at top, as is normal.
You might think that this
displacement would have endangered any barnstorming pilots coming in to land
( VFR ) at
South Bend
Regional , but not to worry: at the top was ``a gilded statue of Mary,
mother [an avatar, as I understand it] of God,''
according to
WNDU , which goes on to point out that
The simplicity of the sculpture is overwhelming.
Frankly, if the closest most people will get to see it is 570 feet (the height
of the original broadcast tower) minus eye height, why spend money making a
complex speculative likeness?
Maybe it is the simplicity of the faithful that is overwhelming.
In 1415, as the friar Jan Hus (`John Huss' in English) was being burned alive
at the stake, he remarked, or quipped (with great presence of mind,
IMO ):
O sancta simplicitas!
[`Oh Holy Simplicity!']
This was apparently a reference to a peasant adding a
faggot to stoke the fire.
It was also presumably an allusion to a comment of
Saint Jerome --
Veneratoni mihi semper fuit non verbosa rusticas sed sancta
simplicitas.
[`I have always revered not crude verbosity but holy
simplicity.']
Then again, maybe he was misheard and actually said ``Oh Holy
Shit!''
That hasn't aught to do with this entry, I guess, except that the tower
functions as a lightning arrestor, so the statue is scarred up some after
fifty years.
What does have to do with this entry is that in June 1955, Father
Edmund P. Joyce demonstrated his athleticism by climbing to the top of the
570-foot tower and blessing the statue.
Just how close did he have to get?
Couldn't he bless it from the ground?
In 1970, the statue was lifted to the
top of WNDU's new 1000-foot tower, but it wasn't necessary to rebless it
because it had already been blessed fifteen years earlier.
Why didn't they
think ahead in 1955 and first put it at the top of a two-foot tower so that it
could be blessed at a convenient height?
Then they could transfer it to the
new (570-foot) tower with no need for a rebless climb (just as it wasn't
needed in 1970).
These clerical types just aren't practical.
Father Edmund Joyce, C.S.C., died in Spring 2004.
In a press release dated November 23, 2005, the University of Notre Dame
announced that it had reached an agreement with
Gray Television, Inc. , under which Gray
acquires all of the capital stock of
Michiana
Telecasting Corporation, the university-owned company that operates
WNDU- TV , for $85 million in cash, most of
which will be invested in the university's endowment.
Student internships at
WNDU-TV will continue.
The agreement is subject to certain conditions and
regulatory approval, and is expected to be completed before June 30, 2006.
According to the press release, WNDU-TV ``is the
NBC
affiliate serving the South Bend-Elkhart, Ind., television market, the nation's
87th largest Designated Market Area (DMA).''
Eighty-seventh largest DMA out of roughly two hundred?
A four-syllable rank?
This is humiliating.
No wonder all our local stations are in UHF Siberia
( WNDU
is channel 16,
WNIT
is 34,
WSBT
is 22;
there's at least one other).
Gray previously announced its acquisition of
WSAZ-TV, the NBC affiliate serving Charlestown-Huntington, W.Va.
Where?
Gray Television, headquartered in Atlanta, will own 35 stations when the WNDU
and WSAZ acquisitions are complete, reaching approximately 6 percent of total
U.S. TV households.
This is not making me feel better.
Of these 35, 16 are
CBS
affiliates, 10 are NBC affiliates, and 7 are
ABC
affiliates.
Twenty-five of the stations ranked
No. 1 in local news audience, and 24 are No. 1 in overall audience within their
respective markets.
Is this impressive?
Why sure: the 35 stations serve only
30 TV markets, so at most 30 could be first.
I don't know if any more than six
of these markets are served by a No. 2 TV station.

JPW
An orgy that begins the Friday following Ash Wednesday of the sophomore
year.
Extra-large sweat-shirts with the letters J - P - W
are on sale at the university book store.
It must have been a long time ago that I wrote the first paragraph of this
entry.
At the University of Notre Dame (in Saint Joseph County, Indiana), JPW
stands for Junior Parents' Weekend.
It sounds a bit like it's promoting
teenage pregnancy, but it's actually a juniors' parents weekend: a weekend when
the parents of juniors enrolled in the university come to visit their kids and
see what their $30,000 or so a year is buying.
I'm not sure how they pick the
weekend.
In 2008 it was the second weekend after Ash Wednesday (Feb. 16-17),
so secular considerations may intrude.
This annual ritual was instituted in 1952 by then-president Father Theodore
Hesburgh.
(For more about names ending in -burgh, see the
Pgh
entry.)
Father Hesburgh (``Father'' is not his
first name, so this isn't an instance of
nomen est omen ) felt that
``parents should become more involved in their students' lives at Notre Dame
before the following year's graduation ceremony,'' according to an article in
the student newspaper in 2008, when about 1750 parents were expected for JPW.
A quick bit of googling suggests that Harvard is the only other school with a
Junior Parents' Weekend.
Harvard is a more demanding school, though: they also
have a Freshman Parents' Weekend.
Saint Mary's College, which neighbors Notre
Dame, has a Sophomore Parents' Weekend on the same weekend that Notre Dame has
its JPW.
Entirely by coincidence (surely they wouldn't do it as a deliberate
provocation!?) the students who do a local performance of ``The Vagina
Chronicles'' have a performance on Sunday during the parents' weekend.
Saint Mary's College also holds an annual event for seventh-grade girls from
the local area ( Michiana ) to, of all things,
``celebrate [the] accomplishments of Saint Mary's students in math.''
They
were expecting 90 students on Saturday, February 23, 2008.
(I didn't follow up
to check how many actually showed up, okay?)
This (2008) is the 18th year they
hold the event, and it's also the first year that I've heard of it.
Of that I
am pretty sure, because a Catholic school celebrating a ``Hypatia Day'' (that's
what the event is called) is immediately arresting and memorable.
Hypatia of Alexandria had other distinctions besides being ``the first female
mathematician'' (whose name we know) and a leading Platonist philosopher.
During the patriarchate of Cyril of Alexandria, a (nonheretical!) Christian mob
kidnapped her to a church, where she was stripped, flayed to death with tiles,
and dismembered.
It's not clear what role Cyril played in this episode, but it
was the same Cyril who some time earlier had led mobs in the destruction of the
Alexandrian synagogues and the expulsion of the Jews.
I'm sorry, that's
Saint
Cyril.
Anyway, for SMC to hold a Hypatia Day displays about as much chutzpah as would
Notre Dame University holding a day to honor Giordano Bruno or Jan Hus or the
Albigensians or Galileo Galilei, although the last was not murdered.
He was
even rehabilitated in a sort of mini-de-Stalinization event a few years back.
I guess I can see where this is leading.
When ND holds its first Galileo
Astronomy Day, I'll try to mention it here.

flagged about halfway through

In LOTR, I really felt that he broke faith with the reader when
Gandalf the Grey came back as Gandalf the White.

Jump The Shark .
A television
series is said to jump the shark when it airs a particularly lamentable episode
that heralds the show's decline.
Often this show involves a, ah, let us say,
daring
premise (Josh cloning a thought-to-be-dead Reva, or Reva
time-traveling, on
GL ), and demonstrates final
exhaustion or jettison of the original artistic inspiration.
The term is not applied to the first show or the pilot: there is an underlying
assumption that every show has achieved some sort of level from which it can
decline.
It is fashionable to pretend that each show has only one JTS moment,
but the reality is that if a show declines only as fast as standards generally,
there is nothing to prevent it from gaining a new loyal following during its
post-JTS decline.
These fans will eventually find their own JTS moment, and so
on.
The term was coined in reference to the episode of
Happy Days
in which the Fonz went
water-skiing in
California
and jumped a shark.

Juday
There are a number of toponymic Judays north of South Bend,
Indiana .
Some of these apparently antedate
the puzzling story about
Cary Grant .
Not he nor anybody else seems to have been able to track down
with any certainty the origin of the story of his saying ``Judy, Judy, Judy.''
The repeated name is pronounced in an affected way, with both syllables
stressed, and the second syllable sounding a bit like ``day''; this is
sometimes indicated in
eye dialect
by
writing the name ``Juday.''
Locally, the name comes from meandering Juday Creek, north of the
University of Notre Dame .
It's
not clear how
that
name in turn arose.
An 1863 map labels it Sheffield
Creek, and in the late 1880's it was referred to as ``The State Ditch.''
I kid you not. .
judge names
People whose names include common non-name words, or whose names are odd in
some other way, end up on the bench surprisingly often.
A number of them are
listed in the

fit the bill above.
Robert D. Drain
John Ground

Oscar Hassenteufel
Mr.
Sue K. Hicks , Esq.
Lord Justice Judge
Lord Justice Laws
Robert Sweet
Not mentioned there, because it's hard to state precisely and with certainty
some way in which his name turned out to be unusually appropriate, is John
Minor Wisdom.
He's mentioned in the
black
Republicans
footnotes.
I guess from the text quoted there that Judge
Wisdom was known by his last two names (Minor Justice), as Judge Learned Hand
was.
The following is from the chapter entitled ``Judicial Levity'' in Arthur
Train's nonfiction
My Day In
Court
(New York and London: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1939), p. 61.
Even the names of the defendants and other trial participants
sometimes had a humorous aspect.
I had a case in the Supreme Court Criminal Trial Term before the
present Chief Judge of the
New York Court of Appeals ,
Cuthbert W. Pound, which no doubt he remembers.
The defendant's name was
Schornstein (chimney), that of his counsel, Firestone, my own, Train (also
suggestive of smoke and cinders), while the judge and clerk rejoiced
respectively in those of Pound and Penny.
What a knee-slapper, oh boy!

Juggalo, Juggalette
Members of the rap group
ICP
(that stands for
Insane Clown Posse, but visit the entry anyway) at some point started to refer
to themselves as Juggalos.
(The plural
is
formed without an e.)
Lyrics
in their
Carnival of Carnage
CD
make
reference to the jugula' (vein, to rhyme approximately with strangle-uh, and
mentioned in the context of neck-breaking), and also to juggling
(metaphorically).
There might be some reference to gigolos too, but probably
not to boogaloo dudes ( vide
Day Tripper
entry).
The next album,
The Great Milenko , included a rap entitled ``What is a
Juggalo?'' that doesn't answer the title question in any essential way.
As the
term is used by ICP fans, a Juggalo is an ICP fan.
(Unless he is an ICP member
who isn't a fan.
I don't know if this second category is, or is conceived to
be, nonempty yet.
Positive enthusiasm isn't very cool, you know, if you're a
Juggalo.)
A Juggalette (or
Lette ) is a female ICP
fan, and the term Juggalo is typically used in the complementary sense of a
male ICP fan.
Juggalettes can be enthusiastic about ICP and some other groups
(but not eminem!) and not suffer any coolness deficit.
(Juggalos should say
that they really like ICP, but that they don't consider themselves Juggalos.)
To signal their coolness and belonging, Juggalos and Juggalettes can use
expressions like ``down wit' de clown'' ( DWTC ) and
MCL , and buy ICP
merchandise .
No secret decoder rings yet, though
they could come in handy.
Los and
Lettes
are unexceptional young white
people (``caucasions'') who are often bored and who think of themselves as

this somewhere, but I don't give a %^*##@!!, and that's cool.
F off.
Peace.
There's a large Ukrainian community around southern Ontario, extending into the
Detroit
and Buffalo areas.
I don't know how my
homies in ICP happened to chose the name Milenko (probably for scansion,
dontchathink?), but ICP is Detroit-based.
Milenko sounds like a Ukrainian
surname (a large fraction of Ukrainian surnames end in -ko).
And Mihalenko
(also Mihailenko or Mihajlenko) is a moderately common Ukrainian surname.
But
it turns out that Milenko is mostly a south Slav (Slovenia to Macedonia) man's
given name.
I figured I ought to explain that.

Jumping Frenchmen of Maine Syndrome
This syndrome deserves to be better known, maybe.
It's an exaggerated
startle reflex that was first reported to the medical community by G.M. Beard,
at the 1878 conference of the
American Neurological
Association
[see ``Remarks upon `jumpers or jumping Frenchmen',''
J.
Nerv. Ment. Dis.
vol.
5 , p. 526 (1878)].
The following
description, at least partly a quote of Beard, is in an article at
OMIM
(see
item
244100 ):
In response to sudden sensory input, abnormal reaction occurred.
For example,
if one of them was abruptly asked to strike another, he would do so without
hesitation, even if it was his mother and he had an ax in his hand.
If given a
short, sudden, quick command, the affected person would respond with the
appropriate action, often echoing the words of command. Some, when addressed
quickly in a language foreign to them, would echo the phrase.
Beard found it among French-Canadian lumberjacks in the Moosehead Lake area of
Maine.
Many of the lumbermen had origins in the Beauce region of Quebec, and
the syndrome has been documented there and also reported in five offspring of a
French-Canadian fishing guide in Wedgport, Nova Scotia.
In some cases, there
was a family history of the syndrome.
All this suggests that the condition is
hereditary, but does not exclude a necessary environmental trigger.
A 1986
study (see the OMIM article for reference) concluded that the cases they
studied were related to the specific conditions in lumber camps in the 19th and
early 20th centuries.
They also concluded that `jumping' is not a neurologic
disease but rather can be explained in psychologic terms as operant
conditioning.
Georges Gilles de la Tourette translated Beard's 1880 article on the syndrome,
and this may have stimulated him to study certain patients making peculiar
sounds and movements.
This research led him to describe the disorder that soon
bore his name (see
GTS ).
jumping up and down
When you think about it, there's a lot to ponder in this phrase.
Most
people really just jump up repeatedly and allow
gravity
to complete the cycle.
This seems most efficient.
I'll finish
the entry when I'm ready to make a complete final report.
The only time that anyone can recall George Washington jumping up and/or
down in excitement was when he received word of
French
ship arrivals around Yorktown, which meant that
he had Lord Cornwallis completely surrounded.
Cornwallis's subsequent
surrender marked the end of the military action in the Revolutionary War.
junction isolation
Doping to achieve electronic isolation between devices.
E.g.:
Integrated-circuit BJT's are fabricated as a sequence of successively enclosed
doped regions; an
npn
presents an outer n
(collector) region.
For junction isolation ( JI ),
this is fabricated in an n epi layer on a p substrate, and different
devices are separated by thick p regions that reach down to the substrate.
The substrate and these doped regions constitute a single electrical node which
is connected to the most negative voltage on the chip, so that the electrical
path between any two transistors is collector-to-collector, through a pair of
junctions equivalent to a pair of opposed, reverse-biased diodes.
Cf.
ROx ,
dielectric
isolation ,
LOCOS .
One striking difference
between junction isolation and dielectric isolation is that within the same
technology, JI'd
pnp
transistors have much lower
f T
values than npn transistors,
whereas dielectric isolation tends to give comparable
f T
values.
An early form of JI is (or better ``was'')

I read the following interesting advice in
Some of my best friends are

by Robert Turner ( Los Angeles : Sherbourne Pr., 1970).
It's in the chapter
on getting past initial writer's block -- attacking page 1:
One other warning.
The subconscious is a slippery, sneaky little devil,
too.
At times, it will try to dodge all your attempts to nudge it into
motion by conning you that you are too sick, too hung over, too depressed,
too tired to try to write.
And that if you
do
write, it will be
appallingly bad, not up to your usual standards; so, forget it.
You may
even attempt to do a few pages, then read back over them and decide that
it is true.
What you have just written is sheer tripe, so what's the use
of going on?
Ordinarily, this will just not be true.
Forget it.
Write anyhow.
Unless
you are practically a hospital case or have the shakes so bad that you can't
hit the right typewriter keys, what you write under these conditions will
probably not be any worse than at any other time.
It will just
seem
that way.
If you will just persevere, sometime later, when you reread it,
you will realize the truth.

of Senator Jacob Javits, Congress amended this Act ( 41 U.S.C. 46-48c )
to include people with severe disabilities and allow the Program to also
provide services to the Federal Government.''
(According to 41  U.S.C.  46 nt., it may
be cited as the ``Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act.'')

JYC
Jacques-Yves Cousteau.
His friends actually pronounced this as an acronym.
Transliterated into English, the acronym is something like ``Zheek.''
With various collaborators, he invented relatively lightweight and
self-contained apparatus for breathing underwater
( scuba ).
Almost as important, they invented good
watertight goggles and underwater camera housings, and JYC became world-famous
with films and books about his explorations.
I still remember watching this
stuff on
TV
as a kid.
His ship was called the
Calypso; whether for the Greek legend or the Caribbean music, I don't remember.
He died on June 25, 1997, at the age of 87, and you can find more information
about him in obituaries from then, like
this reverent one
still up at
the
IANTD
website.
A detail about capitalization.
The pronunciation of JYC as an acronym is
mentioned in various French-language articles I can pull up from the 1990's --
mostly obituaries.
For example, the
AFP
announcement commented
en passant , ``JYC, comme tous ses amis
l'appelaient....''
The 26 articles that mentioned the nickname generally wrote
it in all-caps, with the single exception of one article with ``Jyc'' in
Le
Figaro
(out of four).
But here's some really big news: as of 2004,
French-language articles in Lexis-Nexis finally use accented characters!
J-1
Visa type for a `` short-term
scholar '' [clever phrase!].
Also professors and
au pairs
(would
that be
aux
pairs
in
French ?) and a variety of other guests.
Category
includes graduate students, foreign guest lecturers, participants in meetings
(workshops, seminars, conferences,...).
They're permitted to receive direct
compensation as well as payment for travel expenses.
There is
a limit
on
how many hours per week an
au
pair
may be
required to provide child care services, but
professors do
not benefit from this kind of protection .
Cf.
J-2
visa.
