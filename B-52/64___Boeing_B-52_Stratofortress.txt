AFOTEC Det 2The Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center stood up Detachment 2 at Eglin to meet the growing demand to provide realistic operational testing for new and modified weapon systems. Since then, Detachment 2 has partnered with the warfighter and the developmental test community to provide the most thorough and rigorous operational test programs found anywhere in the world. History Eglin Air Force Base was named on 24 Jun 1948 in honor of Lt Col Frederick Irving Eglin (1891-1937). First rated as a military aviator in 1917, he helped train other flyers during
World War I . On 1 Jan 1937, while assigned to General Headquarters, Air Force,
Langley Field , VA, Colonel Eglin was killed in the crash of his
Northrop A-17
pursuit aircraft on a flight from Langley to
Maxwell Field , AL. Previous names of Eglin AFB were: Valparaiso Bombing and Gunnery Base, 14 Jun 1935 Eglin Field, 4 Aug 1937 Eglin Field Military Reservation, 1 Oct 1940 Eglin Field, 28 Dec 1944 Major Commands USAAC/USAAF Air Corps Training Cen, 9 Jun 1935 - 27 Aug 1940 Southeast Air Corps Training Cen, 27 Aug 1940 - 1 Apr 1942 AAF Proving Ground Comd, 1 Apr 1942 - 1 Jun 1945 AAF Center, 1 Jun 1945 - 8 Mar 1946 AAF Proving Ground Comd, 8 Mar 1946 -10 Jul 1946 Air Proving Ground Comd, 10 Jul 1946 - 20 Jan 1948 United States Air Force Air Materiel Comd, 20 Jan 1948 - 1 Jun 1948 Air Proving Ground, 1 Jun 1948 - 20 Dec 1951 Air Proving Ground Comd, 20 Dec 1951 - 1 Dec 1957 Air Research and Development Comd, 1 Dec 1957 - 1 Apr 1961 Air Force Systems Command , 1 Apr 1961 - 1 Jul 1992 Air Force Materiel Command , 1 Jul 1992 - Present Base Operating Units USAAC/USAAF 84th Service Sq (Det), 14 Jun 1935 - 1 Sep 1936 Section V, Eglin Field Section, 13th Air Base Sq, 1 Sep 1936 - 1 Aug 1940 Det 13th Air Base Sq, 1 Aug 1940 - 1 Dec 1940 61st Air Base Gp, 1 Dec 1940 - 19 Jun 1942 51st Base HQ and Air Base Sq, 19 Jun 1942 - 1 Apr 1944 610th AAF Base Unit, 1 Apr 1944 - 30 Jun 1947 609th AAF Base Unit, 1 Jul 1947 - 1 Jul 1948 United States Air Force 3201st Air Base Gp, 1 Jul 1948 - 31 Mar 1951 3201st Air Base Wg, 31 Mar 1951 - 8 Aug 1951 3201st Air Base Gp, 8 Aug 1951 - 1 Jul 1953 3201st Air Base Wg, 1 Jul 1953 - 16 Sep 1964 3201st Air Base Gp, 16 Sep 1964 - 1 Jun 1992 96th Air Base Wing, 1 Jun 1992 - Present Operational History In 1931, personnel of the
Air Corps Tactical School
( Maxwell Field ,
Alabama ) while looking for a bombing and gunnery range, saw the potential of the sparsely populated forested areas surrounding Valparaiso and the vast expanse of the adjacent Gulf of Mexico. Local businessman and airplane buff James E. Plew saw the potential of a military payroll to boost the local areas depression-stricken economy. He leased from the City of Valparaiso the 137 acres (0.6 km2) on which an airport was established in 1933, and in 1934, Plew offered the U.S. government a donation of 1,460 acres (6 km2) contiguous for the bombing and gunnery base. This leasehold became the headquarters for the Valparaiso Bombing and Gunnery Base activated on June 14, 1935, under the command of Captain Arnold H. Rich. With the outbreak of war in
Europe , a proving ground for aircraft armament was established at Eglin. The
U.S. Forestry
ceded to the
War Department
the
Choctawhatchee National Forest . In 1941, the Air Corps Proving Ground (later the Proving Ground Command) was activated, and Eglin became the site for gunnery training for Army Air Forces fighter pilots, as well as a major testing center for aircraft, equipment, and tactics. In March 1942, the base served as one of the sites for Lieutenant Colonel
Jimmy Doolittle
to prepare his
B-25
crews for their
raid against Tokyo . A number of auxiliary fields were constructed on the Eglin reservation at this time, many of which are still in service in various roles, either in support of flight operations or special test activities. After the war, Eglin became a pioneer in developing the techniques for missile launching and handling; and the development of drone or pilotless aircraft. In 1947, a successful drone flight from Eglin to
Washington, D.C.
was conducted. In 1950, the Air Force Armament Center was established at Eglin. After the start of the
Korean War , test teams moved to the combat theater for testing in actual combat. In 1957, the Air Force combined the Air Proving Ground Command and the Air Force Armament Center to form the Air Proving Ground Center. In 1968, the Air Proving Ground Center was redesignated the Armament Development and Test Center to centralize responsibility for research, development, test and evaluation, and initial acquisition of nonnuclear munitions for the Air Force. In 1975, the installation served as one of four main U.S.
Vietnamese
Refugee Processing Centers, where base personnel housed and processed more than 10,000 Southeast Asian refugees. Eglin again became an Air Force refugee resettlement center processing over 10,000
Cubans
who fled to the U.S. between April and May 1980. During a 1992 reorganization, the Air Force disestablished Eglin's parent major command,
Air Force Systems Command
(AFSC) and merged its functions with the former
Air Force Logistics Command
(AFLC). The newly created major command from this merger,
Air Force Material Command
(AFMC), remains Eglin's parent command to this day. In 1998, as part of the Air Forces' strategic plan to guide the service into the 21st century, the Air Force Development Test Center became the Air Force Materiel Command's Air Armament Center (AAC), responsible for development, acquisition, testing, and fielding all air-delivered weapons.

In 1968, the Air Proving Ground Center was redesignated the Armament Development and Test Center to centralize responsibility for research, development, test and evaluation, and initial acquisition of nonnuclear munitions for the Air Force. In 1975, the installation served as one of four main U.S.
Vietnamese
Refugee Processing Centers, where base personnel housed and processed more than 10,000 Southeast Asian refugees. Eglin again became an Air Force refugee resettlement center processing over 10,000
Cubans
who fled to the U.S. between April and May of 1980. During a 1992 reorganization, the Air Force disestablished Eglin's parent major command,
Air Force Systems Command
(AFSC) and merged its functions with the former
Air Force Logistics Command
(AFLC). The newly created major command from this merger,
Air Force Material Command
(AFMC), remains Eglin's parent command to this day. In 1998, as part of the Air Forces' strategic plan to guide the service into the 21st century, the Air Force Development Test Center became the Air Force Materiel Command's Air Armament Center (AAC), responsible for development, acquisition, testing, and fielding all air-delivered weapons.

Eglin AFB military resort - 02/15/2008
EGLIN AFB  Construction of a military resort on Okaloosa Island might move a step closer later this month. Eglin Air Force Base will host an industry forum Feb. 21 at the Emerald Coast Conference Center, not far from the 17.1-acre beachfront plot where it would like to see Emerald Breeze built. A welcome reception for interested contractors will be from 6 to 8 p.m. Feb. 20 at the Air Force Armament Museum. The project on the Air Force-owned parcel will be an enhanced-use lease contract. The Air Force is looking for a developer to build and manage the resort. Eglin spokesman Mike Spaits said the upcoming forum is not a bidding venue. Rather, its an opportunity for local officials, bankers, developers and real estate managers, among others, to get more information about the resort. Competition for project award is based on a Request for Qualifications process, Spaits said in an e-mail. The completion date is yet to be determined. Environmental and biological assessments must be made on the valuable parcel. Each study generally takes about six months to complete, but when they will begin hasnt been determined yet. The Air Force sees the resort as a way to reward troops and other Department of Defense workers and dependents for their service and sacrifices while also drawing tourism dollars to the Emerald Coast. WANT TO ATTEND? For more information or to register for the Emerald Breeze resort industry forum Feb. 21, go to jllpress.com.

To Do list Before coming to Eglin AFB - 08/18/2007
There are a number of things you should do to help make the transition easier: - Give the post office a forwarding address - Change addresses with billing agencies - Send changes of address to magazine publishers - Notify friends and relatives of your new address - Obtain credit references from your bank, etc. - Stop newspaper and all home delivery services - Settle bills with local utility companies (gas, water, electric, telephone, etc..). Don't forget to get deposit refunds and a written statement stating your last bill was paid in full - Transfer insurance on cars, home etc... and check to see if personal high -value possessions are covered during the move - Ask for a copy of or transfer children's records - Get records from any private doctors or dentists that you and your family have been using- Notify your clergyman and obtain any necessary documents of birth, baptism, etc. that you may need- Double-check closets and shelves to be sure that they are empty - Buy traveler's checks instead of carrying large sums of cash- Be sure to take any jewelry and valuable documents with you. Don't pack them in your household goods - Make plans for transporting your pets. Unhappy or nervous pets can make very poor traveling companions. Here are some tips for ensuring your pet's travel on an airline goes unrestricted: - Veterinarian-issued health certificates are required- International flights require further documentation. Quarantine requirments may apply - Pets must travel in an airline-approved carrier large enough for the animal to move unrestricted- Food and water must be provided - When accompanied by the owner, the pet is ususally checked in as excess baggage. If small enough, the pet may be allowed to ride in its carrier under the passenger seat - When unaccompanied, the pet usually passes through airline freight handling systems. The cargo hold is pressurized with climate control to ensure the safety of your pet. Some airlines allow the owner to check on their pet through their 800 number tracking system * NOTE:Check with your airline to ensure you have made all necessary arrangements for your pets' travel!! - Let a close friend or relative know the route and schedule you will be traveling, including overnight stops. Use that person as a message center.

EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. -- Maintaining the infrastructure of an Air Force base that's nearly the size of the state of Rhode Island and the largest in the free world is a tough and challenging job, but it is one that the 96th Civil Engineer Group is fully focused on doing in the most innovative, resourceful and efficient ways possible. From repairing roads to fighting forest fires, the group is one of the most diverse on base with everything from firefighters to archaeologists on staff to do the job. Similar to many units throughout the Department of Defense, though, the 96th CEG must find ways to overcome budget and personnel cuts to continue its contributions to the Global War on Terror. "Funding has been lean and from the people standpoint, we're heavily supporting the Air Expeditionary Force mission requirements," Col. Dennis Yates, 96th CEG commander, said. That doesn't discourage Colonel Yates and the 96th CEG at all. Instead, he says it keeps them focused and true to the group's vision of being innovative, resourceful and effective in all they do in light of these challenges. The group is comprised of the 796th Civil Engineer Squadron, the 96 Civil Engineer Squadron and the Environmental Management, Resources and Family Housing Divisions. Lt. Col. Dave Eaton, 796th Civil Engineer Squadron commander, heads a squadron of more than 600 military and civilians who are responsible for maintenance and repair of base property. They've got everything from pest management personnel to heating, ventilation and air conditioning specialists. He agrees that limited funding and ops tempo are some of the biggest challenges his squadron faces. "The people are great and do great things for us, always stepping up to the plate to meet the challenges head on." he said. "They take limited funding and manpower and do their magic to produce a great product. For example, when one of our shop superintendents deployed last month, an airman quickly stepped into his shoes and has been leading the shop ever since. There is no doubt in my mind that we'll see more examples like this as the deployment wears on." The Environmental Management Division is led by Mike Applegate. The division is responsible for ensuring the base is a good steward of the environment and manages the reservation for 19 federally listed threatened and endangered species, as well as maintaining the world's largest longleaf pine forest. Beyond the natural resources, Environmental Management is also responsible for ensuring the base stays compliant with the myriad of federal and state laws that regulate the base's air emissions, water quality programs, restoration efforts and protection of cultural resources among other things. "We're environmental managers, not environmentalists," Mr. Applegate said. "We manage the environment for the mission, and we don't let it manage us. Our job is to make sure the base is compliant with the law as we execute the mission." The Family Housing Division, ran by Kathy Lawhon, provides program management for housing referral services and effective use of on-base housing, including the single unaccompanied Airmen's dormitories. They are also responsible for providing input to the housing budget and the accompanying furnishings management program. Through privatization, the quality of military family housing for both Eglin and Hurlburt Field military families stands to improve substantially. "Our military families will enjoy contemporary homes similar to those found in the local communities," Paul Ledford, housing office manager, said. "They will have homes that are better built and equipped to endure the intense heat associated with coastal living." The Air Force hopes to attract the right developer for the job when it releases its updated Request for Proposal in September. The 96th Civil Engineer Squadron, known as the "first-response arm of CE," boasts the largest fire department in DOD and the largest explosive ordnance disposal in the Air Force. "If you think first response across the base or the community, fire, police and medical, we are one leg of that Eglin triad," Maj. Don Treanor, 96th CES commander, said. The 96th CES also includes the Readiness Flight. Its mission includes conducting emergency management for peacetime emergencies and natural disasters on Eglin as well as providing chemical warfare defense training for all Eglin military personnel, Major Treanor said. They also have the Prime BEEF functions which prepares CE forces for their wartime responsibilities. So while there may be less people and financial resources to do their job these days, Col. Yates believes that if the group stays true to its vision, they'll be fine.
"It's a great group of people with a lot of pride to do the job right under any circumstances," Colonel Yates said. "Our pride and ingenuity makes us a formidable weapon system."

Eglin Airmen train Iraqis on fuel delivery - 08/18/2007
by Tech Sgt. Russell Wicke 447th Air Expeditionary Group Public Affairs 6/20/2007 - SATHER AIR BASE, BAGHDAD, IRAQ -- Airmen from the 447th Expeditionary Logistics Readiness Squadron Fuels Flight are training Iraqis here to fuel up their own C-130s without dependence on the U.S. Air Force. Heading up the training is Master Sgt. Scott Addington, 447th ELRS Petroleum, Oils and Lubricant fuels manager, who said the plan is broken own into a "crawl, walk, run" process. The first day of training was June 17 and involved familiarization with one of the Iraqis two fuel trucks. "These guys are in the infancy stage of fueling," said Sergeant Addington. "We developed a six-phase process designed to ease them into this work. " The entire Iraqi fuels shop here, consisting of three people, is now learning the fundamentals in Phase One: moving fuel. Sergeant Addington said advanced training will involve tracking and recording fuel, and eventually performing lab work. The Iraqi airmen at New Al-Muthana will be responsible for refueling their three C-130s, their helicopters and their aerospace ground equipment, according to Tech. Sgt. Chad Wilkey, 447th ELRS fuels operations supervisor. At present, all of these are being fueled by U.S. Airmen working for Sergeant Addington. In addition to the Iraqis' aircraft and equipment, the 13 Airmen of 447th ELRS Fuels shop have their hands full with other commitments. Approximately 300 transit aircraft funnel through Sather every week - all requiring fuel. Furthermore, the Army's 3rd Infantry Division Combat Aviation Brigade has approximately 115 helicopters which fly daily missions from Baghdad International Airport. They all depend on fuel from the 447th ELRS. And just to add the icing, Sather also maintains multiple generators which supply electricity to the base; they all depending on POL for clean, dry fuel. "We provide the life-blood of the American war fighter," said Sergeant Wilkey. "Nobody goes anywhere without gas." And Sather's access to gas all passes through the conduit of these 13 Airmen. But Sergeant Wilkey was quick to point out his team does a lot more than deliver fuel. This is where Tech. Sgt. Terrance Ladd, 447th ELRS fuels lab technician comes in. Sergeant Ladd runs the fuels lab here. It's his job to ensure the fuel is of high quality. He said he spends his days sampling fuel from their fuel trucks and the 50,000-gallon fuel bladders, and testing them for a number of contaminants. "I test the fuel for solids, (like dirt) and trace amounts of water," said Sergeant Ladd. "If my tests indicate the fuel is too dirty, or has too much water, we have to take action to correct the problem." Sergeant Ladd also said the JP-8 fuel he works with requires several additives to enhance engine performance. He runs lab work on the JP-8 to ensure it has the right amount of icing inhibitor and static dissipater. Without these additives, the fuel may develop crystallized ice, or build up static electricity. Sergeant Ladd also tests the fuel for proper flash point. In addition to lab testing come the rigors of inventory and paperwork. According to Sergeant Addington, all fuel has to be received by convoy, tracked and recorded. When people depend on a product that comes by convoy in Baghdad, Iraq, problems surface fast. Baghdad features a characteristic that makes fuel supply very unpredictable: hostility. "We have a small surplus of fuel because re-supply trucks are unpredictable," said Sergeant Wilkey. "For this reason, we limit all aircraft to 40,000 pounds of fuel, unless they arrange for more in advance." Sergeant Addington agreed that his crew of 13 stands up under a heavy yoke: providing clean, dry fuel to the entire base and the coalition in addition to the training of Iraqis - all in a hostile environment. But he said it would take more than this and the occasional rocket attack to break the resolve of the Airmen in POL. "We like the term 'resilient' defined by Webster's as, 'tending to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change,'" wrote Sergeant Addington in an e-mail responding to a concerned peer after a rocket attack in their area. "What doesn't kill you will only make you stronger."

Occupational Health Council Eglin Air Force Base - 08/18/2007
Commentary by Col. Joseph A. LanniVice Commander, Air Armament Center & Chairman, Eglin Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health Council - EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla.
-- In less than three weeks, every Eglin unit and organization will be subject to an evaluation of its compliance with environmental laws and guidelines when Air Force Materiel Command environmental officials visit to conduct an Environmental, (and Occupational Health) Compliance Assessment and Management Program (EOHCAMP) evaluation July 9-13. Eglin is prepared. Thirteen protocols, which include hazardous waste management and water quality management, will be thoroughly assessed by a team who knows those processes and programs and how they should work, inside and out. Eglin is ready. Why so confident, you ask? Because I know Team Eglin has made all the necessary preparation for this external EOHCAMP. I know the difference between glancing at a regulation and making environmental safety and health part of our lifestyle...and I know that the lifestyle is stressed at all levels of our workforce. I know that commanders and their Unit Environmental Coordinators, all 98 of them, have been ensuring the finer details of their unit's environmental programs are in order, and are hitting the streets, stressing ownership of the program by everyone. I know they'll continue these efforts right up until showtime when the AFMC team arrives at their unit's doorstep in early July. That's the kind of effort it will take to ensure success during this evaluation. I believe that all of Team Eglin understands that the future of this great nation rests in our hands right now and our job #1 is to carry out our mission and protect our country. That requires us to integrate all of our efforts toward conserving our resources...that's natural, infrastructure and human resources that supports and conduct our mission. The EOHCAMP results will give us a clear picture of how well we are doing that now, as well as areas to improve in moving forward. As we prepare for the upcoming evaluation, let's continue to improve Eglin's Environmental Management System to a benchmark that others will mimic. Our next challenge in that process will begin 9 July. Team Eglin, continue to do what it takes to be ready for this and future challenges...our workforce, our mission and our nation depend on it.

Exchange Select quality and price registering with military families - 08/18/2007
EGLIN AFB, Fla. -- Military shoppers in search of the best value for their dollar are increasingly reaching for "private label" products manufactured under the Exchange Services' "Exchange Select" brand. The steady demand for affordably priced, quality products by the military community continues to drive expansion of the Exchange Select brand, available exclusively at Navy, Marine and Coast Guard Exchanges, Veterans Canteen Service locations and Army & Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) BXs and PXs. We introduced 67 new 'Exchange Select' items in 2006 including value pack diapers and baby wipes, whitening pre-brush oral rinse and smoking cessation gum," said the Eglin AFB BX's General Manager Myra Moore. "The entire portfolio now includes 557 unique items, all priced to deliver substantial savings." Whether shopping for health and beauty care items, household cleaning and laundry products or even a single-use camera, Exchange Select products offer quality that is equal to or better than equivalent national brands at an average savings of 50 percent. "Our Quality Assurance team actively ensures the quality of 'Exchange Select' merchandise by visiting suppliers' plants to verify 'Good Manufacturing Practices,' as set by the Food and Drug Administration as well as other governing agencies, are used," said Moore. "In fact, all over-the-counter medicines, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, meet FDA established guidelines, which are the same for 'Exchange Select' and national brand equivalent products." Name brand quality combined with "private label" pricing continues to attract military shoppers as "Exchange Select" sales have increased 30 percent since the brand was first introduced in the summer of 2002. As a result, the Exchange Services continue to broaden their "private label" assortment through line extensions in existing categories and expansion into new programs. "Exchange Select" stock assortment additions currently in development include oatmeal based baby toiletries, women's premium triple-blade disposable razors, sugar-free cough drops, plastic applicator tampons and "custom-size-it" paper towels.

Back to School Safety - 08/18/2007
Air Armament Center Safety Office EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. -- As summer vacation concludes here on the Emerald Coast, students across several counties are readying themselves for the start of a new school year. With all of the excitement this time brings, safety is not the first topic that may be discussed between students and parents. The Air Armament Safety Office encourages parents to speak with their children about safety before school begins. Here is why and some topics to help you along. Getting to school and back home again ˇ Find an easy, safe way to walk to school or the bus stop. Ask your parents if there is anything you should watch out for along way. Crosswalks, stop lights, crossing guard, speed zones. ˇ Always walk with a brother, sister, neighbor, or friend - sounds just like a Wingman. ˇ Don't talk to strangers, go anywhere with them, or take anything from them. ˇ Know your phone number and address, even your area code and zip code. If you have trouble remembering them, write them down and keep them in a safe place like a backpack or notebook. Walking and biking to schoolEven if you don't ride to school in a car or a school bus, students must still protect themselves. In walking to and from school without a parent, many young pedestrians face many safety decisions, situations and dangers. Here are a few basic safety tips to follow: ˇ Mind all traffic signals and/or the crossing guard -- never cross the street against a light, even if you don't see any traffic coming. ˇ Walk your bike through intersections. ˇ Walk with a buddy. ˇ Wear reflective material if possible...it makes you more visible to street traffic. ˇ Never walk alone--always travel with a buddy. ˇ Pay attention to all traffic signals and crossing guards along the way. Never cross the street against a stop light. ˇ Always wear a helmet when riding a bicycle. ˇ Avoid ill-fitting clothing that could get caught in spokes or pedals or restrict movements, and wear reflective colors and material to be more visible to street traffic. ˇ Walk your bicycle across all intersections. Riding in a car You might have heard before that most traffic crashes occur within a 25-mile radius of home ... that's true, they do. ˇ Safety belts are the best form of protection passengers have in the event of a crash. They can lower your risk of injury by 45%. ˇ You are four times more likely to be seriously injured or killed if ejected from the vehicle in a crash. ˇ Everyone needs to be buckled up properly. That means older kids in seat belts, younger kids in booster seats and little kids in child safety seats. Riding the bus According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 24 million students nationwide start their school day with a trip on the school bus. Although NHTSA reports that riding on a school bus is nearly eight times safer than riding in a passenger vehicle, an average of 11 school-aged pedestrians are killed by school transportation vehicles each year. In 2006, 26 students were killed and another 9,000 were injured in incidents involving school buses. More often than not, these deaths and injuries didn't occur in a crash, but as the pupils were entering and exiting the bus.
Remember these safety tips: ˇ Have a safe place to wait for your bus, away from traffic and the street. ˇ Stay away from the bus until it comes to a complete stop and the driver signals you to enter. ˇ When being dropped off, exit the bus and walk ten giant steps away from the bus. Keep a safe distance between you and the bus. Also, remember that the bus driver can see you best when you are back away from the bus. ˇ Use the handrail to enter and exit the bus. ˇ Stay away from the bus until the driver gives a signal that it's okay to approach. ˇ Be aware of the street traffic around you. Drivers are required to follow certain rules of the road concerning school buses, however, not all do. Protect yourself and watch out! After school If you stay home alone for a few hours after school while your parents are at work, call and check in with them as soon as you get home. Ask your parents what the rules are. Are you allowed to watch TV before you finish your homework? But these two are simple rules parents should provide their children who are home alone: ˇ Keep doors shut: Instead of telling kids not to let a stranger in, the real rule needs to be: Keep the door shut and locked at all times. Don't fill your child's head with "don'ts"; simply tell them to keep all doors closed. If someone comes to the door, your child can communicate with this person through the door. ˇ Set check-in time: Another thing parents should ask their child to do is call and let Mom or Dad know that she is home safe. Set a consistent time for the child to call each day. Give her 10 minutes plus or minus to allow for a slow bus, etc ... then start to worry if she doesn't meet this deadline. Also, find a close neighbor who is usually home around this time. If the parent can't be reached, the child knows to call this person. Parents, please remember that kids home alone are much more likely to encounter dangers such as fire from burning popcorn or falling down the stairs than being abducted by a stranger. Parents need to consider some of these issues facing their families and deal with them accordingly. Have a safe and productive school year.

Eglin AFB History - 08/18/2007
Spanning five wars, modern-day Eglin evolved from a distant and honorable past. Currently the Air Armament Center tests and evaluates non-nuclear munitions, electronic combat systems and navigation/guidance systems. For more than sixty-five years and spanning six wars, Eglin has played a prominent role in airpower history. In 1931, personnel of the Army Air Corps Tactical School (Maxwell Field, Alabama) looking for a site for a bombing and gunnery range, saw the potential of the sparsely populated forested areas surrounding Valparaiso, Florida, and the vast expanse of the adjacent Gulf of Mexico. A local businessman and airplane buff, James E. Plew, saw the potential of a military payroll to boost the depression-stricken economy in the local area. He leased to the City of Valparaiso 137 acres on which an airport was established in 1933, and in 1934, Plew offered the U.S. government a donation of 1,460 contiguous acres for the bombing and gunnery base. This leasehold became the headquarters for the Valparaiso Bombing and Gunnery Base activated on 14 June 1935 under the command of Captain Arnold H. Rich. On 4 August 1937, the base was redesignated Eglin Field in honor of Lieutenant Colonel Frederick I. Eglin, U.S. Air Corps, killed on 1 January 1937 in an aircraft crash. With the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939 and President Roosevelt's call for an expansion of the Army Air Corps, General Henry H. "Hap" Arnold ordered the establishment of a proving ground for aircraft armament. Eglin was selected for the testing mission, and on 27 June 1940, the U.S. Forestry Service ceded to the War Department the Choctawhatchee National Forest, consisting of some 384,000 acres. In 1941, the Air Corps Proving Ground was activated, and Eglin became the site for gunnery training for Army Air Forces fighter pilots, as well as a major testing center for aircraft, equipment, and tactics. In March 1942, the base served as one of the sites for Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle to prepare his B-25 crews for their raid against Tokyo. In addition to testing all new aircraft and their serial modifications, the Proving Ground Command, established at Eglin April 1942, found the isolation and immensity of the ranges especially well-suited for special tasks. For example, in 1944, personnel developed the tactics and techniques to destroy German missile installations being built to support V-1 buzz-bomb attacks on England. By the end of the war, Eglin had made a recognizable contribution to the effectiveness of the American air operations in Europe and the Pacific and continued to maintain a role in the research, development, and testing of air armament. Eglin also became a pioneer in missile development when, in early 1946, the First Experimental Guided Missiles Group was activated to develop the techniques for missile launching and handling; establish training programs; and monitor the development of a drone or pilotless aircraft capability to support the Atomic Energy Commission tests, Operation CROSSROADS, at Eniwetok. On 13 January 1947, the Guided Missiles Group received nationwide publicity by conducting a successful drone flight from Eglin to Washington, D.C., in a simulated bombing mission. Both as a reaction to the Soviet atomic explosion in 1949 and in recognition that research and development had lagged in the years of lower priority to operational concerns, the Air Force, in early 1950, established the Air Research and Development Command (later Air Force Systems Command). The following year, the Air Research and Development Command established the Air Force Armament Center at Eglin, which, for the first time, brought development and testing together. After the start of the Korean War in 1950, test teams moved to the combat theater for testing in actual combat. They numbered among their accomplishments improved air-to-air tactics and improved techniques for close air support. On 1 December 1957, the Air Force combined the Air Proving Ground Command and the Air Force Armament Center to form the Air Proving Ground Center. The Center built the highly-instrumented Eglin Gulf Test Range and for the next few years, served as a major missile test center for weapons such as the BOMARC, Matador, GAM-72 "Quail," and GAM-77 "Hound Dog." As the Southeast Asia conflict increased emphasis on conventional weapons, the responsibilities at Eglin grew. On 1 August 1968, the Air Proving Ground Center was redesignated the Armament Development and Test Center to centralize responsibility for research, development, test and evaluation, and initial acquisition of nonnuclear munitions for the Air Force. On 1 October 1979, the Center was given division status. The Armament Division, redesignated Munitions Systems Division on 15 March 1989, placed into production the precision-guided munitions for the laser, television, and infrared guided bombs; two anti-armor weapon systems; and an improved hard target weapon used in Operation DESERT STORM during the Persian Gulf War. The Division was also responsible for developing the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), an Air Force-led joint project with the U.S. Navy. In addition to its development and testing mission, Eglin also served as the training site for the Son Tay Raiders in 1970, the group that made the daring attempt to rescue American POWs from a North Vietnamese prison camp. In 1975, the installation served as one of four main U.S. Vietnamese Refugee Processing Centers, where base personnel housed and processed more than 10,000 Southeast Asian refugees at the Auxiliary Field Two "Tent City." Eglin again became an Air Force refugee resettlement center processing over 10,000 Cubans who fled to the U.S. between April and May of 1980. On 11 July 1990, the Munitions Systems Division was redesignated the Air Force Development Test Center. During the 1990s, the Center supported test and evaluation for the development of nonnuclear Air Force armament including next generation precision-guided weapons; operational training for armament systems; and test and evaluation of command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) aerospace navigation and guidance systems. On 1 October 1998, as part of the Air Forces' strategic plan to guide the service into the 21st Century, the Air Force Development Test Center became the Air Force Materiel Command's Air Armament Center (AAC). As one of AFMC?s product centers, AAC is responsible for development, acquisition, testing, and fielding all air-delivered weapons. AAC applies advanced technology, engineering, and programming efficiencies across the entire product life cycle to provide superior combat capability. The Center plans, directs, and conducts test and evaluation of U.S. and allied air armament, navigation/guidance systems, and command and control (C2) systems and supports the largest single base mobility commitment in the Air Force. AAC accomplishes its mission through three components: the Air Force Program Executive Office for Weapons with two systems wings and a systems group, the 46th Test Wing, and the 96th Air Base Wing. Recently the AAC provided our warfighters with the munitions and expeditionary combat support to dominate the enemy in Operations ALLIED FORCE, ENDURING FREEDOM, and IRAQI FREEDOM.
