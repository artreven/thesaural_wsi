AFOTEC Det 2The Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center stood up Detachment 2 at Eglin to meet the growing demand to provide realistic operational testing for new and modified weapon systems. Since then, Detachment 2 has partnered with the warfighter and the developmental test community to provide the most thorough and rigorous operational test programs found anywhere in the world. History Eglin Air Force Base was named on 24 Jun 1948 in honor of Lt Col Frederick Irving Eglin (1891-1937). First rated as a military aviator in 1917, he helped train other flyers during
World War I . On 1 Jan 1937, while assigned to General Headquarters, Air Force,
Langley Field , VA, Colonel Eglin was killed in the crash of his
Northrop A-17
pursuit aircraft on a flight from Langley to
Maxwell Field , AL. Previous names of Eglin AFB were: Valparaiso Bombing and Gunnery Base, 14 Jun 1935 Eglin Field, 4 Aug 1937 Eglin Field Military Reservation, 1 Oct 1940 Eglin Field, 28 Dec 1944 Major Commands USAAC/USAAF Air Corps Training Cen, 9 Jun 1935 - 27 Aug 1940 Southeast Air Corps Training Cen, 27 Aug 1940 - 1 Apr 1942 AAF Proving Ground Comd, 1 Apr 1942 - 1 Jun 1945 AAF Center, 1 Jun 1945 - 8 Mar 1946 AAF Proving Ground Comd, 8 Mar 1946 -10 Jul 1946 Air Proving Ground Comd, 10 Jul 1946 - 20 Jan 1948 United States Air Force Air Materiel Comd, 20 Jan 1948 - 1 Jun 1948 Air Proving Ground, 1 Jun 1948 - 20 Dec 1951 Air Proving Ground Comd, 20 Dec 1951 - 1 Dec 1957 Air Research and Development Comd, 1 Dec 1957 - 1 Apr 1961 Air Force Systems Command , 1 Apr 1961 - 1 Jul 1992 Air Force Materiel Command , 1 Jul 1992 - Present Base Operating Units USAAC/USAAF 84th Service Sq (Det), 14 Jun 1935 - 1 Sep 1936 Section V, Eglin Field Section, 13th Air Base Sq, 1 Sep 1936 - 1 Aug 1940 Det 13th Air Base Sq, 1 Aug 1940 - 1 Dec 1940 61st Air Base Gp, 1 Dec 1940 - 19 Jun 1942 51st Base HQ and Air Base Sq, 19 Jun 1942 - 1 Apr 1944 610th AAF Base Unit, 1 Apr 1944 - 30 Jun 1947 609th AAF Base Unit, 1 Jul 1947 - 1 Jul 1948 United States Air Force 3201st Air Base Gp, 1 Jul 1948 - 31 Mar 1951 3201st Air Base Wg, 31 Mar 1951 - 8 Aug 1951 3201st Air Base Gp, 8 Aug 1951 - 1 Jul 1953 3201st Air Base Wg, 1 Jul 1953 - 16 Sep 1964 3201st Air Base Gp, 16 Sep 1964 - 1 Jun 1992 96th Air Base Wing, 1 Jun 1992 - Present Operational History In 1931, personnel of the
Air Corps Tactical School
( Maxwell Field ,
Alabama ) while looking for a bombing and gunnery range, saw the potential of the sparsely populated forested areas surrounding Valparaiso and the vast expanse of the adjacent Gulf of Mexico. Local businessman and airplane buff James E. Plew saw the potential of a military payroll to boost the local area’s depression-stricken economy. He leased from the City of Valparaiso the 137 acres (0.6 km2) on which an airport was established in 1933, and in 1934, Plew offered the U.S. government a donation of 1,460 acres (6 km2) contiguous for the bombing and gunnery base. This leasehold became the headquarters for the Valparaiso Bombing and Gunnery Base activated on June 14, 1935, under the command of Captain Arnold H. Rich. With the outbreak of war in
Europe , a proving ground for aircraft armament was established at Eglin. The
U.S. Forestry
ceded to the
War Department
the
Choctawhatchee National Forest . In 1941, the Air Corps Proving Ground (later the Proving Ground Command) was activated, and Eglin became the site for gunnery training for Army Air Forces fighter pilots, as well as a major testing center for aircraft, equipment, and tactics. In March 1942, the base served as one of the sites for Lieutenant Colonel
Jimmy Doolittle
to prepare his
B-25
crews for their
raid against Tokyo . A number of auxiliary fields were constructed on the Eglin reservation at this time, many of which are still in service in various roles, either in support of flight operations or special test activities. After the war, Eglin became a pioneer in developing the techniques for missile launching and handling; and the development of drone or pilotless aircraft. In 1947, a successful drone flight from Eglin to
Washington, D.C.
was conducted. In 1950, the Air Force Armament Center was established at Eglin. After the start of the
Korean War , test teams moved to the combat theater for testing in actual combat. In 1957, the Air Force combined the Air Proving Ground Command and the Air Force Armament Center to form the Air Proving Ground Center. In 1968, the Air Proving Ground Center was redesignated the Armament Development and Test Center to centralize responsibility for research, development, test and evaluation, and initial acquisition of nonnuclear munitions for the Air Force. In 1975, the installation served as one of four main U.S.
Vietnamese
Refugee Processing Centers, where base personnel housed and processed more than 10,000 Southeast Asian refugees. Eglin again became an Air Force refugee resettlement center processing over 10,000
Cubans
who fled to the U.S. between April and May 1980. During a 1992 reorganization, the Air Force disestablished Eglin's parent major command,
Air Force Systems Command
(AFSC) and merged its functions with the former
Air Force Logistics Command
(AFLC). The newly created major command from this merger,
Air Force Material Command
(AFMC), remains Eglin's parent command to this day. In 1998, as part of the Air Forces' strategic plan to guide the service into the 21st century, the Air Force Development Test Center became the Air Force Materiel Command's Air Armament Center (AAC), responsible for development, acquisition, testing, and fielding all air-delivered weapons.

Army Air Corps Tactical School (Maxwell Field, Ala.)
while looking for a bombing and gunnery range, saw the potential of the sparsely populated forested areas surrounding Valparaiso and the vast expanse of the adjacent Gulf of Mexico. Local businessman and airplane buff James E. Plew saw the potential of a military payroll to boost the local area’s depression-stricken economy. He leased from the City of Valparaiso the 137 acres (0.6 km²) on which an airport was established in 1933, and in 1934, Plew offered the U.S. government a donation of 1,460 acres (6 km²) contiguous for the bombing and gunnery base. This leasehold became the headquarters for the Valparaiso Bombing and Gunnery Base activated on June 14, 1935, under the command of Captain Arnold H. Rich. With the outbreak of war in
Europe , a proving ground for aircraft armament was established at Eglin. The
U.S. Forestry
ceded to the
War Department
the
Choctawhatchee National Forest . In 1941, the Air Corps Proving Ground was activated, and Eglin became the site for gunnery training for Army Air Forces fighter pilots, as well as a major testing center for aircraft, equipment, and tactics. In March 1942, the base served as one of the sites for Lieutenant Colonel
Jimmy Doolittle
to prepare his
B-25
crews for their
raid against Tokyo . A number of auxiliary fields were constructed on the Eglin reservation at this time, many of which are still in service in various roles, either in support of flight operations or special test activities. After the war, Eglin became a pioneer in developing the techniques for missile launching and handling; and the development of drone or pilotless aircraft. In 1947, a successful drone flight from Eglin to
Washington, D.C.
was conducted. In 1950, the Air Force Armament Center was established at Eglin. After the start of the
Korean War , test teams moved to the combat theater for testing in actual combat. In 1957, the Air Force combined the Air Proving Ground Command and the Air Force Armament Center to form the Air Proving Ground Center. In 1968, the Air Proving Ground Center was redesignated the Armament Development and Test Center to centralize responsibility for research, development, test and evaluation, and initial acquisition of nonnuclear munitions for the Air Force. In 1975, the installation served as one of four main U.S.
Vietnamese
Refugee Processing Centers, where base personnel housed and processed more than 10,000 Southeast Asian refugees. Eglin again became an Air Force refugee resettlement center processing over 10,000
Cubans
who fled to the U.S. between April and May of 1980. During a 1992 reorganization, the Air Force disestablished Eglin's parent major command,
Air Force Systems Command
(AFSC) and merged its functions with the former
Air Force Logistics Command
(AFLC). The newly created major command from this merger,
Air Force Material Command
(AFMC), remains Eglin's parent command to this day. In 1998, as part of the Air Forces' strategic plan to guide the service into the 21st century, the Air Force Development Test Center became the Air Force Materiel Command's Air Armament Center (AAC), responsible for development, acquisition, testing, and fielding all air-delivered weapons.

Eglin AFB military resort
EGLIN AFB — Construction of a military resort on Okaloosa Island might move a step closer later this month. Eglin Air Force Base will host an industry forum Feb. 21 at the Emerald Coast Conference Center, not far from the 17.1-acre beachfront plot where it would like to see Emerald Breeze built. A welcome reception for interested contractors will be from 6 to 8 p.m. Feb. 20 at the Air Force Armament Museum. The project on the Air Force-owned parcel will be an enhanced-use lease contract. The Air Force is looking for a developer to build and manage the resort. Eglin spokesman Mike Spaits said the upcoming forum is not a bidding venue. Rather, it’s an opportunity for local officials, bankers, developers and real estate managers, among others, to get more information about the resort. “Competition for project award is based on a Request for Qualifications process,” Spaits said in an e-mail. The “completion date is yet to be determined.” Environmental and biological assessments must be made on the valuable parcel. Each study generally takes about six months to complete, but when they will begin hasn’t been determined yet. The Air Force sees the resort as a way to reward troops and other Department of Defense workers and dependents for their service and sacrifices while also drawing tourism dollars to the Emerald Coast. WANT TO ATTEND? For more information or to register for the Emerald Breeze resort industry forum Feb. 21, go to jllpress.com.
