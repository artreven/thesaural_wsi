V-22 Osprey
The V-22 Osprey is a multi-mission, military
tiltrotor
aircraft
with both a vertical takeoff and landing ( VTOL ) and short takeoff and landing ( STOL ) capability. It is designed to perform missions like a conventional
helicopter
with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a
turboprop
aircraft. The V-22 was developed by
Bell Helicopter , which manufactures it in partnership with
Boeing Rotorcraft Systems . The initial operators are the
United States Marine Corps
and
Air Force . The
FAA
classifies the Osprey as a model of
powered lift
aircraft.

C-130 Hercules
The Lockheed C-130 Hercules is a four-engine
turboprop
military transport aircraft
built by
Lockheed . It is the main
tactical airlifter
for many military forces worldwide. Over 40 models and variants of the Hercules serve with more than 50 nations. In December 2006 the C-130 became the fifth aircraft—after the
English Electric Canberra ,
B-52 Stratofortress ,
Tupolev Tu-95 , and
KC-135 Stratotanker —to mark 50 years of continuous use with its original primary customer, in this case the
United States Air Force . The C-130 is also the only military aircraft to remain in continuous production for 50 years with its original customer, as the updated
C-130J Super Hercules . Capable of takeoffs and landings from unprepared
runways , the C-130 was originally designed as a troop,
medical evacuation , and cargo transport aircraft. The versatile airframe has found uses in a variety of other roles, including as a
gunship , for
airborne assault ,
search and rescue , scientific research support, weather reconnaissance,
aerial refueling
and
aerial firefighting . The Hercules family has the longest continuous production run of any military aircraft in history. During more than 50 years of service the family has participated in countless military, civilian and
humanitarian aid
operations.

Recent developments
In July 2006, C-17 production was planned to end in 2009 unless Boeing received additional orders in time to allow the production "pipeline" to remain in operation. At the time a large follow-on order would allow Boeing to begin C-17B production in 2010. The proposed C-17B would be capable of landing on sandy beaches and other areas off-limits to the C-17A. [15] On 18 August 2006 Boeing announced it was telling suppliers to stop work on parts for uncommitted C-17s. This move is the first step in shutting down production if no new plane orders were received from the US Government. [16]
However, just one month later on 21 September, a House and Senate conference committee approved a US$447 billion defense bill for 2007, that includes US$2.1 billion for 10 additional C-17s. The additional purchase follows intense lobbying by Boeing, as well as by
California
state leaders (where the plane is manufactured), and
Missouri
leaders, where Boeing's defense business is based. [17]
However, this extends the life of the program for only one additional year, to 2010. On 2 March 2007, Boeing announced the C-17 production line may end in mid-2009 due to the lack of additional US government and international orders. [18] A total of 190 C-17s are contracted for delivery to the USAF as of October 2007. Boeing has purchased parts for 30 new C-17s at its own expense in hopes that Congress will approve the funds requested. [19]
Fifteen C-17s are earmarked in a FY2008 War Supplemental [20]
that passed the House on 10 June 2008 and the Senate on 27 June 2008. President Bush signed the measure into law in 30 June 2008. [21]
These funds will extend production from August 2009 to August 2010, once a contract is awarded. On 6 February 2009, Boeing was awarded a contract for 15 additional C-17s with for US$2.95 billion, thus pushing total C-17s on contract to the USAF to 205. [22]

Operational history
The first C-5A was delivered to the USAF on 17 December 1969. Wings were built up in the early 1970s at
Altus AFB, OK ;
Charleston AFB ,
Dover AFB, DE ; and
Travis AFB, CA . July 9, 1970 marked the C-5's first mission in Southeast Asia during the
Vietnam War . Through the rest of the war, C-5s were used to transport equipment and troops. Equipment included Army tanks, and various aircraft. [11]
C-5s also delivered weapons and supplies to
Israel
as part of
Operation Nickel Grass
in 1973. [12] During the 1980s the C-5As were re-winged to restore full design capability. [5]
The US Air Force took delivery of the first C-5B on 28 December 1985 and the final one in April 1989. [13] The C-5 is the largest aircraft to ever operate in the Antarctic.
Williams Field
near
McMurdo Station
is capable of handling C-5 aircraft and the first C-5 landed there in 1989. [14] Fourteen C-5As have been retired as of 2005. Aircraft number 69-0004 was the first, sent to the
Warner Robins Air Logistics Center
(WR-ALC) for tear down and inspection. Data from inspection will be used to evaluate structural integrity and estimate remaining fleet lifespan. Thirteen C-5As were sent to the Air Force's
Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group
(AMARG) for inspection. At AMARG, 66-8306 underwent tear down and inspection similar to 69-0004 at WR-ALC. The remaining 12 will eventually be reclaimed as destructive inspection is performed on the airframes to test for corrosion and fatigue. [15] Sources have cited that the Air Force might be looking to replace some of these aircraft and requested information on the
Airbus A380
freighter for possible use as a military transport. [16] The 436th AW received their first C-5M in February 2009.

Into production
The first C-5A Galaxy (number 66-8303) was rolled out of the manufacturing plant in
Marietta, Georgia
on March 2, 1968. On June 30, 1968
Lockheed-Georgia Co.
began flight testing its new Galaxy C-5A heavy transport with the aircraft's first flight taking to the air under the call-sign "eight-three-oh-three heavy" (8303H). Upon completion of testing the first C-5A was transferred to the Transitional Training Unit at
Altus Air Force Base , OK, in December 1969. Lockheed then delivered the first operational Galaxy to the
437th Airlift Wing ,
Charleston Air Force Base, SC , in June 1970. In the early 1970s, the C-5 was considered for the role of
Shuttle Carrier Aircraft
to transport the
Space Shuttle
to
Kennedy Space Center
by
NASA , but rejected in favor of the
Boeing 747
due in part to the 747's low-wing design. In contrast, the
Soviet Union
chose to transport its shuttles using the high-winged
An-225 , which is derived from the
An-124 , which is very similar to the C-5 in terms of design and function. During static and fatigue testing, cracks in the wings occurred before completion of testing. All C-5A aircraft were restricted to 80% of maximum design loads. To reduce wing loading, load alleviation systems were added to the aircraft. [4]
By 1980, payloads were restricted to as low as 50,000 lb (23,000 kg) for general cargo during peacetime operations. To restore full payload capability and service life, a program to rewing the 76 C-5As began in 1976. After design and testing of the new wing design, the C-5As received their new wings from 1980 to 1987. [5] The first C-5B was delivered to Altus Air Force Base in January 1986. In April 1989, the last of 50 C-5B aircraft was added to the 77 C-5As in the Air Force's airlift force structure. The C-5B includes all C-5A improvements and numerous additional system modifications to improve reliability and maintainability. [6] In 1998, the Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) began upgrading the C-5's avionics to include a glass cockpit, navigation equipment, and a new autopilot system. [7]
Another part of the C-5 modernization effort is the Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP). The program will mainly replace the engines with newer, more powerful ones. Three C-5s are to undergo RERP as a test with full production planned to begin in May 2008. [8]

Physical Education
Cadets are required to take physical education courses in each of their four years at the Academy. The classes cover a wide range of activities:
Swimming
and water survival build confidence while teaching important survival skills. Combative sports such as
boxing ,
wrestling ,
judo
and unarmed combat build confidence, teach controlled aggression and develop physical fitness. Cadets also take classes in team sports such as
basketball
and
soccer , in "lifetime" sports such as
tennis
and
golf
and on the physiology of exercise.

The Cadet Wing
The organization of the Academy has characteristics of both a military unit and a civilian college. Like a civilian college, the students, called "cadets", are divided into four classes, based on their year in school. They are not referred to as
freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors , however, but as
fourth-, third-, second- and first class cadets , respectively. Fourth class cadets (freshmen) are sometimes referred to as "doolies," a term derived from the Greek word δουλος ("doulos") meaning "slave" or "servant." [28]
Members of the three lower classes are also referred to as "4 degrees," "3 degrees" or "2 degrees" based on their class. [29]
First-class cadets are referred to as "firsties." In the military structure of the Cadet Wing, first class cadets (seniors) act as the cadet officers, second class cadets (juniors) act as the cadet non-commissioned officers and third class cadets (sophomores) as cadet junior non-commissioned officers. The Cadet Wing is divided into four cadet
groups , of ten cadet
squadrons
each. Each cadet squadron consists of about 110 cadets, roughly evenly distributed among the four classes. Selected first-, second- and third-class cadets hold leadership, operational and support jobs at the squadron, group and wing levels. Cadets live, march and eat meals with members of their squadron, and take part in many activities, notably military training and intramural athletics, by squadron as well. Each cadet squadron and cadet group is supervised by a specially selected active duty officer called an
Air Officer Commanding
(AOC). In the case of a cadet squadron, the AOC is normally an active duty Air Force
major . For a cadet group, the AOC is normally an active-duty
lieutenant colonel . These officers have command authority over the cadets, counsel cadets on leadership and military career issues, oversee military training and serve as role models for the future officers.

Other locations on campus
Other locations on campus serve support roles for cadet training and other base functions. Doolittle Hall is the headquarters of the Academy's Association of Graduates and also serves as the initial reception point for new cadets arriving for Basic Cadet Training. It is named after
General Jimmy Doolittle . The Goldwater Visitor Center, named after longtime proponent of the Academy
United States Senator
Barry Goldwater , is the focal point for family, friends and tourists visiting the Academy grounds. The Academy
Airfield
is used for training cadets in airmanship courses, including parachute training, soaring and powered flight. Interment at the
Academy Cemetery
is limited to Academy cadets and graduates, certain senior officers, certain Academy staff members, and certain other family members. Air power notables
Carl Spaatz ,
Curtis E. LeMay
and
Robin Olds , are interred here. The
United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School
(usually referred to as the "Prep School") is a program offered to selected individuals who were not able to obtain appointments directly to the Academy. The program involves intense academic preparation (particularly in English, math and science), along with athletic and military training, meant to prepare the students for appointment to the Academy. A high percentage of
USAFA Preparatory School
students (known as "Preppies") earn appointments to the Academy following their year at the Prep School.

Commemorative Displays
Many displays around the Cadet Area commemorate heroes and air power pioneers, and serve as an inspiration to cadets. The War Memorial, a black marble wall located just under the flagpole on the Terrazzo, is etched with the names of Academy graduates who have been killed in combat. The Honor Wall, overlooking the
Terrazzo , is inscribed with the
Cadet Honor Code : "We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does." Just under the Cadet Chapel, the Class Wall bears the
crests
of each of the Academy's graduating classes. The crest of the current first (senior) class is displayed in the center position. Another display often used as a symbol of the Academy, the Eagle and Fledglings Statue was given as a gift to the Academy in 1958 by the personnel of
Air Training Command . It contains the inscription by Austin Dusty Miller, "Man's flight through life is sustained by the power of his knowledge." Static air- and spacecraft displays on the Academy grounds include an
F-4 ,
F-15 ,
F-16
and
F-105
on the
Terrazzo ; a
B-52
by the North Gate; a
T-38
and
A-10
at the airfield; an
F-100
by the preparatory school; a
SV-5J lifting body
next to the aeronautics laboratory; and a
Minuteman III
missile in front of the Fieldhouse. The Minuteman III was removed in August 2008 due to rusting and other internal damage. The Core Values Ramp (formerly known as the "Bring Me Men Ramp") leads down from the main Terrazzo level toward the parade field. On in-processing day, new cadets arrive at the base of the ramp and start their transition into military and Academy life by ascending the ramp to the
Terrazzo . From 1964 to 2004, the portal at the base of the ramp was inscribed with the words "Bring me men..." taken from the poem, "The Coming American," by
Samuel Walter Foss . In a controversial move following the 2003
sexual assault scandal , the words "Bring me men..." were taken down and replaced with the Academy's (later adopted as the Air Force's) core values: "Integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do."

The Cadet Area
Main article:
United States Air Force Academy, Cadet Area The buildings in the Cadet Area were designed in a distinct, modernist style, and make extensive use of
aluminum
on building exteriors, suggesting the outer skin of aircraft or spacecraft. [20]
On April 1, 2004, fifty years after Congress authorized the building of the Academy, the Cadet Area at the Academy was designated a
National Historic Landmark . [21]
[22] The main buildings in the Cadet Area are set around a large, square pavilion known as The Terrazzo. The most recognizable building in the Cadet Area is the 17-spired [23]
Cadet Chapel . The subject of controversy when it was first built, it is now considered among the most beautiful examples of modern American academic architecture. Other buildings on the Terrazzo include the two dormitories, Vandenberg Hall and Sijan Hall, Mitchell Hall, the cadet dining facility, and Fairchild Hall the main academic building, which houses academic classrooms, laboratories, research facilities, faculty offices and the
Robert F. McDermott
Library. The Aeronautics Research Center (also known as the "Aero Lab") and contains numerous aeronautical research facilities, including transonic, subsonic, low speed and cascade
wind tunnels , engine and rocket test cells and simulators. [24]
The Consolidated Education and Training Facility (CETF) was built in 1997 as an annex to Fairchild Hall. It contains chemistry and biology classrooms and labs, medical and dental clinics and civil engineering and astronautics laboratories. The Cadet Area also contains an observatory and a planetarium for academic use. The cadet social center is Arnold Hall which houses a 3000-seat theater, a ballroom and a number of lounge and recreation facilities for cadets and visitors. Harmon Hall is the primary administration building, which houses the offices of the
Superintendent
and the Superintendent's staff. The Cadet Area also contains extensive facilities for use by cadets participating in intercollegiate athletics, intramural athletics, physical education classes and other physical training. Set amid numerous outdoor athletic fields, the Cadet Gymnasium, the Cadet Fieldhouse (with
Clune Arena , the
ice hockey rink
and an indoor track).
Falcon Stadium , located outside of the Cadet Area, is the
football
field and site of the graduation ceremonies. [25]

The early years
The early Air Force Academy leadership faced monumental tasks, including the development of an appropriate curriculum, establishment of a faculty, design of a distinctive cadet uniform, oversight of the construction of the permanent site, and the creation of a structure for military and flight training. To establish the foundations of the Academy program, officials ultimately drew from sources within the Air Force, from West Point and Annapolis, and occasionally from outside the military entirely. The Academy's permanent site had not yet been completed when the first class entered, so the 306
cadets
from the Class of 1959 were sworn in at a temporary site at
Lowry Air Force Base , in
Denver
on July 11, 1955. While at Lowry, they were housed in renovated World War II barracks. There were no upper class cadets to train the new cadets, so the Air Force appointed a
cadre
of " Air Training Officers " (ATOs) to conduct training. The ATOs were junior officers, many of whom had been graduates of West Point or Annapolis. They acted as surrogate upper class cadets until the upper classes could be populated over the next several years. [9]
The Academy's dedication ceremony took place on that first day and was broadcast live on national television, with
Walter Cronkite
covering the event. [9] In developing a distinctive uniform for cadets, Secretary of the Air Force Harold Talbott was looking for "imagination" in the design. Talbott initially used military tailors, but was unhappy with their products. [11]
As a result, the first classes of cadets wore temporary uniforms while the official uniform was developed. Secretary Talbott then sought out legendary
Hollywood
director
Cecil B. DeMille
for help. DeMille's designs — most notably his design of the cadet parade uniform — won praise from Air Force and Academy leadership, were ultimately adopted, and are still worn by cadets today. The Class of 1959 established many other important traditions that continue until the present. Most notably, the first class adopted the
Cadet Honor Code , and chose the
falcon
as the
Academy's mascot . In 1957, the Air Force cadets marched in the
Inaugural Parade
of President
Dwight Eisenhower
in
Washington, D.C. . On August 29, 1958, the
wing
of 1,145 cadets moved to the present site near Colorado Springs, and less than a year later the Academy received
accreditation . The first USAFA class graduated and was commissioned on June 3, 1959.

These aircraft are modified to observe (through visual or other means) and report tactical information concerning composition and disposition of forces. OC-135B Open Skies The reconnaissance aircraft of the USAF are used for monitoring enemy activity, originally carrying no armament. Several unmanned remotely-controlled reconnaissance aircraft (UAVs) have been developed and deployed. Recently, the UAVs have been seen to offer the possibility of cheaper, more capable fighting machines that can be used without risk to aircrews. Note: Although the U-2 is designated as a 'utility' aircraft, it is indeed a reconnaissance platform. RC-26B RC-135S/U/V/W RQ-4A Global Hawk RQ-11 Raven U-2R/S "Dragon Lady"

Multi-mission UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)
Initial generations of UAVs were primarily surveillance aircraft, but some were fitted with weaponry (such as the MQ-1 Predator, which utilized AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles). An armed UAV is known as an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). The near future will likely see unmanned aircraft employed, offensively, for bombing and ground attack. While air-to-air combat will likely remain the last domain of the human pilot, when unmanned fighter jets do come about, they will enjoy the advantage of almost unlimited immunity to G-force effects.

Tanker
The USAF's aerial refueling aircraft are derivatives of civilian jets. Usually, the aircraft providing the fuel is specially designed for the task, although refueling pods can be fitted to existing aircraft designs if the "probe and drogue" system is to be used. There is no known regular civilian in-flight refueling activity. In large-scale operations (and even daily air operations), air-to-air refueling is extensively used; fighters, bombers, and cargo aircraft rely heavily on the lesser-known "tanker" aircraft. This makes these aircraft an essential part of the Air Force's global mobility and the U.S. force projection. KC-10A Extender KC-135E/R/T Stratotanker

Fighters
The fighter aircraft of the USAF are small, fast, and maneuverable military aircraft primarily used for air-to-air combat. Many of these fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities, and some are dual-roled as fighter-bombers (e.g., the
F-16 Fighting Falcon ); the term "fighter" is also sometimes used colloquially for dedicated ground-attack aircraft. Other missions include interception of bombers and other fighters, reconnaissance, and patrol. Out of the 5,778 manned aircraft in service, 2,402 are fighters, and 1,245 of those are variants of the F-16 Fighting Falcon.

Electronic Warfare
The purpose of electronic warfare is to deny the opponent an advantage in the EMS and ensure friendly, unimpeded access to the EM spectrum portion of the information environment. Electronic warfare aircraft are used to keep airspaces friendly, and send critical information to anyone who needs it. They are often called "The Eye in the Sky."

Cargo
The Air Force can provide rapid global mobility, which lies at the heart of U.S. strategy in this environment--without the capability to project forces, there is no conventional deterrent. As U.S. forces stationed overseas continue to decline, global interests remain, making the unique mobility capabilities of the USAF even more in demand. Air mobility is a national asset of growing importance for responding to emergencies and protecting American interests around the globe. Cargo and transport aircraft are typically used to deliver troops, weapons and other military equipment by a variety of methods to any area of military operations around the world, usually outside of the commercial flight routes in uncontrolled airspace. The workhorses of the USAF
Air Mobility Command
are the
C-130 Hercules ,
C-17 Globemaster III , and
C-5 Galaxy . These aircraft are largely defined in terms of their range capability as strategic airlift (C-5), strategic/tactical (C-17), and tactical (C-130) airlift to reflect the needs of the land forces which they most often support. The CV-22 is used by the Air Force for the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). It conducts long-range, special operations missions, and is equipped with extra fuel tanks and terrain-following radar.

[edit] Bombers
In the US Air Force, the distinction between bombers, fighter-bombers, and attack aircraft has become blurred. Many attack aircraft, even ones that look like fighters, are optimized to drop bombs, with very little ability to engage in aerial combat. Many fighter aircraft, such as the F-16, are often used as 'bomb trucks,' despite being designed for aerial combat. Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range: a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling, which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations. The US is the only country, besides Russia, that operate strategic bombers. The majority of the USAF's dedicated bombers are rapidly aging. The
B-52 Stratofortress
airframe is over 50 years old, and are scheduled to remain in service for another 30 years, which would keep the airframe in service for over 90 years, an unprecedented length of service for any aircraft. Plans for successors to the current strategic bomber force remain only paper projects, and political and funding pressures suggest that they are likely to remain paper-bound for the foreseeable future.

Attack Aircraft
The ground-attack aircraft of the USAF are designed to attack targets on the ground and are often deployed as close air support for, and in proximity to, U.S. ground forces. The proximity to friendly forces require precision strikes from these aircraft that are not possible with bomber aircraft listed above. They are typically deployed as close air support to ground forces, their role is tactical rather than strategic, operating at the front of the battle rather than against targets deeper in the enemy's rear.

Air Force Fitness Test
Main article:
United States Air Force Fitness Test The US Air Force Fitness Test (AFFT) is designed to test the body composition, muscular strength/endurance and cardiovascular respiratory fitness of airmen in the United States Air Force. As part of the Fit to Fight program, the Air Force adopted a more stringent physical fitness assessment; the new fitness program was established on January 1, 2004, and replaces the annual ergo-cycle test that the Air Force had used for several years. In the AFFT, Airmen are given a score based on performance consisting of four components: waist circumference, the crunch, the push-up, and a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) run. Airmen can potentially earn a score of 100; a passing score is anything over 75 points.

Enlisted airmen
Main article:
United States Air Force enlisted rank insignia Enlisted members of the Air Force have pay grades from E-1 to E-9, with E-9 being the highest. While all Air Force military personnel are referred to as Airmen, it can specifically refer to the
pay grades
of E-1 through E-4 which are below the level of
non-commissioned officers
(NCOs). Above the pay grade of E-4 (E-5 through E-9) all ranks fall into the category of NCO and are further subdivided into NCOs (E-5 & E-6) and Senior NCOs (E-7 through E-9); the term Junior NCO is sometimes used to refer to staff sergeants and technical sergeants (E-5 & E-6). The Air Force is the only one of the five branches of the United States military where NCO status is only achieved at the grade of E-5. In all other branches NCO status can be achieved at the grade of E-4 (a
Corporal
in the
Army
and
Marine Corps ,
Petty Officer Third Class
in the
Navy
and
Coast Guard ). However, E-4s in the Army with the rank of
Specialist
are not NCOs. The Air Force mirrored the Army from 1976 to 1991 with an E-4 being either a Senior Airman wearing three stripes without a star or a Sergeant (referred to as "Buck Sergeant") which was noted by the presence of the central star and considered an NCO. Despite not being an NCO, a Senior Airman who has completed
Airman Leadership School
can be a supervisor.

Recent history
In 2007, the USAF implemented a large Reduction-in-Force (RIF). Because of budget constraints, the USAF planned to reduce the service's size from 360,000 active duty personnel, to 316,000. [11]
The size of the active-duty force in 2007 is roughly 64% of that of the USAF at the end of the
Gulf War
in 1991. [12]
However, the reduction was ended at approximately 330,000 personnel in 2008 to meet mission requirements. [11] On June 5, 2008,
Secretary of Defense
Robert M. Gates , accepted the resignations of both the
Secretary of the Air Force ,
Michael W. Wynne , and the
Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force , Gen.
T. Michael Moseley . Gates in effect fired both men for "systemic issues associated with declining Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance". This followed an investigation into two embarrassing incidents involving
nuclear weapons , and were also the culmination of disputes between the Air Force leadership and Gates. [13]
To put more emphasis on nuclear assets, the USAF established the nuclear-focused
Global Strike Command
on October 24, 2008. [14]

History
Main article:
History of the United States Air Force The Army created the first antecedent of the Air Force in 1907, which through a succession of changes of organization, titles, and missions advanced toward eventual separation 40 years later.The United States Air Force became a separate military service on September 18, 1947, with the implementation of the
National Security Act of 1947 . [9]
The Act created the
United States Department of Defense , which was composed of three branches, the Army, Navy and a newly-created Air Force. [10]
Prior to 1947, the responsibility for military aviation was divided between the Army (for land-based operations) and the Navy, for sea-based operations from
aircraft carrier
and
amphibious
aircraft.
