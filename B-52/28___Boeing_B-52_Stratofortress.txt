Bombardier Global Express
The Bombardier Global Express is an ultra long range corporate and
VIP
high speed
jet aircraft
produced by
Bombardier Aerospace . The Bombardier Global 5000 is a slightly shorter version. The Global Express has also been modified for military missions, such as the
Raytheon Sentinel
R1. Bombardier Aerospace began studies in 1991 and the aircraft was officially launched in
1993 . The first flight occurred on October 13, 1996. The Global Express can fly intercontinental ranges without refueling (e.g.
New York
-
Tokyo ) or between most two points in the world with only one stop. In this class the Global Express competes with the
Airbus Corporate Jet ,
Boeing Business Jet ,
Dassault Falcon 7X
and
Gulfstream G550 . Bombardier subsidiaries have three specific roles in the project:
Canadair
is the design leader and manufactures the nose;
Short Brothers ,
Belfast
is responsible for the design and manufacture of the engine
nacelles ,
horizontal stabiliser
and forward
fuselage ; and
de Havilland Canada
builds the rear fuselage and
vertical tail
and carries out final assembly. The major external supplier is
Japan 's
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
which builds the wing and centre fuselage sections. The Global Express is powered by two
Rolls-Royce BR710
turbofans . Global Express XRS The Global Express XRS is an improved version of the original aircraft, offering higher cruise speed, increased range, improved cabin layout and lighting. It is reported that the letters have no significance, but were chosen by
focus groups
simply to improve the brand image. The range increase is achieved by addition of a 1,486 lb (674 kg) fuel tank at the wing root. The Global Express XRS entered service in early 2006. The unit price is estimated to be $45.5 million (US). Bombardier claims it takes 15 minutes less to fuel the XRS than the original model thanks to improved computer systems and mechanical refinements. The Global 5000 is built on the same production line as the Global Express XRS, and the two types' serial numbers are intermingled. Global 5000 The aircraft is manufactured by Bombardier Aerospace in
Toronto, Canada , and flown "green" to
Montreal ,
St. Louis
or
Savannah
for final completion. The Global 5000 can fly close to 5,000 nautical miles (9,300 km) nonstop at Mach .80. The average trip lengths for most operators is 2.5 hours where the aircraft will cruise between Mach .85 and Mach .89, making it one of the fastest long range jets available today. Typical configuration features 18 passenger seats including fully berthable seats and an aft lounge/bedroom. The aircraft has a full galley and two lavatories. The crew rest area was removed, but is being considered on newer versions). Originally, the maximum takeoff weight was 89,700 lb (40,700 kg). With typical equipment and passenger accoutrements, the empty weight was 52,000 - 55,000 pounds (22600 – 25000 kg). In April 2008, Bombardier announced that the certified gross weight had been increased to 92,500 lb (41954 kg), which permitted an increased fuel load - projected maximum range increased to 5,200 nm (9637 km). The maximum certified altitude is 51,000 ft (16,000 m) The typical approach speed is 108 knots (200 km/h) requiring approximately 2,600 feet (790 m) of runway for landing.

B-1 Lancer
The
Rockwell
(now part of
Boeing ) B-1 Lancer is a
strategic bomber
used by the
United States Air Force . First envisioned in the 1960s as a
supersonic bomber with sufficient range and payload to replace the
B-52 Stratofortress , it developed primarily into a low-level penetrator with long range and supersonic speed capability. Its development was stopped and restarted multiple times over its history, as the theory of strategic balance changed from
flexible response to
mutually assured destruction
and back again. It eventually entered service more than 20 years after first being studied. The B-1B production version has been in service with the United States Air Force (USAF) since 1986. The Lancer serves as the supersonic component of the USAF's long-range bomber force, along with the subsonic B-52 and
B-2 Spirit . The bomber is commonly called the "Bone" (originally from "B-One"). With the retirement of the
EF-111 Raven
in 1998 and the
F-14 Tomcat
in 2006, the B-1B is the U.S. military's only active
variable-sweep wing
aircraft. The first post-B-70 study was known as the
Subsonic Low Altitude Bomber
(SLAB), which was completed in 1961. This was followed by the similar
Extended Range Strike Aircraft
(ERSA), which added a
variable-sweep wing
planform , something then very much in vogue in the aviation industry. ERSA envisioned a relatively small aircraft with a 10,000 lb (4,500 kg) load and a range of 8,750 nautical miles (16,200 km), with 2,500 nmi (4,600 km) being flown at low altitudes. In August 1963 the similar
Low-Altitude Manned Penetrator
(LAMP) design was completed, which called for an aircraft with a 20,000 lb (9,000 kg) load and somewhat shorter range of 7,150 nautical miles (13,200 km). These all culminated in the October 1963
Advanced Manned Precision Strike System
(AMPSS), which led to industry studies at
Boeing ,
General Dynamics , and
North American . In mid-1964, the USAF had revised its requirements and retitled the project as
Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft
(AMSA), which differed from AMPSS primarily in that it also demanded a high-speed high-altitude capability, albeit slower than the Valkyrie at about Mach 2. Given the lengthy series of design studies, Rockwell engineers joked that the new name actually stood for "America's Most Studied Aircraft". The B-1 has a
blended wing body
configuration, with
variable-sweep wing , triangular fin control surfaces and four
turbofan engines , to improve range and speed with enhanced survivability . Forward-swept wing settings are used for
takeoff ,
landings
and high-altitude maximum
cruise . Aft-swept wing settings are used in high subsonic and supersonic flight. The wings of the B-1B originally were cleared for use at settings of 15, 25, 55 and 67.5 degrees. The 45-degree setting was later cleared in 1998–99 timeframe. The length of the aircraft presented a serious flexing problem due to air turbulence at low altitude. To alleviate this, Rockwell included small canards near the nose on the B-1. An accelerometer would actuate the canards automatically to counteract turbulence and smooth out the ride. Unlike the B-1A, the B-1B made no attempt at Mach 2+ speeds. Its maximum speed at altitude is Mach 1.25 (about 950 mph or 1,530 km/h),
but its low-level speed increased to Mach 0.92 (700 mph, 1,130 km/h). Technically, the current version of the aircraft can exceed its speed restriction, but not without risking potential damage to its structure and air intakes. To help lower its radar cross section (RCS), the B-1B uses fixed air intake ramps with serpentine baffles, which limit its speed compared to the B-1A. The B-1's defensive electronics include the
Eaton
AN/ALQ-161 radar warning and defensive
jamming
equipment, linked to a total of eight AN/ALE-49
flare
dispensers located on top behind the canopy, which are handled by the AN/ASQ-184 avionics management system. The AN/ALE-49 dispenser has a capacity of 12 MJU-23A/B flares each. The MJU-23A/B flare is one of the world's largest infrared countermeasure flares having a gross weight of ~1170 g. The cylindrical
Magnesium/Teflon/Viton
pellet has a net weight of ~1470 g. The Plans for a defensive systems upgrade program (DSUP) were canceled for budgetary reasons. The B-1 has also been equipped to carry the
ALE-50 Towed Decoy System . The Lancer has an additional
Doppler
tail-warning radar to detect aircraft or missiles approaching from the rear. Also aiding the B-1's survivability is its relatively low
radar cross-section
(RCS). Although not technically a
stealth aircraft
in a comprehensive sense, thanks to the aircraft's structure, serpentine intake paths and use of radar-absorbent material its RCS is about 1/50th that of the
B-52
(probably about 26 ft² or 2.4 m²), although the Lancer is not substantially smaller in mass than the Stratofortress.

A-6 Intruder
The Grumman A-6 Intruder was a twin jet-engine, mid-wing
attack aircraft
built in the
United States
by
Grumman Aerospace . In service between 1963 and 1997, the Intruder was designed as an all-weather replacement for the
piston-engined
A-1 Skyraider
medium attack aircraft. A specialized
electronic warfare derivative, the
EA-6B Prowler , remains in service as of 2009. As the A-6 was slated for retirement, its precision strike mission was taken over by the now retired
F-14 Tomcat
equipped with
LANTIRN
pod. The Intruder was developed in response to a
United States Navy
specification for an all-weather
carrier-based
attack aircraft
to serve as a replacement for the
piston-powered ,
World War II–era
A-1 Skyraider . Grumman
was awarded the contract in 1957, and the resulting A2F-1 made its first flight on 19 April 1960. The jet nozzles were originally designed to swivel downwards, but this was dropped from production aircraft. The pilot sits in the left seat, while the bombardier/ navigator sits to the right and below. A unique CRT gives a synthetic display of terrain ahead which, with the additional crew member, enabled low-level flying in all weather conditions. The wing is very efficient at subsonic speeds compared to supersonic fighters such as the
F-4 Phantom II , which are also limited to subsonic speeds when carrying a payload of bombs. A very similar wing would be put on pivots on Grumman's later supersonic
swing-wing
F-14 Tomcat , as well as similar landing gear. The Intruder was also equipped with the " Deceleron ", a type of airbrake on the wings with two panels that open in opposite directions; in this case, one panel goes up, while another goes down.

B-52 Stratofortress
The
Boeing
B-52 Stratofortress is a long-range,
subsonic ,
jet-powered
strategic bomber
operated by the
United States Air Force
(USAF) since 1955. Beginning with the successful contract bid on 5 June 1946, the B-52 design evolved from a straight-wing aircraft powered by six
turboprop
engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight
turbojet
engines. The aircraft first flew on 15 April 1952 with
"Tex" Johnston
as pilot. Built to carry nuclear weapons for
Cold War -era
deterrence
missions, the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the
Convair B-36 . Although a veteran of a number of wars, the Stratofortress has dropped only conventional munitions in combat. The B-52 carries up to 70,000 pounds (32,000 kg) of weapons. The USAF has possessed B-52s in active service since 1955. The bombers flew under the
Strategic Air Command
until SAC was disestablished in 1992 and its aircraft absorbed into the
Air Combat Command
(ACC), until February 2010 becoming part of
Air Force Global Strike Command
(AFGSC). Superior performance at high subsonic speeds and relatively low operating costs have kept the B-52 in service despite the advent of later aircraft, including the Mach-3 XB-70 Valkyrie , the supersonic
B-1B Lancer , and the
B-2 Spirit . In January 2005, the B-52 became the second aircraft, after the
English Electric Canberra , to mark 50 years of continuous service with its original primary operator. (As of 2009, the list has added the
Tupolev Tu-95 , the
C-130 Hercules , the
KC-135 Stratotanker , and the
Lockheed U-2 .) On 23 November 1945,
Air Materiel Command
(AMC) issued desired performance characteristics for a new strategic bomber "capable of carrying out the strategic mission without dependence upon advanced and intermediate bases controlled by other countries". The aircraft was to have a crew of five plus turret gunners, and a six-man relief crew. It was required to cruise at 300
mph
(240
kn , 480 km/h) at 34,000 feet (10,400 m) with a combat radius of 5,000 miles (4,300
nmi , 8,000 km). The armament was to consist of an unspecified number of 20 mm cannon and 10,000
pounds
(4,500 kg) of bombs. On 13 February 1946, the Air Force issued bid invitations for these specifications, with Boeing,
Consolidated Aircraft , and
Glenn L. Martin Company
submitting proposals. Only three of the 13 B-52As ordered were built. All were returned to Boeing, and used in their test program. On 9 June 1952 the February 1951 contract was updated to order the aircraft under new specifications. The final 10, the first aircraft to enter active service, were completed as B-52Bs. Even while the Air Force works on new bombers scheduled for
2037
it intends to keep the B-52H in service until at least 2040, nearly 80 years after production ended. This will be an unprecedented length of service for a military aircraft. B-52s are periodically refurbished at the USAF maintenance depots such as
Tinker Air Force Base , Oklahoma . The USAF continues to rely on the B-52 because it remains an effective and economical heavy bomber, particularly in the type of missions that have been conducted since the end of the Cold War against nations that have limited air defense capabilities. The B-52's capacity to " loiter " for extended periods over (or even well outside) the battlefield, while delivering
precision
standoff and
direct fire
munitions, has been a valuable asset in conflicts such as
Operation Iraqi Freedom . The speed of the
B-1 Lancer
and the stealth of the
B-2 Spirit
have only been useful until enemy air defenses were destroyed, a task that has been swiftly achieved in recent conflicts. The B-52 boasts the highest mission capable rate of the three types of heavy bombers operated by the USAF. Whereas the B-1 averages a 53% ready rate, and the B-2 achieved a 26%, the B-52 averages 80% as of 2001. Additionally, a proposed variant of the B-52H was the EB-52. This version would have modified and augmented 16 B-52H airframes with additional electronic jamming capabilities. This new aircraft would have given the USAF an airborne jamming capability that it has lacked since retiring the
EF-111 Raven . The program was cancelled in 2005 following removal of funding for the stand-off jammer. The program was revived in 2007 but funding was again canceled in early 2009. Specifications (B-52H) General characteristics Crew: 5 ( pilot ,
