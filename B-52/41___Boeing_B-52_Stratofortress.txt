The last B-52 pilot and Who Really Won the Cold War?
December 18th, 2011
The name
Holden Withington  probably doesn’t mean much to you.  He just passed away at the age of 94.  He was the last of the six aeronautical designers that occupied a suite in Dayton, Ohio for an entire weekend in October of 1948 to design a new large, long range bomber for the jet age. Armed with slide rules, a phone line to the engineering staff in Seattle, a stenographer and modeling materials from a hobby shop, they emerged with a 33 page proposal for an aircraft, along with a 14 inch scale model of what was to become the
B-52 .
Mr Withington was recruited by Boeing out of MIT in 1941, mainly to build Boeing’s first high speed wind tunnel.  He built one capable of 625 mph speeds and was instrumental in developing the swept wings of the B-47 bomber, along with fellow engineers Gerorge Schairer and Vic Ganzer.
The pod mounted engines under the swept wings were features used on the later Boeing 707, and have been the template for commercial airliners ever since.
This April will bring the 60th anniversary of the first test flight of the B52 prototype by legendary test pilot
“Tex” Johnston , (famous for doing a impromptu barrel roll demonstrating a 707).
The thing that blows my mind is that there are still
over 70 B-52’s
out there in operational status.   The
last
one of the 742 that were built was manufactured back in 1962.  And the Air force plans on B-52’s still flying around in 2040 and beyond.  It HAS been upgraded several times, including the addition of the
IBM
AP-101,
an 80’s era avionics processor also used in the space shuttle, having similar capabilities to the one in your  smart phone.
Officially called the Stratofortress, the bombers are affectionately called BUF’s (Big Ugly Fuckers) by the men who crew them,  most of whom are younger than the planes they fly in.
The B-52’s original mission was as a long range nuclear bomber.  Beginning in 1958, the Strategic Air Command employed an interesting tactic that lasted for the next 10 years: at least some B-52’s (armed with nukes) were in the air at all times, the idea being that,in the event of a sneak attack by the commies, we’d still have the ability to retaliate.   That ghastly fact was a major factor during the Cuban Missile Crises as the
Armed
Airborne Alert
flights were intensified during this period.   This duty was brutal on the crews as they had to endure up to 26 hour flights in cramped and noisy conditions.  It should be noted that the SAC did approve of the limited use of amphetamines in 1960.  Although the airborne alert flights ended in 1968, the majority of the B-52 force did not stand down from nuclear alert until 1991.
From 1965 to 1973 B-52’s flew over 125,000 sorties in Vietnam Laos and Cambodia, with  the majority of those mission being
carpet bombing
in South Vietnam.  They usually flew in six plane formations with the result being near total devastation of a half-mile by mile-and-a-half area that would be hit with 80 tons of bombs.
The B-52’s were major factors in Desert Storm, dropping 27,000 tons of bombs on Iraq.   They’ve since been on active duty in both Iraq and Afghanistan and played a major role in the Shock and Awe campaign.  The planes have modernized weapons systems now, replacing bombs with the GPS guided GBU-31/32
Joint Direct Attack Munition  .
The B-52 has to be one of the most versatile and adaptable devices of the last 200 years or so.   Few mechanical items of any type have remained in service as long as the B-52, much less something of the enormous size and complexity of the B-52.   About the closest rival they’d have would be the air-cooled VW Beetle.     The fact that the most powerful and modern military the world has ever seen plans on using airplanes that will have been in service for nearly 80 years is mind-boggling in itself.  If you couple that with the fact that it was designed  by guys wielding slide rules and originally had vacuum tube electronics, the whole enterprise seems even more fantastic.
As for the esteemed Mr. Withington, he went on to a long career at Boeing, retiring as a vice president in 1983.  At that point, he finally got his pilot’s license and designed and flew a two seat airplane he built in his backyard at the age of 80.
