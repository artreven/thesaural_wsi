The Story of the
Military Challenge
Coin
( copied
from
Wikipedia
9-15-2008 )
Like so many other aspects of
military
tradition, the origins of the challenge coin are a matter of
much
debate with
little supporting evidence.
While
many
organizations and services claim to have been the originators
of the
challenge
coin, the most commonly held view is that the tradition began
in the
United States Army
Air Service
(a
forerunner of the current
United States Air Force ).
Air warfare was a new
phenomenon
during
World War I .
When
the
army created flying
squadrons
they
were manned with volunteer pilots from every walk of civilian
life .
While some of the early
pilots came from
working class or
rural backgrounds, many were wealthy Ivy
League
students who withdrew from classes in the middle of the year,
drawn by
the
adventure and romance of the new form of warfare.
As the legend goes, one such
Ivy
Leaguer, a
wealthy lieutenant,
ordered small, solid-bronze medallions
(or coins)
struck,
which
he
then
presented
to
the
other pilots in
his squadron as mementos of their service together .
The
coin was gold-plated,
bore
the
squadron’s
insignia,
and
was
quite
valuable .
One
of the pilots in the squadron, who had never owned anything
like the
coin,
placed it in a leather pouch he wore around his neck for
safekeeping .
A short while later,
this pilot’s aircraft was
heavily damaged by ground fire (other sources claim it was an
aerial
dogfight ),
forcing
him
to
land
behind
enemy
lines
and allowing him to be captured
by the
Germans.
The Germans confiscated
the
personal belongings from his pockets, but they
didn’t
catch the leather pouch around his neck.
On
his
way
to
a
permanent
prisoner
of war
facility, he
was held
overnight
in a small
German-held French village near the front.
During
the
night,
the
town
was bombarded by the British, creating enough confusion to
allow the
pilot to
escape .
The pilot avoided German
patrols by
donning
civilian attire, but all of his identification
had
been
confiscated
so he had no way to prove his identity.
With great difficulty, he sneaked
across
no-man’s land and made contact with a French patrol.
Unfortunately
for
him, the French had been on the lookout for German saboteurs
dressed as
civilians.
The French mistook the
American pilot for a German saboteur and immediately prepared
to
execute
him.
Desperate to prove his
allegiance
and without
any identification, the pilot pulled out the coin from his
leather
pouch and
showed it to his French captors.
One
of
the Frenchmen recognized the unit insignia on the coin and
delayed the
execution long enough to confirm the pilot’s identity.
Once the pilot safely returned
to
his
squadron, it became a tradition for all members to carry their
coin at
all
times.
To ensure compliance, the
pilots
would challenge each other to produce the coin.
If
the
challenged
couldn’t
produce the coin, he was required to buy a drink of choice for
the
challenger;
if the challenged could produce the coin, the challenger would
purchase
the
drink.
Another tradition dates to US
Military
personnel assigned to occupy post World War Two Germany.
With
the
exchange
rate,
the
West
German
One
Pfennig
coin was worth only a fraction of a U.S. cent, and
they were thus generally considered not having enough value to
be worth
keeping
- unless one was broke.
At any
place
where servicemen would gather for a beer, if a soldier called
out
"Pfennig
Check" everyone had to empty their pockets to show if they
were saving
any
West German Pfennigs .
If a soldier
could
produce a
Pfennig, - it meant that he was nearly broke, and if a soldier
could
not
produce a Pfennig, it meant that he had enough money to not
bother
saving them,
- and thus enough money to buy the next round.
A version of this story dating
from
the
Vietnam war goes like this, "The tradition of the coin giving
dates
back
to
Vietnam
actually when soldiers would tote along a piece of "lucky"
ordnance
that had helped them or narrowly missed them .
At
first
it was small arms ammunition,
but this
practice grew
to much bigger and more dangerous ordnance as time wound on.
It became then actually a dangerous
practice
because of the size and power of the ordnance
being
carried ,
so commanders banned it, and instead gave away metal coins
emblazoned
with the
unit crest or something similar.
The
main
purpose of the ordnance had been when going into a bar, you
had to
have
your lucky
piece
or you had to buy
drinks
for all who
did have it.
The coins worked far
better
in this
regard
as they were
smaller and not
as lethal!
So , if
you go
to a military bar, whip out a challenge coin and slam it down
on the
bar, those
who lack one buy drinks!
Obviously
you have to be careful about
this
tradition.
However, Commanders
and units
give out coins
for this and as mementos for services rendered or special
occasions.
This tradition spread
to other military units
in all branches of service and even to
non
military
organizations.
Today, challenge
coins
are given to members upon joining
an organization, as an
award to
improve morale, and sold to commemorate special occasions or
as
fundraisers .
President Bill
Clinton displayed several racks of challenge coins, which
had been given
to him by
U.S.
servicemembers ,
on
the
credenza
behind his Oval Office desk.
These
coins
are
currently
on
display
at
the
Clinton
Library.
The challenge coins
appear
in the background of his
official
portrait , now hanging in the White
House.
President George
W. Bush received a challenge coin from a Marine combat patrol
unit
during
his short but unexpected visit to Al- Asad
Airbase in
Anbar
province,
Iraq ,
Monday, Sept. 3, 2007.
In 2008,
Leatherneck
Magazine
gives a 90th
Anniversary
Leatherneck
Challenge Coin to a select few
readers
who send
in letters to their Sound Off section which the editors
particularly
like.
There is another story
about an
American
soldier scheduled to rendezvous with Philippine guerrillas
during WWII
and with
him he carried a Philippine solid silver coin stamped with the
unit
insignia on
one side and the coin verified to the guerrillas that he was
their
valid
contact for the mission against the Japanese.
Challenging
The tradition of a challenge
is the
most
common way to ensure that members are carrying their unit's
coin.
Unfortunately, the rules of
a challenge
are not always formalized
for a unit, and may
vary between
organizations.
This may lead to
some
controversy when challenges
are initiated
between
members of different organizations.
The challenge, which
can be
made
at any time, begins with the challenger drawing
his/her
coin, and
slapping or placing the coin on the table or bar.
In
noisy
environs,
continuously
rapping
the
challenge
coin
on
a surface may initiate the challenge .
(Accidentally
dropping
a
challenge
coin
is considered
to be a
deliberate challenge to all present.)
Everyone
being challenged
must immediately
produce
the coin for
their organization and anyone failing to do so must buy a
round of
drinks for
the challenger and everyone else who has their challenge coin.
However, should everyone
challenged be able to
produce their coin, the challenger must buy a round of drinks
for the
group.
While most holders of
challenge
coins usually
carry them in their pockets or in some other readily
accessible place
on their
persons, most versions of the rules permit a challenged person
"a step
and
a reach" (particularly useful if one is challenged in the
shower).
Variants of the rules include
the
following.
If you are able to
steal a
challenge coin,
everyone in the group must buy you a drink.
During
a
challenge,
everyone
in
the
group
must
buy
you
a drink if you are the holder of the highest ranking coin .
Some units provide strict time
limits to
respond to a
challenge.
Other considerations
One feature of challenge coins
is
it takes a
conscious effort to carry one at all times.
Traditionally,
rules
of
a
challenge
include
a
prohibition
against
defacing
the coin, especially if it makes it easier
to
carry at all times.
If the
challenge
coin is attached to a belt buckle or key ring, or has had a
hole
drilled in it to attach to a lanyard, it no longer qualifies
as a
challenge
coin.
A generally safe place to
carry a
coin is in a pouch worn around the neck (like the pilot in the
legend).
Carrying a challenge coin in the
wallet is
problematic because the distinctive circular bulge identifies
the
individual as
a military member—a serious security consideration in many
places—and because it can loosely resemble a condom (and
therefore open
the individual up to jokes from friends).
Some
unit
rules
specifically
prohibit
carrying
a
challenge
coin
in
a wallet.
Cost
Challenge coins are moderately
expensive to
have made; as
of 2005 in the United States, typical costs run about
US$250 to set
up the die
and then
from US$7.00 to as low as US$2.50 per coin to stamp, depending
on
quantity,
colors, textures, and so on.
Challenge
coins,
as of 2007,
can be found
much
cheaper as makers
are becoming more plentiful in today's collectible market.
Thus, a run of 25 coins may cost about
US$425
total (US$17 each), while a run of 1000 coins may cost about
$2750
total
(US$2.75 each).
Common coins can
be
found for less than US$5 each, while others will run over
US$100 each
if they
are rare authentic coins from a
high
ranking
military
officer.
As
of 2007,
coins manufactured in China
typically cost about US$100 for the die and US$1.00 to US$2.00
per
coin.
When these coins
are
purchased
from a US Company, the customer's costs
will
significantly
increase.
Many challenge coins are
fabricated
in
South Korea ,
as
the connection to the
US
military
bases there is strong, and costs are cheaper than
US
made
coins .
Uses for
the
challenge coin
Besides
using
coins for
challenging, they
are also used
as
rewards
or awards.
They
are used
as a
tool to build morale.
In the context as they
are
used
by the modern
U.S.
military,
the
tradition
probably began amongst Special Forces units during the Vietnam
War.
The tradition spread through the
Airborne
community, and by the early
1980s also
into the
75th Infantry "Rangers."
As
officers were reassigned as their careers progressed, they
carried with
them
the tradition of awarding a unit coin for acts that were
worthy of
recognition,
but yet
lacked enough merit to
submit the
soldiers act
for an official medal.
Challenge
Coins
were not very common until the First Persian Gulf War
of
1990-1991, and have steadily grown in popularity since.
While
most
soldiers
are
happy
to
receive
an
award
of any type, some feel that there are so many coins
being
given
out
now that their value has been cheapened.
Some
collectors
buy them for their numismatic value.
United States Air Force
Every Airman
receives the
Airman's
coin
upon graduation from Basic
Training.
One widely known challenge
coin in
the United
States Air Force was the "Bull Dog" challenge coin that was
exclusive
to
B-52
enlisted tail
gunners.
Since the B-52 gunner
position is no longer in existence, this famous challenge coin
has
become
more rare .
This coin was presented to
gunners
upon
graduation from their Air Force technical training and their
entry into
the
"Gunners Association ."
In
the
earlier
days
of
bombers,
a
bean
or a
nugget
was used .
The
coin
represents
the
attributes
of
strength
and
courage
as
reflected in the Bulldog, the gunner's official mascot.
The coin was also given to certain
"honorary gunners ,"
usually
commanders and
leaders who portrayed the spirit of the bulldog.
The rules for the Bulldog coin
(acquired from
the Mack Trucking Company) were slightly different
than
for other coins.
- Bulldog Coins and Beans are
equal
and
interchangeable.
I.E .
Having
a
Coin
is
like
having
a
Bean
and having a Bean is like having a Coin.
- Coin or Bean must
carried
at ALL times.
You can be
challenged
anywhere, at anytime.
You must
produce
Coin or Bean without taking
3
or 4
steps.
(Many coin holders
have
been
caught
in the shower without their coin.)
- When challenging, the
challenger
must state
whether or not it is for a single drink,
or a round
of drinks .
(Warning- Coin challenges can
become
very expensive in a crowd of gunners)
- Under no circumstances
can
the Coin or Bean be handed
to another Gunner.
If
a
Gunner
hands
his
Coin
or
Bean
to another
Gunner, that Gunner can keep the coin/bean,
it's
his.
However, if the Gunner
places the
Coin or Bean
down and another Gunner picks it up to examine it, that is not
considered
"giving" and the Gunner is honor bound to place the Coin or
Bean back
where he got it.
He cannot
challenge
while he holds the other Gunner's Coin or Bean.
- If a Gunner
has
never
been
given
a Coin or Bean, he cannot be expected to play
the
game.
Rules of the game
must be
explained
to all new Coin/Bean holders.
- Lost Coins or Beans, or
failure
to produce
said Coin or Bean, results in the challenger
being
bought
a drink or round of drinks.
This
type of
transaction could be expensive so hold on to your Coin or
Bean.
Once the
challengee
has bought you a drink, you cannot continue to challenge him.
- If a Coin or Bean is lost,
replacement cost
is up to the individual.
A new
Coin or
Bean
should be acquired
at the
earliest
possible date.
Losing a Coin or Bean and not
replacing
it does not relieve the Gunner of his responsibilities.
(Usual
standard
replacement
cost
is
a
full
keg
to
be enjoyed
by all available Coin or
Bean
holders,
plus the cost of another Coin/Bean.)
- Gunner's Coins or Beans must
be
controlled
at all times -- giving them to just anyone is like opening up
the
Association
to anyone.
It is up to the local
Association as to who, outside the active members, they want
to have
the Coin
or Bean.
It
is
considered
an HONOR to be presented a Coin or Bean.
Let's
keep
it that
way.
- No holes
will
be
drilled
in the Coin or Bean.
- The above rules pertain and
apply
to anyone
who is worthy to hold the position of Defensive Aerial Gunner,
has held
the
position, or
has been selected
as
an
honorary member
of the Association.
A true story involving a
Gunner's
Coin:
"We had a new gunner on his
first
alert
tour, so of course he was the butt of many a joke or prank.
One morning we saw him in the showers,
his
coin nowhere in sight.
We
approached,
and "coined" him on the spot for a round of drinks.
He
looked
us
in
the
eyes,
laughed,
and
pulled
his coin out of his mouth!
It
turns out
that his morning routine consisted of first putting his coin
into his
mouth.
The next
morning, he woke
up, and had just put his coin into his mouth when the phone
rang.
As he sat up
to answer it, he accidentally swallowed the coin!
As
you
could
imagine,
he
was
hard
to
find over
the next few days.
He never did find the coin..."

Challenge
coins in
popular culture
At the end of the long-running
American
adventure drama television show
JAG , the
two main
characters decide to marry, then flip a challenge coin to
decide who
will
resign his or her military commission to accompany the other
to a new
duty station.
The final image
freezes
with the coin in the air; the audience never sees it fall.
Colonel
Eli McNulty coins Samantha Liston in
E-Ring
when she
is in the running to be Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Special
Operations
and a General
is trying to put a stop to it.
At
one
point the General initiates the 'Coin Check' to show that she
should
not have a
senior job as she has not seen combat and, of course, Liston
has no
challenge
coin - thus proving his point.
Challenge
coins outside of the military
The popularity of challenge
coins
are
stretching past the military.
NASCAR,
the
NFL
and World Series of Poker all have their
own
challenge coins.
They are also
becoming
extremely popular with Police Departments, Fire
Departments
and Fraternal
organizations.
In 2007, the Utah
Symphony and Opera gave
challenge
coins to all of its staff and musicians, making it the first
symphony
organization in
America
to embrace the challenge coin tradition.
Coins
do
not
have
to
be
given
to someone to be called a Challenge Coin, as
many
non-governmental
organizations sell challenge coins to fundraise or promote
their
products or
services.
