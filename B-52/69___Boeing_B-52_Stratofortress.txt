The
North American
X-15
rocket-powered aircraft
was part of the
X-series
of
experimental aircraft , initiated with the
Bell X-1 , that were made for the
USAF ,
NASA , and the
USN . The X-15 set speed and altitude records in the early 1960s, reaching the
edge of outer space
and returning with valuable data used in
aircraft
and
spacecraft
design. It currently holds the world record for the fastest speed ever reached by a manned aircraft.
During the X-15 program, 13 of the flights (by eight pilots) met the USAF
spaceflight
criteria by exceeding the altitude of 50 miles (80.47 km. 264,000ft.), thus qualifying the pilots for
astronaut
status; some pilots also qualified for NASA
astronaut wings .
Of all the X-15 missions, two flights (by the same pilot) qualified as space flights, per the international
FAI
definition of a spaceflight by exceeding a 100 kilometer (62.137 mi, 328,084 ft) altitude.
Design and development

The X-15 was based on a concept study from
Walter Dornberger
for the NACA for a hypersonic research aircraft.The
requests for proposal
were published on 30 December 1954 for the airframe and on 4 February 1955 for the
rocket engine . The X-15 was built by two manufacturers:
North American Aviation
was contracted for the airframe in November 1955, and
Reaction Motors
was contracted for building the engines in 1956.
The first X-15 flight was an unpowered test flight by
Scott Crossfield , on 8 June 1959; he also piloted the first powered flight, on 17 September 1959, with his first XLR-99 flight on 15 November 1960.
Like most X-series aircraft, the X-15 was designed to be carried aloft, under the wing of a
B-52
bomber plane. The X-15 fuselage was long and cylindrical, with rear
fairings
that flattened its appearance, and thick, dorsal and ventral wedge-fin stabilizers. Parts of the fuselage were heat-resistant
nickel
alloy
( Inconel -X 750). The retractable
landing gear
comprised a nose-wheel carriage and two rear skis. The skis did not extend beyond the ventral fin, which required the pilot to jettison the lower fin (fitted with a parachute) just before landing. The two
XLR-11
rocket engines for the initial
X-15A
model delivered 72kN (16,000 lbf) of total thrust; the main engine (installed later) was a single
XLR-99
rocket engine delivering 254kN (57,000 lbf) at sea level, and 311 kN (70,000 lbf) at peak altitude.
Before 1958, USAF and
NACA , (later NASA), officials discussed an orbital X-15 spacecraft — the
X-15B
— for launching to outer space atop an
SM-64 Navajo missile , that was cancelled when the NACA became the NASA, and
Project Mercury
was approved. By 1959, the
X-20 Dyna-Soar
space-glider program became the USAF's preferred means for launching military manned-spacecraft into orbit; the program was cancelled in the early 1960s.
Operational history
Three X-15s were built, flying 199 test flights, the last on 24 October 1968. Twelve test pilots flew the X-15; among them were
Neil Armstrong
(first man on the moon) and
Joe Engle
(a space shuttle commander). In July and August 1963, pilot
Joe Walker
crossed the 100 km altitude mark twice, thus joining the NASA astronauts and Soviet Cosmonauts as the only men to have crossed the barrier into outer space (Alan Shepard was the first American in space, while Soviet
Yuri Gagarin
was the first human being in space).
U.S. Air Force Test pilot Maj.
Michael J. Adams
was killed, on 15 November 1967, in
X-15 Flight 191
when his craft (X-15-3) entered a hypersonic spin while descending, then oscillated violently as aerodynamic forces increased after re-entry. As his craft's flight control system operated the control surfaces to their limits, the craft's acceleration built to 15  g
vertical and 8 g lateral. The airframe broke apart at 60,000 ft altitude, scattering the craft's wreckage for 50 square miles. On 8 June 2004, a monument was erected at the cockpit's locale, near
Randsburg, California .Maj. Adams was posthumously awarded astronaut wings for his final flight in craft X-15-3, which had reached 266,000 ft (81.1 km, 50.4 mi.) of altitude. In 1991, his name was added to the Astronaut Memorial monument,
Kennedy Space Center , Florida.

The second X-15A was rebuilt after a landing accident. It was lengthened 2.4 ft (0.74 m), a pair of auxiliary fuel tanks attached under the fuselage, and a heat-resistant surface treatment applied. Re-named the
X-15A-2 , it first flew on 28 June 1964, reaching 7,274 km/h (4,520 mph, 2,021 m/s).
The altitudes attained by the X-15 aircraft do not match that of Alan Shephard's 1961 NASA spacecapsule flight (116 miles), nor subsequent NASA spacecapsules and space shuttle flights. However, the X-15 flights did reign supreme among rocket-powered aircraft until the
third spaceflight
of
Space Ship One
in 2004. The widely-reported record achieved, by the small
X-43A
scramjet
testbed, on 16 November 2004, of approximately
Mach
10 (6,600 mph, 10,622 km/h, 2.95 km/s) at 95,000 ft (29 km, 17.99 mi) is an air-breathing
jet engine
record.
Five aircraft were the X-15 program: three X-15s, two B-52 bombers:
X-15A-1
-
56-6670 , 82 powered flights
X-15A-2
-
56-6671 , 53 powered flights
X-15A-3
-
56-6672 , 64 powered flights ( destroyed in a crash )
NB-52A
-
52-003
(retired in October 1969)
NB-52B
-
52-008
(retired in November 2004)
A 200th flight over Nevada was slated for 21 November 1968, piloted by
William J. Knight . Technical problems and bad weather delayed the flight six times, and on 20 December 1968, the 200th flight was finally cancelled. The X-15 was unfastened from the wing of bomber NB-52A, and prepared for indefinite storage.

Record flights
Highest flights
In the United States there are two definitions of how high a person must go to be referred to as an
astronaut . The
USAF
decided to award
astronaut wings
to anyone who achieved an altitude of 50 miles (80.47 km) or more. However the
FAI
set the
limit of space
at 100 km. Thirteen X-15 flights went higher than 50 miles (80.47 km) and two of these reached over 62.137 miles (100 km).
