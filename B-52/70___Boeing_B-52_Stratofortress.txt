Heading into Guangdong province
18
Mar
This morning I plot the route from Dongxing, on the Chinese side, to Maoming in the Guangdong province, which Google maps tells be will take about five and a half hours, but is more likely six to six and a half due to the top speed of my little camper. Ok, I know I am not in Dongxing just yet, but it’s only across the Ka Long river, and I’ll be there in an hour or so.
So I get a simple breakfast of tea, bread and jam, and make my way to the border road. It’s an easy and well arranged crossing, with the two border buildings either end of the Ka Long Bridge. I pay my dues, have my papers checked a few times and pass through the Vietnam gates. At the Chinese side I go through the same things again, but they get me out of the camper and give it a good look over. I suspect they are rather envious that I have one and they don’t! I am finally allowed through, but I don’t intend to stop, and make my way out onto the G7511 east.
Open road with the wind in my hair.
The initial G7511 takes me along the coast and south of the mountains. It’s a good route and I pass plenty of transports heading in both directions, but not as much traffic as I was expecting. The G75 to Maoming is a good, well maintained road and I make great progress through the area. En-route I pass Zhanjiang, a city of about 7 million people and a fine history. Despite its dynastic past, it was still a simple fishing village in 1898 when the French arrived and occupied the area. The French managed to force the Chinese into a lease of one part, and they renamed it Fort-Boyard and intended to develop it as a major port to take advantage of the silk trade. The port was taken over by the Japanese during the Second World War, and eventually relinquished by the French in 1946 by
Charles de Gaulle . The port is now one of the busiest in China and has an annual throughout of more than 2,600 million tons.
The G15 takes me a little north and onto the city of Maoming. There are well built roads everywhere, but not that many vehicles on them. As I drive into Maoming, I notice the tower blocks and larger buildings in all directions.
After nearly an hour on Google, I find a room I can ‘book’ in the Nanguo Hotel for 251 CNY (£25.00) for the night. I am using the
Agoda.com
site here, which is a little cluttered, but has all the right information. I could stay in the camper, but I am actually feeling a little out of my depth here. Tomorrow I head north east to Shenzhen, and look forward to meeting up with my niece in Honk Kong.

Mong Cai
17
Mar
I arrive in Mong Cai at three twenty-five in the afternoon and park up to the side of the bus station off the Quang Trung road. The border here turns out to be only open until 16:30, (I thought it was 17:30, but found better information that it was 07:30 – 16:30. Oh and expect to pay a dollar ‘overtime’ at the weekends.) so it’s unlikely I will have time to get through today, as there is quite a queue already.
Mong Cai shares the river with the Chinese city of Dongxing on the other side. Mong Cai is widely considered one of the wealthiest cities in Vietnam, and the city is very modern in places. Having resigned myself to not making the crossing, I head along to the river to look across at China. Although Dongxing is more developed an area, it is obvious that Mong Cai is where the money is, or at least where the money is spent. Maybe the Chinese have bigger places to worry about. I was expecting to get across and head off into China today, if only to stay near Dongxing, but the more I do my research the more I think I am better this side of the river. At least for tonight. There is a surprisingly lively nightlife. Families and tourists meander along the bridge and through the streets that branch off from the intersection in the centre of town. The cafes along the river offer a more romantic setting, and a younger crowd tends to gather in the two popular clubs. The town’s five-star hotel has a 24 hour casino, too, but local Vietnamese are not allowed into the hotel, so the only gamblers are Chinese or foreigners.
The border generates billions in trade between the two countries, and the nearby beach of Tra co draws in plenty of tourists. Mong Cai Town lies by the bank of the Ka Long River. Tra co beach stretches 17km (10 mi) along the south eastern edge of the nearby peninsular. It is mostly Vietnamese tourists from Hanoi and the northern region.
So, here I am, stuck, as it were, on the Vietnam-side of the border and unprepared. I like the look of Mong Cai, so I decide to head off for an early dinner and sample the local food. Not far from the bus station I find a chinese restaurant that is eager to serve me. There is no menu, and the owner insists, in actually good English, that I simply point out the ingredients I want and they will cook it for me.
Afterwards I head back to the camper, make a cup of tea and read for a while, before getting some sleep.

A pass by Ha Long Bay
17
Mar
Today, Google maps plots a route across the Cau Long Bien Bridge out of Hanoi to the east and directly across the Red River.
Out of the three routes offered by the map, I choose Route 2 to stay near the coastal area and follow the lowland around the mountain range that overlooks the bays. Vietnam has a wonderfully diverse countryside, but the coastal route, especially on this stretch, is magnificent. Most of the roads are in very good condition, and they are travelled by an assortment of traders and long distance transports. The Chinese play a big part in this region, and many of the ‘locals’ are displaced Chines, or families that have moved here. Conflicts between the two countries have produced an interesting and cross-cultured community.
This region has been the scene of a number of Chinese invasions and the last major issue was in 1979. Chinese forces amassed on the border through December and January. At the time, the Chinese had an alliance with Cambodia, while the Vietnamese became politically closer to the USSR (The former Russian federation). This caused some friction, and Vietnamese citizens were massacred in Cambodia in the lead up to the invasion. On February 17th, China invaded in an attempt to destroy military structure in the north Vietnam region. The Chinese forces advanced and took Lang Son in early March, which represented a last defence before Hanoi. The well trained Vietnamese army pushed back and the Chinese retreated, but systematically destroyed almost everything on their way back across the border.
Back on the coast I am presented with incredibly beautiful scenery. Just three hours east of Hanoi and I head along the TL 326, which runs just north of Ha Long bay, a truly beautiful view. The pillars of limestone protrude from the sea, creating encircled, calm natural harbours.
There are nearly 2000 islets along this coastline, and the fishing community live among them, many on floating harbours that they moor to and fish from. There is something magical about this area.
Heading off north, I join the QL18 towards China. I expect to be in Mong Cai around 15:00 and to cross the border by 17:00.

Day 50: Hanoi
16
Mar
I will spend today in and around Hanoi, visit some famous places and sample the culture and style of the city. Hanoi has always been the centre of Vietnam and was established in 1010. The city was the capital of the French Indochina between 1902 and 1954, when the French relinquished sovereignty to the Vietnamese. During the Vietnam war, it remained the capital of North Vietnam until the parts of teh embattled nation came back together in 1976. It’s a nice temperature today of about 26c, but very overcast and a touch humid. Still, nice to be walking around and taking the time for this fine city.
One fundamental thing I have learnt about the southern asia region is that life here goes back to an ancient age, and Hanoi is no exception. The red river area was inhabited from around 3000 BC, and has a strong trading and political base. This predates the
Pyramids of Giza . In 1010, Ly Thai To, the first ruler of the Lý Dynasty, moved the capital of Đại Việt to the site of the Đại La Citadel. Claiming to have seen a dragon ascending the Red River, he renamed the site Thăng Long or Rising Dragon. In 1408, the Chinese Ming Dynasty walked in and took over. The invading China stuck around for twenty years and were driven out by the Vietnamese in 1428. It became Hanoi when the French took over in 1887.
The red river is part of Hanoi.
Life seems busy.
As it is so close to the hotel I am staying in, my first call is to the Hoan Kiem Lake. There’s a touch of the Arthurian legend here, in that the lake was the home to the Golden Turtle God (Kim Qui), who handed the Emporer Lê Lợi a magical sword that empowered him to defeat the Chinese and drive them out. The lake is often referred to as the Sword lake, and soft-shell turtles live on the shallow island that stands in the centre. The rather impressive Turtle Tower was built in the 18th Century. The soft shell turtle is badly endangered, and no one seems to know how many are actually in the lake. The Old Quarter amounted to just 36 streets a hundred years ago, and each street had merchants that specialised in a particular trade. Now, the Old Quarter is surrounded by the modern city.
For lunch I decide to try one of the street stalls, which look a little less than safe, but the food look incredible. While simply asking for Chicken Street in Vietnamese – Phố Gà Nướng – will probably land you in the right place [If you can pronounce it!], the actual street name is Lý Văn Phúc. I can’t quite face the grilled chicken feet, so I go for the drumsticks instead. A great bowl of rice with a hot sauce makes the meal. There are some concerns about the general hygiene in these markets, and some of the restaurants for that matter, but with a little common sense it shouldn’t be too risky.
Great food, despite the conditions.
Not sure about the grilled feet!
A little further on I pass Hỏa Lò Prison, otherwise known as the “Hanoi Hilton”. It was a prison used by the French colonists in Vietnam for political prisoners and later by North Vietnam for prisoners of war during the Vietnam War. I know it as the place that drug smugglers end up at after being caught at the airport.
As I head back to the Old Quarter and my hotel, I stop off at the Night Market. It is open late every Friday, Saturday and sundays. Dong Xuan Market was constructed by the French in 1889 and follows the many town markets you see in French towns and cities. It has to be said, it is mostly a tourist market selling souveniers, handicrafts, but I venture in and have a good look round.
It’s been a busy day and I have found some great places and easten dome terrific food. Tomorrow I head out towards China and another border crossing.

Hanoi, here I come

Mar
Big journey today. The plotted route on Google maps gives me three possible routes and I choose Route 3 for no other reason than it follows the coast all the way up. There’s less than half an hour between the routes, and I fancy having the wind in my hair. If I had any hair, that is.
A coastal journey along the South China Sea.
So I have the earliest breakfast the hotel can give me and I head off to give the camper a check over. Dong Hoi is actually quite nice. Dong Hoi is the capital of the Quang Binh region, and the estuary adds a seaside feel to the whole place and fishing is clearly one of its main industries.
My hotel is just there to the right.
Very picturesque.
In 1926, a French female archaeologist, Madeleine Colani discovered many items in caves in west Quang Binh. With
Carbon14
tests, the artefacts were dated back to 10,509 years ago.
Now, I have to say I have a bit of an interest in things dating back to 10,000 BC, or there a bouts. This seems to come up an awful lot in ancient history and is largely seen as the starting point of the warming of the Earth and the end of the Glacial period. In popular culture, Atlantis was destroyed about 9,600 BC. Some people even suggest that an Alien race set up shop around this time in various parts of the world, but that’s for another day.
I head north and find my virtual self on the AH01 again, which is actually quite comforting. Vietnam drive on the right, which is fine, but I do have to pay attention on junctions. In fact, almost all of the countries that drive on the left are old British Colonial states. Practically every other one drives on the right. (You can always check using
whatsideoftheroad.com . It seems to be accurate, but second check if it’s important.) For safety sake, if you are a British citizen, like me, register with the Foreign Office’s
LOCATE
system. Many other western nations have similar systems that allow a quick response if you get into trouble as a traveller. While I am on the subject, the British Foreign Office tell me that there are no current travel restrictions in Vietnam for me.
It takes me almost three hours to get to Vinh, another estuary city on the coast. I cross the Vinh bridge and into the city. In the 1950’s, much of the original city was destroyed in the countless battles between the French and the Viet Minh, which means the city I pass through is mostly modern. As I leave Vinh to the north, I drive into Cua Lo, one of the most popular resorts in this part of Vietnam.
The estuary port.
The Vietnam seaside resort.
One thing I notice about the last few countries I have been through, and that’s how many bridges I get to cross. I barely get a few hours before I have to cross another one. Having the sea on my right is not helping, and I cross another 14 before I arrive at Hanoi. I ‘book’ a room in the Rising Dragon Palace Hotel for £35, just a mile form the railway station and views of Hanoi’s Old Quarter. My camper goes into the parking bay and I take an overnight bag. I plan on staying in Hanoi to take the time to look around, get a feel for the city and find some great history.

Over the Trail to Dong Hoi
14
Mar
I am driving over the much fabled
Ho Chi Minh Trail . This stretch of mountains became one of the most important corridors the Vietnamese could have wished for. The U.S. National Security Agency once referred to the Trail system as “one of the great achievements of military engineering of the 20th century.” Along these mountains, the National Front for Liberation of South Vietnam, or the Vietcong, as the US forces referred to them, supported their cause. The Trail has its origins in early trade routes in these parts, but by the end of the Vietnam war, it had became an elaborate network of roads, storage areas, barracks and command facilities.
Route 9, or AH16, takes me over the range and between the peaks. Most of which are around 600m. The Song Thach Han river is below me to the right, as it heads east and then south towards Dong Ha and the south china sea.
The Song Thach Han river
In 1941, Ho Chi Minh (Born Nguyễn Sinh Cung in 1890.) returned to Vietnam to find it occupied by two foreign states:  Vichy France  and Japan. He had travelled the world, spending time in London, France and the United States. Not the peasant I always thought he was. He took control of, and developed what was to become the People’s Army of Vietnam (PAVN), and declared the independence of Vietnam in 1945. (I found an interesting similarity here to how the formation of the US came about, when a group of men met in secret to do the same in 1776.) The new declaration was contested by the US and other nations in that it was based on a Communist government. This was the start of the
cold war , and Communism was not a popular way to go.
Over 58,000 US servicemen died in the war, but that doesn’t come close the estimate of between one and three million Vietnamese soldiers and civilians, 200,000 – 300,000 Cambodians and 20,000 – 200,000 Loatians. The Vietnam war is now the example of how not to conduct a war.
Once over the mountains I head down towards the sea and Dong Ha. It’s another two hours before I arrive at Dong Hoi. The sight of the South China Sea is the first expanse of water I have seen since the Black sea in north Turkey, and it’s a wonderful sight. I ‘book’ a room for the night in the Moon Light hotel, right on the mouth of the estuary and facing the sea. Now to look for something nice to eat.

Junket across Laos
14
Mar
I headed out onto the AH16, still part of the Asian network I have mentioned a few times, that cuts a line across this part of Laos towards Vietnam in the east. The Laos people seem to be pretty relaxed about everything. Every so often I get an intersection of roads where there are no traffic lights or policeman waving people this way and that. Instead, we all just weave around and get by. No bibbing of horns or road rage. I am noticeably over polite, and am always the most interesting sight on the road.
Not always whizzing along a road.
Great way to travel.
After the Geneva Conference in 1954, France eventually relinquished their hold over these countries and they became independent. To this aim, Vietnamese nationalists fought for a unified country under a Communist government, but the United States, along with the help of south Vietnamese, wanted to stop Communism wherever they found it, almost by any means. By the mid 60’s, the Vietnam war reached a new level, despite the US Government losing all support from the American public. Laos used a number of political agreements to try to stay out of the war, but after a major invasion on the
Plain of Jars , it was inevitable that Laos was now part of the conflict. The US used most airfields to mount attacks on the neighbouring country. Massive aerial bombardment was carried out by the United States. The UK newspaper,  The Guardian  reported that Laos was hit by an average of one  B-52  bombload every eight minutes, 24 hours a day, between 1964 and 1973.
I stop off at Phin to fill the tank and pick up some food. (Here’s a thought. Not all Petrol stations have all of the fuel types you might need. For instance, some only have leaded petrol, so many modern vehicles, which require unleaded fuel, may well have a problem. My habit of topping up when I can seems to be the best approach.) There are plenty of reminders of the war on this route, and I go and see the monument-like remains of the American helicopter in Muang Phin. As I carry on I head up into the Annamite mountain range that forms the border between Laos and Vietnam, I travel through a long valley and beside a river and it’s not long before I get to the Dansavan/Lao Bao border crossing. There’s a bit of a queue, and as far as I can find out the border is only open between 08:00 and 17:00. It’s only a little after two, so I should have plenty of time. I am heading to Dong Hoi, which is another two and a half hours drive. Again, I get a Visa on Arrival (VOA) into Vietnam, which costs between US$30 and US$40, depending on your natioanlity. This I find interesting, but can’t find the reason for different costs.
It takes about an hour and I pass through as part of a small convoy of similar-sized vehicles, through the Laos border arch, along the short road and through the Vietnam arch. Lao Bao, on the other side is much smaller than I thought it would be, but I have no time to stop and take a look.
