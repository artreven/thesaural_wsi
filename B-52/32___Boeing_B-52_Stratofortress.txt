Dr. Bill Tells Ancestor Stories
This Blog focuses on Ancestor Stories, both the stories themselves about my family’s ancestors and discussions of where they come from and how to prepare and share them. These stories may be non-fiction or fiction – we will always tell which is which, of course. Also see my KINNICK blog and The HOMEPLACE Series Blog, left sidebar, scroll down.

Those Places Thursday - My Air Force Desk - Aug 1962
Those Places Thursday - My Air Force Desk - Aug 1962
Here I am, 2nd Lieutenant William L. Smith, United State Air Force,
sitting at my military issue desk in a semi-trailer van, part of the
Radar Bomb Scoring Squadron Detachment (SAC), on a mesa, west of
Winslow, Arizona , in August 1962. How about that two-toned green color scheme?
This would have been at the beginning of my second year (of three) on
active duty. The first half of the first year was spend in Biloxi, MS,
at
Ground Electronics School ; the second half was
spent here
at the Detachment. I was the third ranking Officer (of three Officers
in the Detachment). The Major and the Captain were both pilots, who took
tours of duty flying the
B-47
and
B-52
bombers flying over that our Detachment was 'scoring' as they made their simulated bomb runs.
[ The B-52 s started flying in 1952, and these same planes, the very same planes, were used to bomb
Baghdad, Iraq , just a few years ago (85 in active service, 9 in reserve).]
Families are Forever!  ;-)
