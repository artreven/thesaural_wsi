Nope
The "deformity" is the result of a couple of bouts with skin cancer and surgery.

Probably when he was a prisioner of war
From the excerpt from Wikipedia below you can just about surmise it came from many beatings he received as a POW in Vietnam.
"
On
October 26 ,
1967 , McCain was flying as part of a 20-plane attack against a
thermal power plant
in central
Hanoi , a heavily defended target area that had previously been off-limits to U.S. raids. [43] [44]
McCain's
A-4 Skyhawk
had its wing blown off by a Soviet-made
SA-2
anti-aircraft missile [44]
while pulling up after dropping its bombs. [45]
McCain
fractured
both arms and a leg in being hit and ejecting from his plane [46]
as it went into a
vertical inverted spin . [47]
He nearly drowned after he parachuted into
Truc Bach Lake
in Hanoi. [43]
After he regained consciousness, a mob gathered around, spat on him, kicked him, and stripped him of his clothes. [47]
Others crushed his shoulder with the butt of a rifle and bayoneted him in his left foot and abdominal area; he was then transported to Hanoi's main
Hoa Loa Prison , nicknamed the "Hanoi Hilton" by American POWs. [47] [48]
Although McCain was badly wounded, his captors refused to give him medical care unless he gave them military information; they beat and interrogated him, but McCain only offered his name, rank, serial number, and date of birth, [47]
and then his ship's name, squadron's name, and their intended target [49]
(disclosing this information was in violation of the
Code of Conduct , which McCain later wrote he regretted, but in practice was of no military value to the North Vietnamese [50] ). Further coerced to give the names of his squadron members, he supplied the names of the
Green Bay Packers '
offensive line . [51] [49]
Soon thinking he was near death, McCain said he would give them more information if taken to the hospital, hoping he could then put them off once he was treated. [52]
A prison doctor came and said it was too late, as McCain was about to die anyway. [47]
Only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was a top admiral did they give him medical care [47]
and announce his capture. At this point, two days after McCain's plane went down, that event and his status as a POW made the front pages of
The New York Times [37]
and
The Washington Post . [53]
McCain spent six weeks in the Hoa Loa hospital, receiving marginal care. [43]
He was interviewed by a
French
television reporter whose report was carried on
CBS , and was observed by a variety of North Vietnamese, including the famous General
Vo Nguyen Giap . [47]
Many of the North Vietnamese observers assumed that he must be part of America's political-military-economic elite. [47]
Now having lost 50 pounds, in a chest cast, and with his hair turned white, [43]
McCain was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp on the outskirts of Hanoi nicknamed "the Plantation" [54]
in December 1967, into a cell with two other Americans who did not expect him to live a week (one was
Bud Day , a future
Medal of Honor
recipient); they nursed McCain and kept him alive. [55]
In March 1968, McCain was put into
solitary confinement , where he would remain for two years. [47]
In July 1968, McCain's father was named
Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC) , stationed in
Honolulu
and commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater. [4]
McCain was immediately offered a chance to return home early: [43]
the North Vietnamese wanted a worldwide propaganda coup by appearing merciful, and also wanted to show other POWs that elites like McCain were willing to be treated preferentially. [47]
McCain turned down the offer of repatriation, due to the
Code of Conduct
principle of "first in, first out": he would only accept the offer if every man taken in before him was released as well. [56]
McCain's refusal to be released was even remarked upon by North Vietnamese senior negotiator
Le Duc Tho
to U.S. envoy
Averell Harriman
during the ongoing
Paris Peace Talks . [57]
In August of 1968, a program of vigorous torture methods began on McCain, using rope bindings into painful positions, and beatings every two hours, at the same time as he was suffering from
dysentery . [47] [43]
Teeth and bones were broken again, as was McCain's spirit; the beginning of a suicide attempt was stopped by guards. [43]
After four days of this, McCain signed an anti-American propaganda "confession" that said he was a "black criminal" and an "air pirate", [43]
although he used stilted Communist jargon and ungrammatical language to signal that the statement was forced. [51]
He felt then and always that he had dishonored his country, his family, his comrades and himself by his statement, [58]
but as he would later write, "I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine." [47]
His injuries to this day have left him incapable of raising his arms above his head. [13]
Two weeks later his captors tried to force him to sign a second statement, and this time, his will to resist restored, he refused. [47]
He received two to three beatings per week because of his continued refusal. [59]
Other American POWs were similarly tortured and maltreated in order to extract "confessions". [47]
On one occasion, a guard surreptitiously loosened McCain's painful rope bindings for a night; when months later the guard later saw McCain on
Christmas Day , he stood next to McCain and silently drew a
cross
in the dirt with his foot [60]
(decades later, McCain would relate this
Good Samaritan
story during his presidential campaigns, as a testament to faith and humanity [61] [62] ). On
Christmas Eve
1968, a
church service
for the POWs was staged for photographers and film cameras; McCain defied North Vietnamese instructions to be quiet, speaking out details of his treatment then shouting "Fu-u-u-u-ck you, you son of a bitch!" and giving
the finger
whenever a camera was pointed at him. [63]
McCain refused to meet with various anti-war peace groups coming to Hanoi, such as those led by
David Dellinger ,
Tom Hayden , and
Rennie Davis , not wanting to give either them or the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory based on his connection to his father. [47]
In May 1969,
U.S. Secretary of Defense
Melvin Laird
began publicly questioning North Vietnamese treatment of U.S. prisoners. [64]
On
June 5 ,
1969 , a
Radio Hanoi
broadcast denied any mistreatment, and quoted from a statement it attributed to McCain: "I have bombed the cities, towns and villages and caused injuries and even death for the people of North Vietnam. After I was captured, I was taken to a hospital in Hanoi where I received very good medical treatment." [64]
In October 1969, treatment of McCain and the other POWs suddenly improved, after a badly beaten and weakened POW who had been released that summer disclosed to the world press the conditions to which they were being subjected [47]
and the
National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia , including McCain's brother Joe, heightened awareness of the POWs' plight. [65]
In December 1969, McCain was transferred back to the Hoa Loa "Hanoi Hilton"; [47]
his solitary confinement ended in March 1970. [47]
McCain continued to refuse to see anti-war groups or journalists sympathetic to the North Vietnamese regime; [47]
to one visitor who did speak with him, McCain later wrote, "I told him I had no remorse about what I did, and that I would do it over again if the same opportunity presented itself." [47]
McCain and other prisoners were moved around to different camps at times, but conditions over the next several years were generally more tolerable than they had been before. [47]
Back at the "Hanoi Hilton" from November 1971 onward, [47]
McCain and the other POWs cheered the intense, Hanoi-focused,
B-52 -led
U.S. "Christmas Bombing" campaign
of December 1972 — whose explosions lit the night sky and shook the walls of the camp, and whose daily orders were issued by McCain's father, knowing his son was in the vicinity — as a forceful measure to force North Vietnam to terms. [47] [66]
Altogether, McCain was held as a
prisoner of war
in North Vietnam for five and a half years. The
Paris Peace Accords
were signed on
January 27 ,
1973 , ending direct U.S. involvement in the war, but the
Operation Homecoming
arrangements for POWs took longer; McCain was finally released from captivity on
March 15 ,
1973 , [67]
having been a POW for almost an extra five years due to his refusal to accept the out-of-sequence repatriation offer. [68]

A lop-sided face is a sign of mental deterioration.
McCain is a psycho case.
