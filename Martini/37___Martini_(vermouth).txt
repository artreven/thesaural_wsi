While celebrating a friend’s birthday at a restaurant that prides themselves on their food and cocktail pairings, I realized that there are a myriad of
Italian Liquors  that have a great deal to offer and there’s not a lot of general knowledge out there.
Most reputable bars always have that shelf of gorgeous vintage liquor labels, but their contents are a mystery to most.  I thought I would give a quick breakdown to help shed some light on the subject:
Aperitivi :
Vermouth
Martini
&
Cinzano
– both are Italian brands of Vermouth that are offered in bianco (white)/dry or rosso (red)/sweet. Typically Bianco or Dry vermouths are used for Martinis, while Rosso or Sweet vermouths are used in cocktails such as Manhattans to compliment the bourbon.
Bitte r Liqu ors
Campari  &  Aperol  – both liquors have bitter, citrusy flavor with similar sugar contents; however, Campari has a stronger alcohol content.  They are both great in cocktails with soda water, grapefruit juice, or even gin.  The
Negroni
is a very popular Campari cocktail.  I’ve also floated Aperol in a glass of champagne, which makes a great champagne cocktail.
Digestivi:
Anise
Strega  &   Sambuca  – Anise (or liquorice) flavored syrupy liquors.  They are typically served neat, chilled, on the rocks, or with water.  Sometimes when served neat, bars will add 3 espresso beans, which are supposed to represent the holy trinity.  One other ‘of note’ is you can light Sambuca on fire, which makes a fun party trick.
Amaro Herbal Liqueurs
Fernet  &  Averno  – These herbal liqueurs are generally used as a digestivo after a large meal.  They’re Italy’s version of Germany’s  Jagermeister .  They’re also well known amongst the restaurant industry (especially in SF) as the shot of choice.
Dolce
Amaretto  – almond flavored liqueur, served neat or on the rocks.  I don’t recommend it in cocktails, as it’s very sweet (unless it’s a coffee drink).
Frangelico  – hazelnut flavored liqueur, should be served similarly to Amaretto – very tasty in coffee, too.
Limoncello  – Very sweet and thick lemon liquor that should be served ice cold in little cordial glasses (small portions are key because it’s quite sugary).  I’ve also used it in cocktails as well.  I made a dessert cocktail one year with vanilla vodka, limoncello, and soda water.  Beware because it’s tasty, but dangerous.
Hope this helps next time you’re in the mood to try something new!
