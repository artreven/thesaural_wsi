Halia Lane - Martini Formula
Martini Formula
“Parker pen ran an advertising campaign in the early 1970s, simply showing a hand using a Parker Pen to write the following ‘mathematical’ formula on a piece of paper:
The result was that they received numerous inquiries by chemists, mathematicians, and physicists, asking for the meaning of the formula, as they could not figure it out. The formula is actually a humorous representation for the recipe of a
Martini : 3.5 shots of
gin
and half a shot of
vermouth
over 4 parts H 2 O 3
(water cubed = ice), finished off with three stirs (the 3×360°).
Apparently the campaign received one very critical letter asking "Who ever heard of a martini without an olive?”.“
