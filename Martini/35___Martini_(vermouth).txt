Wank List 1986
‘Living a Boy’s Adventure Tale’ – A-ha WANK LIST 1986 Jayne Tyler
(can’t forget the denim warmth between her legs that night we watched
Doctor Who
in her ‘parlour’);
Kirsty McDonald
(she’s got great eyes and decent breasts);
Hannah
(just reckon she’s dirty);
BM Wasp
(of course, she’s just stunning);
Phoebe
(the more I think about it, the more I fancy her and her bushy eyebrows);
Sadie Woolf
(I really need to have sex with her…);
Angelene Hawkins
(after
Stan ’s party, what d’you expect?);
Katy Gaynor
(there’s something ‘real woman’ about her now);
Nicky Brown
(we really should go out with each other);
Mandy Dell
(still gorgeous);
Tara Speed
(slim ‘n’ sexy);
BMW’s mum
(why not? She’s older, yeah, but a lot like BMW);
Gerry Gordon
(she’s just really nice, sorry,
Flash !);
Tia Purdey
(another one I’d just really love to have sex with);
Sue Nunn
(she’s got better looking with time and I bet she’s good at it);
Sally Roper
(she’s really filthy, I reckon, and I’ve fancied her since I started at
Wetlands ). Later: ‘Glow World’ – Bill Nelson I think
February
has shown me the first signs of my ‘schizophrenia’: when things began to crumble between BMW and I, and Flash’s half term visit was cancelled. I think that issue with Flash made us dislike each other more, but right now we seem to have become friendlier than ever… A gap between my
Mother
and I has slowly begun to develop… My ‘infatuation’ with
Hazel Church , which meant we became 'close' for a couple of days, seems to have led to the end of all communication between
Astra Trellis
and myself. Because of my ‘moods’, apparently… WHAT RITCHERD WAS UP TO A YEAR AGO [Images subject to control of individual Copyright Holders / While based on true life events and designed as a study of parochial British cultural and emotional life in the 1980s, this blog is a work of fiction.

Eleven Years From Now: 26/02/97
ELEVEN YEARS FROM NOW…
‘Little Wonder’ – David Bowie
Had a lovely day out in
LONDON
with
LILI , which was great. We bought
Doctor Who
books and ate in
Chinatown …
… (at the restaurant I took her to for her
GRADUATION DINNER ).
Afterwards, we ended up in
HAAGEN DAZS …
…before failing to go to the pictures so we could come home and watch
FRIENDS .
Again, I feel such love for Lilith. More than I ever did. I can’t wait to get the Third Year out of the way and then we can go away together. If only she’ll wait for me…

The Day After Scumburger's Party
‘A Foreign Place’ – Japan The day after
Scumburger ’s party… …which was not without incident. Good music, lots of booze,
Gary Decan ’s band ( Pussfeller ) making a hasty escape through a window when things turned violent and me and Hazel getting on like a house on fire. Or a house with the giggles at the very least. So, today, I invited
Hazel
across to see
Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence
(again). She came over and we enjoyed ourselves (no, not in the sex kind of way, but as friends, you cynics!). I hope
Astra Trellis
doesn’t mind me inviting her best friend to my house instead of her… WHAT RITCHERD WAS UP TO A YEAR AGO [Images subject to control of individual Copyright Holders / While based on true life events and designed as a study of parochial British cultural and emotional life in the 1980s, this blog is a work of fiction.

Lizzie

down here
in
1983 , as you know. As time went by, Lizzie and Claire went home, whilst Hazel and I stayed in town. Like myself, Hazel intends going to
Scumburger ’s party tonite, so we both went to buy some cider. A weird helmet/ball thing with stick arms and cartoon animal opera gloves. Antennae and big black boots.

From Astra To Hazel
My No.1:
‘Eloise’ – The Damned A very poxy me saying: Hi! Up early today as we had to go to
George ’s because
Betty
and
Freddie
are going to
London
for the day to celebrate their ‘anniversary’. George gave me £4 to spend whilst he and
Jack
went to
Peterborough . Mellow. I stayed behind at
The King Arthur
(my old home, but very different now) and worked on my
Drama Project . Later, I rang
Astra Trellis
to see if she would be going up town. She said yes, so we went into
Wisbech
together, only interrupted and a bit ‘put-off’ by the sudden appearance of
Legs , who eventually decided to go to the dentist (well, not exactly ‘decided’). But, in town, Astra lost a letter that her mum had asked her to post and later got into trouble! As the afternoon went on, we came across
Hazel and Lizzie Church , who we went around with. On the bus ‘home’, I asked Hazel and Lizzie if I could visit them (at their house in
West Walton ) later in the evening. Back at The King Arthur, I watched
Blue Peter
and it inspired me to start thinking about writing a new and modern stage version of
Frankenstein . So I shall! Following some more Drama Project,
Top Of The Pops
and
EastEnders , I went to Hazel’s, where Lizzie crimped my hair. We then wandered the streets and chatted. I realised that I’m getting to know Hazel a lot more at last (but not Lizzie). After being asked to meet them in town tomorrow, I went in to watch
Blackadder II . I also mixed a new theme tune for
The Situation
tapes.

I went to
Freddie ’s ‘yard’ and did the stock take (to no gratitude at all!). He’s beginning to bug me! I like him the least of all my ‘fathers’ (except probably
Paul , who I would like if he wasn’t so stubborn about the whole
Jack
situation).
A squashed-headed hero-type sports a mighty wedge of
Mohawk …
A grinning half face says, ‘FWEELEHH!’
A grinning half-man, half-BMW, face in half-shadow, hair in
Kershaw
mould says ‘KoK!’

A big-eared looker with parted waves of hair and a lifebelt of an ear-ring…
Something half seen, half shadowed spies something high above…
A messy headed worried looking bloke…
Tonight:
Stan Flowers ’s Private Birthday Party for the Select Few. I was late and arrived at about 8pm! Damn and wistak.
People at the party?
Boys:
Stan Flowers, me.
Girls:
Jo & Becky Brownlow
(both ginners),
Janet Joy
( former finger-buddy ),
Pauline Alderton ,
Sharon Jones , and the bee-ootiful (brainiest girl in our year)
Angelene Hawkins !
As the party progressed, they all got drunk, and I only got a little tipsy. The booze wasn’t working on me! Which was a bastard!
So, we played
Strip Poker
and, quite luckily, Angelene lost, which meant we were given special view to her black satin and lace undergarments.
Jolly D . I, too, lost and was left standing in my black, silk ‘bondage’ pants! Following this, we played
Postman’s Knock , where Angelene and I arranged to kiss each other – a lot!
Time went on, and Stan said I could stay the night if I wanted.
Angelene and I went to the pub for some cigarettes. We briefly bumped into
George
(my Mum’s ex-husband),
Elaine
(his new wife),
Daphne
and
Giles . George lent me some money, so Angelene and I were able to stop for a few drinks. We drank
Whiskey Sours , chatting about relationships and why she recently finished with
Cheggers
after a very brief relationship. We discussed boys, girls, emotional maturity, exams, independence and smoking. Upon leaving, Angelene clung onto me, in a locking of arms, and asked me if I’ve ever ‘had it’. I told her ‘Yes’ and explained about
Cheryl Pickering
as well as
BMW . I told her I was ashamed of doing it with Cheryl – and in some ways BMW, too – because it was all immature messing around. I want to do it properly. With a real woman. In a bed. I think I fancy Angelene. And she is fond of me, she says. She brought up the subject of me and
Y-Fronts
fancying her and
Katy Gaynor
in Fourth Year English.
Upon returning, we played more Postman’s Knock and Angelene and I kissed some more.
Then, Freddie + Betty arrived. I asked if I could stay. They said ‘no!’ – spastic fools. So I said goodbye and Angelene saw me off with a kiss!
At home, angered, I came to bed!

'I Still Love You...'
'Kometenmelodie 2' - Kraftwerk
Dried blood everywhere…
Okay, let’s forget the 'Gordon Question' today, huh?
Last night’s dream: Put simply, I did some
lucid dreaming . This is where one can control one’s dreams.
I controlled the women, pal!
Today. What happened?
Oh yes. I received another Valentine’s card. Inside it read:
‘Ritcherd, I still love you xxx’
…and we all know who that’s from.
Yup!
BMW .
Noreen rang later. She begged me to go back out with BMW. I said no, but that I’d think on it. I mean, I don’t think we’ll be apart forever, but I don’t feel ready yet. I need a break. I think things were great when they were great, but at other times I’d be thinking about
Jayne
or
Astra
or just spending time with my friends and I don’t think that’s good for either of us.
Tonight, I received a surprise phone call from
Make-Up . He’s in
Sussex , at his dad’s. Apparently, during
that week he stayed here
(last August), I transformed his music taste! He now possesses
both
Propaganda
LPs and a single – as well as the 12-inch I sold him , oh, and a
Kate Bush
LP.
I told him that if
Flash
doesn’t come, he can come up and stay this week. So. We’ll see. It’s all up to Danyel’s dad!
Say ‘YES’,
Gerald , please!

Valentine's Day, 1986...
'Incantation' - David Sylvian All I dreamt about last night was pleading for
Gordon
to be able to stay at our house. Negative results! We ( Flash
Gordon and I) were going to make a series of
Situation
tapes chronicling his adventures down here. Alas, we might have to cancel that. I’m going to serialise my adventures on tape anyway. Whether things work out or not, I think it’s important to keep a document of this stressful time, so at school, I recorded some of the last lesson of term. So there, mateyboys!

Pontefract , so he’ll have to come down on a train! I rang Flash and the train idea seemed OK to him, but he rang back later after conferring with
Gerry
(his mum) and told me he can’t come unless we pick him up! I told him there was no way this could be done, which is true, because now that
Jack
lives with us we have no excuse for being in Ponty that weekend. Flash got a bit angry with me, because he was under the impression that we were going to pick him up, but I did only say ‘maybe’ when we first discussed him coming down. I mean, if I rang the Gordons and said, ‘Hey! I’m staying for the week, but you need to drive down to
Wisbech
and pick me up’, I’m sure
Gerald
(Flash’s dad) wouldn’t pick me up! I asked why he couldn’t come on the train. He said it was because his mum wouldn’t let him, because his dad wasn’t there to give the go-ahead. Now, readers, if I get touchy and nasty here, it is because I’m depressed and angry; I will not hold myself responsible for anything I might say, so there! Flash’s dad doesn’t really want Flash to come down here because he thinks I’m a bad influence. I’m sure that this will be twisted into the argument and the train situation will be an excuse for them to forbid him to come. Flash actually said he has a fear of public transport. BILLY! Only cos his dad won’t let him go on it, I bet! And if it is a genuine fear, it’s only because he hasn’t had the opportunity to use it! Which is rubbish, anyway, because he always gets the bus to Leeds when he wants! Gerry said she was worried because Flash hadn’t really been anywhere alone on a train before, so they didn’t want to risk it. Well, they should have trained him in the ways of personal independence much earlier! I told Flash they needn’t be so concerned, as I’ve used trains several times. Flash said this makes no difference as I am nearly 16 and he is only just 14, but that’s a load of crap! The last time I used a train, I was 14! Anyway, that’s how our very ‘atmospheric’ conversation ended. Now it’s all up to Gerald to give the train go-ahead. Which I know he won’t! I feel sorry for Flash, really. He’s being smothered and brought up in a sheltered way. He can’t always depend on people to transport him everywhere. Soon, he’s going to have to use a lot more public transport – and now’s as good a time as any! There’s a first time for everything, Danyel! As for me being a bad influence – that’s bullshit! Flash needs to get out of his goody-goody cotton wool ways sometimes – and I know it. I’ve been there and seen him free himself up, and I’ve heard the recordings of him doing it when I’m not even around. If he keeps repressing his personality he could get really screwed up. He could be come depraved and rape people! Naw. But when he gets into the Big Wide World, he’s going to get a shock. He might think I’m a tearaway and that my parents don’t care, but he’d be wrong. My parents care enough to have taught me independence and how things work. I’m not in the driving seat, but I’m experiencing life from the front passenger seat right now. Danyel’s in the back seat – or even the boot! He needs to get into the passenger seat also! Flash is very physically and mentally mature. He is a 14-year-old in the body of a 16-year-old. Or do I mean the other way round? He has the capabilities of a 16-year-old, and I consider him extremely adept. I’m sure his parents do, too. So why must they persist in this smothering? To not use a train service that goes straight through to its destination is a bit strange for someone of Flash’s age (physical or mental!). So come on, Mr + Mrs Gordon – fingers out – let Flash live. There’s got to be a first time. Make him more independent, or I’m going to lose a friend. Oh, I got one Valentine’s card. From Betty... Hah! Hah! Hah!

This Time of Nothing
My No.1: ‘P-Machinery (Beta)’ – Propaganda More dried blood... I’m just going to school and I feel ill and very depressed. Let
Flash
come please. Let
Flash
come please. Let
Flash
come please. No, I didn’t mean COME as in
SPUNK-UP , I meant it as ‘come down to my house’. Please, my mean, nasty, tossing parents! When I ring him tonight I’m going to feel a right bastard! He’ll think we hate him! I’ve got to convince my parents! I’ll do anything. I’ll go without pocket money while he’s down – for two weeks if I have to! We’ll keep out of the way, make our own meals, take the bus when possible… A A AA RGH! Let him come down! Later: ‘Help’ – The Beatles Dried blood in streaks… I’ve just pleaded with
Betty
again. She said NO! Let her say YES and I’ll work like bugger. I’ll never harm anyone or hate anyone again! I have also just ‘prayed’ to
Buddha . I went to school and I was very depressed – and now I think I’m ill. I’m depressed over two major situations: Flash and
BMW . Flash, please come… I’ve been invited to go to a punk gig with
Gary Decan
( Joey ’s brother). I might as well accept, seeing as how Flash won’t be coming. I’ve got to beg. And plead. PLEASE! We’re all going out for tea tonight, and I’m going to have to beg her. PLEASE-PLEASE-PLEASE-PLEASE! I’m dying (not literally) Later: Fucking hell, you Cow! Now I’m angry. Later: Another one of those faces I draw… We came back from tea and I pleaded with Buddha. And I am ill; I’ve got a touch of flu, so I’m off to bed.

Cow! Bitch! Twat!
Later:

Later:

Later:
‘Senses Working Overtime’ – XTC
School was babber today, but at least
Astra
enjoyed my 1985 diary tape – or so she says!
I asked Betty about arrangements for picking
Flash
up. She's now saying he can’t come!
Her excuses:
1.
Freddie
is ill.
2. I’m not exactly pulling my weight.
3. They’re going away for the day next Thurs and I’ve got to go to
The King Arthur
(which I don’t want).
Later:
Fuck

Brown, dried blood smeared all over the page...
Later:
‘Tar’ – Visage
I apologise for my outburst there, but I am angry! Wouldn’t you be? It’s the thing I’ve been waiting ages for and Betty has just screwed it all up!
‘Let him come in the Easter Holidays or Summer Holidays’ she says.
God, you fascist! You said he could come in these holidays and then changed your mind without being honest or direct with me! I’ve been waiting for Flash’s visit for ages! This was going to be the
BiG
holiday, the one where I have a big laugh, drink ‘n’ smoke before I start my exam revision. So I’ve got to suffer the embarrassment of letting Flash down now, and they don’t care!
BASTARDS!
I don’t think he can come in the Easter Holidays because he’ll be revising! And the Summer Holidays is 5 months away and I just can’t wait that long!
Later:
'Ancient Evening' - David Sylvian
I just rang
BMW . And I finished with her. Well, what else could I do? It wasn’t working. I didn’t love her as much as I should; we’d both been getting more and more negative towards each other, and my approach to the relationship really wasn’t helping either. I did regret saying it. I think I still do. I’m not sure. And I couldn’t tell if she was upset or relieved. I don’t know. I’m all mixed-up in a flurry of emotions. I’m crying and I’m sorry about it, okay?
FineFineFineFine!
Look, my parents, I’m in a depressed phase! Let Flash come or I’ll kill you both…
Please…

Under Pressure
‘Under Pressure’ – Queen & Bowie Gosh! I’m absolutely pissed off right now. My parents are really making life hard for me. I’m sure they don’t want
Flash
to come down here in the holidays for some reason. There are now conditions attached to his coming to stay, and these are that I should ‘behave’ and ‘help around the house’. BILLY! What pointless nonsense. Whenever they tell me to do something, I do it. What choice do I have? So why bother pointing it up like this? It's not like I don't already have a routine of chores I have to regularly fulfill. They are making things positively hard for me.

lets him come.
I bet it gets called off!

A Valentine for Jayne
‘Hard Days Night’ – The Beatles
Yes! It snowed today! Skill!
Today, I went round
Wisbech
with
Astra
and
Lizzie and Hazel Church . It was just like
the old days, when I first moved to
The King Arthur
(but without
Claire Stubbs
and hilarious laughter at
Adam Ant
dressed as a Cat ). Eventually
Jazz Thompson
and
Legs
joined us.
I also saw
BMW , but pretended not to and deliberately avoided her!
Oh, and Jazz shoplifted two
Japan
albums (on cassette) from
Woolworth 's . I had no idea he had done this, but when we got back to
Blackberry Narrow
he gave them to me 'for being a good mate'. I didn't know quite what to say, but I'm chuffed to have them:
Adolescent Sex
and
Quiet Life .
Tonight, Jazz, Legs,
Joey
and I went round Wisbech. We got cider from
BLACKFRIAR’S Off Licence
and got drunk near
Jayne ’s. I delivered a
Valentine’s card
to Jayne’s house. She wasn’t in, but her brother said he’d give it to her (he’d better do!).
The card said:
‘This is to remind you that one year ago our love blossomed. This is to tell you of my love, which shall never die. You know who I am, so talk to me some time,
One Time Comic Reader
X’
We had a laugh, but I’m happy to get home to bed!

About Me
Ritcherd Winterfood
It's 1990: I am 20. I moved to East Anglia (Wisbech) from West Yorkshire seven years ago.
I live in a bungalow (often with my brother Jack) which is owned by Betty (my Mum) and Freddie (her boyfriend), both of whom live down the road with Chip (my baby brother).
I have had three Dads (Jon, Paul and George).
My best friend is called Flash Gordon ... really!
My other best friends are Johnny Badcock, Elbow, Stan, Donna Davidson, and Astra Trellis.
I am single, but I like Beatrice Miranda Wasp, Mary-Jane Ferguson, Lilith MacMillan, and Amy Neat.
I love Doctor Who, Marvel comics, cult TV, old movies and music: prog, rock, punk, house, goth, and a hell of a lot more.
I have recently graduated my study of Performing Arts at Norfolk College of Arts and Technology, King's Lynn, where I won the 1988 Drama Prize, directed two respected plays, and passed my course with Distinction.
Now I need to find a career in theatre.
I'm sometimes known as 'Jez DeCarlo' - usually when I drink in The Angel.
This blog was intended to cover the late 1980s, but will extend to the end of 1990 to see what that's all about.
