25 Years Too Late...: Under Pressure
25 Years Too Late...
The explicit, confessional daily diary of 1980s teenager Ritcherd Winterfood: would-be lover, music fiend, comic reader and Doctor Who fan...

Under Pressure
‘Under Pressure’ – Queen & Bowie Gosh! I’m absolutely pissed off right now. My parents are really making life hard for me. I’m sure they don’t want
Flash
to come down here in the holidays for some reason. There are now conditions attached to his coming to stay, and these are that I should ‘behave’ and ‘help around the house’. BILLY! What pointless nonsense. Whenever they tell me to do something, I do it. What choice do I have? So why bother pointing it up like this? It's not like I don't already have a routine of chores I have to regularly fulfill. They are making things positively hard for me.
Cacker. Tonight, I transferred the 1st volume of
my 1985 diary
onto cassette for

About Me
Ritcherd Winterfood
It's 1990: I am 20. I moved to East Anglia (Wisbech) from West Yorkshire seven years ago.
I live in a bungalow (often with my brother Jack) which is owned by Betty (my Mum) and Freddie (her boyfriend), both of whom live down the road with Chip (my baby brother).
I have had three Dads (Jon, Paul and George).
My best friend is called Flash Gordon ... really!
My other best friends are Johnny Badcock, Elbow, Stan, Donna Davidson, and Astra Trellis.
I am single, but I like Beatrice Miranda Wasp, Mary-Jane Ferguson, Lilith MacMillan, and Amy Neat.
I love Doctor Who, Marvel comics, cult TV, old movies and music: prog, rock, punk, house, goth, and a hell of a lot more.
I have recently graduated my study of Performing Arts at Norfolk College of Arts and Technology, King's Lynn, where I won the 1988 Drama Prize, directed two respected plays, and passed my course with Distinction.
Now I need to find a career in theatre.
I'm sometimes known as 'Jez DeCarlo' - usually when I drink in The Angel.
This blog was intended to cover the late 1980s, but will extend to the end of 1990 to see what that's all about.
Updated: 11th June 1990.
