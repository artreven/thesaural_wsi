Mixing Drinks - Double Happiness
Mixing Drinks - Double Happiness
A bit blurry, but you still get the idea of the bar area :)
We tried the martini cocktails (AUD15), which we could have easily made at home! I don't think any of them had
Martini
in it!
- lychee martini - nice, but it only had vodka, a tinned lychee and its syrup
- plum martini - Japanese
umeshu
and vodka with a plum from the umeshu.
- chilli martini - chilli infused vodka
