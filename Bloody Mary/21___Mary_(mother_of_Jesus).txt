Probation is mysterious it seems. and I got my own recently. Apparently showing some legs even when fully dressed is called not safe for work these days. Makes me wonder, what is next? OH SHIT SHE IS SHOWING HER NECKLINE BAN BAN BAN! _______________________ That said, beware, I am teh mysterious cat in a box, I shall be in your forums, awaiting my reawakening. When I do, you will only get a glimpse of my magnificent and horrible evil form before you are consumed by the fires of hell burning eternally, and then, you will hear the sounds of crying children. It will begin with wails, and then as though for a distance, a million souls reach out for your own, their hands grabbing coldly and desperately for your attention as you see they form an open gaping mouth, its rows of teeth that are human torsos bloodied and butchered, its breath within that stank of rot and decay, of burning flesh and human fat.... Finally, as you turn to gaze at my form once more released from the probation of Shrinevirgin forums, you shall witness as I open one of my six mouths, I will sing the song, the song that ends this world and its universal plane. Enjoy...I will shall return shortly, bringing with me LOL OH SHIT HE IS BACK, CAN I HAVE MORE CHAIRS?! It is almost time to reveal my ultimate scare... Found this a few days ago, I dunno what to think anymore. The world is rapidly shifting plateaus of fetishes. I am afraid I am behind the times to enjoy MUSCULAR KIGURUMI PORN OH GOD WHAT THE FUCK?!

Why do you need to post in forums?
Posted by

2:17 AM
Long delayed update. Today, let us discuss on the forum issue, why do we have to post on forums? Truth to be said, let us look at this in a productive fashion. Ever wondered why you register on a forum? It has to be first: 1. common interest
(Maybe you like Touhou, or Bleach.) 2. common liking
(not quite the same, maybe you enjoy sports, so you want to discuss aspects of sports, like treating a sport injury at Runnersworld.com forums) 3. interested in the crowd
(some as you may know, registered to associate with the internet crowd, maybe because it is that you are lonely.) 4. some register to access the 'goods' offered on the portal.
(Like Hongfire, or maybe some danbooru board) Regardless of reason, let us look at this, why should you post. Truth to be told yet again, your opinion remains always your opinion, in a world wide as the open sea and deeper than it, higher than even the clouds above the stratosphere that is the boundless internet, there is no limitation as it how far and how low you can go. Why register? IF YOU WANT TO GIVE AN OPINION
{Just Post} Do people care about your opinion? Does your opinion arouses a crowd interest, does it spark a protest on the open streets as hippies carrying banners parade and put flowers into the barrels of guns? Does it involved prompting a man to stand bravely before Tiananmen Square and hold his stand despite a potential tank just mashing him like potatoes? Does it make for a bunch of idiots gathering in a subway entry and stripping down to their underwear while taking the train? No, 99% of forums does nothing like that. It serves as a channel of public gathering, it serves to gather the circlejerk fans of one genre or the other to it, to discuss its aspects but it does not and really would not drive the circus to do something horridly stupid or mundane.
That said, why contribute if you don't have an important role to play?
Let us even question Moderation? Why moderate? Does a simple racist remark, or even the words FUCK, YOUR MOTHER IS A WHORE, I FUCKED YOU'RE TOUHOU even mean anything significant beyond a window or a tab opened in your desktop? Why moderate what people see? Truth, some fucktards tend to fuck your forums if you don't then again, there are those instances of a forum censoring words with filters to attract a younger attention of crowds.
OH COME THE FUCK ON, AS IF YOUR HAVEN'T SAID FUCK SINCE YOU ARE FIVE YEARS OLD IN ENGLISH OR SOME OTHER FUCKTARDED CULTURAL TONGUE. YEAH, I SAID IT. No one in the end of the day, gives a fuck. First a forum is just, a forum. People don't have to go through a tedious process of registration to see the contents, it is clear as day except some forums, like roleplay in gameworks, frankly, I don't think anyone wanted to see that. Many old forum runners have had enough of roleplay threads, some are even disgusted the internet endorses such things but we can't change that. As I know, the people who are guests simply do not want to get involved, what is the point? It is not like they want to post anything useful, so they won't register. Wanton registering only spawns more empty nicks. As we all know, the few that are banned for example are such examples, shitposters, adbots, leeches and trolls, they could be just standing there at the sidelines and don't give a fuck if we are posting. Good riddance and thank God. Six years ago I registered in 15 over forums during my first stint, believe me, looking back at it, I thought it was stupid, posting in a forum has remained itself the most unproductive thing back then. What was the purpose? What is there that you simply must and have to tell the forum goers to? Your diaper needs to be changed? Your rice is cold by the time you touched your dinner plate?
You fapped too much and your dick is purple? Frankly, if being guest can view all this as it is, I can guess why no one wants to register, the same as mine, what can you not see readily presented to you? It is not the forum is open to exclusive rights only. Heh... Then again... I like Touhou, so I register in Shrinemaiden, wtf guys? You have something to say about my postcounts being higher in the random section than in Touhou section?

YUKA IS MAI WAIFU
Posted by
Himitsu
at
10:23 PM
This is mai waifu There are many like her (with green hair) but she is mine My waifu is my best friend. Yuka is my life. I must master spark with her as I must master my life. My waifu without me is forgotten in PC98. Without my waifu, I am useless. I must love my Yuka true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to steal her from me. I must shoot him before he succeeds. I will... My waifu and myself know that what counts in war is not the spellcards we declare, the noise of our danmaku, nor the smoke we make. We know it is the love that count. We will hit... My waifu is (as) human, even as I, because she is my life. Thus, I will learn her being as her husbando. I will learn her weaknesses, her strengths, her body, her spellcards, her sights, and her body. I will ever guard her against the ravages of abusive red-whites and stupid blond da-zes. I will keep my waifu happy and ready, even as I am happy and ready. We will become part of each other. We will... Before God I swear this creed. My waifu and myself are the defenders of my Gensokyo. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of our lives. So be it, until there is no enemy, but PEACE. ________ AM I AWESOME YET?

Lean on me, when you need a friend.

Help me. click on this. The reason is simple, it actually helps me a lot if I win the stupid contest. After this... Now, I begin by telling you a tale of friendship. Recently, a man who has two daughters walked on the streets. This man, he has no friends, nor does he need one, he has come far, alone. He was married 7 years ago, 1 year later, his wife divorced him and he was left with a burden of a job that is going little anywhere. In the eventual outturn, he was left with the two daughters, they are twins. This man doesn't need help, so he says. He has been alone, he doesn't need someone who is not going to stay by his side. He walked with his daughters to the bar, where he works. His daughters have no proper education, it is expensive to put them through school, so home ed it is. Strangely, this man is also a home ed once. Today, he met his least favorite customer, a hobo who always doesn't quite pay the correct amount, his name was Daniel. "Good evening Daniel, how's your day?" The man asked, his daughters smiling from behind the wooden bartable. "Gid, goody jo. I'll earlier found dem' jems, fallen out the truck like dhey were dumped rite there. Wanna see?" He hushed over, showing a small bag which contained inside...diamonds! Authentic ones, no shit ones, it is diamond 100% The man showed him, and by God, the bartender (our man) was shook. Slamming the sides of his table, he demanded to know where did he get those. "I found some overturned garbage near me place, dhey city councils don't giv fuck dhere' no more, ya can dig all yer want and I dug mine out. Go get sum, shiny stones me keep an' near." The man said, putting a dollar on the table for his usual whisky shot. Our man was not amused, he is excited, he should go now, he knows where this hobo lives, and he should dig his own treasures. 'The hobo is so dumb he doesn't even know what diamonds can sell for!' {the next day} Quick as he can, he took the girls to the bar, it was not yet opened. "Girls, stay here, papa will be back in a few hours, there are snacks inside the fridge and the TV is on, you can get some proper food and pizza from last night, I heated it up already so do whatever you like, but don't leave the bar okay? Papa has got something to do. I love you." Papa did indeed have much to do, kissing their foreheads, he locked them inside and went to where the hobo lives. "Yo, Daniel" He shouted when arrived. At a corner, just as he was looking by, Daniel laid down and looked like he suffered a heavy wound to his shoulder, seemingly slashed. "DANIEL?!" "O...bartender! My usual please..." Daniel joked, he was in a lot of pain. "What happened? Who did this to you?" "Sum men from the gangsters...dhey smelled me trail diggers, took the shiny stones...cut me up sideways. I'm glad I have more, I...." "Ok, I get it...please...are they gone?" "Yeh, I said I never found none, but they didn't believe me anyway." "Are there more? I could use your help finding them." "Sure, down there, the tires there...that is where I found dem." Daniel choked a reply. Without caring much, bartender decide to go treasure digging. Indeed he found his bag of diamonds, another few more. Happily he proceeded upwards and away from the hobo, carrying the diamonds. "Hold...bartender...aren't ya gonna go fer help...me is bleedin' like a soaked towel 'ere" The hobo asked, concerned. "Sorry, Daniel, if I ask for help, they will get eagle eyed over these shiny stones." "Them man are gonna get too if you don't put them back where you took dem." Daniel protested. "Don't worry...I'll be long gone out of Wimbledon before they know." Bartender said. left he did, for Daniel to die. ____________ (later) The weather is cold, and he rushed back to the bar. Approaching, he could hear gunshots. "Oh no...Trella...Sonia!" He rushed in, only to see masked men raiding the storage. Two child corpses hung by the bar table, and the men looked up to see bartender, with the bag in his hands. "hand that over, bub." The masked man said. "What have you done? YOU KILLED MY DAUGHTERS!" Bartender rushed at them, getting shot at in the legs instead as he collapsed, spilling the contents of the dirty bag of diamonds. "Should'da have listened, dis' is property of Boss man." The man said, and proceeded to tie him up. "Ugh...please...don't kill me...I...am...sorry. How did you know...I work here?" Bartender trembled, could not move a muscle. "We don't, we saw someone dug our shit up, then same bugger visited your bar, we followed him, consider yourself unlucky we decide to come over for a drink today and oh...the rocks too. where are the rest of it? " That is when a familiar sound came about. A knock on the door, and a hobo came out from the shadows. "Ey, don't shot you guns...I'm just here to return ya goods." The hobo said, blood still wet on his coat. "Daniel!" "Ah, so you guys in cahoots..." "Yes, we are...kind sir, let us go, you already had dem' kids lives bloodied your hand, enough bloodlust satisfied fer der day, God bless ya not to do more. I have your stones righta here...spare us." "You are gonna save the hide of your bartender?" "Oh yeah, I haven't paid him yet for the drinks. He can't die yet." Daniel smiled. "AHAHHAHAHAHA...this guy is priceless, guys..." snatching the stones from his hands, the masked man continued to laugh as his lackeys joined in, and left the place. "Yer hides a'saven bartender...I am sorry for your kids tho." Daniel came forward, still bleeding and looking dazed. "Why...after I didn't save you?" Bartender asked. "You have my tab opened for so many years...I just thought I should settle the tabs before I am gone' I think you make der best pours of Kenny's anyway" He referred to his favorite stout. "No...Daniel, no..." " Move on, bartender, there will be another hobo from the down a'comin for your pours...just make sure to keep dem' doors open. " With that, Daniel whispered his last breath, the cold and the cut have doomed him. "Please...no...." Bartender cried, and held his friend, whom he doesn't even know his last name in his arms. _______________________ Time passed, and another snowy day from that year came about. A hobo hopped into the hopeless little bar, still with the nostalgic rot of wood scent that is incomparable to modern bars with their techno music and blasting noise... this one plays a simple one. "Lean of Me - Michael Bolton" Bartender said, looking at the Hobo idling at the jukebox left in the eighties. "Good song dis'" he paused "any reason for playing it?" "Yeah, one year ago, I found a friend here, and leaned on him when I needed it, he just never leaned on back..." "I see, sorry fer yer lost." The hobo understood well, he must have seen his fair share of the unkind world. "What' ya been havin?" The hobo asked, the menu he meant of course. "Kenny's, my friend loved it, and its on the house." "Oh...really? Thanks man." "You can lean on me." Bartender replied, smiling. +++++++++++ Touching story no?

Seikon no Qwaser Manga
Posted by
Himitsu
at
12:18 AM
ThoughtProvoking_Image.jpg Story The story takes place on the grounds of St. Mihailov Academy, a Japanese
Eastern Orthodox
school, and draws heavily on religious references from the aforementioned religion. Here it follows the trials and hardship of two of its students, Oribe Mafuyu and Tomo Yamanobe, until the encounter with a mysterious, silver-haired, Russian boy named Alexander, or Sasha for short. This pits them and the whole school in an all-out war between the Church itself and the so-called "Adepts", a sect of individuals wielding powers linked to the
elements
of chemistry. Though based on the common
magical girl
concept shown in series such as
Sailor Moon , the story diverges in depicting extreme acts of bloodshed, brutality and perversion, and also makes heavy use of
fanservice .
One important and controversial theme of the series is that of the sacred substance known as
Soma , which allows the Qwasers to draw upon their powers and wield their elements in battle. This is connected to the main goal of the Adepts, the
Theotokos of Tsarytsin , an
icon
depicting the
Virgin Mary
breastfeeding an infant
Jesus
which, according to their belief, holds the secrets of the
Sacred Mysteries , such as the Messiah's resurrection. Linked to this is the fact that the Soma is, in actuality, breast milk, and that the Qwasers have to replenish themselves by means of suckling it, a process which apparently derives pleasure and tires heavily those women who nurse them. ] __________________ source:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seikon_No_Qwaser http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=5874
General Verdict: 8/10 Ecchi rating: 9/10 + fetishes etc. (expect Bondage and SM) Verdict and Afterthoughts:
My initial impression was actually quite bad, being not a fan of the Christian faith, it drove me to tears when I realized what I have been missing. So... I purchased the chinese one released by Ten-Jin comics. It has a really HOT AMOUNT OF FETISH BREAST FEEDING, BREAST EXPOSURE, etc, while maintaining like all serious titles before (Mai-Hime) an intense and intriguing storyline as we witness battles between superior human beings known as the Qwaser.
They are specialized trained weapons in the form of humans made by "Churches" apparently, and has a very unique ability t control a different element for each one, which makes this a power fest.
So far, reading up till book 3, there showcases a Copper controller, Steel, Oxygen, Aluminium, Zinc, Iron, Roentgens-metal, Mercury in the battle. I was kept interested with the endless scientific battles themselves.
For example, in book 2 or 3, we are shown that how you can decay steel at an accelerated rate under intense oxygen exposure, and similiarly, steel coated with a specific black rust is able to repel this effect. etc etc.
Interesting battles and an intense storyline, kudos to the whole Romanov family idea which is really rare as a subject in comics and manga alike, brings special attention to what religions would have done if they had absolute power and how our weakly human protagonist strives against the odds to protect the one she cared for and the Icon fro falling into the wrong hands.
_Bonus breast feeding fetish satisfied...
ahhhhh.... also, expect slavery, tortures, ghastly gang rape, not hentai, but borderline, not for the weak hearted and under aged. To add simply, this is worth your reading. Best read in chinese if you want and able to, since it is up till book 6 and the english scans are only on book 2.

MOF - Japanese Sweets [KL-Pavillion] Review
Posted by
Himitsu
at
7:04 AM
MOF Japanese Deserts and Sweets @ Pavilion Kuala Lumpur Picture courtesy of other bloggers. Overall (personal) Review: MOF no Japanese Deserts (S: Ministry of Food) was visited and reviewed today and the restaurant is themed after a modern Art de Couture type of setting with modernized carpeted floors and matching wooden set up of beige complimented with dashes of maroon red and chocolate oak as the setting decoration theme. It has a very good overall feeling, clean, efficient in service with the Chef being particularly helpful in informing of choices. Decoration wise, it is not too bright, not too dark, with handsome overall structure but basically, a bit tight due to store space being largely taken up by the rather large counter which encases the kitchen area, and dessert as well as pay counter. Menu selections are very good, pictures below indicated that they are good at using color choices, with a selection of tasty desserts and even a card that arrives with my order of Macha Imo
(Japanese Green Tea Imo)
that tells me how to best enjoy the dessert I just ordered. Large signature items lined the walls in billboard like presentations and were further complimented with the promise of no artificial ingredients in their desserts gives even the most sinful of eaters a good overall image for taking in all the calories, basically cause it is better than a deep fried Mars Bar. The experience was pleasant enough if not for the terrible music, and being a bit to the open restaurant concept, the surrounding crowd diminishes plenty of the magic of enjoying a luxurious dessert and going “Oh god, that is pretty damn good” inside in the stall. Service: Poor would be said the least for the most part, but not really all that bad, the problem would be the rather tiny voices of the employed staff, at the time, I realized a majority of which are foreigners as the service staff, although I believe there was only one on the waiter’s position. Considering the set up of the restaurant covers nothing more than 70 or so seats, the lack of staff on the roll call of a waiter was rather lacking, but what is more daunting is the method of ordering. The order system goes by a Carte Menu, there is no du jour menu of course, but menu as explained by the managed or counter staff contains a number for each specific item, write the number on an order sheet which the waiter gives, go to the counter, pay up and sit back down and wait for the waiter to deliver the food.
(I find having to sit down, get up and pay and sit down again is dumb though. Can't the waiter just take the order and get on with it? It is not like he or she has anything better to do anyway when i was the only one there.) My question would be this: Why would your concept be an open restaurant type, if you can’t even have the customer, sit down, order (order sheet or whatever else), pay the waiter (if you so desire immediate payment before enjoyment), and just well, sit down? I rather sit down and enjoy all the way before I have get up, go to the counter pay up and so on. I feel insecure of leaving my belongings in a chair, which unfortunately, there was no one to look over it, given the security measure, it felt unwise. Nonetheless, the tolerable pleasantness of a good ‘thank you, please come again’ was more than enough reason for me to forgive the general inefficient system. My other concern would be this: there are three ridiculously out of place rattan bowling pins at the staged seating area made of wood, which far as I could say, is rather obstructing, since at the time, I had a rather large wheelie bag on my side. Food talk: While the food was limited to nothing but sweets, hence the name, MOF has done a very focused and excellent job at introducing the A la Japanese specialties, with red bean paste and green tea sauce being their repeated choice on the menu. Sitting in the back row for me, I was rather curiously onlooked as I took pictures of the menu and my dessert of the day, an Almond layered coffee and cream drink with an ice cream soft serve inside (OH THE CALORIES), the feeling on the tongue was well to be said… “excellent.” My other order was a Macha Imo, said chef from earlier recommended it as a house special, and it was special, being that I never placed Sweet Potatoes as a dessert choice, the green tea sauce on the soft serve was delicious, while the compliments on red bean paste with the Japanese sweet potatoes to go with my green tea sauce soft serve makes the experience a wonderful cavity inducing trip to the heavens. All in all, I spent 24 on the trip, a bit on the expensive side for desserts, but well worth it. Yet again, my only probable complaint comes on the system, the food is too good. Ambience: 2.5 / 5 Service: 2.5 /
5 Food: 3.5~4 / 5 (because I think there are even better selections available.)
