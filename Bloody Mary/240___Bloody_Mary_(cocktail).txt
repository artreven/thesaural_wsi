Bring'in home the Bacon! Bacon Cocktails?
Unbelievable - but true - you can make your OWN Bacon Flavored Vodka! Fat Washing Process for Bacon-Infused Liquor
Fat washing process for bacon-infused Vodka
Fat washing
is a method used to instill the flavor of a fatty substance, such as
bacon
or
ham , into
liquor . The meat is added to liquor and
infused
for a time, then the liquid is chilled and the fatty portion, which floats to the top, is then removed.
Alcohol
bonds to
fat
and
sugars
easily and
fat washing
is fairly simple. Though keep in mind that
low-sodium bacon
doesn’t work as well. When executed properly,
fat washing
leaves behind the taste of the
bacon , but doesn’t retain a greasy taste or texture.
Here is a step by step
fat washing process for bacon-infused liquor :
Bacon Fat Washing
Ingredients: 5 Thick Slices of
Applewood Smoked Bacon .
1 750 ml bottle of the
liquor
of your choice (recommend
rum ,
bourbon
or
vodka ).
Preparation: 1.   Cook the bacon in the oven until it is crispy on the outsides but still chewy in the center. 2.   Place
cooked bacon in a large glass jar (that can be sealed air-tight) with
two 750 ml bottles of liquor and allow it to infuse for 24-36 hours (no
more than 72 hours) at room temperature.
3.   Remove the bacon and then place the jar in the freezer until the bacon fat solidifies at the top. 4.   Using a cheese cloth or paper coffee filter, strain the fat from the liquor. 5.   Repeat the freezer step if needed and strain again. 6.   Refrigerate until ready for use.
The Bloody Hogger
The Bloody Heffer, a classic take on a Bloody Mary
The
Bloody Hogger
is a spin on the classic
cocktail ,  Bloody Mary   . With the incorporation of

bacon lover
and you enjoy a
Bloody Mary
now and then - you're going to really like this
bacon-infused
Bloody Mary recipe .
Once you try the
Bloody Hogger , you’ll never want to go back to the old classic.
