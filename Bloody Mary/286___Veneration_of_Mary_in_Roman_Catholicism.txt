I needed to construct a
rosary
for a recent assignment from the
Holy Childhood Association . I found a nice close-up of the part of a rosary known as the
center
or
centerpiece , which contained an image of the
Sacred Heart of Jesus . I needed
to substitute an image of the
Virgin Mary . Here are the
Before
and
After
images.
Scroll down
to see how I made the change.
I began with a
color photo
of a statue of the
Virgin Mary . I clipped it out with
Photoshop’s Pen
tool,
desaturated
the image, then applied a white to black
gradient
at low opacity from top to bottom, to give the image some extra contrast.
Photoshop
does
have a
Sketch>Chrome
filter, but I found it next to useless. I used the
Curves
adjustment tool instead. There’s no “right answer” in this case. One has to experiment with configurations that resemble the one shown below.
Applying
Curves
a
second
time really boosts the chrome effect. After applying
Curves ,
I used the
Burn
tool around the edges to add a bit more contrast. You can see how the main folds are a bit darker in the image on the right below.
Next I
copied and pasted
the chromed image into the rosary centerpiece image, placing it on a
separate layer
beneath
the centerpiece. Then I scaled it down and rotated it into position.
I applied a
Layer Mask
to the top image, then
selected
the innermost image area of the centerpiece. Using color Black and a
soft airbrush
at
low opacity , I brushed away the selected portion of the mask to reveal the
Mary
image underneath.
Final steps : I applied a 2-pixel
Gaussian Blur
to the
Mary
image, used the
Burn
tool to darken it a bit, applied the
Texture>Grain
filter, Type =
Contrasty , and used a soft brush at reduced opacity to add a few
spot touches of blue and green.
Here’s a close-up compare of the
Before
and
After
images:

Very cool I would have never though of using the curve to get the effect you did. Ill keep that in mind next time I’m working on something like this.

Yes, certainly one of the more obscure Photoshop tricks, and one I just learned myself. Glad you found it helpful, sir– keep clickin’ that shutter!

I have so much to learn but your instructions are excellent. I have now bought a tutorial on photoshop so with that and your excercises I may eventually achieve something! Many thanks.

Thanks so much for your kind support, Ann. Photoshop’s one of those programs where there’s always more to learn. Somedays I feel I’ve barely scratched the surface myself. Take your time– you’ll get there!

Nice tutorial, Mark.
I just wrote a post on The Magic of Photoshop earlier this week with examples of some of the creative things you can do with Photoshop.
Take a peek if you get a chance.
Love that I have a new source of knowledge to learn from when I come here!
Thanks for sharing.

I’ve often seen a finished piece myself and wondered how the heck it was done… : (
Happy to give you a peek behind the scenes, and glad you found it helpful. Thanks for stopping by!
