Jesus
Wiki
Jesus of Nazareth
( c.
5 BC/BCE –
c.
30 AD/CE), [ 3 ]
also known as
Jesus Christ
or simply
Jesus , is the
central figure of
Christianity , which views him as the
Messiah
foretold in the
Old Testament , with most
Christian denominations
believing him
to be the
Son of God
and
God incarnate
who was raised from
the dead. [ 6 ]
Islam
and the
Baha'i Faith
consider
Jesus
a
prophet
and also the Messiah. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
The principal sources of information regarding Jesus' life and
teachings are the four
canonical gospels , especially the
Synoptic Gospels , [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
though some scholars believe texts such as the
Gospel of Thomas
are also relevant. [ 11 ]
Most
critical scholars in biblical studies
believe that some parts of the
New
Testament
are useful for reconstructing Jesus' life, [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
agreeing that Jesus was a
Jew
who was regarded as a teacher
and
healer , that he was
baptized
by
John the Baptist , and was
crucified
in
Jerusalem
on the orders of the
Roman Prefect
of
Judaea ,
Pontius Pilate , on the charge of
sedition
against the
Roman Empire . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ]
Aside from these few conclusions, academic debate continues regarding
the chronology, the central message of Jesus' preaching, his social
class, cultural environment, and religious orientation. [ 11 ]
Critical scholars have offered competing descriptions of Jesus as a
self-described Messiah, as the leader of an apocalyptic movement, as an
itinerant sage, as a charismatic healer, and as the founder of an
independent religious movement. Most contemporary scholars of the
historical Jesus consider him to have been an independent, charismatic
founder of a Jewish restoration movement, anticipating an imminent
apocalypse. [ 28 ]
Other prominent scholars, however, contend that Jesus' " Kingdom of God " meant radical personal and social
transformation instead of a future apocalypse. [ 28 ]
Christians predominantly believe that Jesus is the " Son of
God " (generally meaning that he is
God
the Son , the second person in the
Trinity )
who came to provide humankind with
salvation
and
reconciliation
with
God
by
his death for their
sins . [ 29 ] :568-603
Christians traditionally believe that Jesus was
born of a virgin , [ 29 ] :529-532
performed
miracles , [ 29 ] :358-359
founded
the Church, rose from the dead, and
ascended
into
Heaven , [ 29 ] :616-620
from
which he
will return . [ 29 ] :1091-1109
While
the doctrine of the Trinity is accepted by most Christians, a few groups
reject the doctrine of the Trinity , wholly
or partly, as non-scriptural. [ 30 ]
Most Christian scholars today present Jesus as the awaited Messiah [ 31 ]
and as God.
Judaism
rejects Jesus'
prophethood , arguing that he did not fulfill the
Messianic prophecies
in the
Tanakh [ 32 ]
whereas in
Islam ,
Jesus ( Arabic :
عيسى ‎,
commonly transliterated as
Isa ) is considered one of
God's
important
prophets , [ 33 ] [ 34 ]
a bringer of
scripture ,
the product of a virgin birth, and a worker of miracles. Jesus is also
called "Messiah," but Islam does not teach that he was divine.
Islam teaches
that Jesus
ascended bodily to heaven without experiencing the crucifixion and
resurrection, [ 35 ]
rather than the traditional Christian belief of the
death
and
resurrection of Jesus . Etymology
See also:
Yeshua
"Jesus" (pronounced
/ˈdʒiːzəs/ ) is a
transliteration , occurring in a number of
languages and based on the Latin
Iesus , of the Greek
Ἰησοῦς
( Iēsoûs ), itself a
Hellenisation
of the
Hebrew
יְהוֹשֻׁעַ
( Yĕhōšuă‘ ,
Joshua )
or Hebrew- Aramaic
יֵשׁוּעַ
( Yēšûă‘ ), meaning " Yahweh
delivers (or rescues)". [ 36 ] [ 37 ]
" Christ "
(pronounced
/ˈkraɪst/ ) is a title
derived from the Greek
Χριστός
( Christós ), meaning the
"Anointed One", a translation of the Hebrew מָשִׁיחַ ( Messiah ). [ 38 ] [ 39 ] :274-275
A
"Messiah," in this context, is a king anointed at God's direction or
with God's approval, and Christians identify Jesus as the
one foretold by Hebrew prophets .
Chronology

Pierre Mignard , 1640

Chronology of Jesus
See also:
Nativity of Jesus ,
Star of Bethlehem ,
1 BC , and
Year zero
Possible year
of birth
Scholars generally conclude that Jesus was born sometime between 7-2
BC / BCE
and died sometime between 26-36
AD / CE . [ 40 ] [ 41 ]
There is no contemporary historical evidence demonstrating the date
of
Jesus' birth . The common
Gregorian calendar
method for numbering years, in which
the current year is 2010, is based on an
early
medieval attempt
to count the years from a point of reference —
namely, Jesus' birth — which
Dionysius Exiguus
placed, either mistakenly or
intentionally, sometime between 2 BC/BCE and 1 AD/CE. [ 42 ]
The
Gospel of Matthew
states Jesus' birth
occurred during the reign of
Herod the Great , who died in 4 BC/BCE, [ 43 ]
but also with the intimation that Jesus may have been as much as two
years old when Herod ordered the
Massacre of the Innocents , and
therefore that he may have been even older at the time of Herod's death.
The
Gospel of Luke
similarly points to Jesus' birth as having
occurred during the reign of Herod the Great ( i.e. , sometime
between 37 and 4 BC/BCE), but the author of Luke also describes the
birth as taking place during the
first census
of the Roman provinces of
Syria
and
Iudaea , which is generally believed to
have occurred in 6 AD/CE. [ 44 ]
Most scholars generally assume a date of birth between 6 and 4 BC/BCE. [ 45 ]
The historical incompatibility of Luke's chronology for the birth of
Jesus, as well as the silence of the
Pauline Epistles
and the Gospels of
Mark and John with respect to the nativity, have been suggested as
evidence that the birth traditions contained in Matthew and Luke are
historically unverifiable or even possibly fictitious. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ]
The earliest evidence of celebration of Jesus' birth on December 25
is found in the year 354 in Rome. It was only later that the December 25
celebration was adopted in the East, with the exception of
Armenia ,
where his birth is celebrated on January 6. [ 52 ]
Indeed, there is no month of the year to which respectable authorities
have not assigned his birth. [ 52 ]
Ministry
Jesus' ministry , which according to the
Gospel of Luke began when Jesus was "about 30 years of age", [ 53 ]
followed that of
John the Baptist , [ 54 ]
whose ministry is said to have begun "in the fifteenth year of the
reign of Tiberius Caesar", [ Lk. 3:1–2 ]
which
would be about 28 or 29 AD/CE. [ 55 ]
According to the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus' ministry lasted approximately
one year, whereas the
Gospel of John
implies that his ministry may have lasted
approximately three years. [ 56 ]
Thus, the earliest generally accepted date for the crucifixion is 29
AD/CE ( i.e. , the 15th year of Tiberius' reign plus one year for
Jesus' ministry), and the latest is 36 AD/CE ( i.e. , the final
year of Pontius Pilate's prefecture).
Possible year
of death
According to each of the four canonical New Testament gospels, the
death of Jesus occurred during the prefecture of Pontius Pilate, the
Roman prefect who governed Judaea from 26 to 36 AD/CE. No known
historical records written contemporaneously with this period record
Jesus' execution under Pilate, however, which, when taken in tandem with
the supernatural claims made in the gospels, has led scholars to
question the historicity of the Gospel portrayals of Jesus' death (see
Historicity of Jesus ). However, the
late first century Jewish historian
Josephus , [ 57 ]
writing in
The Antiquities
of the Jews
( c.
93 AD/CE), and the early second century
Roman historian
Tacitus , [ 58 ]
writing in
The Annals
( c.
116
AD/CE), also state that Pilate ordered the execution of Jesus, though
each writer incorrectly gives him the title of "procurator" instead of
prefect. [ 59 ]
The authenticity of these two passages, however, is disputed by
scholars (see
Josephus on Jesus
and
Tacitus on Christ ). Even if authentic, scholars and
historians disagree over whether these passages demonstrate that
Josephus and Tacitus were recording what they knew to be verifiable
historical events, or if they were merely recording what had, by the end
of the first century, become popular Christian legends that the authors
mistakenly assumed were historical facts. [ 47 ]
Writing in the late second century, the early church father
Irenaeus
records in his
Against
Heresies
( c.
180 AD/CE) that he believed Jesus lived to
be approximately 50 years of age. [ 60 ]
According to Irenaeus, the author of the Gospel of John implies that
Jesus was close to the age of 50 when the Jews ridiculed him as being
too young to have achieved sufficient learning of the Jewish law:
The Jews then said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and you
have seen Abraham?" (John 8:57)
Irenaeus argued that had the intention of the Jews been to mock
Jesus' youth, they would have accused him of being "not yet forty years
old" had he, as Christian tradition held, been only in his early
thirties at the time of his ministry, as this accusation would carry
even greater condemnation for his youth. Similarly, the Roman Catholic
priest and theologian
Alfred
Loisy
argued that the author of the Gospel of John implied that
Jesus was in his mid-to-late forties during his ministry. [ 61 ]
According to Loisy, the author of John's use of allegory to describe
Jesus' body as
Herod's Temple , which according to Jesus'
Jewish opponents, required 46 years to build, [ John 2:19-21 ]
was
meant as a symbolic comment on Jesus' age at the time of his ministry.
If accurate, such arguments would place the death of Jesus during the
reign of the Roman Emperor
Claudius
(41-54 CE). The Roman historian
Suetonius
records in his
Lives of the
Twelve Caesars
(121 CE) that Claudius expelled the Jews from
Rome for "making constant disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus",
which scholars have interpreted as further evidence of an early
tradition that held that Jesus lived to be approximately 50 years of
age. [ 62 ]
Regardless of the year of Jesus' death, most Christians commemorate
the crucifixion on
Good Friday
and celebrate the resurrection on
Easter
Sunday.

New Testament view on Jesus'
life
See also:
Gospel harmony
The four
canonical
gospels ,
Matthew ,
Mark ,
Luke , and
John , are the main sources for the biography of Jesus' life;
nevertheless, these Gospels were written with the intention of
glorifying Jesus and are not strictly biographical in nature. [ 63 ]
For example, the Gospels primarily characterize Jesus as the Messiah:
he performs miracles and is often described as having a very close
relationship to the Jewish God — the phrase "Son of God" is attributed
to Jesus at least once in each Gospel. [ Lk. 1:35 ] [ Mt. 16:16 ] [ Mk. 1:1 ] [ Jn. 3:18 ]
The
Gospels (especially Matthew) present Jesus' birth, life, death and
resurrection as fulfillment of
prophecies
found in the Hebrew Bible
(e.g., the
virgin birth , the
flight into Egypt , Immanuel from
Isaiah
7:14 , and the
suffering servant ). [ 64 ]
However, critical scholars find historical information about Jesus'
life and ministry in the
synoptic gospels , while interpreting
the miraculous and theological content in light of what is known of
Jewish beliefs at the time. [ 65 ]
Similarities and
differences among the Gospels
Three of the four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are known as the
synoptic Gospels because they display a high degree of similarity in
content, narrative arrangement, language, and sentence and paragraph
structures. These Gospels are also considered to share the same point of
view. [ 66 ]
The fourth canonical Gospel, John, differs greatly from these three, as
do the
Apocryphal gospels .
According to the
two-source hypothesis , Mark was a
source for Matthew and Luke, both of whom also independently used a now
lost sayings source called the
Q Gospel . Mark defined the sequence of events
from Jesus' baptism to the empty tomb and included parables of the
Kingdom of God. [ 67 ]
Character of Jesus
Each gospel portrays Jesus' life and its meaning differently. [ 68 ] [ 69 ]
The gospel of John is not a biography of Jesus but a theological
presentation of him as the divine Logos. [ 70 ]
One modern scholar writes that to combine these four stories into one
story is tantamount to creating a fifth story, one different from each
original. [ 69 ]
Mark presents Jesus as a heroic, charismatic man of action and mighty
deeds. Matthew portrays him especially as the fulfillment of Hebrew
prophecy and as a greater
Moses . Luke emphasizes Jesus' miraculous powers and
his support for the poor, women, and
Gentiles . John views Jesus' earthly life as a
manifestation of the eternal Word. [ 68 ]
Logos
The Gospel of John opens with a
hymn
identifying Jesus as the divine
Logos , or
Word, that formed the universe. [ Jn. 1:1–5 ] [ 1:9–14 ] [ 71 ]
The author describes the Logos in relation to God and the created
order, declares that he "became flesh", and identifies him as Jesus
Christ. [ Jn. 1:17 ]
According to the Fourth Gospel, Jesus Christ is God active in creation,
in revelation (Light), and in redemption (Life). [ 72 ]
Jesus' earthly life was the Logos incarnate. [ Jn. 1:14 ] [ 71 ]
Genealogy and
family
Main articles:
Genealogy of Jesus ,
Desposyni ,
and
Jesus bloodline
Of the four gospels, only Matthew and Luke give accounts of Jesus'
genealogy. [ 73 ] [ 74 ]
The accounts in the two gospels are substantially different. [ 75 ]
Several explanations have been suggested and it has been traditional to
assume that Luke's genealogy traces through Mary and Matthew's through
Joseph since at least 1490. [ 76 ]
Some contemporary scholars generally view the genealogies as
theological constructs. [ 77 ]
More specifically, some have suggested that the author of Matthew wants
to underscore the birth of a Messianic child of royal lineage. ( Solomon
is included in the list); whereas, in this interpretation, Luke's
genealogy is priestly (e.g., it mentions
Levi ). Mary is
mentioned in passing in the genealogy given by Matthew, but not in
Luke's, while Matthew gives Jacob as Joseph's father and Luke says
Joseph was the son of Heli. Both accounts, when read at face value,
trace Jesus' line though his human father Joseph back to
King David
and from there to
Abraham . These lists are identical between Abraham
and David (except for one), but they differ almost completely between
David and Joseph (having only Zerubbabel and Shealtiel in common).
Child Jesus (left) with his cousin John the Baptist, painting by
Bartolomé
Esteban Perez Murillo
Joseph , husband of
Mary , appears in descriptions of
Jesus' childhood. No mention, however, is made of Joseph during the
ministry of Jesus. The New Testament books of Matthew, Mark, and
Galatians
tell of Jesus' relatives,
including words sometimes translated as "brothers" and "sisters". [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ]
Luke also mentions that
Elizabeth , mother of John the
Baptist, was a "cousin" or "relative" of Mary, [ Lk. 1:36 ]
which
would make John a distant cousin of Jesus.
Nativity and
early life
Main articles:

Adoration of the Shepherds , illustration by
Guido
Reni , 17th century
While there are documents outside of the New Testament which are more
or less contemporary with the
Historical Jesus , many shed no light on the more biographical
aspects of his life. [ 63 ]
The main sources of Jesus himself that are available to modern scholars
are the gospels. [ 81 ]
According to Matthew and Luke, Jesus was born in
Bethlehem
of
Judea
to Mary, a virgin, by a miracle of the
Holy
Spirit .
In Luke, the
angel
Gabriel
visits Mary to tell her that she was chosen
to bear the
Son of God . [ Lk. 1:26–38 ]
An
order of
Caesar Augustus
had forced Mary and Joseph to leave
their homes in
Nazareth
and come to the home of Joseph's
ancestors, the house of
David , for the
Census of Quirinius . [ Lk. 2:1-5 ]
After
Jesus' birth, the couple was forced to use a
manger
in
place of a crib because of a shortage of accommodation. [ Lk. 2:1–7 ]
An
angel announced Jesus' birth to shepherds who left their flocks to see
the newborn child and who subsequently publicized what they had
witnessed throughout the area (see
The First Noël ). [ Lk. 2:8-18 ]
In Matthew, the " Wise Men " or " Magi " bring
gifts to the young Jesus after following a star which they believe was a
sign that the
King of the Jews
had been born. [ Mt. 2:1–12 ]
King
Herod hears of Jesus' birth from the Wise Men and tries to kill him by
massacring all the male children in Bethlehem under the age of two (the " massacre of the
innocents "). [ 82 ] [ Mt. 2:16-17 ]
The
family flees to Egypt and remains there until Herod's death, whereupon
they settle in Nazareth to avoid living under the authority of Herod's
son and successor
Archelaus . [ Mt. 2:19–23 ]
Jesus' childhood home is identified as the town of Nazareth in
Galilee . [ Mt. 2:23 ]
Except
for Matthew's "flight into Egypt", and a short trip to
Tyre
and
Sidon
(in what is now Lebanon), the Gospels place all other events in Jesus'
life in
ancient Israel . [ 83 ]
However,
infancy gospels
began to
appear around the beginning of the second century. [ 84 ]
According to Luke, Jesus was "about thirty years of age" when he was
baptized. [ Lk. 3:23 ]
In
Mark, Jesus is called a
tekton , usually understood to mean
carpenter . Matthew says he was the son of a
tekton . [ Mk. 6:3 ] [ Mt. 13:55 ] [ 39 ] :170
However, the
Greek word used in the Gospels means "builder", which could refer to a
stonemason or some other type of artisan. [ 85 ]
Baptism and
temptation
Main articles:
Baptism of Jesus ,
Temptation of Christ , and
John the Baptist
Christ baptized by
John the Baptist
by
Francesco Trevisani
All three
synoptic Gospels
describe the Baptism of
Jesus by John the Baptist, an event which Biblical scholars describe as
the beginning of Jesus' public ministry. According to these accounts,
Jesus came to the
Jordan River
where John the Baptist had been
preaching and baptizing people in the crowd. After Jesus was baptized
and rose from the water, Mark states Jesus "saw the heavens parting and
the Spirit descending upon Him like a dove. Then a voice came from
heaven saying: 'You are My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased'". [ Mk. 1:10–11 ]
Mark starts his narration with Jesus' baptism, specifying that it is a
token of repentance and for forgiveness of sins. [ 68 ]
Matthew omits this reference, emphasizing Jesus' superiority to John. [ 68 ] [ 86 ]
Matthew describes John as initially hesitant to comply with Jesus'
request for John to baptize him, stating that it was Jesus who should
baptize him. Jesus persisted, "It is proper for us to do this to fulfill
all righteousness". [ Mt. 3:15 ]
In
Matthew, God's public dedication informs the reader that Jesus has
become God's anointed ("Christ"). [ 68 ]
Temptation of Christ , illustration
by
Ary Scheffer , 19th c.
Following his baptism, Jesus was led into the desert by God where he
fasted
for forty days and forty nights. [ Mt. 4:1–2 ]
During
this time, the
Devil
appeared to him and
tempted Jesus three times. Each time, Jesus refused temptation with a
quotation of
scripture
from the
Book of Deuteronomy . The Devil departed and angels came
and brought nourishment to Jesus. [ 87 ]
The Gospel of John does not describe Jesus' baptism, [ 10 ] [ 88 ]
or the subsequent Temptation, but it does attest that Jesus is the very
one about whom John had been preaching — the Son of God. The Baptist
twice declares Jesus to be the "Lamb of God", a term found nowhere else
in the Gospels. John also emphasizes Jesus' superiority over John. [ 68 ]
In John, Jesus leads a program of baptism in Judea, and his disciples
baptize more people than John. [ Jn. 3:22–23 ] [ 4:1–3 ]
Ministry
Main articles:
Ministry of Jesus ,
Sermon on the Mount ,
Sermon on the Plain ,

Transfiguration of Jesus
In the synoptics as well as in John, Jesus has a ministry of teaching
and miracles, at least part of which is in Galilee. [ 89 ]
In the synoptics, Jesus speaks in parables and aphorisms, exorcises
demons, champions the poor and oppressed, and teaches mainly about the
Kingdom of God. [ 12 ]
In John, Jesus speaks in long discourses, with himself as the theme of
his teaching. [ 12 ]
Jesus' purpose
Jesus said of his purpose, "I came that they may have life, and have
it abundantly." [ Jn. 10:10 ]
Mark says that Jesus came to "give his life as a ransom for many"; [ Mk. 10:45 ]
Luke,
that Jesus was sent to "preach the good news of the
Kingdom of God "; [ Lk. 4:43 ]
and
John, that Jesus came so that "those who believed in him would have
eternal life". [ Jn. 3:16 ]
Duration and
location
Judæa and Galilee at the time of Jesus
John describes three different
Passover
feasts over the course of Jesus' ministry, implying that Jesus preached
for at least "two years plus a month or two". [ 90 ]
The
Synoptic Gospels
suggest a span of only one
year. [ 91 ] [ 92 ]
In the synoptics, Jesus' ministry takes place mainly in Galilee, until
he travels to Jerusalem, where he cleanses the Temple and is executed. [ 93 ]
In John, his ministry in and around Jerusalem is more prominently
described, cleansing the temple at his ministry's beginning. [ 93 ]
Disciples
Main article:
Twelve Apostles
In the synoptic Gospels, Jesus calls some Jewish men to be his
Twelve Apostles . None of them seems to
have been a peasant (an agricultural worker). At least four are
described as fishermen and another as a tax collector. Three of them are
presented as being chosen to accompany Jesus on certain special
occasions, such as the
transfiguration of Jesus , the
raising of the
daughter of Jairus , and the
Agony in the Garden . Jesus speaks of the demands of
discipleship, telling a rich man to sell his possessions and give the
money to the poor. He states that his message divides family members
against each other. [ 94 ]
In Mark, the disciples are strangely obtuse, failing to understand
Jesus' deeds and parables. [ 95 ]
In Matthew, Jesus directs the apostles' mission only to those of the
house of Israel, [ Mt. 15:24 ] [ 10:1–6 ]
Luke
places a special emphasis on the women who followed Jesus, such as
Mary Magdalene . [ 96 ]
Teachings
and preachings
Main articles:
Sermon on the Mount
and
Sermon on the Plain
Sermon on the Mount ,

Carl Heinrich Bloch , 19th c.
In the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus speaks primarily about the Kingdom of
God (or Heaven). [ 91 ]
In Matthew and Luke, he speaks further about morality and prayer. In
John, he speaks at length about himself and his divine role. [ 91 ]
At the height of his ministry, Jesus is said to have attracted huge
crowds numbering in the thousands, primarily in the areas of
Galilee
and Perea (in modern-day
Israel
and
Jordan
respectively). [ 97 ]
Some of Jesus' most famous teachings come from the
Sermon on the Mount , which contains the
Beatitudes
and the
Lord's Prayer . It is one of five collections
of teachings in Matthew. [ 82 ]
In the Synoptics, Jesus often employs
parables , such as the
Parable of the Prodigal Son
(Luke) and the
Parable of the Sower
(all Synoptics).
His moral teachings in Matthew and Luke encourage unconditional
self-sacrificing
God-like love
for God and for all people. [ 98 ]
During his sermons, he preached about service and humility, the
forgiveness of sin, faith,
turning the other cheek ,
love for one's enemies
as well as
friends, and the need to follow the spirit of
the law
in
addition to the letter. [ 99 ]
In the Synoptics, Jesus relays an
apocalyptic
vision of the
end of days . He preaches that
the
end of the current world
will come unexpectedly,
and that he will return to judge the world, especially according to
how they treated the vulnerable . He calls on
his followers to be ever alert and faithful. In Mark, the Kingdom of God
is a divine government that will appear by force within the lifetimes
of his followers. [ 95 ]
Matthew describes false Messiahs, disasters, tribulations, and signs in
the heavens that will portend Jesus' return, which is also described as
unexpected. [ 82 ]
Outreach to
outsiders
Jesus with children, early 1900s Bible illustration
Table fellowship is central to Jesus' ministry in the Gospels. [ 14 ]
He and his disciples eat with sinners (who neglect purity rules) [ 93 ]
and tax collectors (imperial
publicani , despised as extortionists). The
apostle
Matthew
is a tax
collector. When the
Pharisees
object to Jesus eating with sinners and
tax collectors, Jesus replies that it is the sick who need a physician,
not the healthy. [ Mt. 9:9–13 ] [ 93 ]
Jesus also defends his disciples against charges that they do not
follow purity laws when eating. The Pharisees accused Jesus himself of
being a drunk and a glutton. [ 93 ]
Jesus' miracles and teachings often involve food and feasting. [ 14 ]
He instructs his missionaries to eat with the people that they preach
to and heal. [ 14 ]
In the Synoptics, Jesus institutes a new covenant with a ritual meal
before he is crucified.
Jesus' outreach to outsiders includes the
Samaritans , who followed
a different form
of the Israelite religion, as
reflected in his preaching to the Samaritans of
Sychar [ Jn. 4:1–42 ]
and
in the
Parable of the Good Samaritan . [ Lk. 10:25-37 ]
At various times, Jesus makes a point of welcoming sinners, children,
women, the poor, Samaritans, and foreigners.
Transfiguration and Jesus'
divine role
Main article:
Transfiguration of Jesus
In the synoptic gospels, Jesus leads three select disciples:
Peter ,
John , and
James
to the top of a mountain. [ 95 ]
While there, he is
transfigured
before them, his face
shining like the sun and his clothes brilliant white;
Elijah
and
Moses
appear adjacent to him. A bright cloud overshadows them, and a voice
from the sky says, "This is my beloved son, with whom I am well
pleased". [ 100 ]
The Transfiguration is a turning point in Jesus ministry. [ 101 ]
Just before it and thereafter, Jesus warns that he is to suffer, die
and rise again. [ 101 ]
In Mark, Jesus' identity as the Messiah is obscured (see
Messianic secret ). [ 102 ]
Mark states that "this generation" will be given no sign, while Matthew
and Luke say they will be given no sign but the sign of Jonah. [ 103 ]
In John, and not in the synoptics, Jesus is outspoken about his divine
identity and mission. [ 89 ]
Here he punctuates his ministry with several miraculous signs of his
authority.
In John, Jesus declares that belief in the Son brings eternal life,
that the Father has committed powers of judgment and forgiveness to the
Son, and that He is the bread of life, the light of the world, the door
of the sheep, the good shepherd, the resurrection and the life, the way,
the truth, and the life, and the real vine. [ 71 ]
Here Jesus uses the phrase "I am" in talking of himself [ Jn. 8:58 ]
in ways
that designate God in the Hebrew Bible, [ Ex. 3:14 ]
a
statement taken by some writers as claiming identity with God. [ 104 ]

In Jerusalem
According to the Synoptics, Jesus came with his followers to
Jerusalem during the Passover festival where a large crowd came to meet
him, shouting, " Hosanna ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord! Blessed is the King of Israel!" [ 105 ]
Following his
triumphal entry , [ 106 ]
Jesus created a disturbance at
Herod's Temple
by
overturning the
tables of the moneychangers
who set up shop there, and claiming
that they had made the Temple a "den of robbers". [ Mk. 11:17 ]
Later
that week, Jesus celebrated the
Passover
meal
with his disciples — an event subsequently known as the
Last
Supper
— in which he prophesied that he would be betrayed by one of
his disciples, and would then be executed. In this ritual he took bread
and wine in hand, saying: "this is my body which is given for you" and
"this cup which is poured out for you is the New Covenant in my blood",
and instructed them to "do this in
remembrance
of me." [ Lk. 22:7–20 ]
Following the supper, Jesus and his disciples went to pray in the
Garden of Gethsemane .
In Mark and Matthew, Jesus is anguished in the face of his fate. [ 101 ] [ 107 ]
He prays and accepts God's will, but his chosen disciples repeatedly
fall asleep on the watch. [ 101 ] [ 107 ]
In Luke, Jesus prays briefly at the Mount of Olives, and his disciples
fall asleep out of grief. [ 108 ]
In John, Jesus has already cleansed the temple a few years before and
has been preaching in Jerusalem. He raises Lazarus on the Sabbath, the
act that finally gets Jewish leaders to plan his death. [ 71 ]
At the Last Supper, Jesus washes the disciples' feet and there is no
new covenant of bread and wine. [ 71 ]
Jesus gives the farewell discourses, discussing the
persecution of his followers , the coming of the Holy
Spirit, and more. [ 71 ]
He says a long final prayer with his disciples before heading to a
garden where he knows Judas will show up. [ 109 ]

Betrayal and
arrest
While in the Garden, Jesus is
arrested
by temple guards on the orders of the
Sanhedrin
and the high priest,
Caiaphas . [ 110 ]
The arrest takes place clandestinely at night to avoid a riot, as Jesus
is popular with the people at large. [ Mk. 14:2 ]
Judas Iscariot , one of his apostles, betrays Jesus by
identifying him to the guards with
a kiss . [ Mt. 26:49-50 ]
Simon Peter, another one of Jesus' apostles, uses a sword to attack one
of Jesus' captors, cutting off his ear, which, according to Luke, Jesus
immediately heals miraculously. [ 111 ]
Jesus rebukes the apostle, stating "all they that take the sword shall
perish by the sword". [ Mt. 26:52 ]
After
his arrest, Jesus' apostles go into hiding; Judas, distraught by his
betrayal of Jesus, commits
suicide
shortly after. [ Mt. 27:5 ]
Trials before the Sanhedrin
and Pilate
[ improper synthesis? ]
Crucifixion , illustration by
D. Velázquez , 17th c.
Jesus affirms that he is the Messiah before the Sanhedrin, [ Mk. 14:53–65 ]
the
only time in the Gospel that he makes such a claim. [ 95 ]
The Jewish leaders turn him over to Pilate for execution, but Pilate is
reluctant to execute Jesus. [ 95 ]
In an attempt to spare Jesus' life, Pilate offers the mob a chance to
free him, but they choose
Barabbas
instead, so that the responsibility for Jesus' execution falls on the
mob of Jews that the Pharisees have incited, rather than on the Romans, [ 95 ]
as expressed in the Gospel of Matthew by the Jewish crowd's
proclamation, “His blood be upon us and on our children.” [ Mt. 27:24–25 ]
Matthew adds the details that Pilate's wife, tormented by a dream, urges
Pilate not to have anything to do with Jesus, and Pilate washes his
hands of responsibility. [ Mt. 27:11–26 ] [ 82 ]
Luke adds the detail that Pilate sends Jesus to
Herod
Antipas , who has authority over Galileans, but that Herod, like
Pilate, finds him guilty of nothing treasonous. [ 96 ] [ Luke 23:6-16 ]
In
John, Jesus makes no claim to be the Son of God or the Messiah to the
Sanhedrin or to Pilate, even though this gospel proclaims Jesus'
divinity from the beginning. [ 71 ]
Death
Christ en majesté ,
Resurrection of Jesus , illustration by
Matthias Grünewald , 16th c.
In Mark, Jesus is stripped, flogged, mocked, and crowned with thorns. [ 95 ]
He is crucified between two thieves, and his cross states that he is
being executed for aspiring to be the king of the Jews. [ 95 ]
He begins to recite
Psalm 22 , "My God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken me." [ 95 ]
He utters a loud cry and dies. [ 95 ]
According to all four Gospels, Jesus died before late afternoon at
Calvary ,
which was also called
Golgotha . In Luke, Jesus faces
his crucifixion stolidly. [ 69 ]
He asks God to forgive those who are crucifying him, possibly the
Romans and possibly the Jews. [ 96 ]
One of the thieves states that Jesus has done nothing wrong and asks
Jesus to remember him in the Kingdom, and Jesus replies that the thief
will be with him in Paradise. [ 96 ]
The Synoptic Gospels tell of the
darkening of the sky
from twelve until three that afternoon; Matthew also mentions an
earthquake , [ Mt. 27:51 ]
"At
that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to
bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split." Mathew also says many dead
saints were resurrected and went into the city to appear before other
people. [ Mt. 27:52-53 ]
John omits the phenomena accompanying Jesus' death. [ 71 ]
The tearing of the
temple
parokhet , upon the death of Jesus, is referenced by
Matthew, Mark and Luke. [ 112 ]

Further information:
Historicity of
the Gospels
The Gospels state that Jesus
rose from the dead
on Sunday. [ 113 ]
All the Gospels portray Jesus' empty tomb. In Matthew, an angel appears
near the tomb of Jesus and announces his resurrection to
Mary Magdalene
and "another Mary" who had arrived to
anoint
the body. [ Mt. 28:1–10 ]
Jewish elders bribe the soldiers who had guarded the tomb to spread the
rumor that Jesus' disciples took his body. [ 114 ]
In Luke, there are two angels [ Lk. 24:4 ]
and in
Mark the angel appears as a youth dressed in white. [ Mk. 16:5 ]
The " longer
ending " to Mark, which is known as the
Markan Appendix
and which did not form
part of the original manuscripts, [ 114 ] [ 115 ]
states that on the morning of his resurrection, Jesus first appeared to
Mary Magdalene. [ Mk. 16:9 ]
John
states that when Mary looked into the tomb, two angels asked her why she
was crying; and as she turned round she initially failed to recognize
Jesus until he spoke her name. [ Jn. 20:11–18 ]
The Gospels all record appearances by Jesus, including an appearance
to the eleven apostles. [ 116 ]
In Mark, Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene, to two disciples in the
country, and to the eleven, at which point Jesus commissions them to
announce the gospel, baptize, and work miracles. [ 114 ]
In Matthew, Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene and to the eleven on a
mountain, at which point he commissions them to enlist followers,
baptize, and teach what Jesus taught. [ 114 ]
Although his own mission and his disciples' missions had been to the
Jews, [ Mt. 15:24 ]
here
he sends the eleven to the whole world (see
Great Commission ). In Luke, he appears to two disciples
in the country and to the eleven. [ 114 ]
He proves to them that he has a body, opens their minds to understand
the scripture about the Messiah, and directs them to wait in Jerusalem
until they are invested with power. [ 114 ]
In John, Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene and to the eleven. He
demonstrates his physical reality to
doubting Thomas . [ 68 ] [ 114 ]
Later he appears to seven disciples who are fishing, and finally talks
with Peter, foretelling Peter's death [ 114 ]
and assigning him the principal role as shepherd of the new community. [ 114 ] [ 117 ]
In Mark and Luke, Jesus ascends to the heavens; [ Mk. 16:19 ] [ Lk. 24:5 ]
after
these appearances. In Luke, Jesus ascends on Easter Sunday evening when
he is with his disciples. [ 114 ]
In Mark, Jesus' Ascension to heaven, where he sits at God's right hand,
is said to have taken place but not described as a visible event. [ 114 ]
John implies that Jesus will return to his Father [ Jn. 20:17 ]
but
doesn't describe an Ascension. [ 114 ]
Names
and titles in the New Testament
Main article:
Names and titles
of Jesus in the New Testament
Jesus lived in
Galilee
for most of his life and spoke
Aramaic
and possibly
Hebrew
and some Greek. [ 118 ]
The name "Jesus" comes from an alternate spelling of the
Latin
( Iēsus ) which in turn
comes from the
Greek
name Iesous ( Ιησους ). In the
Septuagint ,
Ιησους
is used as the Greek
version of the Hebrew name
Yehoshua
( יהושוע , "God delivers" from
Yeho
—
Yahweh
[is]
shua`
— deliverance/rescue) in the Biblical book of the same
name, usually Romanized as
Joshua . Some scholars believe that
one of these was likely the name that Jesus was known by during his
lifetime by his peers. [ 119 ]
Thus, the name has been translated into English as " Joshua ". [ 120 ]
Christ
(which started as a title, and has often been used as a name for Jesus)
is an Anglicization of the Greek term χριστός,
christos . In the
Septuagint, this term is used as the translation of the
Hebrew :
מָשִׁיחַ ,
Modern   Mašíaḥ
Tiberian   Māšîªḥ ,
"Anointed One" in reference to priests, [ 121 ]
and kings [ 122 ]
and King Cyrus. [ Isaiah 45:1 ]
In
Isaiah and Jeremiah the word began to be applied to a future ideal king.
The New Testament has some 500 uses of the word χριστός applied to
Jesus, used either generically or in an absolute sense, namely as
the
Anointed One (the Messiah, the Christ). The Gospel of Mark has as its
central point of its narrative Peter's confession of Jesus as the
Messiah. [ Mk. 8:29 ]
1 Corinthians 15:3
indicates that the strong belief that Jesus was the Messiah predates the
letters of Paul the Apostle. These letters also show that the Messiah
title was already beginning to be used as a name. [ 123 ]
Some have suggested that other titles applied to Jesus in the New
Testament had meanings in the first century quite different from those
meanings ascribed today. [ 124 ]
Géza Vermes has argued that "Son of man" was not a title but rather the
polite way in which people referred to themselves, i.e. a pronominal
phrase. [ 124 ]
Many New Testament scholars state that Jesus claimed to be
God
through his
frequent use of " I am " (e.g. Before
Abraham was, I am), [ Jn. 8:58 ]
his act
of forgiving sins which gave Jews an impression of
blasphemy , [ Lk. 5:20–21 ]
and
his statement that "I and the Father are one." [ Jn. 10:30 ] [ 125 ]
However, a number of New Testament scholars argue that Jesus himself
made no claims to being God. [ 126 ]
Most Christians identified Jesus as divine from a very early period,
although holding a variety of views as to what exactly this implied. [ 127 ]
Other names
and titles
"Son of David" is found elsewhere in Jewish tradition to refer to the
heir to the throne. [ 124 ]
"Son of God" was often used to designate a person as especially
righteous. [ 124 ]
"Emmanuel" or "Immanuel" derives from the Hebrew name
Immanu-El ,
which translates as "God (is) with us" and is based on a Messianic
interpretation of a verse in the Hebrew Bible, Isaiah 7:14 , "They
shall call his name Immanuel."

and
Quest for the historical Jesus
Biblical scholars have used the
historical method
to develop probable reconstructions of
Jesus' life. [ 128 ]
Over the past two hundred years, their image of Jesus has thus come to
be very different from the common one based on the gospels. [ 129 ]
Scholars of historical Jesus distinguish their subject from the "Jesus
Christ" of Christianity, [ 12 ]
while others hold that the figure presented in the gospels is the real
Jesus and that his life and influence only make sense if the gospel
stories are accurate. [ 130 ] [ 131 ] [ 132 ]
The principal sources of information regarding Jesus' life and
teachings are the Gospels, especially the Synoptic Gospels:
Mark ,
Matthew , and
Luke . Including the Gospels, there are no surviving historical
accounts of Jesus written during his life or within three decades of
his death. [ 133 ]
A great majority of biblical scholars accept the historical existence
of Jesus. [ 134 ] [ 135 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ] [ 138 ]
The English title of Albert Schweitzer's 1906 book,
The Quest of
the Historical Jesus,
is a label for the post-Enlightenment effort
to describe Jesus using critical historical methods. [ 139 ]
Since the end of the 18th century, scholars have examined the gospels
and tried to formulate historical biographies of Jesus. [ 128 ]
Contemporary efforts benefit from a better understanding of 1st-century
Judaism, renewed Roman Catholic biblical scholarship, broad acceptance
of critical historical methods, sociological insights, and literary
analysis of Jesus' sayings. [ 139 ]
Constructing
a historical view
Main articles:
Historical Jesus
and
Cultural and
historical background of Jesus
Historians of Christianity analyze the gospels to try to discern the
historical man on whom these stories are based. They compare what the
gospels say to historical events relevant to the times and places where
the gospels were written. They try to answer historical questions about
Jesus, such as why he was crucified.
Most Biblical scholars agree the Gospel of Mark was written about the
time of the destruction of
the Jewish Temple
by the Romans under
Titus
in the
year 70 AD/CE, and that the other gospels were written between 70 and
100 AD/CE. [ 140 ]
The historical outlook on Jesus relies on
critical analysis of the Bible , especially the gospels.
Many Biblical scholars have sought to reconstruct Jesus' life in terms
of the political, cultural, and religious crises and movements in late
Second Temple Judaism and in Roman-occupied Palestine, including
differences between Galilee and Judea, and between different sects such
as the
Pharisees ,
Sadducees ,
Essenes
and
Zealots , [ 141 ] [ 142 ]
and in terms of conflicts among Jews in the context of Roman
occupation.
Descriptions
Historians of Christianity generally describe Jesus as a healer who
preached the restoration of God's kingdom [ 143 ]
and agree he was baptized by John the Baptist and crucified by the
Romans.
Baptism
by John the Baptist
John the Baptist led a large apocalyptic movement. He demanded
repentance and baptism. Jesus was baptized and later began his ministry.
After John was executed, some of his followers apparently took Jesus as
their new leader. [ 144 ]
Historians are nearly unanimous in accepting Jesus' baptism as a
historical event. [ 144 ]
Teaching
Jewish focus
Jesus preached primarily to the Jews. [ 145 ]
Geza Vermes concludes that Jesus' message was exclusively for the Jews, [ 145 ]
while Gerd Theissen asserts that Jesus' message included themes related
to the Gentiles being welcomed into the coming Kingdom. [ 146 ]
Arrival of the
Kingdom
Jesus preached about the Kingdom of God. He said that the age of the
Kingdom had in some sense arrived, starting with the ministry of John
the Baptist. [ 145 ]
Apocalyptic sect
Most scholars hold that the movement Jesus led was apocalyptic,
expecting God to intervene imminently to restore Israel. John the
Baptist's movement was apocalyptic, and Jesus began his public career as
one of his followers. [ 147 ]
Scholars commonly surmise that Jesus'
eschatology
was apocalyptic, like John's. [ 148 ]
Parables
Jesus taught in pithy parables and with striking images. [ 149 ]
His preaching was marked by hyperbole and unusual twists of phrase. [ 145 ]
Jesus likened the Kingdom of Heaven to small and lowly things, such as
yeast or a mustard seed, [ 149 ]
that have great effects. Significantly, he never described the Kingdom
in military terms. [ 145 ]
He used his sayings to elicit responses from the audience, engaging
them in discussion. [ 14 ]
Importance
of faith and prayer
Jesus identified faith or trust in God as a primary spiritual virtue. [ 145 ]
Associated with this main theme, Jesus taught that one should rely on
prayer and expect prayer to be effective. [ 145 ]
Virtue of
being childlike
Jesus was remarkable in stating that one must become like a child to
enter the Kingdom of God. [ 145 ]
The
eschatological family
Jesus repeatedly set himself at odds with traditional family duties
and emphasized that the true family of a believer was the community of
believers. [ 145 ]
Healing and
exorcism
Jesus taught that his healings and exorcisms indicated that a new
eschatological age had arrived or was arriving. [ 145 ]
God as a
loving father
Jesus placed a special emphasis on God as one's heavenly father. [ 145 ] [ 149 ]
This teaching contrasts with the more common practice of depicting God
as a king or lord. [ 145 ]
Crucifixion
Jewish and Roman authorities in Jerusalem were wary of Galilean
patriots, many of whom advocated or launched violent resistance to Roman
rule. [ 13 ]
The gospels demonstrate that Jesus, a charismatic leader regarded as a
potential troublemaker, was executed on political charges. [ 13 ]
Jesus' criticism of the Temple and the scene he caused there led the
Jewish leaders to have him executed. [ 150 ]
The Gospels report that Jesus foretold his own Passion, but the
actions of the disciples suggest that it came as a surprise to them. [ 145 ]
Historically, it's more probable that Jesus did not foretell his own
crucifixion. [ 145 ]
Religious groups
Scholars refer to the religious background of the early 1st century
to better reconstruct Jesus' life. Some scholars identify him with one
or another group.
Pharisees
Pharisees
were a powerful force in 1st-century Judea. Early Christians shared
several beliefs of the Pharisees, such as resurrection, retribution in
the next world, angels, human freedom, and Divine Providence. [ 151 ]
After the fall of the Temple, the Pharisee outlook was established in
Rabbinic Judaism. Some scholars speculate that Jesus was himself a
Pharisee . [ 152 ]
In Jesus' day, the two main schools of thought among the Pharisees were
the
House of Hillel , which had been founded by the eminent
Tanna ,
Hillel the Elder , and the
House of Shammai . Jesus' assertion of hypocrisy may have
been directed against the stricter members of the House of Shammai,
although he also agreed with their teachings on divorce. [ Mk. 10:1–12 ] [ 153 ]
Jesus also commented on the House of Hillel's teachings ( Babylonian Talmud ,
Shabbat
31a) concerning the
greatest commandment [ Mk. 12:28–34 ]
and
the
Golden Rule . [ Mt. 7:12 ]
Historians do not know whether there were Pharisees in Galilee during
Jesus' life, or what they would have been like. [ 93 ]
Sadducees
The
Sadducee
sect was particularly powerful in
Jerusalem. They accepted the written Law only, rejecting the traditional
interpretations accepted by the Pharisees, such as belief in
retribution in an afterlife, resurrection of the body, angels, and
spirits. After Jesus caused a disturbance at the Temple, it was to have
been the Sadducees who had him arrested and turned over to the Romans
for execution. After the fall of Jerusalem, they disappeared from
history. [ 154 ]
Essenes
Essenes
were apocalyptic ascetics, one of the three (or four) major Jewish
schools of the time, though they were not mentioned in the
New
Testament . [ 155 ]
Some scholars theorize that Jesus was an Essene, or close to them.
Among these scholars is
Pope Benedict XVI , who supposes in his book on Jesus
that "it appears that not only John the Baptist, but possibly Jesus and
his family as well, were close to the Qumran community." [ 156 ]
Zealots
The
Zealots
were a revolutionary party opposed to
Roman rule, one of those parties that, according to
Josephus
inspired the fanatical stand in Jerusalem that led to its destruction
in the year 70 AD/CE. [ 157 ]
Luke identifies Simon, a disciple, as a "zealot", which might mean a
member of the
Zealot
party (which would
therefore have been already in existence in the lifetime of Jesus) or a
zealous person. [ 157 ]
The notion that Jesus himself was a Zealot does not do justice to the
earliest Synoptic material describing him. [ 158 ]
Christian scripture as
historical texts

Historicity of
the Gospels
Historians of Christianity examine scripture for clues about the
historical Jesus. They sort out sayings and events that are more likely
to be genuine and use those to construct their portraits of Jesus. The
Gospel tradition has certainly preserved several authentic fragments of
Jesus' teaching. [ citation needed ]
The New Testament was at least substantially complete by 100 AD/CE,
making its books, especially the synoptic gospels, historically
relevant. [ 159 ]
The Gospel tradition certainly preserves several fragments of Jesus'
teaching. [ 160 ]
The
Gospel of Mark
is believed to have been written
c.
70 AD/CE. [ 161 ] [ 162 ] [ 163 ]
Matthew
is placed at being sometime after this date and
Luke is thought to have been written between 70 and 100 AD/CE. [ 164 ] [ 165 ]
Biblical scholars hold that the works describing Jesus were initially
communicated by
oral tradition , and were not committed to
writing until several decades after Jesus' crucifixion. After the
original oral stories were written down in Greek, they were transcribed,
and later translated into other languages. Contemporary textual critic
Bart D. Ehrman
cites numerous places where he maintains that
the gospels, and other New Testament books, were apparently altered by
Christian scribes. [ 69 ]
Critical scholars consider scriptural accounts more likely when they
are attested in multiple texts, plausible in Jesus' historical
environment, and potentially embarrassing to the author's Christian
community. The " criterion of embarrassment " holds
that stories about events with aspects embarrassing to Christians (such
as the denial of Jesus by
Peter ,
or the fleeing of Jesus' followers after his arrest) would likely not
have been included if those accounts were fictional. [ 166 ]
Sayings attributed to Jesus are deemed more likely to reflect his
character when they are distinctive, vivid, paradoxical, surprising, and
contrary to social and religious expectations, such as "Blessed are the
poor". [ 167 ]
Short, memorable parables and aphorisms capable of being transmitted
orally are also thought more likely to be authentic. [ 167 ]
The earliest
extant texts
which refer to
Jesus are
Paul's
letters (mid-1st
century), which affirm Jesus' crucifixion. Some scholars hold that the
Gospel of Thomas , a collection of 114 sayings of Jesus,
predates the four orthodox gospels, and was composed around mid-first
century. [ 168 ] [ 169 ]
Mythical view

Jesus
Christ and comparative mythology
Although the historicity of Jesus is accepted by almost all Biblical
scholars and classical historians, [ 170 ] [ 171 ] [ 172 ] [ 173 ] [ 174 ]
a few scholars have questioned the existence of Jesus as an actual
historical figure. Among the proponents of non-historicity was
Bruno
Bauer
in the 19th century. Non-historicity was somewhat influential
in biblical studies during the early 20th century. The views of
scholars who entirely rejected Jesus' historicity then were based on a
suggested lack of eyewitnesses, a lack of direct archaeological
evidence, the failure of certain ancient works to mention Jesus, and
similarities early Christianity shared with then-contemporary religion
and mythology. [ 175 ]
More recently, arguments for non-historicity have been discussed by
authors such as
George Albert Wells
and
Robert M. Price . Additionally,
The Jesus Puzzle
and
The Jesus Mysteries
are examples of works presenting
the non-historical hypothesis.
Classicist
Michael Grant
stated that standard
historical criteria prevent one from rejecting the existence of an
historical Jesus. [ 176 ]
The New Testament scholar,
James Dunn
describes the mythical
Jesus theory as a 'thoroughly dead thesis'. [ 177 ] [ 178 ] [ 179 ]

perspectives

Religious perspectives on Jesus
By and large, the Jews of Jesus' day rejected his claim to be the
Messiah, as do Jews today. For their part, Christian Church Fathers,
Ecumenical Councils, Reformers, and others have written extensively
about Jesus over the centuries. Christian sects and schisms have often
been defined or characterized by competing descriptions of Jesus.
Meanwhile, Gnostics, Mandaeans, Manichaeans, Muslims, Baha'is, and
others have found prominent places for Jesus in their own religious
accounts.

Christian views of
Jesus
and
Christology
Though
Christian
views of Jesus vary, it is possible
to describe a general majority Christian view by examining the
similarities between specific Western Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and
many Protestant doctrines found in their
catechetical
or
confessional
texts. [ 180 ]
Almost all Chistian groups regard Jesus as the "Savior and Redeemer",
as the Messiah (Greek:
Christos ; English: Christ) prophesied in
the
Old Testament , [ 181 ]
who, through his life, death, and resurrection, restored humanity's
communion with God in the blood of the
New Covenant .
His death on a cross is understood as the redemptive sacrifice: the
source of humanity's salvation and the atonement for
sin , [ 182 ]
which had
entered human history
through the
sin of Adam . [ 183 ]
Christians profess that Jesus suffered death by
crucifixion , [ 184 ]
and rose bodily from the dead in the definitive miracle that
foreshadows the
resurrection
of humanity at the end
of time, [ 185 ]
when Christ will come again to
judge the living and the dead , [ 186 ]
resulting in either entrance into heaven or damnation. [ 187 ]
Christians profess Jesus to be the only
Son of
God , the Lord, [ 188 ]
and the eternal
Word
(which is a translation of the Greek
Logos ), [ 189 ]
who became man in the
incarnation , [ 190 ]
so that those who believe in him might have eternal life. [ 191 ]
They further hold that he was born of the
Virgin Mary
by the power of the Holy Spirit in an event
described as the miraculous
virgin birth
or incarnation. [ 192 ]
Current religious groups that do not accept the doctrine of the
Trinity include the
The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) ,
Jehovah's Witnesses ,
Oneness Pentecostals ,
Sabbatarian Churches of God
and
the
Christadelphians . (See also
Nontrinitarianism )
Islamic views
Main article:
Jesus in Islam
Mainstream
Islam
denies that Jesus was God or the
son of
God , stating that he was an ordinary man who, like other prophets,
had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. Islamic texts forbid
the association of partners with God ( shirk ), emphasizing the notion of God's
divine oneness
( tawhīd ). As such, Jesus is referred to in the Qur'an frequently
as the "son of Mary" (" Ibn Maryam "). [ 193 ] [ 194 ]
Jesus is seen in Islam as a precursor to
Muhammad ,
and is believed by Muslims to have foretold the latter's coming. [ 193 ] [ 195 ]
According to the
Qur'an , believed by Muslims to be God's final
revelation, Jesus was born to Mary (Arabic: Maryam) as the result of
virginal conception , and was given the ability to
perform
miracles .
However, Islam rejects historians assertions that Jesus was
crucified
by the Romans, instead claiming that
he had been raised alive up to
heaven .
Islamic traditions narrate that he will return to earth near the
day of judgement
to restore justice
and defeat
al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl
( lit .
"the false Messiah", also known as the
Antichrist )
and the enemies of Islam. As a just ruler, Jesus will then die. [ 193 ]
Ahmadiyya views
Main article:
Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam
Similar to Islamic views, the
Ahmadiyya Movement
consider Jesus was a
mortal man, but go a step further to describe Jesus as a mortal man who
died a natural death – as opposed to having been raised up alive to
Heaven. According to the early 20th century writings of
Mirza Ghulam Ahmad
(the founder of the Ahmadiyya
movement)
[ 196 ] ,
Jesus survived his ordeal on the cross, and after his apparent death
and resurrection, he fled Palestine and migrated eastwards to further
teach the gospels. They claim Jesus eventually died a natural death of
old age in India –
Kashmir
and is believed to be buried at
Roza Bal . [ 197 ]
Although the view of Jesus having migrated to India has also been
researched in the publications of independent historians with no
affiliation to the movement, [ 198 ]
the Ahmadiyya Movement are the only religious organization to adopt
these views as a characteristic of their faith. The general notion of
Jesus in India is older than the foundation of the movement, [ 199 ]
and is discussed at length by Grönbold [ 200 ]
and Klatt. [ 201 ]
The movement also interprets the second coming of Christ prophesied
in various religious texts would be that of a person "similar to Jesus" ( mathīl-i
ʿIsā ). Thus, Ahmadi's consider that
the founder of the movement
and his prophetical
character and teachings were representative of Jesus and subsequently a
fulfillment of this prophecy.
Judaism's view
Main article:
Judaism's view of Jesus
Judaism
rejects the idea of Jesus being God, or a person of a Trinity, or a
mediator to God. [ 32 ]
Judaism also holds that Jesus is not the
Messiah , arguing that he had not
fulfilled the
Messianic prophecies
in the
Tanakh
nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. According to
Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after
Malachi ,
who lived centuries before Jesus and delivered his prophesies about 420
BC/BCE. Judaism states that Jesus did not fulfill the requirements set
by the
Torah
to prove that he was a prophet. Even if Jesus had produced such a sign
that Judaism recognized, Judaism states that no prophet or dreamer can
contradict the laws already stated in the Torah, which Jesus did. [ 202 ]
The
Mishneh Torah
(an authoritative work of
Jewish law )
states in
Hilkhot Melakhim
11:10–12 that Jesus is a "stumbling
block" who makes "the majority of the world err to serve a divinity
besides God". [ 203 ]
According to
Conservative Judaism , Jews who believe
Jesus is the Messiah have "crossed the line out of the Jewish
community". [ 204 ]
Reform Judaism , the modern progressive movement, states
"For us in the Jewish community anyone who claims that Jesus is their
savior is no longer a Jew and is an
apostate ". [ 205 ]
Bahá'í views
The
Bahá'í Faith , founded in 19th-century
Persia , considers Jesus, along with
Muhammad ,
the
Buddha ,
Krishna ,
and
Zoroaster ,
and other messengers of the great religions of the world to be
Manifestations of God
(or
prophets ),
with both human and divine stations. [ 206 ]
God is one and has manifested himself to humanity through several
historic Messengers. Bahá'ís refer to this concept as
Progressive Revelation ,
which means that God's will is revealed to mankind progressively as
mankind matures and is better able to comprehend the purpose of God in
creating humanity. In this view, God's word is revealed through a series
of messengers: Moses, Jesus, Mohammed,
Bahá'u'lláh
(the founder of the Bahá'í Faith)
among them. In the
Book of Certitude , Bahá'u'lláh claims that
these messengers have a two natures: divine and human. Examining their
divine nature, they are more or less the same being. However, when
examining their human nature, they are individual, with distinct
personality. For example, when Jesus says "I and my Father are one", [ 207 ]
Bahá'ís take this quite literally, but specifically with respect to his
nature as a Manifestation. When Jesus conversely stated "...And the
Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me", [ 208 ]
Bahá'ís see this as a simple reference to the individuality of Jesus.
This divine nature, according to Bahá'u'lláh, means that any
Manifestation of God can be said to be the return of a previous
Manifestation, though Bahá'ís also believe that some Manifestations with
specific missions return with a "new name" [ 209 ]
and a different, or expanded purpose. Bahá'ís believe that Bahá'u'lláh
is, in both respects, the return of Jesus.
Buddhist views
Further information:
Buddhism and Christianity
Buddhists' views of Jesus differ. Some
Buddhists , including
Tenzin
Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama [ 210 ]
regard Jesus as a
bodhisattva
who dedicated his life to the
welfare of human beings. The 14th century Zen master
Gasan Jōseki
indicated that the sayings of Jesus in the
Gospels were written by an enlightened man. [ 211 ]
Other views
Mandaeanism , a very small
Mideastern, Gnostic sect that reveres
John the Baptist
as God's greatest prophet, regards Jesus
as a false prophet of the false Jewish god of the Old Testament,
Adonai , [ 212 ]
and likewise rejects
Abraham ,
Moses , and
Muhammad .
Manichaeism
accepted Jesus as a prophet, along
with
Gautama Buddha
and
Zoroaster . [ 213 ]
The
New
Age
movement entertains a wide variety of views on Jesus. The
creators of
A Course In Miracles
claim to trance- channel
his
spirit. However, the New Age movement generally teaches that
Christhood
is something that all may attain.
Theosophists ,
from whom many New Age teachings originated (a Theosophist named
Alice A. Bailey
invented the term
New
Age ), refer to Jesus of Nazareth as the
Master
Jesus
and believe he had previous
incarnations .
Many writers emphasize Jesus' moral teachings.
Garry
Wills
argues that Jesus' ethics are distinct from those usually
taught by Christianity. [ 214 ]
The
Jesus Seminar
portrays Jesus as an itinerant preacher who
taught peace and love, rights for women and respect for children, and
who spoke out against the hypocrisy of religious leaders and the rich. [ 215 ]
Thomas Jefferson , one of the
Founding Fathers of the
United States
and a
deist , created the
Jefferson Bible
entitled "The Life and Morals of Jesus of
Nazareth" that included only Jesus' ethical teachings because he did not
believe in Jesus' divinity or any of the other supernatural aspects of
the
Bible .

(February 2010)
According to Christian interpretations of the
Bible , the
theme of Jesus' teachings was that of
repentance ,
unconditional
love , [ Jn. 13:34–35 ]
forgiveness
of
sin ,
grace ,
and the coming of the
Kingdom of God . [ 216 ]
Starting as a small Jewish sect, [ 217 ]
Christianity developed into a religion clearly distinct from
Judaism
several decades after Jesus' death. Christianity spread throughout the
Roman
Empire
under a version known as
Nicene
Christianity
and became the
state religion
under
Theodosius
I . Over the centuries, it spread to most of Europe, and around the
world.
His teachings promoted the value of those who had commonly been
regarded as inferior: women, the poor, ethnic outsiders, children,
prostitutes, the sick, prisoners, etc. For over a thousand years,
countless hospitals, orphanages, and schools have been founded
explicitly in Jesus' name.
Thomas Jefferson
considered Jesus' teachings to be "the
most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered
to man". [ 218 ]
Concept of God
Jesus presented a view of God as more lovingly parental, merciful,
and more forgiving, and the growth of a belief in a blissful
afterlife
and in the
resurrection of the dead . [ citation needed ]
The
Church Fathers
of the early centuries further
defined Jesus' identity as fully divine, as god incarnate. [ 219 ]
Ancient and medieval thinkers, such as
Augustine of Hippo , further defined Jesus' divine and
human natures. [ 219 ]
Enlightenment and Reformation theologians concerned themselves less
with defining Jesus' identity as with understanding his work in
redemption. [ 219 ]
In the 1800s, German scholars questioned Jesus' miracles and some,
such as
David Strauss , portrayed him as merely a man,
hence incapable of providing one's eternal salvation. [ 220 ]
C.
S. Lewis
and
Pope John Paul II
have defended the Jesus of faith against
historical critics.
Salvation and
damnation
Paul of Tarsus , in his influential epistles, which were the
earliest writings of the New Testament, espoused that salvation was
based on Jesus alone, acknowledging the positive value of the Jewish Law
but considering it unnecessary to salvation. [ 221 ]
Jesus' followers developed a belief in eternal damnation not found in
Judaism .
Christ Acheiropoietos ( Made without hands ). An icon from the
Novgorod School , 12th century,

Art and literature
Jesus has been a popular subject in drawing, painting, and sculpture.
He is
popularly depicted
as having long brown
hair and a full beard, wearing robes. He is often portrayed crucified
and wearing a
crown of thorns , such as on a
crucifix .
Pictures of the resurrected Jesus has the wounds he suffered on the
cross (see
stigmata ). He appears as the
Christ
Child
in Christmas nativity scenes. He has been
portrayed on stage and in films
in many different ways, both serious and
humorous .
The figure of Jesus features prominently in art and literature. A
number of popular novels, such as
The Da Vinci Code , have portrayed various ideas
about Jesus, and a number of films, such as
The Passion of the Christ , have
portrayed his life, death, and resurrection. Many of the sayings
attributed to Jesus have become part of the culture of
Western
civilization . There are a few items purported to be
relics of Jesus , of which the
most famous are the
Shroud of Turin
and the
Sudarium of Oviedo .
Christian
antisemitism
Although Jesus was a Jew as were the first Christians, some
anti-Judaic attitudes started to develop even before the end of the
first century. For some Jews, the legacy of Jesus has been a history of
Christian antisemitism , even
though there is evidence of continued Jewish-Christian interaction since
the early Church, [ 222 ]
although in the wake of
the
Holocaust
many Christian groups have gone to considerable lengths
to reconcile with Jews and to promote interfaith dialogue and mutual
respect.
Christianity has often been linked to European
colonialism . [ 223 ]
Others have argued that through
Bartolomé de las Casas 's defense of
the indigenous inhabitants of
Spain's New World empire , one of the legacies of Jesus has
been the notion of universal
human
rights . [ 224 ]
