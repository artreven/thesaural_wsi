Penne with Creamy Vodka Sauce
After several months of not being allowed to drink ( another
mono
complication ), my most recent blood test finally showed normal liver functions. To celebrate, Ozzy and I took a trip to the liquor store and picked up a bottle of
vodka ,
since I'd been craving a
Bloody Mary
after reading about using them as a fun substitute for
maror ,
the bitter herbs eaten at the
Passover seder , on
The Liquid Seder . Once we'd purchased the
vodka ,
however, I realized that
Bloody Marys
do not a dinner make. That, and a bottle of
Nero d'Avola
(my favorite wine) was sitting unopened on the table and calling my name. So, instead of drinking my
vodka ,
I decided to cook with it instead! Flipping through my favorite cooking bible, Mark Bittman's
How to Cook Everything ,
I lighted on a recipe for
Creamy Vodka Sauce
and, tweaking it a bit as is my way, it was not only a perfect accompaniment to the
Nero d'Avola ,
but an easy meal the Vegetarian and I could both enjoy equally. Score! Penne with Creamy Vodka Sauce Kosher Salt 1 pound
penne rigate 3 tablespoons
olive oil 1
yellow onion ,
chopped 1 28-ounce can
diced tomatoes 1/8 teaspoon
black pepper 1/2 teaspoon
cumin ,
ground 1/8 teaspoon
piment d'espelette 1/4 cup
vodka 1/4 cup
heavy cream Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once it has boiled, add the
penne
and cook until al dente, around 9 minutes. Heat
olive oil
in a large skillet over medium heat. When it moves around easily in the pan, add
onion
and cook 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add
tomatoes, salt, pepper, cumin
and
piment d'espelette.
Cook 8 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in
vodka
and
heavy cream
and cook an additional 2 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings as necessary. Keep warm while
penne
finishes cooking. When
penne
is cooked, drain and toss with the sauce, adding some of the cooking water if necessary. Enjoy! Links to other
