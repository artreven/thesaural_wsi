The Most Simple Sangria
I’ve
tried Sangria many times over the years, and I’ve decided I prefer the
kind that doesn’t get you hammered and headachy after a couple of
glasses on a hot day.
It should be light and refreshing, enjoyable
alone or with food. To this end, I wanted to use good wine with fruit
juice and avoid additional sugar or other alcohol, creating an easily
drinkable, punchy beverage.
This recipe is
embarrassingly simple, but I always get positive comments when I serve
it so I figure it’s blog-worthy.
It goes quickly, so be prepared to
make a few batches during a party.
You will need:
Red wine (use decent quality red wine with strong fruit, such as a Sangiovese. The wine should be good enough to drink alone.)
Pineapple juice
Limes
Lemons and oranges, sliced in thin half-circles with rind on
Fill
a large pitcher with 2/3 wine and 1/3 pineapple juice. Add juice of
half a lime. Add sliced citrus and stir. Other fruit can be added, such
as sliced pineapple or strawberries.
Let sangria chill for a couple of hours…or not.
It’s pretty good served right away, too. Serve over ice.

Bill's Kick-Ass Bloody Marys
The
Bloody Mary
is the comfort food of the cocktail world, perhaps because it feels
like a nourishing and refreshing meal in a glass, a cure-all for travel
jitters, jet lag, hangovers, or whatever nameless malaise that ails you.
We used to think the best Bloody Mary of all time was made at Dick’s
Place in Mendocino, rivaled perhaps only by the Orbit Room in San
Francisco, whose extravagant Bloody Mary’s are like a spiked salad in a
glass.
Then we tasted our neighbor Bill’s
version.
His Bloody Mary takes the prize – in most ways very
traditional, with a simple celery stick garnish and a good kick, but
with unusually refreshing, zesty flavor. After some analysis we
determined his secret: a copious amount of fresh lime juice from fruit
off of his own tree.
The tree is enormous, about the size of a small
house, and bears large, extremely juicy limes that turn yellow when
ripe.
As far as we can determine, this seems to be a
Bearss lime
(also known as Tahitian or Persian), which has benefited from the
fertilizer that Bill always feeds the neighboring tomato plants.
We’ve
never encountered limes with such wonderful flavor and aroma, and we
squeeze the juice on practically everything that comes out of our
kitchen. It adds instant sparkle to so many things. This lime tree makes
us feel rich, and I’m not kidding when I say we feel a bit bereft when a
crop is depleted.
It inspired us to plant our own Bearss tree, but it
has a ways to go before producing on the same level.
Anyway, here’s
Bill’s recipe.
In a small pitcher, mix the following:
3 parts vodka
6 parts tomato juice
juice of 3 to 5 Bearss limes, depending on size, to taste
dashes of Tabasco, horse radish, and Worcestershire sauce
celery salt and black pepper
celery stick garnish for each glass
Pour over ice and garnish with celery.
