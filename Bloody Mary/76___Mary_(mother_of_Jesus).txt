And here is the coming three-concert season of the MCP:
The Madison Choral Project (MCP) has announced its third season, which features internationally renowned choral conductor
Dale Warland
(below), and notable local artists Martha Fischer, Bruce Bengtson, Noah Ovshinsky and the Madison Youth Choirs.
CONCERT
1: “O Day Full of Grace,” MCP’s second annual holiday concert, opens the season on Saturday, December 20, at 7:30 p.m. in the First
Congregational Church
of Christ in Madison, 1609 University Ave.  It will feature an evening of traditional holiday music, secular music, narrated texts and audience singing all surrounding the theme of a transformative time, place or experience.
MCP is again partnering with Noah Ovshinsky (below), Assistant News Editor at
Wisconsin Public Radio , who will narrate readings interposed amongst the musical selections.
CONCERT 2: The stunning and sublime Requiem by French composer
Gabriel Faure
(below top) will headline the choir’s second concert, which will also feature the striking “ Te Deum ” of contemporary Scottish composer
James MacMillan
(below bottom) on Saturday, February 28, at 7:30 p.m. at the First Congregational Church. (You can hear the opening of James Macmillan’s “Te Deum” in a
YouTube video
at the bottom.)
MCP is partnering with organist Bruce Bengtson, Director of Music at Luther Memorial Church in Madison, on both the Faure and MacMillan.
February is also the culmination of a period of educational exchange between MCP and the Madison Youth Choirs, and this concert will include a performance by the Ragazzi (below, in a photo by Dan Sinclair) and Cantabile ensembles of the Madison Youth Choirs, both alone and in a combined work with the MCP singers.
CONCERT 3: The season will close on Friday, May 29, at 7:30 p.m. at the First Congregational Church of Christ under the direction of renowned guest conductor Dale Warland, and collaborating pianist Martha Fischer (below left, with her husband pianist Bill Lutes), Professor of Piano and head of the graduate collaborative piano program at the University of Wisconsin.
This concert marks Warland’s first return to conduct in Madison in 20 years.
Dale Warland is considered one of the most influential American choral musicians of all time, and is one of only two choral conductors to be inducted into the
American Classical Music Hall of Fame .
He founded the pioneering choral ensemble, the Dale Warland Singers, in 1972.  The group was nominated for a
Grammy Award for Best Choral Performance
in 2003, and their 29 commercial CDs remain standard issue for choral conductors and educators around the country.
Tickets for the 2014-2015 season are available online at
www.themcp.org , and at the door before each concert.  Discounted student tickets are available with a valid student ID.

Classical music: Is there better graduation music than the old stand-by, “Pomp and Circumstance” No. 1 by Sir Edward Elgar? The Ear doubts it.
May 17, 2014 4 Comments
By Jacob Stockinger
This is
graduation
weekend at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison.  This year, the biggest ceremonies will be held outdoors in
Camp Randall Stadium , as in the photo below.
It started last night, Friday night, with doctoral students,
MFA ‘s and
professional degree
students including doctors, lawyers, business people and veterinarians who had their ceremony indoors at the
Kohl Center .
Today, Saturday, May 17, 2014, is devoted to the largest number of graduates -– the
undergraduates  as well as master’s students.
The Ear wants to honor all UW
students
who are graduating, but especially the students — both undergraduate and graduate — at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Music
who have brought him so many hours of pleasure and memorable listening.
But what to choose to play?
Believe me, I have thought long and hard about it.
And for the life of me, I still do not think there exists anything better than the old stand-by: The “Pomp and Circumstance’ March No. 1, originally written by
Sir Edward Elgar
(below) for the coronation of a  King of England . (You can hear it in a YouTube video at the bottom.)
Of course, there are other fine marches by Elgar in the same set.
But none surpasses the really famous one, the omnipresent one at this time of year, THE
Pomp and Circumstance March
that captures the vitality and rush, yet also the dignity and hope of the event — and yes, all the bittersweet sadness of leaving behind close friends and mentors.
If you know of a better musical offering for graduation or commence, please leave a reply or comment with a
YouTube
link is possible and certainly the composer’s name and work’s title.
In the meantime, here it is again. You have no doubt heard it before probably many times. But no matter that it is a cliché or that is banal. It never fails to give me both goosebumps and tears, and it always makes me wish that I too were among those students processing through commencement.
Are you ready?
Graduates: Please line up, adjust your robe and mortar board, and smile.
Maestro, a downbeat please!
Best wishes and congratulations to all.

Classical music news: Madison Summer Choir will go authentically Baroque this year. It holds auditions on Monday, May 14, and then starts rehearsals on May 21 with a public performance on July 1.
May 10, 2012 1 Comment

It’s that time again.
The
University of Wisconsin-Madison
ends its spring semester with classes this week, finals next week, and graduation ceremonies on May 19 and 20.
Then comes the unofficial start of summer – when many avid community singers find themselves without an outlet.
Until recently.
For the fourth year, the Madison Summer Choir (below, performing last year) will take place, although the venue of its public concert at 7 p.m. on Sunday, July 1, will change from Mills Hall on the UW campus to the First Congregational
United Church of Christ , across from
Camp Randall Stadium . (NOTE: Contrary to what was earlier stated here, the July 1 concert is NOT free, as it has been for the past three years. Admission will be $8, $5 for seniors and students, and is designed to cover the cost of renting the church.)
It is a fine group that in past summers has brought memorable performances of classic and contemporary music, including major works like Saint-Saens’ “Requiem” and Morton Lauridsen’s “Lux Aeterna.” It pulls a lot together very quickly and very well.
This year, the program  “Honors the Blessed
Virgin Mary ” by featuring
Baroque music
and period instruments. That makes it a fine run-up or introduction to the Madison Early Music Festival, which follows it in July.
Here are details from the founder and director of the 80-voice Madison Summer Choir, UW alumnus Ben Luedcke (below), the talented and energetic man who is also the director of the Lake Edge United Church of Christ among other posts he holds:
Here are notes to the fascinating and eclectic program: “Madison Summer Choir
presents a concert honoring the
Blessed Virgin Mary
with a plethora of devotional Marian texts set by inventive titans of their time, including Benjamin Britten, Franz Liszt, Edvard Grieg, William Byrd and
Tomás Luis de Victoria .
“It will culminate with choral/instrumental mid-sized works by
Claudio Monteverdi
(below), Michael Praetorius,
Domenico Scarlatti
and Giovanni Gabrieli, and will feature Baroque period string instruments that use gut strings instead of metal and a different kind of bow.”
The Madison Summer Choir runs 6 weeks: May 21 through the end of June (see ** below for additional information).
Rehearsals are Mondays and Tuesdays 5:15-7:15 p.m., 1351 Mosse Humanities Building on campus.
The  Concert is on Sunday, July 1, at 7 p.m. in the First Congregational UCC (across from Camp Randall)
Members’ dues are: $30 for students; $45 for community members. Concert admission is $8, $5 for seniors and students.
**Wed., May 30, 5:15-7:15 p.m. (make-up for
Memorial Day
holiday)
**Wed., June 20, 5:15-7:15 p.m. (extra rehearsal)
**Thursday, June 28, 5:15-7:15 p.m.
Dress Rehearsal
at First Congregational United Church of Christ
Members of the UW-Madison or community auditioned ensembles do NOT need to audition; otherwise contact
baluedcke@wisc.edu
to set up an audition time during the evening of Monday, May 14.
If you are interested, you should RSVP and include the choir that you currently sing with (if any) and your voice part to:
baluedcke@wisc.edu
