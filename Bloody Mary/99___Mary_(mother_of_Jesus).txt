Annotations [ edit ]
Omnis caro ad te veniet       ( Latin )
All flesh shall come unto thee. [1]
See
047.26-27 .
omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem       ( Latin )
a suppliant almightiness of the Mother of God , or
an almightiness of petition of the Mother of God . [2]
Omnipotentia supplex
( the all-powerful suppliant ) is an honorific title bestowed on the
Virgin Mary .
Saint Bernardino of Siena
said of her:
Mary has the keys of the divine treasury, so that she can distribute to whom she wills and as much as she wills, the grace of the Holy Spirit. [3]
The same point is made in the popular prayer
Memorare , which is often attributed to
Saint Bernard of Clairvaux , but Stephen's phrase has not been found in any genuine work by Saint Bernard.
