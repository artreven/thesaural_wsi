Well, it’s actually the El Minuto Margarita.   El Minuto Cafe
is a Mexican restaurant in downtown Tucson.  It wasn’t happy hour, per se, but the
Margs
were only five or six dollars… and we got free chips and salsa!
Yeah, so I was more excited about the
salsa
than the margaritas.  I got a plain ol  tequila
margarita
on the rocks.  It was served in a small glass cup.  I would have liked it to come in a big fancy margarita glass, but hey, at least there was free salsa.  My friend Sara got a blended strawberry margarita.  It was great.  That’s what I’m ordering next time.
And yes, there will be a next time.  It wasn’t like it was a “bad margarita.”
And the salsa was spicy with few chunks – my favorite. Plus, the service was great.  Our waiter was funny and friendly from the moment we walked in, he checked on us at the perfect intervals, and he was happy to get us more salsa.  We got a cup of the
tortilla soup
too, and it was delicious.  Lots of tortilla strips, avocados, and a huge bubble of melted cheese in the bottom of the bowl.  I’m ordering that next time, too.
For this very stressful time of the year, I leave you with a quote by
Jimmy Buffett
himself, “If life gives you limes, make margaritas.”
Tequila = Ta kill ya

Tequila happens to be a favorite alcohol of mine.  It is a main ingredient in many icy
drinks
(great for summers in
Arizona ), it goes down easily, and it provides a great buzz.  The drink of the week is a shot of
Tequila .  I forced some friends to contribute their drinking talents for the sake of my blog, and they happily accepted the task.
Ingredients:
Tequila (I called upon my good friend
Jose )
Salt
Lime slices
You may not be aware, but there are very specific directions for taking a tequila shot.  It is highly important to follow these directions in the order given.
1. Cut the lime into slices and give everyone a slice.
2. Pour the shots up the rim of the shot glasses.
3. Lick the top of your hand between your thumb and forefinger.
4. Pour salt on the same part of your hand.
5. Cheers!
6. Lick the salt, take the shot, and bite the lime slice. (Yes, this should all be done in ONE speedy last step.)
Now I suppose step 3 can be modified, but it is generally accepted by the tequila -drinking world to put the salt on this part of your hand.  It is not unlikely that you would be ridiculed for putting it anywhere else.  By the way, I like to use lemon-flavored salt.  You can get it at general markets, like
17th Street Market
in Tucson.
Also, the “Cheers!” step is not completely necessary, but it is fun and really helps with the momentum of the shot.
Salud!

I’m finally getting back on the blog horse this week and I am making a tried and true favorite of mine.  It is a Tequila Sunrise.
All the recipes I found online were almost the same, but the general directions I always follow go like this:
1. Fill a glass with ice cubes
2. 1.5 shots of tequila (2 oz.)
3. Twice as much orange juice if you are eyeing it (4 oz. if you want to be precise)
4. Stir it all up
5. Add about a good splash of grenadine (1 oz.)
6. Enjoy! (With a lime wedge and a cherry if you have them on hand)
If you want to experience the full “sunrise effect,” it is important to add the grenadine AFTER stirring the other ingredients together.  The grenadine will sink to the bottom and rise back to the top.  I was hoping to post the “sunrise” in video form, but my camera was injured in a Spring Break-related accident.  This is also why the quality of my pictures is lacking – I used my camera phone.
Like many cocktails, a Tequila Sunrise is better as cold as possible.  I recommend keeping tequila in the freezer when you have the space.
Also, if you looked very closely at the picture of ingredients you will see that I didn’t even
manage to follow my own recipe.  I added pineapple juice that I happened to have in the fridge, and it was – of course – delicious.  This is not to say, though, that it is better than the original recipe.  A classic is a classic.

Tequila, Collins?

The drink of the night is called a Tequila Collins.
This is a very simple recipe, and all the ingredients are things you probably already have in your kitchen.  This, and the fact that the main ingredient is tequila, makes this drink great for getting tipsy in a hurry.
Here
is the recipe I used:
Juice of ½ lemon
1 tsp. powdered sugar
2 oz. tequila (= 1.5 shots)
Club soda
Do the hokey pokey, turn it all around (with lots of ice), and that’s about all it is.  All the recipes I found online said to add wedges of lemon and lime, and a cherry for garnish.  Well I had blood oranges, so that is what I used.  (Other than that, I followed the recipe – exactly!)
The consensus is… this drink is STRONG.  I actually didn’t like it on first sip (and I love
tequila).  My tester, Sara, liked it and said, “It tastes like tequila.”  And a couple sips later, “I’m already feeling tipsy!”
And that’s exactly how it is.  The more I drank, the better it tasted.
Here is a
video
to show you exactly how it is done.

Bloody Beers

Eww.  That sounds really gross.
The drink is called a Michelada.  It is a mix between a
Bloody Mary
and a beer.  Hence, the title.
I found the recipe on
NocheLatina.com , although there are many varying recipes elsewhere.
Ingredients:
(about) 1 Tbsp. Lime juice
(about) 1 Dash of salt
(about) 2 Dashes of Cayenne pepper sauce (I used Frank’s RedHot)
(about) 2 Dashes of Worcestershire sauce (I used Lea & Perrins)
(about) 1 Bottle of Mexican beer (I used Dos Equis and Corona Extra)                                    Lots of Ice
This recipe is all about personal preference.  I used extra hot sauce and extra lime, because those are my favorites.
I also used (about) 1 Dash of Kikkoman Soy Sauce to give it more flavor.  You didn’t think I could follow a whole recipe did you?  I got the idea of soy sauce from other sites’ Michelada recipes – there is some method do the madness.
Directions:
Mix altogether.  Trust your instincts.  Use more of your favorite ingredients until it’s perfect.
Overall, the drinks were alright.  I enjoy a spicy Bloody Mary more than a Michelada, but hey, I still drank them.  I even went through the trouble of rimming the glasses with salt, so I couldn’t let them go to waste.  The salt, by the way, made all the difference.
As for the beers,
Corona
is usually my Mexican beer of choice.  I was feeling extra spontaneous, though, and got
Dos Equis
also.  I was glad that the crazy side of me
The Dos Equis Michelada was tastier, but I did drink both.
showed itself while I stood there in the beer aisle of the grocery store – the Dos Equis Michelada was excellent.   (Those cerveza websites are worth checking out).

At 8am this morning I got to my business class to find out it was cancelled.
Ugh, I got out of my cloud of a bed for nothing. I’ll go to the grocery store now so that I can get drink supplies and get my blog done before midnight for once.
At the grocery store I ended up getting fresh tulips, two packs of chip clips, four fresh bagels and a reusable grocery tote. I looked all over, no watermelon.  (I was planning on making non-alcoholic watermelon “Aguas Frescas.”)
I’ll go home and eat these bagels, get my coffee fix, and go to another grocery store.
… 8 hours later I left Border Beat with every intention of going straight to the grocery store as soon as I get to my car.  My roommate had just finished making an early dinner when I got home.
I didn’t end up getting to Super Target until 8pm.  By this time I decided I needed a drink –
why would I make any non-alcoholic drink, ever?
After searching every aisle for Club Soda, the only ingredient in a Tequilla Collins that I didn’t already have, I grabbed two bags of Aguas Frescas mix.  I left Super Target with $40 of necessary items, such as marshmallows and Rice Krispies cereal. No Club Soda.
There’s no excuse for Super Target not to have Club Soda.
Anyways, ever since I started this blog, every time I Google, “drinks from the border,” Aguas Frescas came up, but I was never interested.  You know, because of the no-alcohol thing.
I tried Horchata and Mango flavored mixes.
The recipe was simple – 2 Tbs. mix
9 oz water (or add some sweetened condensed milk to the Horchata)
Cinnamon to taste
I wanted to try it both with and without milk (regular milk because I could never follow a recipe perfectly)
The general consensus between me and my tolerant friends was that the Horchata with
milk was the best, the mango was good, and the Horchata with no milk was kinda gross.
We may have eaten the better part of a tin of Rice Krispie Treats.  This is my friend Jenn, she drank the Aguas Frescas and ate the Rice Krispie Treats. Clearly.
Happy birthday… Dad

I grew up in the Phoenix area. The best part of going to school so close to home is the ease of going home when you want. The worst part is the ease of going home when your
parents
want.
My dad celebrated his 50th birthday this weekend in Cave Creek, and being the wonderful daughter I am, I drove up to make an appearance at the party.
As much as I didn’t want to make the drive, my dad’s ability to party impressed me.
I was pleasantly surprised to find that the guest of honor was ready for action when I got home.  My dad grabbed a cup, and introduced himself to Mr. Margarita.
Margaritas were the obvious drink choice for a Southwest-themed party, complete with taco buffet, rice and beans, and fiesta colors everywhere.
Always welcoming, sure to fuel interesting conversation, and the heartbeat of any good party, I have determined that Mr. Margarita is the most necessary party guest.
Mr. Margarita is quite self-sufficient and requires little attention.  When you rent the machine, you also get a 5 gallon bucket for mixing, margarita mix, cups, a cart for the machine and extension cords, if necessary.
Step 1 – Start with one bottle of Mr. Margarita Mix
Step 2 – Add 2 or 3 liters of tequila
Step 3 – Fill the rest of the bucket with water (up to the red line)
Step 4 – Pour mixture into the margarita machine
Step 5 – Poof! Frozen margaritas are ready.  Rim your glass with salt and enjoy
Not only does Mr. Margarita come with free perks, but also, the company often offers delivery and clean up services.  Does throwing a party get any easier than that?
I’d allow margaritas at my party even if I had to clean it up myself.
The party turned out to be much more entertaining than I expected.  Alcohol, Depends diapers, and Ginkgo Biloba are just some of the amusing gifts Dad received.
He ended up going out dancing and came home at 2 am to find me already passed out on the couch. Who’s the party animal now?
