Home Brewing: How to make a bad beer better (The art of the michelada)

Have a bad macro kicking around the fridge that you don’t want to give out and you don’t want to drink yourself? Well, you could do what I do: Make a michelada.
The michelada is a popular Mexican  alcoholic beverage  of a genre known in  Spanish  as  cerveza preparada  (prepared beer) and in  English as a variety of  cocktail . There are several variations. In some cases it is similar to a  Bloody Mary  but containing  beer  instead of  vodka , although a less complicated concoction of Mexican beer with sauces and  lime  juice added (see recipe below) is also referred to as a Michelada.
In traveling to Mexico – which I tend to do often – I was at first disgusted by the mixure. In Monterrey, Mexico where my in-laws live they take lime juice (fresh), a little pepper, some hot sauce or maybe salsa,  Worcestershire sauce , and Clamato and a light Mexican beer. Beers I have used include Negro Modelo, Sol, Tecate, Indio and some others. Corona is not allowed within city borders thank God.
Recently, major  American beer  producers have begun marketing  cervezas preparada , illustrating the wide variety of recipes in the Chelada/ Michelada category. For example,  Miller Brewing Company  produces  Miller Chill  which is a “Chelada-style light lager with a hint of salt and lime”. Going a different route,  Anheuser-Busch  is manufacturing  Bud Light Chelada  as a combination of lager,  clamato , lime juice, and salt.
I warn, you will not like this drink at first but after a bit it will take on the same appeal as margarita. You won’t want it everyday – maybe once a month – but it is a nice way to spice up a cheap macro.
