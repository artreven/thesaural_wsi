Your name is triangleDAYS and you have a wide variety of BLOGS on a number of different WEBSITES that are mainly ART-BASED. You have recently indulged in reading this HOMESTUCK comic and now have the INTENSE URGE to REBLOG and DRAW fanart of this phenomenon. You wish that you had continued reading it LAST YEAR instead of stopping at CAPTCHALOGUE FAKE ARMS. You are a FOOL. You tend to use a lot of TYPED EMOTICONS when you speak and a BUTTLOAD of

Boozestuck—the trolls are all various cocktails that Andrew Hussie shotguns one after the other while constructing the plot of his comic.
Aradia— Bloody Mary  ; a spicy vodka-based cocktail made with tomato juice that shares a name with the
famous ghost
of American folklore.
Tavros— Shandy  ; a mild beer or cider, often weak enough to be classified as non-alcoholic.
Sollux— Screwdriver  ; a zesty, citrus-flavoured highball invented by engineers.
Karkat— Gin & Tonic  ; a rather bitter, colorless drink.
Nepeta— Absinthe  ; whimsical drink of painters and poets, prepared with sugarcubes and said to induce visions.
Kanaya— Japanese Slipper  ; a cool, sweet & sour martini that gets its characteristic green color from Midori melon liqueur.
Terezi— Electric Lemonade  ; a refreshing and vibrant-colored cocktail, bubbly and tart, made with blue curacao and 7-up.
Vriska— Skyy Blue  ; a ready-mixed malt drink of complex flavours.
Equius — Black Velvet  ; a combination of stout beer and champagne meant to symbolize and mourn the death of royalty, ranging from black to deep violet in color.
Gamzee — Purple Drank  ; the ingredients can include various narcotic cough syrups, hard candies and sodas and the concoction is meant to induce a dissociative state, or even hallucinations. Popularized by the hip-hop community and notable for deaths caused by overdose.
Eridan — Red Wine  ; a drink with a long and distinguished history, and often associated with nobility or
snobbery .
Feferi — Cosmopolitan  ; a frothy pink cocktail made with cranberry juice, considered a popular “girls’” drink.
Hopefully you guys know by now that character analysis, lists, and alcohol are three of my very favourite things, and you won’t hate me too much for this.
