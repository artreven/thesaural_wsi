A Guide to Downtown Kenosha Bloody Marys . . .

To many, itâ€™s a brunch-time beverage of choice and to others, a hangover cure or anytime treat.
The drink famously known as the Bloody Mary is one of the most popular cocktails ordered in the U.S. and around
Downtown Kenosha , itâ€™s served up at a variety of locales, in a variety of ways.
The base ingredients of the Bloody Mary are simple: tomato juice and vodka. But it rarely stops there. No two establishments seem to make a Bloody exactly alike. Most Bloody Marys are mixed with seasonings like celery salt and black pepper, and sauces like Tabasco and Worcestershire. Bloody Marys are garnished with anything from a pickle spear or celery stick, to cold cuts or cocktail shrimp.
How the Bloody Mary got its start is somewhat of a debate. One account has the beverage originating in the 1920s at
Harryâ€™s New York Bar in Paris , France, a popular hangout for writers and American expatriates. Another story is that the original recipe, half tomato juice, half vodka, was invented by American actor
George Jessel
sometime in the late 1930s and was popularized by the bartenders at the King Cole Room in New York.
Even the origin of the drinkâ€™s name, â€œBloody Mary,â€ is disputed. Some have attributed it to Hollywood star
Mary Pickford,
who once had a similarly red cocktail named after her. The term has also been traced to a waitress named Mary who worked at a bar called
The Bucket of Blood in Chicago . Then thereâ€™s
Bloody Mary , the folklore ghost, based on the original Bloody Mary, Queen Mary I of England.
Wisconsinites are no strangers to the Bloody Mary. In fact, the idea of serving a beer chaser with the Bloody Mary is said to have originated in Wisconsin. Garnishing the Bloody Mary with a beef stick also became popular here in the Dairy State.
So if you find yourself craving one of these sumptuous cocktails, this is your guide to some of the best Bloodys served in Downtown Kenosha.
Ashling on the Lough , 125 56th Street
Located along the Southport Marina, Ashling on the Lough (pronounced lock) serves up the kind of Bloody Mary that one would hope for from a contemporary Irish pub and restaurant. In addition to the usual ingredients and spices, the bartenders at Ashling top this giant goblet off with a generous serving of Guinness beer. The drink is garnished with a lemon, lime, two olives, and beef stick and a Harp beer chaser is offered. The final product is a bold and tasty concoction with plenty of Irish brew and a fair amount kick. SlÃ¡inte!
Regularly $5.50.
Boat House , 4917 7th Ave
Overlooking the Simmons Island Marina, Boathouse Pub & Eatery is perhaps best known for its seafood offerings and extensive Long Island drink list. Not to be overlooked is the Boathouseâ€™s signature Bloody Mary, which is only $2 on Saturdays and Sundays. Served in a tulip glass, this Bloody Mary has the spice of horseradish and Tabasco and the tanginess of a couple extra teaspoons of pickle juice. The drink is garnished with a spicy pickle spear that bartender, Chris, says gives it the extra kick that most guests enjoy.
Regularly $3.50, $3.75 with beer chaser.
$2.00 Saturdays and Sundays.
Captain Mikeâ€™s Lighthouse Pub , 5118 6th Ave
Captain Mikeâ€™s Lighthouse Pub is a downtown hotspot that is serious about its beer list–30 beers on tap and over 150 in stock. If itâ€™s not a brewski you came for, the bartenders mix up a Bloody Mary from scratch thatâ€™s just to the guestâ€™s liking. With extra ingredients like A1 sauce and Guinness, theyâ€™re well equipped.
Regulary $4.00.
Cooler Near the Lake , 506 56th St
A cross between a sports bar and upscale lounge, the place with the little pink flamingos has a Bloody Mary thatâ€™s big on flavor. Like most locales, the Bloody Mary at Cooler Near the Lake is popular during Sunday football games. And with a perfect mix of sweet, citrus and spice, thereâ€™s no reason why this recipe wouldnâ€™t be popular at any time. Served with an optional beer chaser and garnished with two olives, cocktail pickle, and a lemon.
Regularly $3.50.
Fecâ€™s Place , 5523 6th Ave
Located in the heart of Downtown Kenosha on 6th Avenue, Fecâ€™s Place is a comfortable sports bar with friendly staff and a fine beverage selection. Served with a beer chaser, two big olives, and a pickle, the Bloody Mary at Fecâ€™s has a classic tangy flavor with an amount of heat that is just right.
Regularly $5.00.
Franks Diner
508 58th St
Downtownâ€™s famous diner does up a Bloody Mary thatâ€™s true to its vintage character. Classic, bold tomato flavor with plenty of spice and attitude. Served in an extra tall glass with a spicy pickle and bendy straw, Franksâ€™ Bloody Mary makes a great sidekick to their popular â€œgarbage plateâ€ or a hearty omelet. With a fun staff and memorable atmosphere, youâ€™ll be back for their breakfast and for the Bloody. Regulary $4.25.
Pazzo , 707 56th St
On the corner of 7th Avenue and 56th Street, Pazzo doubles as an ambient foodspot by day and stylish lounge by night. And whenever itâ€™s served, Pazzoâ€™s Bloody Mary has a distinctly sweet, BBQ-like flavor with a hint of ground black pepper that finishes with a light, spicy kick. The drink is garnished with celery salt around the rim, with two jumbo olives, a lemon, and a lime.
Regularly $7.00.
TGâ€™s Restaurant and Pub
4120 7th Ave
A sign outside of TGâ€™s Restaurant and Pub boasts â€œWisconsinâ€™s #1 Hot Beef.â€ Step up to the bar of this classic Kenosha establishment and the bartender, Lori, makes a similar claim of her Bloody Mary recipe, â€œItâ€™s the best in the world!â€ As one might expect from a place that prides itself on its eats, TGâ€™s Bloody Mary goes the extra mile when it comes to garnishing – beef stick, celery, pickled onion, pickled mushroom, hot pepper, and a big, garlic-stuffed olive.But beware, this is a bloody with an attitude. Besides the traditional tomato juice base, Lori dabbles with The Flavorful Fire, thatâ€™s right,
Cholulaâ€™s hot sauce . Along with other seasonings, including a strong hint of horseradish, Loriâ€™s â€œBloody Mary Supremeâ€ makes for one serious snack.
Regularly $4.50.
$4 during happy hour (Monday-Friday, 3-6 PM), $4 on Sundays.
