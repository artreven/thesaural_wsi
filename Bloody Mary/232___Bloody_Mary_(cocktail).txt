"The
Bloody Mary
has been called
the world's most complex cocktail , and from the standpoint of
flavor chemistry , you've got a blend of hundreds of flavor compounds that act on the taste senses. It covers almost the entire range of human taste sensations --
sweet, salty, sour and umami or savory
-- but not bitter."
Research
that's part of the
International Year of Chemistry .

Wow.
Just wow.
The Bloody Mary is my favorite drink to make because it has so many ingredients.
I think I make a pretty good one, too.
vodka
tom juice
squeeze of lime
ground pepper
garlic salt (celery salt is a legal substitute in most states - check your local laws)
Worcesteshire sauce (don't confuse it with soy sauce!)
Tabasco sauce
and the piece of resistance - horseradish or (if you can get real) wasabi.
voila!

I like mine with the merest sprinkle of Old Bay or some other spice mix.
Adds some complexity to the pepper/Tabasco flavor.
The Bloody is one of those cocktails that benefit from creativity and experimentation, rather than strict adherence to traditional rules.
I had one (well, probably three) in Savannah, GA one time that had a kind of background smokiness going on, maybe like a little chipotle

I didn't enjoy a Bloody Mary until I had
Jeffrey Morgenthaler 's. One point in that recipe I question (both steak sauce AND Worcestershire?), but the rest, particularly the garlic, avocado, and horseradish, is brilliant. That half a small avocado tempers the whole pitcher.
And I use gin or aquavit with his mix, not vodka. And hit it with a dash of Angostura bitters.

I love Red Beer and tomato products, dislike vodka in general and absolutely hate any Bloody Mary I've had. Like y6y6y6, I don't know why. It seems like, considering that I'm totally an epicurean AND a gourmet, I would get down on a good one. But I just can't do it. I even had a snooty friend make me one she promised I would love, and I got through 1/4 before giving up in sad disgust. Am I doing something wrong? An aquavit varietal sounds good (though I resent it being referred to as Danish when everyone knows Swedish aquavit from Skåne is superior), as does gin...but maybe I'm just a lost cause. posted by

I'm not totally positive, but I think that texture is the big problem for most bloody mary dislikers.
Pureed tomato juice can be sort of thick and heavy, and when you add a bunch of other stuff to it, it can get even thicker.
If your tongue doesn't like thick stuff, maybe you can't get to the awesome drunken flavor. posted by

Also I'm going to point out that the chemists didn't say "use cheap vodka", they said you can be "economical" with the vodka. There's a big difference. Vodka is unlike almost every other liquor in its value curve--whereas merely avoiding the cheap stuff isn't enough when picking a good scotch or bourbon, the 'good enough' tier of vodka really is a plateau, above which nothing really rises.
There is no artistry in the stuff; its very definition is a neutral tasting spirit. It's the product of industrial processes. That's why your favorite rapper can package and sell the stuff. Filter it enough, and it becomes premium.
tl;dr - buy Smirnoff. I promise you won't be able to pass a blind taste between that Stoli and Ketel posted by

The Caesar
(basically a Bloody Mary but with Clamato instead of Tomato Juice) was invented in Canada and is one of our country's most popular cocktails.
(Recently, we were on a trip to Cuba and had a good laugh seeing some fellow canucks who'd brought along their own jugs of Clamato so they could make their own Caesars instead of drinking the resort's Bloody Marys!)
Clamato sounds disgusting (clam juice and tomato juice) but is actually delicious.
I haven't had the pleasure of trying
Beefamato
but I would hope it would be a similar sounds terrible/tastes great result.
Oh, and my personal favourite hot sauce substitution is
Marie Sharp's .

While I fully agree that a "true" martini* is made only with gin, I do remember reading once that most vodka drinks used to be made with gin.
In other words, I believe the original Bloody Mary (no one dares type "BM", I see) was made with gin.

So n+1 on the Caesar, which is fantastic and I've never understood why they're not more popular. The only reason you find Clamato in every Canadian grocery store is to make Caesars with, it's not like clamato by itself is some fantastic drink.
Some additions:
- a dash of balsamic is indeed great
- use a pickle spear instead of celery as the garnish
Apparently some people like a bit of horseradish to go in with the tabasco, but to me that's crazy talk. Just the seasoned salt on the rim and a small dash of tabasco. And the pickle. posted by

Pureed tomato juice can be sort of thick and heavy, and when you add a bunch of other stuff to it, it can get even thicker.
it's always served over ice, so it will thin out pretty quickly. And having grown up drinking tomato juice with fancy dinners (I have no idea why this was a family tradition), it's not that thick. And vodka is only going to thin it out, it's not like you're adding thickeners. posted by

(The problem I have is that after years of tending bar the only recipe I have memorized for the mix is a 5-gallon batch, and it doesn't scale. And it's rare that I need that much Bloody Mary mix. I should just go ahead and make it -- it makes for a tasty Virgin Mary, too.) posted by

Well yes,
in the novels , he orders roughly the same amount of gin martinis as vodka martinis.
But all is forgiven, because the very first drink Bond ever orders is one of his own concoction: the Vesper. And it's quite good, if you
compensate
for how the ingredients have changed over the years. Besides adding back the bitterness of the now-extinct Kina* Lillet, you'll want to:
"use 100-proof Stolichnaya vodka to bring the alcohol content of the Vodka back to 1953 levels."

I recently had an amazing Bloody Maria variant at Il Matto in NYC. It was called a Bloody Frida, and contained... if I can recall correctly... ginger-infused tequila, tomato juice, worchestershire, tobasco, and "tom yum gum," which was a spicy, curry-like powder sprinkled on the top. I have this habit where I end up drinking tomato-juice-based products very quickly, so two of those went down my gullet fast enough to leave my boozy head swirling.

I'm drinking Knob Creek (shh, I'm currently too cheap for Blanton's), so I guess that's what I'm in the mood for. In an ideal world I'd be drinking St. Germain and gin cocktails doused with lemon juice and served in an elegant, crystal high-ball...at least my future self has something to look forward to. posted by

I'm a HUGE aficionado and this thread is killing me.
Nice thick tomato juice, celery salt, easy on the black pepper ferchrissakes, Fresh tabasco, The horseradish is key, as are olives, in the drink and on a toothpick balanced correctly, and olive juice just a half teaspoon or so. Bay spice crusted on the glass. BIG GLASS or hell make it a nice big mug. Bloody's should never be in a standard glass and they should ALWAYS be a double. Some decent Vodka, using the absolute top shelf is a waste of money. Grey Goose or Ketel, if you're feeling rich, or Tito's,
Finlandia or Absolute.
And it needs to be made fresh.
THAT is key.
Everyone does the premix shit though for brunches, what're you gonna do?
A a nice bloody freezing cold limed Sol or Pacifico to chase the whole thing down.
Delicious, if I do say so myself. posted by

I generally believe cocktails should be made to a rough formula. Deviation is fine, but it is no longer the named cocktail.
A Bloody Mary, on the other hand, is the salad bar of the drink world. Take a glass and fill it with whatever the heck you like and enjoy. You want to use gin? Go ahead! You want to infuse your vodka with horseradish? Mazel tov! You want to add anchovy paste? Please do, good buddy. posted by

The preceeding discussion suggests that a teaspoon or less of

might add to the interest.
Drinks with falernum are invariably complex.
When people who like rum ask me for a complex drink, I serve them a
Port Antonio .
As for that anchovy suggestion upthread, Worcestershire sauce is anchovies, just the same way Soylent Green is people. posted by

A question about Caesars, which I love: is there a dependable recipe for DIY Clamato?
The Mott's stuff is filled with preservatives and
other
non-essentials.
Suggestions for alternatives which preserve the Caesar-ness of it all would also be appreciated. I'm not inclined to cook clams myself, but if that's what has to be done, then that's what has to be done. posted by

GeckoDundee
has it -- ketchup. Horrifying, I know.
Not a lot of ketchup -- but more than a token amount. For three reasons -- ketchup gives the mix some body, so after you've added ice and vodka the drink still has a nice structure; ketchup rounds the flavor out nicely, adding a sweet note that blends well with the salt and spice; ketchup is bright red, it brings a mix that can tend to be brownish back to a cheerful crimson.
OK, here you go, my Bloody Mary mix. I've deliberately left measurements out, but the list is in (roughly) descending order of quantity:
Tomato juice (NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT V8 *shudder*)
Ketchup
Worcestershire sauce
Horseradish
Lime juice
Olive brine
Texas Pete's Hot Sauce (more flavor, less heat, less vinegary than Tabasco, I prefer it, YMMV)
Celery juice (Really. They sell it! It's true!)
White pepper (because there's nothing more aesthetically displeasing to me than a flake of black pepper clinging to an ice cube. Ugh. White pepper is invisible in the mix)
Note that there's no salt added -- the tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, and olive brine have plenty.
Add a shot of vodka and ice and shake (not stir! it's thick, you want it to be thoroughly blended), pour into a tall glass rimmed with Old Bay (cheers,
Greg Nog !) and garnished with a flag of two olives speared on a lime wedge. I don't hold with the traditional celery garnish, it just gets in the way. A pickled string bean is too cutesy and too much hassle. But lime and olive are flavors already in the drink and have the eye-pleasing splash of green the drink needs to bring it all together. posted by

V8 and MadButcher's Salsa - add dash of Worcestershire, quick pulse or five in blender so not completely pureed.
Mix in vodka.
Garnish with pickle slice and tablespoon of salsa on top of the last ice cube.
Drink with straw.

The secret is.....GIN!
For years I loved the IDEA of the Bloody Mary (as so many have said already, so many yums, so horrible together) but could never stand them, try as I might. Then one day someone suggested gin instead of vodka and my world was new. I love them now. Nothing better for a Sunday brunch. My favorite recipe is a kind of gazpacho variation on the theme.

Sugar
You go to Hell.
I would be absolutely furious if I were given a Bloody with any more sweetness than comes from the Worcestershire sauce. Like anywhere from pouting and fuming to seriously throwing things pissed, depending on my hangover. There are few things grosser than tucking into something you expect to be tart and salty only to get a mouthful of bblleeeeeaaahhh sugar.
I actually think that sounds worse than the Slim Jim. posted by

BOP:
ketchup is bright red, it brings a mix that can tend to be brownish back to a cheerful crimson.
If one's BM's are heading away from a nice subdued (at the very most), red and into any sort of brown, one is using way too much Worcestershire sauce. There's few things sadder than when a BM has the amateurs imprint of the Worcestershire sauce riding too strong in the mix.
DO NOT DO THAT.
If you do that, it's off to cocktail jail with you.
