The best brunch in Amsterdam at lovefood
Love a homemade Sunday brunch with all the fixings? Then look no further than Amsterdam's own  lovefood  brunch at  Vlaming brasserie.
Housed on the picturesque  Prinsengracht , just blocks from the  Anne Frank House,  Vlaming opens its doors only one Sunday afternoon a month to let chef Jason Hartley take over the kitchen and serve up his renowned lovefood brunch.
The  menu  is chock full of breakfast favourites ranging from eggs Benedict, French toast, American pancakes, homemade English sausage and more.
For the hungriest bruncher, the menu offers full-on platters like the meat lover's Full Mikey and the piled high breakfast burrito.
What's more, diners get to indulge their Sunday cravings with a make-it-yourself  Bloody Mary  bar. Nothing says weekend hangover cure like a spicy Bloody Mary!
Lovefood is a  concept  that was born from two of Hartley's strongest beliefs. One is to harness the role that good food plays in our lives, from the heartiness of a delicious meal to the laughter and conversations carried out over the table.
The second is the connection that food has with our cultural heritage. In a world where we are constantly challenged to find the next new thing, Hartley says we need to first understand where we came from - and for him that quest starts in the kitchen.
Using only the finest, freshest ingredients, each plate is prepared with delicate attention. This is not your average fast food breakfast. Lovefood brunch is an entire experience where the meal is a highlight, but your company and the atmosphere make up the full picture.
Lovefood brunches are held once a month from 11.00 until 15.00. Mark your calendars now and treat your taste buds to the best in breakfast!
