Beltane, May day lore
Celebration included frolicking throughout the countryside,
dancing the Maypole, leaping over fires, and "going a maying".
It was customary for young lovers to spend the night in the forest. The earliest May Day celebrations appeared in pre- Christian
times, with the festival of
Flora , the Roman
Goddess
of flowers, and the
Walpurgis Night
celebrations of the
Germanic countries.
It is also associated with the
Gaelic
Beltane . Many pagan celebrations were abandoned or
Christianized
during the process of conversion in Europe. May Day may be best known for its tradition of dancing the
Maypole
and crowning of the
Queen of the May . Various
Neopagan
groups celebrate reconstructed versions of these customs on May the 1st.
The day was a traditional summer holiday in many pre- Christian European
pagan
cultures.
While February 1 was the first day of
Spring ,
May 1 was the first day of
summer ; hence, the
summer solstice
on June 25 (now June 21) was
Midsummer .
In the
Roman Catholic
tradition, May is observed as Mary's month,
and in these circles May Day is usually a celebration of the Blessed
Virgin Mary .
In this connection, in works of art, school skits, and so forth,
Mary's head will often be adorned with flowers in a
May crowning .
Fading in popularity since the late 20th century is the giving of "May baskets," small baskets of sweets and/or flowers, usually left anonymously on neighbours' doorsteps. Traditional English May Day
rites
and
celebrations
include
Morris dancing ,
crowning a
May Queen
and celebrations involving a
Maypole .
Much of this tradition derive from the
pagan Anglo-Saxon
customs held during " Þrimilci-mōnaþ "
(the
Old English
name for the month of May meaning
Month of Three Milkings ). It is most associated with towns and villages celebrating springtime
fertility
and revelry with village fetes and community gatherings. May Day festivities, where the Jack in the Green festival was revived in 1976 and continues to lead an annual procession of
morris dancers
through the town on the May Bank Holiday.
Perhaps the most significant of the traditions is the
Maypole ,
around which traditional dancers circle with ribbons. A
morris dance
is a form of
English
folk dance
usually accompanied by music.
It is based on rhythmic stepping and the execution of choreographed figures by a group of dancers.
Implements such as sticks, swords,
handkerchiefs
and bells may also be wielded by the dancers. In a small number of dances for one or two men, steps are performed near and across a pair of clay
tobacco
pipes laid across each other on the floor. Claims that English records, dating back to 1448, mention the morris dance are open to dispute.
There is no mention of "morris" dancing earlier than the late 15th century, although early records such as
Bishops ' "Visitation Articles" mention sword dancing,
guising
and other dancing activities as well as
mumming plays . Furthermore, the earliest records invariably mention "Morys" in a court setting,
and both men and women are mentioned as dancing. The term is derived from
moorish
dance , attested as
Morisk dance
and
moreys daunce, morisse daunce
in the mid-15th century. The spelling
Morris-dance appears in the 17th century.
By 1492
Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castille
succeeded in
driving the Moors out of Spain
and unifying the country.
In celebration of this a pageant known as a
Moresca
was devised and performed.
This can still be seen performed in places such as
Ainsa ,
Aragon .
Incorporated into this pageant was the local dance — the
baloteao .
This too can still be seen performed in the villages of Aragon. The original ´Moresca´ is a sword dance.
The sticks in Morris dance are a residual of the swords in the 'Moresca'.
The similarity to what became known as the English "morris" is undoubted.
Early court records state that the "moresque" was performed at court in her honour, including the dance — the "moresque" or "morisce" or "morys" dance. Music was traditionally provided by either a
pipe and tabor
or a
fiddle .
These are still used today, but the most common instrument is the melodeon .
Accordions
and
concertinas
are also common, and other instruments are sometimes used. Often drums are employed. Jack in the Green has become identified with the mysterious
Green Man
depicted in mediaeval church carvings and is widely felt to be an embodiment of natural fertility,
a spirit of the primeval greenwood and a
trickster ;
by extension he is linked to such mythological characters as
Puck ,
Robin Goodfellow ,
Robin Hood, the
wild man , and the
Green Knight ,
among others such as the folklore behind the legend of Robin Hood. These festivities were variously associated with
Easter
Monday,
St George 's Day (23 April), May Day, and
Whitsuntide .
Other related figures in Britain include the
Burry Man of South Queensferry
and the Garland King of
Castleton , Derbyshire, who parades on Oak Apple Day . May Day is related to the
Celtic
festival of
Beltane
and the
Germanic
festival of
Walpurgis Night .
May Day falls exactly half of a year from November 1,
another
cross-quarter day
which is also associated with various northern European
pagan
and
neopagan
festivals such as
Samhain .
May Day marks the end of the unfarmable winter half of the year in the Northern hemisphere,
and it has traditionally been an occasion for popular and often raucous celebrations. The fair maid who, the first of May, Goes to the fields at break of day & washes in dew from the hawthorn tree, Will ever after handsome be. - English folk rhyme Beltane
or
Beltaine
is the anglicised spelling of
Old Irish
Beltain
( modern Irish
Bealtaine
] ,
Scottish Gaelic Bealltainn
,
the
Gaelic
name for either the month of
May
or the festival that takes place on
first day of May . In
Irish Gaelic , the month of May is known as
Mí Bhealtaine
or
Bealtaine ,
and the festival as
Lá Bealtaine
('day of Bealtaine' or, 'May Day').
In Scottish Gaelic , the month is known as either
(An) Cèitean
or
a' Mhàigh ,
and the festival is known as
Latha Bealltainn
or simply
Bealltainn .
The feast was also known as
Céad Shamhain
or
Cétshamhainin
from which the word
Céitean
derives.
Beltane was formerly spelled 'Bealtuinn' in Scottish Gaelic. In Modern Irish,
Oidhche Bealtaine
or
Oíche Bealtaine
is May Eve,
and
Lá Bealtaine
is May Day.
Mí na Bealtaine , or simply
Bealtaine
is the name of the month of May. In
Neopaganism , Bealtaine is considered a
cross-quarter day ,
marking the midpoint in the
Sun 's progress between the
spring equinox
and summer
solstice .
The
astronomical
date for this midpoint is closer to 5 May or 7 May, but this can vary from year to year. Old Irish
Bel(l)taine
is derived from a
Common Celtic
*belo-te(p)niâ , meaning "bright fire"
(where the element
*belo- might be cognate with the English word
bale
[as in 'bale-fire'] meaning 'white' or 'shining'. In
medieval Ireland , the main Bealtaine fire was held on the central hill of
Uisneach
'the navel of Ireland',
one of the ritual centres of the country, which is located in what is now
County Westmeath . The lighting of bonfires on
Oidhche Bhealtaine
seems to have survived to the present day only in
County Limerick . In
Irish mythology , the beginning of the summer season for the
Tuatha Dé Danann
and the
Milesians
started at Bealtaine.
Great bonfires would mark a time of purification and transition,
heralding in the season in the hope of a good harvest later in the year,
and were accompanied with ritual acts to protect the people from any harm by
Otherworldly
spirits,
such as the Aos Sí . Like the festival of
Samhain ,
opposite Beltane on 31 October Beltane was also a time when the Otherworld was seen as particularly close at hand. In Scotland, boughs of
juniper
were sometimes thrown on two fires to add an additional element of purification and blessing to the smoke.
People would also pass between the two fires to purify themselves. Beltane marked the beginning of the pastoral summer season when the herds of livestock were driven out to the summer pastures and mountain grazing lands.
Due to the change from the
Julian calendar
to the
Gregorian calendar ,
Bealltainn
in Scotland was commonly celebrated on 15 May
while in Ireland
Sean Bhealtain
/ "Old May" began about the night of 11 May. The lighting of
bonfires
on
Oidhche Bhealtaine
('the eve of
Bealtaine' ) on mountains and hills of ritual and political significance was one of the main activities of the festival.
In modern
Scottish Gaelic ,
Latha Buidhe Bealltainn
or
Là Buidhe Bealltainn
('the yellow day of Bealltain') is used to describe the first day of May.
This term
Lá Buidhe Bealtaine
is also used in Irish and is translated as 'Bright May Day'.
1 May custom , practised in the
Scottish Highlands , where young people met on the moors, lighted a bonfire and made an oatmeal cake toasted at the embers.
The cake was divided, one of the pieces marked with charcoal, and, drawing the pieces blindfolded,
the person who got the marked piece was compelled to leap over the flames three times. Another common aspect of the festival which survived up until the early 20th century in Ireland
was the hanging of May Boughs on the doors and windows of houses and the erection of May Bushes in farmyards, which usually consisted either of a branch of
rowan / caorthann
(mountain ash)
or more commonly
whitethorn / sceach geal
(hawthorn) which is in bloom at the time and is commonly called the 'May Bush' or just 'May' The practice of decorating the May Bush or
Dos Bhealtaine
with flowers, ribbons, garlands and coloured egg shells has survived to some extent among the
Gaelic diaspora . Walpurgis Night
(Walpurgisnacht) is a traditional
spring festival
on 30 April or 1 May in large parts of
Central
and
Northern Europe .
Its celebration is associated with dancing and with
bonfires . Wiccans
and Wiccan-inspired
Neopagans
celebrate a variation of Beltane as a
Sabbat ,
one of the eight solar holidays.
Although the holiday may use features of the Gaelic Bealtaine, such as the
bonfire , it bears more relation to the Germanic May Day festival,
both in its significance (focusing on fertility) and its rituals (such as
maypole
dancing).
Some Wiccans celebrate "High Beltaine" by enacting a ritual union of the
May Lord
and
May Lady . Among the Wiccan Sabbats, Beltane is a
cross-quarter day ; it is celebrated in the northern hemisphere on 1 May and in the southern hemisphere on 1 November.
Beltane follows
Ostara
and precedes
Midsummer . The May Queen is a
girl
who is selected to ride or walk at the front of a
parade
for
May Day
celebrations.
She wears a white
gown
to symbolise purity and usually a
tiara
or
crown .
Her duty is to begin the
May Day
celebrations.
She is generally crowned by flowers and makes a speech before the dancing begins.
Certain age groups dance round a
Maypole
celebrating youth and the spring time. Beltane is the first of the three yearly Faerie Realm festivals.
The other two festivals occur on Mid-Summer’s Eve and All Hallow’s Eve.
In ancient Celtic countries,
a new day began at sunset, so the “eve” of a day was not “the day before” as we calculate time today.
Thus, Beltane Eve/May Eve and Beltane Day/May Day occurred on the same “day;”
i.e., within the same 24 hour period, beginning at 6 p.m. on April 30 th
and ending at 6 p.m. on May 1 st ). The Faerie Courts These
liminal
dates also signal a great change in the Faerie Realm.
From Beltane Eve to All Hallow’s Eve, the Seelie Court reigns supreme.
From All Hallow’s Eve to Beltane Eve, the Unseelie Court holds sway. The most significant difference between the two Courts is compassion, and the lack thereof.
The Seelie Court and its members exhibit profound compassion for humans,
where the Unseelie Court is pitiless.
Like the Unseelie Court, however, the Seelie are swift to retaliate for an injury or insult.
They also are not beneath stealing cattle or borrowing whatever they want from humans,
which includes using humans for their own purposes (as obscure as those purposes may be).
Even Seelie faeries hold to the saying, “All that’s yours is mine; all that’s mine is my own,”
though among themselves stealing is verboten. As a rule, however, we can rely on Seelie faeries to be helpful and fair in their dealings with us.
Unlike the Unseelie fae,
they return the things they borrow, show gratitude for kindnesses we show them, provide patronage to those who find true love, show delight in music and dancing,
and display an appreciation for neatness, order, beauty and fertility.
Since Beltane is a festival of fertility to promote the bountiful crops planted at the beginning of spring, it is entirely proper that the Seelie Court emerges on this day to help us celebrate love, lust and life. As May Eve heralds the reawakening of the Faerie Realm and Seelie Court from winter’s grasp, Mid-Summer’s Eve celebrates the recovery of their full strength from winter’s travails.
Then on November Eve, the Unseelie Court makes its pass through mortal lands on the Wild Hunt before the hand of winter closes its fist.
As so the wheel of the year turns, even for the fae. It is on these dates that the veils between the two worlds are at their thinnest, when the two worlds intermingle and unite, and wild magic abounds.
These are the times when the fae are most accessible and visible–look through a sprig of rowan twisted into a ring and seek the fae at dusk to better your chances of getting a peek.
However, be forewarned that neither Seelie nor Unseelie fae like to be watched and may consider this an infringement on their privacy for which you might be rebuked. The Faerie Queen Beltane is a favored time for the Queen of Faerie to ride out on her white horse,
seeking one of us to lure away with her to the Summerland .
Sit beneath a tree on Beltane and you may see her or hear the sound of her horse’s bells as she rides through the night.
Should you actually meet with her, hide your face and she will pass you by;
look at her, however, and her unearthly beauty will ensnare you.
She may then choose you to journey with her to the Summerland where you must not eat,
nor drink nor speak for seven years.
At the end of seven years,
or perhaps be rescued like
Tam Lin .
If you’re very fortunate and the Queen grants you a special dispensation,
you may gain your freedom along with the gift of true seeing/prophecy,
like
Thomas the Rhymer .
However, eat, drink or speak, and you will never be allowed to leave. Faerie Pranks When the Seelie fae awaken from their winter repose,
like any creature released from a dull existence they are carefree and full of mischief.
The two things they’ll be after the most is a piece of your ritual Beltane fire and all your fresh butter.
To protect yourself from faerie pranks, place rowan branches around your windows and doors,
and have the youngest member of the family gather primroses on May Eve
and throw them at the door of your home. Faerie Blessing To receive a Seelie faerie blessing,
leave offerings of festival bread and drink on your doorsteps and at crossroads.
Some traditional festival breads include: Celtic :
A bread of sweet dough made with sweetmeat (a candied root, such as ginger or
sea holly ) and spices. Scotland :
A
bonnach Bealtain , which is a heavy, flat cake of unleavened barley or oatmeal dough formed into a round or oval shape, then cooked on a griddle; also known as bannock and, when cut into wedges, scone.
When made with nine knobs, it is an offering to the fox, the eagle and the hooded crow so they will not do harm to the fields and flocks.
The hooded crow is the manifestation of the Cailleach, also known as the Queen of Winter.
The bonnach should be glazed with a thin batter of whipped egg, milk, cream and a little oatmeal. Wales :
A
bara brith , which literally means “speckled bread,” that can be either a yeast bread enriched with dried fruit (raisins, currants and candied peel) or something more like a fruitcake made with self-rising flour without yeast. Ireland :
A
báirín breac , which is a yeasted bread with sultanas
and raisins added. Brittany :
A
morlaix brioche , which is a speckled bread like the bara brith of Wales. Prepare the bread on May eve without the use of either steel or iron.
Also, leave any food left over from your Beltane festivities as an offering to the fae,
just as we leave crops not harvested by Samhain in the fields as their due. The Number Seven As you study faeries, myths and folklore, you will find that the number seven is highly significant: Thomas the Rhymer stayed with the Faerie Queen for seven years The Faerie Queen must pay a tithe to Hell every seven years Servitude lasts for seven years The Pleiades is known as the seven sisters Mortal Kings must be sacrificed every seven years to ensure the fertility and health of their kingdom (at first literally, and later symbolically) Curses last for seven years The seventh son/daughter of a seventh son/daughter has the gift of true seeing Our ancestors believed there were seven planets; the Egyptians had seven original and higher gods;
the Phœnicians seven kabiris; the Persians, seven sacred horses of Mithra;
the Parsees, seven angels opposed by seven demons,
and seven celestial abodes paralleled by seven lower regions.
The seven gods were often represented as one seven-headed deity.
The whole of heaven was subject to the seven planets; hence, in nearly all the old religious systems we find seven heavens. It is no great wonder, then, that every seven years on May Eve,
the faeries gather to fight among themselves for the rights to our upcoming harvest.
The winning faction takes the best ears of grain for themselves for the next seven years. Herbs and Flowers Throughout the centuries, the ancient Celts noted which springtime herbs and flowers were attractive to the fae and which afforded protection: Attracts Carnation :
Red ones will draw faeries that enjoy healing animals. Clover :
Not only do bees go wild over this diminutive ground cover, faeries love it, too. Cowslip :
Spring faeries will happily come to live in any garden containing this herb. Dandelion :
The fae use the dandelion to make beverages, just as humans do (i.e., dandelion wine). Foxglove *:
A favorite of earth elementals and gives faeries the power of flight. Hawthorn :
Sacred to faeries, especially the Queen of the Seelie Court.
Faeries that may help or hinder often live in hawthorns, so they are best left undisturbed (i.e., uncut and unmoved).
Try tying wishing ribbons to a hawthorn so friendly faeries can help them come true.
Be sure to leave an offering or libation if you do. Heliotrope *:
Enjoyed by fire elementals. Hollyhock *:
A faerie favorite, particularly the pink variety. Lilac :
The gentle scent draws faeries and wards off evil spirits. Lobelia *:
Helps to attract winged faeries. Mushrooms *:
Often used by faeries to mark the boundaries of their sacred circles or portals to the Faerie Realm. Pansy :
Attracts parades of trooping faeries. Primrose :
Although the fae like this flower, it has the power to repel them from human habitations.
It may also give faeries their power of invisibility. Sassafras :
Enjoyed by air elementals. Shamrock :
A form of clover adored by all Celtic faeries. Protects Bluebell :
If bluebells ring in your garden, malevolent faeries are near and you need to leave quickly. Dill :
The fresh plant has a scent faeries dislike.
In the Mediterranean area, dill weed placed under an infant’s bed will prevent the child being snatched by faeries and replaced with a changeling. Gorse :
Repels virtually all faerie life. Lilac :
The gentle scent draws faeries and wards off evil spirits. Mistletoe *:
Especially good for protecting against and repelling faeries, but can also attract unpleasant tree faeries. Morning Glory *:
Repels unwanted night faeries. Primrose :
Although the fae like this flower, it has the power to repel them from human habitations.
It may also give faeries their power of invisibility. Rosemary :
The fresh plant protects from baneful faeries.
In Mexico, mothers place this herb under their beds, in baby’s cribs and in windows for protection.
To protect a couple from faeries with bad intentions and ensure happiness in their first year of marriage, the bride and groom should carry this herb during their wedding ceremony. *These plants are poisonous and are to be cultivated only with great caution.
They should never be grown where children or pets are present. Beltane Ritual Here is a simple ritual that anyone can do with a minimum of fuss: In a woodland clearing or meadow, or any other naturally secluded and preserved spot where you can sense the fae, spread a clean green cloth.
On it place small cakes** and flowers, especially primroses, in a circle.
In addition to the flowers listed above, other flowers that you may want to consider are roses,
violets, apple and orange blossoms, daisies, columbine, jasmine, and daffodils.
Sit quietly until you feel the magic of the fae around you and then ask for a boon or blessing,
using your own words or the following: The Maid of Spring has busy been To coax forth life both lush and green As all await the evening when Ye ride forth, great Seelie Faerie Queen The veil between our two worlds thins Our magic mingles, wild and tame Tis now that Summer’s bounty begins Blessed by thee, and Beltane’s flame I ask only one boon of thee In doing is the payment worth To share our purpose equally Protect and nurture Mother Earth In celebration of the May I leave these offerings for thee And fare thee well until the day Midsummer Eve it turns to be Written by Faerie♥Kat, 2010 Leave your small cake and floral offerings and walk around the green cloth three times deosil
(i.e., clockwise).
Then slowly walk the path back to your home in silence,
listening for the sound of laughter and bells.
Return the next day to retrieve your belongings and look for any signs or gifts the Seelie Faerie Queen may have left for you. **See festival breads above.

Pastel colored ribbons
Tall white, yellow or green pillar candle
Candle holder (stand) Cut lengths of ribbon around 18 inches each, in pretty Springtime colors.( pastels) Tie a gold craft bell to each end of ribbon (a tooth pick helps this process) Tie ribbons starting at 3/4 way down the pillar candle.
Knot three times but don't tie bows, you need lots of length on the ribbons.
Tie as many as you like snaking your way up the candle, leaving 1/4 candle bare.
Place in a candle stand that will raise the candle about 6 - 8 inches, so the ribbons can "drape"

What Flower
Are You?
Which tarot card are you?
You are The Star
Hope, expectation, Bright promises.
The Star is one of the great cards of faith, dreams realised
The Star is a card that looks to the future. It does not predict any immediate or powerful change, but it does predict hope and healing. This card suggests clarity of vision, spiritual insight. And, most importantly, that unexpected help will be coming, with water to quench your thirst, with a guiding light to the future. They might say you're a dreamer, but you're not the only one.
What Tarot Card are You? Take the Test to Find Out.
who would you be in 1400 AD?
Your result for The Who Would You Be in 1400 AD Test... The Prioress You scored 16% Cardinal, 56% Monk, 59% Lady,
and 38% Knight!
You are a moral person and are also highly intellectual. You like your solitude but are also kind and helpful to those around you. Guided by a belief in the goodness of mankind you will likely be christened a saint after your life is over. You scored high as both the Lady and the Monk. You can try again to get a more precise description of either the Monk or the lady, or you can be happy that you're an individual.

My rainbow colours..
Your rainbow is strongly shaded
violet and white.               What is says about you: You are a contemplative person. You appreciate beauty and craftsmanship. People depend on you to make them feel secure. You are patient and will keep trying to understand something until you've mastered it. Find the colors of your rainbow at spacefem.com.
