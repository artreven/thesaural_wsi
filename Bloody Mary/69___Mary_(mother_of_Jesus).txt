Egypt
Hi Everyone!!!
Egypt . If you are into history
and big temples this is the place to be. My first thought was how I could
travel to
Egypt
and be safe?? I was, after all, traveling alone.  I really wanted to
go.  Coming from
Iraq
and wanting to go to
Egypt
and be safe might sound strange but I feel safe here in
Iraq . I have a great job and don’t
travel outside the wire…. Just a few rockets and mortars to deal with. Anyway,
I didn’t have to go it alone.  I found All Singles Travel. So that made it
easy, pay them and let them take care of the details and security.  I’m
glad I did. It was a fantastic trip and the travel group couldn’t have been
better.
I
arrived in
Cairo
a few hours ahead of the group so I caught a taxi and arrived safely to the
Conrad hotel. The hotel was nice and I decided to take a bath since I haven’t
seen a tub in about a year. I latter hooked up with the rest of the group for
dinner.
The
next day we headed out to
Giza
to see the
Pyramids, Sphinx and
Cheops
Boat
Museum .
This
Ancient Egyptian
necropolis
consists of the
Pyramid of Khufu
(also known as the
Great Pyramid
and the
Pyramid of Cheops ;
coordinates
29°58′31.3″N,
31°07′52.7″E ), the somewhat smaller
Pyramid of Khafre
(or
Chephren; coordinates
29°58′42.6″N,
31°08′05.0″E ), and the relatively modest-size
Pyramid of Menkaure
(or Mykerinus; coordinates
29°58′19.8″N,
31°07′43.4″E ), along with a number of smaller satellite
edifices, known as "queens" pyramids, causeways and valley pyramids,
and most noticeably the
Great
Sphinx . Associated with these royal monuments are the tombs of high
officials and much later burials and monuments (from the
New Kingdom
onwards),
signifying the reverence to those buried in the necropolis.
View away from Pyramids
and city.
These were our tour guides
for the trip. Very knowledgeable and can speak like 5 languages!!!
After lunch we went to the
forgettable
Pharonic
Village
and some rug
place.
J
But later that evening we
went to the Pyramid Sound and Light show. A myth is that Pink Floyd played here
and initiated the sound and light show but they never played in
Egypt .
After the show we went
back to the hotel to relax.
The next morning we went
to the
Egyptian
Museum
and then shopping before catching a happy flight to
Luxor .
1st thing we did was visit
Luxor
temple.
The ancient Egyptian city of
Thebes ,
Luxor
has frequently been characterised as the
"world's greatest open air museum", the ruins of the temple complexes
at
Karnak
and
Luxor
standing within the modern city. Immediately opposite, across the
Nile River ,
lie the monuments, temples and tombs on the West Bank
Necropolis ,
which include the
Valley of the Kings
and
Valley of the Queens .
Girls just want to have
fun.
Luxor Temple
is known in the
Egyptian language
as
ipet
resyt , or "the southern harem", the temple was dedicated to the
Theban
Triad
of
Amun ,
Mut , and
Chons
and was, during the
New Kingdom , the focus of
the annual
Opet Festival ,
in which a cult statue of Amun was paraded down the Nile from nearby
Karnak Temple
(ipet-isut)
to stay there for a while, with his consort Mut, in a celebration of fertility
– whence its name
It’s dark now and time to
check in to our boat (King Tut II) and grab some dinner.
The next morning we all
get up waaaayyy to early and visit:
The Colossi of
Memnon ,
The Valley of the Kings ,
Valley of the Queens , The
Temple of Hatshepsut ,
a tourist trap for statues made from Alabaster and then the
Temple
of
Karnack .
It was a Busy day!!!!
You would never guess they
are tired.
.
Colossi of Memnon
The original function of the
Colossi was to stand guard at the entrance to
Amenhotep's
memorial temple
(or
mortuary
temple ): a massive cult centre built during the pharaoh's lifetime, where
he was worshipped as a god-on-earth both before and after his departure from
this world. In its day, this temple complex was the largest and most opulent in
Egypt .
Covering a total of 35 ha, even later rivals such as
Ramesses II 's
Ramesseum
or
Ramesses III 's
Medinet Habu
were unable
to match it in area; even the
Temple of Karnak , as
it stood in Amenhotep's time, was smaller.
Hatshepsut
was the fifth
pharaoh
of the
Eighteenth
dynasty
of
ancient
Egypt . She was believed to have been co-regent from
about
1479 to 1458
BC (years 7 to 21 of
Thutmose III ) . She is
regarded as the earliest known
queen regnant
in history
and as the first great woman in recorded history. She was only the second
known
woman to assume the throne as "King of Upper and
Lower
Egypt " after Queen
Sobekneferu
of the 12th
Dynasty of Egypt.
Hatshepsut reestablished the trade networks that had
been disrupted during the
Hyksos '
occupation of Egypt (the
Second
Intermediate Period ), the wealth of the 18th dynasty that has become so
famous since the discovery of the burial of
Tutankhamun
began to be
collected. She oversaw the preparations and funding for a mission to the
Land of Punt . The
expedition set out in her name with five ships, each measuring seventy feet
long, and with several sails; each ship accommodated 210 men, including sailors
and thirty rowers. Many goods were bought in Punt, notably
myrrh , which is said to have been
Hatshepsut's favorite fragrance. Most notably however, the Egyptians returned
from the voyage bearing thirty-one live frankincense trees, whose roots were
carefully kept in baskets for the duration of the voyage. This was the first
ever recorded attempt to replant foreign trees. She reportedly had the trees
planted in the courts of her Deir el Bahari mortuary temple. She had the
expedition commemorated in relief at Deir el-Bahri, which is famous for its
unflattering depiction of the Queen of Punt. Although many
Egyptologists
have claimed
that her foreign policy was mainly peaceful, there is evidence that she led
successful military campaigns in
Nubia ,
the
Levant
and
Syria
early in her career.
KARNAK
Karnak
consists of four main
parts, of which only one is accessible for tourists and the general public.
This is also the "main" temple part and by far the largest part. One
can probably on that basis redefine the term Karnak, as to be understood as
being the
Precinct of
Amon-Re
only, as this is the only part most visitors normally see. The
three other parts are closed to the public.
There are also a few smaller
temples and sanctuaries located outside the enclosing walls of the four main
parts, as well as several avenues of ram-headed
sphinxes
connecting the
Precinct of Mut , the
Precinct of Amon-Re
and
Luxor Temple .
The key difference between
Karnak and most of the other temples and sites in
Egypt
is the length of time over
which it was developed and used. Construction work began in the
16th century BC .
Approximately 30
pharaohs
contributed to the buildings, enabling it to reach a size, complexity and
diversity not seen elsewhere. Few of the individual features of
Karnak
are unique, but the size and number of features is
overwhelming.
In the courtyard at
Karnack.
We leave Karnack for a
stop at the Papyrus shop. And I spend a 100 bucks on a painting I had to have.
Goddess
Hathor .
Goddess of Love, Music, Beauty...and Alcohol.
In
Egyptian mythology ,
Hathor
( Egyptian
for
house
of
Horus ) was originally a
personification of the
Milky
Way , which was seen as the milk that flowed from the udders of a heavenly
cow. Hathor was an ancient goddess, worshipped as a cow-deity from at least
2700 BC , during the
2nd dynasty ,
and possibly even by the
Scorpion
King . The name
Hathor
refers to the encirclement by her, in the form
of the Milky Way, of the night sky and consequently of the god of the sky,
Horus . She was originally seen as
the daughter of
Ra , the creator
whose own cosmic birth was formalised as the
Ogdoad
cosmogeny.
Ahh!!!
Back on board sailing up the nile.
Next morning
Edfu
The town is known for the
major Ptolemaic temple, built between
237 BCE
to
57 BCE . Of all the temple
remains in
Egypt , the
Temple
of
Horus
at Edfu is the most completely preserved. Built from sandstone blocks, the huge
Ptolemaic temple was constructed over the site of a smaller
New Kingdom
temple.
The
Ptolemaic dynasty
was a
Hellenistic
royal family
which ruled the
Ptolemaic
Empire
in
Egypt
for nearly 300 years, from 305 BC to 30 BC.
Ptolemy ,
a
Macedonian
and one of
Alexander the Great 's
generals, was appointed
satrap
of
Egypt
after Alexander's death in 323 BC. In 305 BC, he declared himself King Ptolemy
I, later known as "Soter" (saviour). The Egyptians soon accepted the
Ptolemies as the successors to the pharaohs of independent
Egypt . Ptolemy's family ruled
Egypt
until the
Roman
conquest of 30
BC.  All the male rulers of the dynasty took the name Ptolemy. Ptolemaic
queens, some of whom were the sisters of their husbands, were usually called
Cleopatra, Arsinoe or Berenice. The most famous member of the line was the last
queen,
Cleopatra VII ,
known for her role in the Roman political battles between
Julius Caesar
and
Pompey , and later between
Octavian
and
Mark Antony . Her suicide at
the conquest by
Rome
marked the end of Ptolemaic
rule in
Egypt .
The first
pylon
at
Edfu
Temple
Horus
Isis
Inside the 1 st
Pylon
By now, we are learning to
read.
There are
numerous reliefs, including a depiction of the Feast of the Beautiful Meeting,
the annual reunion between Horus and his wife Hathor. The reliefs are mostly
situated on the inside of the first pylon, and spiritually connect this temple
with
Hathor’s Temple at
the Dendera
complex. During the third month of summer, the priests at the
Dendera complex would place the statue of Hathor on her barque (a ceremonial
barge) and would thus bring the statue to the
Edfu
Temple ,
where it was believed that Horus and Hathor shared a conjugal visit. Each
night, the god and goddess would retire to the mamissi, or berthing house.
East Gate ( Isis )
Inner Sanctuary (NAOS)
A quick ride back through
town to our ship.
Cruising Up the
Nile
Temple
of
Kom
Ombo
The
Temple of Kom Ombo
is an unusual double temple built during the rule
Ptolemaic dynasty
in
the Egyptian town of
Kom Ombo .
One side of the temple is dedicated to the crocodile god
Sobek , god of fertility and
creator of the world. The other side is dedicated to the falcon god
Haroeris , also known as
Horus
the Elder. The temple was
started by
Ptolemy VI
Philometor
(180-145 BC) at the beginning of his reign and added to by other
Ptolemys, most notably
Ptolemy XIII
(47-44 BC), who built the inner and outer hypostyle halls. Much of the temple
has been destroyed by the
Nile ,
earthquakes, and later builders who used the stones for other projects. Some of
the reliefs inside were defaced by
Copts
who once used
the temple as a church. A few of the three-hundred crocodile mummies discovered
in the vicinity are displayed inside the temple.
Back to the ship for the
party.
Abu Simbel
The twin temples were carved
out of the mountainside during the reign of Pharaoh
Ramesses II
in the
13th century BC , as a
lasting monument to himself and his queen
Nefertari , to commemorate his
alleged victory at the
Battle
of Kadesh , and to intimidate his
Nubian
neighbors. The complex
consists of two temples. The larger one is dedicated to
Ra-Harakhty ,
Ptah
and
Amun ,
Egypt 's
three state deities of the time, and features four large statues of Ramesses II
in the facade. The smaller temple is dedicated to the goddess
Hathor , personified by
Nefertari , Ramesses's most
beloved wife (in total, the pharaoh had some 200 wives and concubines)…cool.
The greater Abu Simbel
temple
is generally considered the
grandest and most beautiful of the temples commissioned during the reign of
Ramesses II, and one of the most beautiful in
Egypt .
The facade is 33 meters high,
and 38 meters broad, and guarded by four statues, each of which is 20 meters
high. They were sculptured directly from the rock in which the temple was
located before it was moved. All statues represent Ramesses II, seated on a
throne and wearing the
double
crown
of
Upper
and Lower Egypt . The statue to the left of the entrance was damaged in an
earthquake, leaving only the lower part of the statue still intact.
Nubian Slaves
The Smaller Abu Simbel Temple
is located north of the Greater Temple. It was
carved in the rock by Ramesses II and dedicated to Hathor, the goddess of love
and beauty, and also to his favorite wife,
Nefertari ,
for "whose sake the very sun doeth shine." The façade is adorned by
six statues, four of Ramesses II and two of Nefertari. Most unusually, the six
are the same height, which indicates the esteem in which Nefertari was held.
The entrance leads to a hall containing six pillars bearing the head of the
goddess Hathor.
Hathor
has the two horns with the sun in the middle. Nefertari has the high double
crown of royalty. So it’s both Goddess Hathor and Queen Nefertari.
Quick
trip to the Dam: I’m not sure what
Temple
that is but you could see they were working on it from the dam.???
After the Dam we head out
for my favorite
Temple .
Philae
" Every
part of
Egypt
is interesting
and curious,
but the only place to which the epithet beautiful can be
correctly applied is the
island
of
Philae ... "
Robert Curzon, from 'Visits to the Monasteries of
the
Levant ', 1834
The island temple at
Philae
was constructed over a three-century period, by
the Greek
Ptolemaic
dynasty
and the
Roman
Principate . The principal deity of the temple complex was
Isis , but other temples and
shrines were dedicated to her son
Horus
and the goddess
Hathor . In
Ptolemaic times Hathor was associated with Isis, who was in turn associated
with the Greek goddess
Aphrodite .
For centuries the temple complex was the holiest site for
Isis
worshippers. The temple was officially closed down in the
6th century
A.D. by the
Byzantine emperor
Justinian . It was the last
pagan
temple to exist in the
Mediterranean world.
Philae
was a seat of the
Christian religion as well as of the ancient Egyptian faith. Ruins of a
Christian church were still discovered, and more than one adytum bore traces of
having been made to serve at different eras the purposes of a chapel of Osiris
and of
Christ . The
Philae
temple was converted into a church
dedicated to the
Virgin Mary ,
until that was closed by
Muslim
invaders in the
7th century .
Philae
was saved from drowning. In 1977, a coffer dam was constructed around the
temples and the water was pumped out. Then the temples were carefully
dismantled with every block assigned a number and its position noted. A nearby
higher island called Agilkai was modified to resemble
Philae
and the temples were resembled. In 1980,
Philae
was once again opened to the public.
The temple is
really a complex of temples, the main temple being dedicated to the Goddess
Isis , built by
Pharaoh Ptolemy XI. Also to be seen here is the Pavilion of Nectanebo I,
dedicated to
Hathor ,
and Trajan's Pavilion, rebuilt by the emperor Trajan and with reliefs showing
him offering gifts to the
Egyptian Gods.
The
complex contains all the elements of ancient Egyptian history, with Egyptian,
Greek and Roman architecture blending together.

Not really panoramic but
you get the Idea
Hathors
Temple
The beautiful reliefs on
the temple walls depict musicians playing for the entertainment of the gods,
all in accordance with the patron deity Hathor, of singing, music and dance .

landed during it's
annual precession down the river.
The Unfinished Obelisk
Much of the red/pink
granite used for ancient temples and colossi came from quarries in the
Aswan
area. Around these
quarries are many inscriptions, many of which describe successful quarrying
projects. The Unfinished Obelisk located in the Northern Quarry still lies
where a crack was discovered as it was being hewn from the rock. Possibly
intended as a companion to the Lateran Obelisk, originally at Karnak but now in
Rome , it would
have weighed over 2.3 million pounds and would have been the worlds largest
piece of stone ever handled. However, a crack in the stone occurred, which
caused it to be abandoned. Tools left by it's builders have given us much
insight into how such work was performed.
.This
was me explaining to the group how the Egyptians would use Durite Stone to cut
Granite. The Durite is in my hand. It’s a really hard black stone. You would
smash it down on the Pink Granite to take chips out of it to cut it. That’s how
they did it.
Back to the ship to relax.
This was the excursion to
the Nubian village, I’m not on the ferry, that’s how I took this picture. I did
manage to steal some pictures from my fellow travelers who were on the ferry
though. So I have included them on this page. Of course I didn’t ask permission
to use the pictures and if you haven’t guessed I didn’t write all of the
captions on these pages either. That is not an admission of guilt for anything.
I’m just being efficient when I borrow stuff from the web. You can call my
lawyer in
Baghdad
if you have a problem. The court house is almost safe, see you there.
J
The rest of us stayed on
the boat during the
Nubian
Village
camel trek.
We disembark the next
morning to start out on our long trip across the desert.
We stop for lunch
After lunch it’s a convoy
across the desert to Hurghada by the
Red Sea .
Security in numbers.
Nothing out here but
bandits.
Halfway point. Armed
security surround the nearby hills.
“Mister Mister take my
picture for a dollar”
Hurghada ,
Egypt
Out on the Town
Bandits!!!
Saying Goodbye
L
Well,
the trip home,
Iraq , funny
how I call that home, anyway,  I had to spend the night in the
Cairo
Airport …..not
a great Idea. The armed guards left me alone to sleep on a metal bench but the
misquotes were bad!! I had a can of “off’ in my bag thank GAWD!!!  It
really was bad and the fact that I couldn’t say goodbye to everybody at the
gate made it that much worse. Security wouldn’t let me pass because my flight
was 10 hours out going to
Dubai .
I sadly watched my fellow travelers go through security one by one. I felt my
heart sink. The same way it does when I write this….Some of the best memories
of my life. Thank You God and thank you to all who came with me.

There is a person in my drink!!!!
