La Tomatina
La Tomatina
is a food fight
festival
held on a Wednesday towards the end of August in the town of
Buñol
in the
Valencia
region in
Spain . Tens of thousands of participants come from all over the world to fight in a harmless battle where more than one hundred metric tons of over-ripe
tomatoes
are thrown in the streets.
The weeklong festival features
music ,
parades ,
dancing , and
fireworks . On the night before the tomato fight, participants of the festival compete in a
paella
cooking contest .
Approximately 30,000 tourists come to the tomato fight, multiplying by several times Buñol's normal population of 9,000. There is limited accommodation for people who come to La Tomatina, and thus many participants stay in Valencia and travel by bus or train to Buñol, about 38 km outside the city. In preparation for the dirty mess that will ensue, shopkeepers use huge plastic covers on their storefronts in order to protect them from the carnage.
At around 11 a.m., the first event of the Tomatina begins. A ham is placed upon a
cockaigne pole
(a large, greased pole), and the tomato fight can begin only when someone is able to climb to the top and bring it down. [1]
People struggle against each other, climbing atop one another, in order to be the one to pull down the ham. With this victory, the t-shirt fight begins. After a little while the tomato fight breaks through.
Many trucks haul the bounty of tomatoes into the center of the town, Plaza del Pueblo. The tomatoes come from
Extremadura , where they are less expensive. The signal for the beginning of the fight is firing of water cannons, and the chaos begins. Once it begins, the battle is generally every man for himself. Those who partake in this event are strongly encouraged to wear protective
safety goggles
and
gloves . In addition, they must squish the tomatoes before throwing for safety precautions. Another rule is that no one is allowed to bring into this fight anything that may provoke someone into a more serious brawl, such as a glass bottle. Although it is forbidden to tear someone else's clothing, the crowd tend to ignore this and invariably will rip the shirt of any clothed person, man or woman. Somewhere between an hour and two hours, the fighting ends when the water cannons are fired once more to signal the end. At this point no more tomatoes can be thrown. The cleaning process involves the use of
fire trucks
to spray down the streets, with water provided from a
Roman aqueduct . The authorities seem more concerned with cleaning the town than the visitors so some people find water at the
Buñol River
to wash themselves, although some kind residents will hose passers-by down.
The festival is in honor of the town's patron saints,
Luis Bertràn
and the
Mare de Déu dels Desemparats
(Mother of God of the Defenseless), a title of the
Virgin Mary .
While it is often said that the festival is held on the last Wednesday in August, this is not always true: in 2001, the festival was held on August 22, despite August 29 being the final August Wednesday.
The tomato fight has been a strong tradition in Buñol since 1944 or 1945. No one is completely certain how this event originated. Possible theories on how the Tomatina began include a local
food fight
among friends, a juvenile
class war , a volley of tomatoes from bystanders at a
carnival
parade, a practical joke on a bad musician, the anarchic aftermath of an accidental lorry spillage. One of the most popular theories is that disgruntled townspeople attacked city councilmen with tomatoes during a town celebration. Another theory is that a group of friends were having sexual intercourse then city officials threw tomatoes at them. Whatever happened to begin the tradition, it was enjoyed so much that it was repeated the next year, and the year after that, and so on. The holiday was banned during the
Spanish State
period under
Francisco Franco
for having no religious significance, but returned in the 1970s after his demise.
