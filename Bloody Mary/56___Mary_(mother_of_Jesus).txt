History of Our Lady of the Angels
The
Chapel of Notre Dame des Anges
( French :
Chapelle Notre-Dame-des-Anges ) is a miraculous shrine and place of pilgrimage near
Lurs ,
Alpes-de-Haute-Provence ,
France .
The site, between
Apt and
Sisteron on the
Roman road
Via Domitia , was once that of the Roman settlement of Alaunium, named after the local god Alaunius, which later became Aulun, and gave its name to the chapel that was built there, Sainte-Marie d'Aulun.
In the 17th century several visions were reported here of concerts of angels, and in 1660 a vision of the
Virgin Mary (whence the present name, which in English means "Our Lady of the Angels"). In 1661 the chapel was enlarged, the ancient building forming the crypt of the later one, and a community of
Recollects was established here to tend the shrine. The complex was completed around 1674 and underwent substantial repairs in the 1750s.
The chapel has gained a reputation for miraculous cures, and pilgrimages still take place three times a year.
