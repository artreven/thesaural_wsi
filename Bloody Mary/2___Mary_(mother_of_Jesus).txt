Hello,
does anyone know what rich flowing garment is? (it means that the garment is waving quite a lot because of the wind?)
Taken from this sentence: "In both these Annunciations, Leonardo used a formal arrangement, such as in Fra Angelico's two well known pictures of the same subject, of the
Virgin Mary
sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture, approached from the left by an angel
in profile with rich flowing garment , raised wings and bearing a lily".
Thanks in advance.

Flowing does not (necessarily) mean it is blowing in the wind but that it is of a soft fabric that
could
easily do so! Rich could mean that the fabric is "rich" in colour = brightly coloured, or of a "rich" quality = luxurious/heavily textured. I would suggest it is the former i.e. bright, as a rich fabric such as velvet might not "flow" well. "Then again, as it describes an angel's attire, perhaps it means "golden?"
Hopefully, you can decide from looking at the painting

Think of a "rich" - i.e., very luxurious, thick, damask-y - fabric, that's sewn into a "flowing" robe, with a lot of cloth and many folds. This phrase "rich flowing garment/robe" basically is a stock term in English for the robes that people wear in Renaissance art, like for instance the Teresa of Bernini ( http://www.mistica.info/unteresa.htm ).
This sentence isn't very well-written, by the way; it gets grammatically and stylistically faulty at the end.
