بن جانسن
(به
انگلیسی :
Ben Jonson ) ‏ (۱۵۷۲ - ۱۶۳۷)
بنجامین جانسن ، که از او به نام
بن جانسن
یاد می‌شود. هنرپیشه، شاعر و
نمایشنامه نویس
مشهور دورهٔ الیزابت، در یازدهم ژوئن ۱۵۷۲ میلادی در ناحیه
وست مینستر
لندن به دنیا آمد.
او همعصر شکسپیر بود و در ارائه نمایشنامه‌های کمدی از
شکسپیر
چیره دست تر بود. او در کمدی های خود بیشتر به رفتار انسان ها می پردازد. مهمترین آثار او عبارتند از : وولپن - (روباه) (Volpone)، کیمیاگر (The Alchemist)
زندگینامه [ ویرایش ]
بن جانسن در اصل اسکاتلندی بود و پدرش ابتدا ثروتی داشت که بعدها درکشمکش‌های مذهی دورهٔ سلطنت ملکه
ماری تئودور ، که در انگلستان به وقوع پیوست دارایی خود را از دست داد و به مسلک کشیشان درآمد. ملکه ماری که یک کاتولیک متعصب بود با همهٔ پیروان ادیان و مسلک‌های دیگر دشمنی داشت و این نفرت تا بدان جا بود که در دوران فرمانروایی او بیش از سیصدنفر را به جرم
بی‌دینی
زنده زنده در آتش سوزاند. پدر بن جانسن عمرش چندان نپایید و یکی دوماه پس از تولد او درگذشت و مادرش با تنگدستی و فقر دست به گریبان بود، برای ادامه زندگی شوهر دوم برگزید. ناپدری اش به شغل بنایی اشتغال داشت. بن جانسن برای ورود به مدرسه ناچار بود با ناپدری اش کارکند و درآمد اندکش را برای خرج تحصیلات پس انداز کند. در یک آموزشگاه خصوصی
کلیسای
سن مارتین تحصیلات ابتدایی را فراگرفت و سپس به آموزشگاه ست مینستر وارد شد. درآنجا به تحصیل
ادبیات
یونان
و
روم
پرداخت. در۱۵۸۹ برای کمک به خانواده‌اش ناگزیر شد درسش را رها کند و با ناپدری خود به کار بنایی بپردازد. از آنجا که این شغل را هیچ وقت دوست نداشت به سپاهی از سربازان انگلیسی که عازم جبهه‌های فلاندر بودند پیوست (بین ۱۵۹۱- ۱۵۹۷) به زودی ازشغل سربازی هم خسته شد و به
لندن
بازگشت. برای مدتی به همان حرفه بنایی پرداخت و با دختری به نام آن لوییز آشنا شد و با او ازدواج کرد (۱۵۹۴) آن‌ها صاحب چهار فرزند شدند و این زن با همه سختی‌ها تا زمان مرگ از شوهرش جدا نشد.

زندگی تئاتری [ ویرایش ]
آشنایی بن جانسن با گروه بازیگران
تئاتر ، مسیرزندگی او را تغییر داد. یک چند به عنوان
بازیگر
در گروه‌های سیار تئاتر شروع به کارکرد و با
نمایشنامه
نویسان آن زمان آشنا شد، سپس به اصلاح و تصحیح نمایشنامه‌های گوناگون پرداخت تا این که یکی از دست اندرکاران تئاتر، به نام توماس ناش، به او پیشنهاد کرد که در نوشتن نمایشنامه با وی همکاری کند. بن جانسن پذیرفت و حاصل این همکاری نمایشنامه طنزآمیزی بود به نام «جزیره سگ‌ها» که در آن سخت به طبقه حاکم تاخته بود. این اثر در سال ۱۵۹۷ به صحنه رفت اما از سوی شورای سلطنتی این اثر فتنه انگیز تلقی شد و دستور داده شد اجرای آن را متوقف، نمایش را تعطیل و عوامل این اثر را توقیف کنند. بن جانسن برای مدتی به زندان افتاد. بعد از چندماه با پرداخت وجه الضمانی از زندان آزاد شد. یک سال بعد اولین کمدی او در تماشاخانه گلوپ به صحنه رفت. [۱]
صحنه ای از نمایش «وولپن» (روباه)
ویلیام شکسپیر
که هشت سال از وی بزرگ تر بود، در این نمایشنامه بازی داشت. یکی از دلایلی که بن جانسن در بازیگری به موفقیتی نرسید و حتی به نحوی مزاحم کار او گردید، ابتلا به بیماری
اسکوروی
است. در نتیجه این بیماری، صورتش زیاد
خوش منظر
نبود. از سوی دیگر لجاجت و به جا نیاوردن مراتب خضوع و خشوع در نزد اشراف، غالباً برایش دردسر ایجاد کرد. در سال ۱۵۹۸ نخستین اثر موفق او به صحنه رفت. این اثر یک نمایشنامه کمدی بود به نام «هرانسانی اسیرمزاج خویشتن است» این نمایش در زمان اجرا مورد تمسخر یکی از بازیگران گروه رقیب، به نام گابریل اسپنسر قرارگرفت. بن جانسن که سخت از این امر رنجیده خاطر شده بود، او را به دوئل دعوت کرد. حاصل این مبارزه تن به کشته شدن رقیب و زخمی شدن خود بن جانسن بود. او را به جرم
آدم کشی
به
زندان
انداختند. درزندان به مذهب
کاتولیک
درآمد و شروع به مطالعه در زمینه الهیات نمود.پس از چندی با حمایت مقامات
کلیسا
محاکمه شد و با استفاده ازامتیازات مخصوص افراد روحانی که طبق آن ایشان را شرعاً و نه عرفاً محاکمه می‌کردند آزاد گردید. با این حال بعد از محاکمه بنا به رسم آن زمان علامتی با آهن گداخته بر دست او حک شد تا اگر باردیگر مرتکب قتل گردید او را به آسانی باز شناسند. یک چند شروع به کارنمایش کرد، اما باردیگر در اواخر سال ۱۵۹۸ به سبب عدم پرداخت بدهی خود به هنرپیشه‌ای به نام رابرت براون، روانهٔ زندان شد. او پس از آزادی، نمایشنامه دیگری نوشت با عنوان «هرانسانی خارج از مشرب خویش است» این اثر در سال ۱۵۹۹ توسط گروه بازیگران شکسپیر به صحنه رفت. اجرای این نمایش هرچند برتعداد دشمنان نویسنده‌اش افزود اما از پولی که نصیبش شد توانست بدهی‌های عقب افتاده خود را بپردازد. در همین حال کمدی دیگرش را به عنوان «خوشگذرانی‌های سینتا» آماده نمود که در آن کلیسا را مورد استهزا و انتقاد قرارداده بود. [۲]
اگر چه تحصیلات بن جانسون نامنظم و بسیار اندک بود اما او در همان زمان اندک به دو
زبان یونانی
و لاتینی تسلط کامل پیدا کرد و علاقه بسیار آثار نویسندگان و شخصیت‌های ادیی چون
سیسرون ،
سنکا ، «لیوی»، «تاسیتوس»را مطالعه می‌کرد و علاقه زیادی به بررسی و تحقیق در اثار کلاسیک انگلیس داشت. او درنمایشنامه‌های خود از
توده مردم
برای نقش‌های اصلی استفاده می‌کرد و از شیوه‌های کمدی که کاملاً به صورت اشرافی اجرا می‌شد دوری می‌جست.
نمایشنامه «نیوس»، «شیطان خر است»، «کیمیاگر» و نمایشنامه «روباه» نیز از جمله موفق‌ترین اثار این نویسنده به شمار می‌روند. «جانسون» در نمایشنامه «روباه» که با نام «وولپون» نیز معروف است و یکی از آثار برجسته او محسوب می‌شود داستان افرادی را به تصویر می‌کشد که غرق پول‌پرستی و آزمندی شده‌اند. [۳]
این شاعر و نمایشنامه‌نویس انگلیسی در سال ۱۶۳۷ در سن ۶۴ سالگی درگذشت. او در زمان مرگ بسیار فقیر و تنها بود و بیشتردوستان و مریدانش او را ترک گفته بودند.

Benjamin Jonson
(c. 11 June 1572 – 6 August 1637) was an English
playwright , poet, actor, and literary critic of the seventeenth century, whose artistry exerted a lasting impact upon English poetry and stage comedy. He popularised the
comedy of humours . He is best known for the
satirical
plays
Every Man in His Humour
(1598),
Volpone, or The Foxe
(1605),
The Alchemist
(1610), and
Bartholomew Fayre: A Comedy
(1614), and for his
lyric poetry ; he is generally regarded as the second most important English dramatist, after
William Shakespeare , during the reign of
James I . [ 1 ]
Jonson was a
classically educated , well-read, and cultured man of the
English Renaissance
with an appetite for controversy (personal and political, artistic and intellectual) whose cultural influence was of unparalleled breadth upon the playwrights and the poets of the
Jacobean era
(1603–1625) and of the
Caroline era
(1625–1642). [ 2 ] [ 3 ]

Early life
Westminster School
master
William Camden
cultivated the artistic genius of Ben Jonson.
The Scottish poet
William Drummond of Hawthornden
was friend and confidant to Jonson.
Ben Jonson
said that his family originally came from the folk of the
Anglo-Scottish border
country, which genealogy is verified by the three spindles ( rhombi ) in the Jonson family
coat of arms . One spindle is a diamond-shaped
heraldic
device shared with the Border-country Johnstone family of
Annandale . Jonson's clergyman father died two months before his birth; his mother married a master
bricklayer
two years later. [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
Jonson attended school in
St. Martin's Lane . Later, a family friend paid for his studies at
Westminster School , where the
antiquarian , historian,
topographer , and
officer of arms ,
William Camden
(1551–1623) was one of his masters. In the event, the pupil and the master became friends, and the intellectual influence of Camden's broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonson's art and
literary style
remained notable, until Camden's death in 1623.
On leaving Westminster School, Jonson was to have attended the
University of Cambridge , to continue his book learning; but did not, because of his unwilled apprenticeship to his bricklayer stepfather. [ 2 ] [ 4 ]
According to the churchman and historian
Thomas Fuller
(1608–61), Jonson at this time built a garden wall in
Lincoln's Inn . After having been an apprentice bricklayer, Ben Jonson went to
Netherlands , and volunteered to soldier with the English regiments of
Francis Vere
(1560–1609), in
Flanders .
The
Hawthornden Manuscripts
(1619), of the conversations between Ben Jonson and the poet
William Drummond of Hawthornden
(1585–1649), report that, when in Flanders, Jonson engaged, fought, and killed an enemy soldier in
single combat , and took for trophies the weapons of the vanquished soldier. [ 6 ]
After his military activity on the Continent, Jonson returned to England and worked as an actor and as a playwright. As an actor, Jonson was the protagonist “Hieronimo” (Geronimo) in the play
The Spanish Tragedy
(ca. 1586), by
Thomas Kyd
(1558–94), the first
revenge tragedy
in English literature. Moreover, by 1597, he was a working playwright employed by
Philip Henslowe , the leading producer for the English public theatre; by the next year, the production of
Every Man in His Humour
(1598) had established Jonson's reputation as a dramatist. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Regarding his marriage Jonson described his wife to William Drummond as "a shrew, yet honest". Since the seventeenth century, the identity of Jonson's wife has been obscure, yet she sometimes is identified as "Ann Lewis", the woman who married a Benjamin Jonson in 1594, at the church of
St Magnus-the-Martyr , near
London Bridge . [ 9 ]
Concerning the family of Anne Lewis and Ben Jonson, the St. Martin church registers indicate that Mary Jonson, their eldest daughter, died in November 1593, at six months of age. Then a decade later, in 1603, Benjamin Jonson, their eldest son, died of
Bubonic plague
when he was seven years old; to lament and honour the dead boy, Benjamin Jonson
père
wrote the elegiac
On My First Sonne
(1603). Moreover, thirty-two years later, a second son, also named Benjamin Jonson, died in 1635. In that period, Ann Lewis and Ben Jonson lived separate lives for five years; their matrimonial arrangement cast Ann Lewis as the housewife Jonson, and Ben Jonson as the artist who enjoyed the residential hospitality of his patrons, Sir Robert Townshend and Lord Aubigny,
Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox . [ 9 ]
Career
By summer 1597, Jonson had a fixed engagement in the
Admiral's Men , then performing under
Philip Henslowe 's management at
The Rose .
John Aubrey
reports, on uncertain authority, that Jonson was not successful as an actor; whatever his skills as an actor, he was evidently more valuable to the company as a writer.
By this time Jonson had begun to write original plays for the Admiral's Men; in 1598 he was mentioned by
Francis Meres
in his
Palladis Tamia
as one of "the best for tragedy." None of his early tragedies survive, however. An undated comedy,
The Case is Altered , may be his earliest surviving play.
In 1597 a play which he co-wrote with
Thomas Nashe ,
The Isle of Dogs , was suppressed after causing great offence. Arrest warrants for Jonson and Nashe were issued by Queen
Elizabeth I 's so-called interrogator,
Richard Topcliffe . Jonson was jailed in
Marshalsea Prison
and charged with "Leude and mutynous behavior", while Nashe managed to escape to
Great Yarmouth . Two of the actors,
Gabriel Spenser
and Robert Shaw, were also imprisoned. A year later, Jonson was again briefly imprisoned, this time in
Newgate Prison , for killing Gabriel Spenser in a
duel
on 22 September 1598 in Hogsden Fields [ 6 ]
(today part of
Hoxton ). Tried on a charge of
manslaughter , Jonson pleaded guilty but was released by
benefit of clergy , a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief bible verse (the
neck-verse ), forfeiting his 'goods and chattels' and being branded on his left thumb. [ 10 ]
While in gaol Jonson converted to Catholicism, possibly through the influence of fellow-prisoner Father
Thomas Wright , a
Jesuit
priest. [ 11 ]
In 1598 Jonson produced his first great success,
Every Man in His Humour , capitalising on the vogue for humorous plays which
George Chapman
had begun with
An Humorous Day's Mirth .
William Shakespeare
was among the first actors to be cast. Jonson followed this in 1599 with
Every Man out of His Humour , a pedantic attempt to imitate
Aristophanes . It is not known whether this was a success on stage, but when published it proved popular and went through several editions.
Jonson's other work for the theatre in the last years of
Elizabeth I 's reign was marked by fighting and controversy.
Cynthia's Revels
was produced by the
Children of the Chapel
Royal at
Blackfriars Theatre
in 1600. It satirised both
John Marston , who Jonson believed had accused him of lustfulness, possibly in
Histrio-Mastix , and
Thomas Dekker . Jonson attacked the two poets again in 1601's
Poetaster . Dekker responded with
Satiromastix , subtitled "the untrussing of the humorous poet". The final scene of this play, whilst certainly not to be taken at face value as a portrait of Jonson, offers a caricature that is recognisable from Drummond's report – boasting about himself and condemning other poets, criticising performances of his plays, and calling attention to himself in any available way.
This " War of the Theatres " appears to have ended with reconciliation on all sides. Jonson collaborated with Dekker on a
pageant
welcoming
James I
to England in 1603 although Drummond reports that Jonson called Dekker a rogue. Marston dedicated
The Malcontent
to Jonson and the two collaborated with Chapman on
Eastward Ho , a 1605 play whose anti-Scottish sentiment briefly landed both authors in jail.
Royal patronage
At the beginning of the reign of
James I, King of England , in 1603 Jonson joined other poets and playwrights in welcoming the new king. Jonson quickly adapted himself to the additional demand for
masques
and entertainments introduced with the new reign and fostered by both the king and his consort
Anne of Denmark . In addition to his popularity on the public stage and in the royal hall, he enjoyed the patronage of aristocrats such as
Elizabeth Sidney
(daughter of
Sir Philip Sidney ) and
Lady Mary Wroth . This connection with the Sidney family provided the impetus for one of Jonson's most famous lyrics, the
country house poem
To
Penshurst .
In February 1603
John Manningham
reported that Jonson was living on Robert Townsend, son of
Sir Roger Townshend , and "scorns the world." [ 12 ]
Perhaps this explains why his trouble with English authorities continued. That same year he was questioned by the
Privy Council
about
Sejanus , a politically themed play about corruption in the Roman Empire. He was again in trouble for topical allusions in a play, now lost, in which he took part. Shortly after his release from a brief spell of imprisonment imposed to mark the authorities' displeasure at the work, in the second week of October 1605, he was present at a supper party attended by most of the
Gunpowder Plot
conspirators. After the plot's discovery he appears to have avoided further imprisonment; he volunteered what he knew of the affair to the investigator
Robert Cecil
and the
Privy Council . Father Thomas Wright, who heard Fawkes's confession, was known to Jonson from prison in 1598 and Cecil may have directed him to bring the priest before the council, as a witness. [ 11 ]
(Teague, 249).

The Workes of Beniamin Ionson
(1616), the first
folio
publication that included stage plays
At the same time, Jonson pursued a more prestigious career, writing masques for James's court.
The Satyr
(1603) and
The Masque of Blackness
(1605) are two of about two dozen masques which Jonson wrote for James or for Queen Anne;
The Masque of Blackness
was praised by
Algernon Charles Swinburne
as the consummate example of this now-extinct genre, which mingled speech, dancing, and spectacle.
On many of these projects he collaborated, not always peacefully, with designer
Inigo Jones . For example, Jones designed the scenery for Jonson's masque
Oberon, the Faery Prince
performed at
Whitehall
on 1 January 1611 in which
Prince Henry , eldest son of James I, appeared in the title role. Perhaps partly as a result of this new career, Jonson gave up writing plays for the public theatres for a decade. He later told Drummond that he had made less than two hundred pounds on all his plays together.
In 1616 Jonson received a yearly pension of 100
marks
(about £60), leading some to identify him as England's first
Poet Laureate . This sign of royal favour may have encouraged him to publish the first volume of the folio collected edition of his works that year. Other volumes followed in 1640–41 and 1692. (See:
Ben Jonson folios )
In 1618 Jonson set out for his ancestral Scotland on foot. He spent over a year there, and the best-remembered hospitality which he enjoyed was that of the Scottish poet,
William Drummond of Hawthornden , in April 1619, sited on the
River Esk . Drummond undertook to record as much of Jonson's conversation as he could in his diary, and thus recorded aspects of Jonson's personality that would otherwise have been less clearly seen. Jonson delivers his opinions, in Drummond's terse reporting, in an expansive and even magisterial mood. Drummond noted he was "a great lover and praiser of himself, a contemner and scorner of others".
In Edinburgh, Jonson is recorded as staying with a John Stuart of
Leith . [ 4 ]
While there he was made an honorary citizen of
Edinburgh . On returning to England, he was awarded an
honorary
Master of Arts
degree
from Oxford University.
From Edinburgh he travelled west and lodged with the
Duke of Lennox
where he wrote a play based on
Loch Lomond . [ 4 ]
The period between 1605 and 1620 may be viewed as Jonson's heyday. By 1616 he had produced all the plays on which his present reputation as a dramatist is based, including the tragedy
Catiline
(acted and printed 1611), which achieved limited success, and the comedies
Volpone , (acted 1605 and printed in 1607),
Epicoene, or the Silent Woman
(1609),
The Alchemist
(1610),
Bartholomew Fair
(1614) and
The Devil is an Ass
(1616).
The Alchemist
and
Volpone
were immediately successful. Of
Epicoene , Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the play's subtitle was appropriate, since its audience had refused to applaud the play (i.e., remained silent). Yet
Epicoene , along with
Bartholomew Fair
and (to a lesser extent)
The Devil is an Ass
have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition. While his life during this period was apparently more settled than it had been in the 1590s, his financial security was still not assured.
Religion
Jonson recounted that his father had been a prosperous
Protestant
landowner until the reign of " Bloody Mary " and had suffered imprisonment and the forfeiture of his wealth during that monarch's attempt to restore England to Catholicism. On Elizabeth's accession he was freed and was able to travel to London to become a clergyman. [ 13 ] [ 14 ]
(All we know of Jonson's father, who died a month before his son was born, comes from the poet's own narrative.) Jonson's elementary education was in a small church school attached to
St Martin-in-the-Fields
parish, and at the age of about seven he secured a place at
Westminster School , then part of
Westminster Abbey .
Notwithstanding this emphatically Protestant grounding, Jonson maintained an interest in Catholic doctrine throughout his adult life and, at a particularly perilous time while a religious war with Spain was widely expected and persecution of Catholics was intensifying, he converted to the faith. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]
This took place in October 1598, while Jonson was on remand in
Newgate gaol
charged with manslaughter. Jonson's biographer Ian Donaldson is among those who suggest that the conversion was instigated by Father Thomas Wright, a
Jesuit
priest who had resigned from the order over his acceptance of Queen Elizabeth's right to rule in England. [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
Wright, although placed under
house arrest
on the orders of
Lord Burghley , was permitted to minister to the inmates of London prisons. [ 17 ]
It may have been that Jonson, fearing that his trial would go against him, was seeking the unequivocal
absolution
that Catholicism could offer if he were sentenced to death. [ 16 ]
Alternatively, he could have been looking to personal advantage from accepting conversion since Father Wright's protector, the
Earl of Essex , was among those who might hope to rise to influence after the succession of a new monarch. [ 19 ]
Jonson's conversion came at a weighty time in affairs of state; the royal succession, from the childless Elizabeth, had not been settled and Essex's Catholic allies were hopeful that a sympathetic ruler might attain the throne.
Conviction, and certainly not expedience alone, sustained Jonson's faith during the troublesome twelve years he remained a Catholic. His stance received attention beyond the low-level intolerance to which most followers of that faith were exposed. The first draft of his play
Sejanus
was banned for " popery ", and did not re-appear until some offending passages were cut. [ 11 ]
In January 1606 he (with Anne, his wife) appeared before the
Consistory Court
in London to answer a charge of
recusancy , with Jonson alone additionally accused of allowing his fame as a Catholic to "seduce" citizens to the cause. [ 20 ]
This was a serious matter (the
Gunpowder Plot
was still fresh in mind) but he explained that his failure to take
communion
was only because he had not found sound theological endorsement for the practice, and by paying a fine of thirteen shillings he escaped the more serious penalties at the authorities' disposal. His habit was to slip outside during the sacrament, a common routine at the time—indeed it was one followed by the royal consort,
Queen Anne , herself—to show political loyalty while not offending the conscience. [ 21 ]
Leading church figures, including
John Overall ,
Dean of St Paul's , were tasked with winning Jonson back to orthodoxy, but these overtures were resisted. [ 22 ]
In May 1610
Henry IV of France
was assassinated, purportedly in the name of the Pope; he had been a Catholic monarch respected in England for tolerance towards Protestants, and his murder seems to have been the immediate cause of Jonson's decision to rejoin the Church of England. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]
He did this in flamboyant style, pointedly drinking a full chalice of
communion wine
at the
eucharist
to demonstrate his renunciation of the Catholic rite, in which the priest alone drinks the wine. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]
The exact date of the ceremony is unknown. [ 24 ]
However his interest in Catholic belief and practice remained with him until his death. [ 27 ]
Decline and death
Jonson's production began to decline in the 1620s. He was still well-known; from this time dates the prominence of the
Sons of Ben
or the " Tribe of Ben ", those younger poets such as
Robert Herrick ,
Richard Lovelace , and
Sir John Suckling
who took their bearing in verse from Jonson. However, a series of setbacks drained his strength and damaged his reputation. He resumed writing regular plays in the 1620s, but these are not considered among his best. They are of significant interest, however, for their portrayal of
Charles I 's England.
The Staple of News , for example, offers a remarkable look at the earliest stage of English journalism. The lukewarm reception given that play was, however, nothing compared to the dismal failure of
The New Inn ; the cold reception given this play prompted Jonson to write a poem condemning his audience (the
Ode to Myself ), which in turn prompted
Thomas Carew , one of the "Tribe of Ben," to respond in a poem that asks Jonson to recognise his own decline. [ 28 ]
The principal factor in Jonson's partial eclipse was, however, the death of James and the accession of
King Charles I
in 1625. Jonson felt neglected by the new court. A decisive quarrel with Jones harmed his career as a writer of court masques, although he continued to entertain the court on an irregular basis. For his part, Charles displayed a certain degree of care for the great poet of his father's day: he increased Jonson's annual pension to £100 and included a
tierce
of wine.
Despite the strokes that he suffered in the 1620s, Jonson continued to write. At his death in 1637 he seems to have been working on another play,
The Sad Shepherd . Though only two acts are extant, this represents a remarkable new direction for Jonson: a move into
pastoral
drama. During the early 1630s he also conducted a correspondence with
James Howell , who warned him about disfavour at court in the wake of his dispute with Jones.
Jonson died on 6 August 1637 and his funeral was held on 9 August. He is buried in the north aisle of the nave in
Westminster Abbey , with the inscription "O Rare Ben Johnson"
(sic)
set in the slab over his grave. [ 29 ]
John Aubrey , in a more meticulous record than usual, notes that a passer-by, John Young of
Great Milton , Oxfordshire, saw the bare grave marker and on impulse paid a workman eighteen pence to make the inscription. Another theory suggests that the tribute came from
William Davenant , Jonson's successor as Poet Laureate (and card-playing companion of Young), as the same phrase appears on Davenant's nearby gravestone, but essayist
Leigh Hunt
contends that Davenant's wording represented no more than Young's coinage, cheaply re-used. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]
The fact that Jonson was buried in an upright position was an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death, [ 31 ]
although it has also been written that he asked for a grave exactly 18 inches square from the monarch and received an upright grave to fit in the requested space. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]
It has been claimed that the inscription could be read "Orare Ben Jonson" (pray for Ben Jonson), possibly in an allusion to Jonson's acceptance of
Catholic doctrine
during his lifetime (although he had returned to the Church of England) but the carving shows a distinct space between "O" and "rare". [ 11 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ]
A monument to Jonson was erected in about 1723 by the Earl of Oxford and is in the eastern aisle of Westminster Abbey's Poets' Corner. It includes a portrait medallion and the same inscription as on the gravestone. It seems Jonson was to have had a monument erected by subscription soon after his death but the English Civil War intervened. [ 36 ]
His work
Drama
Apart from two tragedies,
Sejanus
and
Catiline , that largely failed to impress Renaissance audiences, Jonson's work for the public theatres was in comedy. These plays vary in some respects. The minor early plays, particularly those written for
boy players , present somewhat looser plots and less-developed characters than those written later, for adult companies. Already in the plays which were his salvos in the Poet's War, he displays the keen eye for absurdity and hypocrisy that marks his best-known plays; in these early efforts, however, plot mostly takes second place to variety of incident and comic set-pieces. They are, also, notably ill-tempered.

Tibullus , are all sacrificed upon the altar of private resentment." Another early comedy in a different vein,
The Case is Altered , is markedly similar to Shakespeare's romantic comedies in its foreign setting, emphasis on genial wit, and love-plot. Henslowe's diary indicates that Jonson had a hand in numerous other plays, including many in genres such as English history with which he is not otherwise associated.
The comedies of his middle career, from
Eastward Ho
to
The Devil is an Ass
are for the most part
city comedy , with a London setting, themes of trickery and money, and a distinct moral ambiguity, despite Jonson's professed aim in the Prologue to
Volpone
to "mix profit with your pleasure". His late plays or " dotages ", particularly
The Magnetic Lady
and
The Sad Shepherd , exhibit signs of an accommodation with the romantic tendencies of
Elizabethan comedy .
Within this general progression, however, Jonson's comic style remained constant and easily recognisable. He announces his programme in the prologue to the
folio
version of
Every Man in His Humour : he promises to represent "deeds, and language, such as men do use." He planned to write comedies that revived the classical premises of Elizabethan dramatic theory—or rather, since all but the loosest English comedies could claim some descent from
Plautus
and
Terence , he intended to apply those premises with rigour. [ 37 ]
This commitment entailed negations: after
The Case is Altered , Jonson eschewed distant locations, noble characters, romantic plots, and other staples of Elizabethan comedy, focussing instead on the satiric and realistic inheritance of
new comedy . He set his plays in contemporary settings, peopled them with recognisable types, and set them to actions that, if not strictly realistic, involved everyday motives such as greed and
jealousy . In accordance with the temper of his age, he was often so broad in his characterisation that many of his most famous scenes border on the
farcical
(as
William Congreve , for example, judged
Epicoene .) He was more diligent in adhering to the
classical unities
than many of his peers—although as
Margaret Cavendish
noted, the unity of action in the major comedies was rather compromised by Jonson's abundance of incident. To this classical model Jonson applied the two features of his style which save his classical imitations from mere pedantry: the vividness with which he depicted the lives of his characters, and the intricacy of his plots. Coleridge, for instance, claimed that
The Alchemist
had one of the three most perfect plots in literature.
Poetry
"Epitaph for Cecilia Bulstrode" manuscript, 1609
Jonson's poetry, like his drama, is informed by his classical learning. Some of his better-known poems are close translations of Greek or Roman models; all display the careful attention to form and style that often came naturally to those trained in classics in the
humanist
manner. Jonson largely avoided the debates about rhyme and meter that had consumed Elizabethan classicists such as
Thomas Campion
and
Gabriel Harvey . Accepting both rhyme and stress, Jonson used them to mimic the classical qualities of simplicity, restraint, and precision.
"Epigrams" (published in the 1616 folio) is an entry in a genre that was popular among late-Elizabethan and Jacobean audiences, although Jonson was perhaps the only poet of his time to work in its full classical range. The epigrams explore various attitudes, most from the satiric stock of the day: complaints against women, courtiers, and spies abound. The condemnatory poems are short and anonymous; Jonson’s epigrams of praise, including a famous poem to Camden and lines to Lucy Harington, are longer and are mostly addressed to specific individuals. Although it is included among the epigrams, " On My First Sonne " is neither satirical nor very short; the poem, intensely personal and deeply felt, typifies a genre that would come to be called "lyric poetry." It is possible that the spelling of 'son' as 'Sonne' is meant to allude to the
sonnet
form, with which it shares some features. A few other so-called epigrams share this quality. Jonson's poems of "The Forest" also appeared in the first folio. Most of the fifteen poems are addressed to Jonson's aristocratic supporters, but the most famous are his country-house poem “ To Penshurst ” and the poem “ To Celia ” ("Come, my Celia, let us prove") that appears also in
Volpone .
Underwood , published in the expanded folio of 1640, is a larger and more heterogeneous group of poems. It contains
A Celebration of Charis , Jonson's most extended effort at love poetry; various religious pieces;
encomiastic poems
including the poem to Shakespeare and a sonnet on
Mary Wroth ; the
Execration against Vulcan
and others. The 1640 volume also contains three elegies which have often been ascribed to Donne (one of them appeared in Donne's posthumous collected poems).
Relationship with Shakespeare
A 19th century engraving illustrating
Thomas Fuller 's story of
Shakespeare
and Jonson debating at the " Mermaid Tavern ".
There are many legends about Jonson's rivalry with
Shakespeare , some of which may be true. Drummond reports that during their conversation, Jonson scoffed at two apparent absurdities in Shakespeare's plays: a nonsensical line in
Julius Caesar , and the setting of
The Winter's Tale
on the non-existent seacoast of Bohemia. Drummond also reported Jonson as saying that Shakespeare "wanted art" (i.e., lacked skill). Whether Drummond is viewed as accurate or not, the comments fit well with Jonson's well-known theories about literature.
In
"De Shakespeare Nostrat"
in
Timber , which was published posthumously and reflects his lifetime of practical experience, Jonson offers a fuller and more conciliatory comment. He recalls being told by certain actors that Shakespeare never blotted (i.e., crossed out) a line when he wrote. His own claimed response was "Would he had blotted a thousand!" [ a ]
However, Jonson explains, "He was, indeed, honest, and of an open and free nature, had an excellent phantasy, brave notions, and gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be stopped". [ 38 ]
Jonson concludes that "there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned." Also when Shakespeare died, he said, "He was not of an age, but for all time."
Thomas Fuller
relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates in the
Mermaid Tavern ; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt, not only because of the tone of Jonson's references to him but because Shakespeare's company produced a number of Jonson's plays, at least two of which ( Every Man in His Humour
and
Sejanus His Fall
) Shakespeare certainly acted in. However, it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had, and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated.
Jonson's most influential and revealing commentary on Shakespeare is the second of the two poems that he contributed to the prefatory verse that opens Shakespeare's
First Folio . This poem,
"To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us" , did a good deal to create the traditional view of Shakespeare as a poet who, despite "small Latine, and lesse Greeke", [ 39 ]
had a natural genius. The poem has traditionally been thought to exemplify the contrast which Jonson perceived between himself, the disciplined and erudite classicist, scornful of ignorance and sceptical of the masses, and Shakespeare, represented in the poem as a kind of natural wonder whose genius was not subject to any rules except those of the audiences for which he wrote. But the poem itself qualifies this view:
Yet must I not give Nature all: Thy Art,
My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part.
Some view this elegy as a conventional exercise, but others see it as a heartfelt tribute to the "Sweet Swan of Avon", the "Soul of the Age!" It has been argued that Jonson helped to edit the
First Folio , and he may have been inspired to write this poem by reading his fellow playwright's works, a number of which had been previously either unpublished or available in less satisfactory versions, in a relatively complete form.
Reception and influence
During most of the 17th century Jonson was a towering literary figure, and his influence was enormous for he has been described as 'One of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of English literature'. [ 40 ]
Before the English Civil War, the "Tribe of Ben" touted his importance, and during the Restoration Jonson's satirical comedies and his theory and practice of "humour characters" (which are often misunderstood; see William Congreve's letters for clarification) was extremely influential, providing the blueprint for many Restoration comedies. In the 18th century Jonson's status began to decline. In the Romantic era, Jonson suffered the fate of being unfairly compared and contrasted to Shakespeare, as the taste for Jonson's type of satirical comedy decreased. Jonson was at times greatly appreciated by the Romantics, but overall he was denigrated for not writing in a Shakespearean vein. In the 20th century, Jonson's status rose significantly.
In 2012, after more than two decades of research,
Cambridge University Press
published the first new edition for Jonson's complete works for 60 years. [ 41 ]
Drama
As G. E. Bentley notes in
Shakespeare and Jonson: Their Reputations in the Seventeenth Century Compared , Jonson's reputation was in some respects equal to Shakespeare's in the 17th century. After the English theatres were reopened on the
Restoration
of
Charles II , Jonson's work, along with Shakespeare's and
Fletcher 's, formed the initial core of the Restoration repertory. It was not until after 1710 that Shakespeare's plays (ordinarily in heavily revised forms) were more frequently performed than those of his Renaissance contemporaries. Many critics since the 18th century have ranked Jonson below only Shakespeare among
English Renaissance dramatists . Critical judgment has tended to emphasise the very qualities that Jonson himself lauds in his prefaces, in Timber, and in his scattered prefaces and dedications: the realism and propriety of his language, the bite of his satire, and the care with which he plotted his comedies.
For some critics, the temptation to contrast Jonson (representing art or craft) with Shakespeare (representing nature, or untutored genius) has seemed natural; Jonson himself may be said to initiate this interpretation in the second folio, and
Samuel Butler
drew the same comparison in his
commonplace book
later in the century.
At the Restoration, this sensed difference became a kind of critical dogma.
Charles de Saint-Évremond
placed Jonson's comedies above all else in English drama, and
Charles Gildon
called Jonson the father of English comedy.
John Dryden
offered a more common assessment in the Essay of Dramatic Poesie, in which his
Avatar
Neander compares Shakespeare to
Homer
and Jonson to
Virgil : the former represented profound creativity, the latter polished artifice. But "artifice" was in the 17th century almost synonymous with "art"; Jonson, for instance, used "artificer" as a synonym for "artist" ( Discoveries,
33). For
Lewis Theobald , too, Jonson "ow[ed] all his Excellence to his Art,” in contrast to Shakespeare, the natural genius.
Nicholas Rowe , to whom may be traced the legend that Jonson owed the production of
Every Man in his Humour
to Shakespeare's intercession, likewise attributed Jonson's excellence to learning, which did not raise him quite to the level of genius. A consensus formed: Jonson was the first English poet to understand classical precepts with any accuracy, and he was the first to apply those precepts successfully to contemporary life. But there were also more negative spins on Jonson's learned art; for instance, in the 1750s,
Edward Young
casually remarked on the way in which Jonson's learning worked, like Samson's strength, to his own detriment. Earlier,
Aphra Behn , writing in defence of female playwrights, had pointed to Jonson as a writer whose learning did not make him popular; unsurprisingly, she compares him unfavorably to Shakespeare. Particularly in the tragedies, with their lengthy speeches abstracted from
Sallust
and
Cicero ,
Augustan
critics saw a writer whose learning had swamped his
aesthetic
judgment.
In this period,
Alexander Pope
is exceptional in that he noted the tendency to exaggeration in these competing critical portraits: "It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and nothing is so probable, as that because Ben Johnson had much the most learning, it was said on the one hand that Shakespear had none at all; and because Shakespear had much the most wit and fancy, it was retorted on the other, that Johnson wanted both." [ 42 ]
For the most part, the 18th century consensus remained committed to the division that Pope doubted; as late as the 1750s,
Sarah Fielding
could put a brief recapitulation of this analysis in the mouth of a "man of sense" encountered by David Simple.
Though his stature declined during the 18th century, Jonson was still read and commented on throughout the century, generally in the kind of comparative and dismissive terms just described.
Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg
translated parts of
Peter Whalley 's edition into German in 1765. Shortly before the Romantic revolution,
Edward Capell
offered an almost unqualified rejection of Jonson as a dramatic poet, who (he writes) "has very poor pretensions to the high place he holds among the English Bards, as there is no original manner to distinguish him, and the tedious sameness visible in his plots indicates a defect of Genius." [ 43 ]
The disastrous failures of productions of
Volpone
and
Epicoene
in the early 1770s no doubt bolstered a widespread sense that Jonson had at last grown too antiquated for the contemporary public; if he still attracted enthusiasts such as
Earl Camden
and
William Gifford , he all but disappeared from the stage in the last quarter of the century.
The
romantic
revolution in criticism brought about an overall decline in the critical estimation of Jonson. Hazlitt refers dismissively to Jonson's "laborious caution." Coleridge, while more respectful, describes Jonson as psychologically superficial: “He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to observe what was open to, and likely to impress, the senses.” Coleridge placed Jonson second only to Shakespeare; other romantic critics were less approving. The early 19th century was the great age for recovering Renaissance drama. Jonson, whose reputation had survived, appears to have been less interesting to some readers than writers such as
Thomas Middleton
or
John Heywood , who were in some senses "discoveries" of the 19th century. Moreover, the emphasis which the romantic writers placed on imagination, and their concomitant tendency to distrust studied art, lowered Jonson's status, if it also sharpened their awareness of the difference traditionally noted between Jonson and Shakespeare. This trend was by no means universal, however;
William Gifford , Jonson's first editor of the 19th century, did a great deal to defend Jonson's reputation during this period of general decline. In the next era,
Swinburne , who was more interested in Jonson than most
Victorians , wrote, "The flowers of his growing have every quality but one which belongs to the rarest and finest among flowers: they have colour, form, variety, fertility, vigour: the one thing they want is fragrance” – by “fragrance,” Swinburne means spontaneity.
In the 20th century, Jonson’s body of work has been subject to a more varied set of analyses, broadly consistent with the interests and programmes of modern literary criticism. In an essay printed in
The Sacred Wood ,
T. S. Eliot
attempted to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analysing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonson's overall conception and his "surface", a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism, which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century, a number of critics and scholars followed Eliot's lead, producing detailed studies of Jonson's verbal style. At the same time, study of Elizabethan themes and conventions, such as those by
E. E. Stoll
and
M. C. Bradbrook , provided a more vivid sense of how Jonson's work was shaped by the expectations of his time.
The proliferation of new critical perspectives after mid-century touched on Jonson inconsistently. Jonas Barish was the leading figure among critics who appreciated Jonson's artistry. On the other hand, Jonson received less attention from the new critics than did some other playwrights and his work was not of programmatic interest to psychoanalytic critics. But Jonson's career eventually made him a focal point for the revived
sociopolitical criticism . Jonson's works, particularly his masques and pageants, offer significant information regarding the relations of literary production and political power, as do his contacts with and poems for aristocratic patrons; moreover, his career at the centre of London's emerging literary world has been seen as exemplifying the development of a fully commodified literary culture. In this respect he is seen as a transitional figure, an author whose skills and ambition led him to a leading role both in the declining culture of
patronage
and in the rising culture of mass consumption.
Poetry
Jonson has been called 'the first poet laureate'. [ 44 ]
If Jonson's reputation as a playwright has traditionally been linked to Shakespeare, his reputation as a poet has, since the early 20th century, been linked to that of
John Donne . In this comparison, Jonson represents the
cavalier
strain of poetry, emphasising grace and clarity of expression; Donne, by contrast, epitomised the
metaphysical
school of poetry, with its reliance on strained,
baroque
metaphors and often vague phrasing. Since the critics who made this comparison ( Herbert Grierson
for example), were to varying extents rediscovering Donne, this comparison often worked to the detriment of Jonson's reputation.
In his time Jonson was at least as influential as Donne. In 1623, historian
Edmund Bolton
named him the best and most polished English poet. That this judgment was widely shared is indicated by the admitted influence he had on younger poets. The grounds for describing Jonson as the "father" of cavalier poets are clear: many of the cavalier poets described themselves as his "sons" or his "tribe". For some of this tribe, the connection was as much social as poetic;
Herrick
described meetings at "the Sun, the Dog, the Triple Tunne". All of them, including those like Herrick whose accomplishments in verse are generally regarded as superior to Jonson's, took inspiration from Jonson's revival of classical forms and themes, his subtle melodies, and his disciplined use of
wit . In these respects Jonson may be regarded as among the most important figures in the prehistory of English
neoclassicism .
The best of Jonson's lyrics have remained current since his time; periodically, they experience a brief vogue, as after the publication of Peter Whalley's edition of 1756. Jonson's poetry continues to interest scholars for the light which it sheds on English literary history, such as politics, systems of patronage, and intellectual attitudes. For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: " On My First Sonne "; " To Celia "; " To Penshurst "; and the
epitaph
on
boy player
Solomon Pavy.

that he famously quipped on the manner in which language became a measure of the speaker or writer:
Language most shows a man: Speak, that I may see thee. It springs out of the most retired and inmost parts of us, and is the image of the parent of it, the mind. No glass renders a man’s form or likeness so true as his speech. Nay, it is likened to a man; and as we consider feature and composition in a man, so words in language; in the greatness, aptness, sound structure, and harmony of it.
— Ben Jonson, 1640 (posthumous) [ 46 ]
As with other English Renaissance dramatists, a portion of Ben Jonson's literary output has not survived. In addition to
The Isle of Dogs
(1597), the records suggest these lost plays as wholly or partially Jonson's work:
Richard Crookback
(1602);
Hot Anger Soon Cold
(1598), with Porter and
Henry Chettle ;
Page of Plymouth
(1599), with Dekker; and
Robert II, King of Scots
(1599), with Chettle and Dekker. Several of Jonson's masques and entertainments also are not extant:
The Entertainment at Merchant Taylors
(1607);
The Entertainment at Salisbury House for James I
(1608); and
The May Lord
(1613–19).
Finally, there are questionable or borderline attributions. Jonson may have had a hand in
Rollo, Duke of Normandy, or The Bloody Brother , a play in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. The comedy
The Widow
was printed in 1652 as the work of
Thomas Middleton , Fletcher and Jonson, though scholars have been intensely sceptical about Jonson's presence in the play. A few attributions of anonymous plays, such as
The London Prodigal , have been ventured by individual researchers, but have met with cool responses. [ 47 ]
