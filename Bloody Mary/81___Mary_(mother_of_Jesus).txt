Bloggers faced Biki’s Waterworld at Enchanted Kingdom
30
May
The Manila Bloggers were invited last Sunday, May 23, 2010 to witness the Flores de Laguna en Mayo and to enjoy Biki’s Waterworld at Enchanted Kingdom!
We were all expecting to be soaked in sweat but lo and behold: It rained! We were still able to enjoy EK due to the occasional hellos of the sun that day.
To all the non-Filipinos out there, Flores de Mayo is a  Catholic
festival held in the  Philippines
in the month of May. It lasts for a month, and is held in honor of the  Virgin Mary . The  Santa Cruzan
is a parade held on the last day of Flores de Mayo in honor of  Reyna Elena .
The winners of the Miss Philippines Earth 2010 graced the Flores de Laguna en Mayo that day. Here are some pictures:
I would love to upload all the pictures but they were just too many!
After witnessing the Flores de Laguna en Mayo, we were asked to proceed to Biki’s Waterworld, it was my first time to go there so I don’t have any real expectations on what I would see. Well, I expect a pool. A children’s pool. But I was welcomed with all these eye-candy!
We were first to experience Biki’s Waterworld Aqualympics! I can’t go into details but expect an amazing-race-type of obstacles. I’ve got to tell you that my muscles..I mean..fats…ached for 2 days after  the 10  strenuous pit stops we have to endure that day. But it was loads of fun!
I recommend this as a great idea for a team building, but expect to get tired with all the obstacle races.  EK Biki Waterworld is open daily from 4:00PM to 10:00PM. Guests should come in proper swimwear complete with swimming caps. For more details, you may call 584-3535 or 584-4326 to 29. You may also log on to  www.enchantedkingdom.ph .

Then and Now Massive Music Festival 2010 tomorrow!
14
May
JoJo, Diana King, Frankie J, Baby Bash, P.M. Dawn, SWV, All-4-One and V Factory— each and every one of them performing their greatest hits onstage for all their fans in the Philippines in one concert!
The THEN AND NOW Massive Music Festival is a definite all-hits show- not an album tour (where the artist/s only sing cuts from a new-released CD), or a promo tour (where the artist/s only push a couple of songs)- so music fans from all over the country can expect to sing and dance to their favorite tunes all night long.
Prizes will be given away to lucky concert-goers, as Divan Media enlist the involvement of all sorts of music-friendly sponsors and partner companies, who also have a mind to make concert night a lot more festive and fun.
The THEN AND NOW Massive Music Festival 2010 featuring JoJo, Frankie J, Baby Bash, Diana King, SWV, P.M. Dawn,All-4-One and V Factory happens on a Saturday, May 15, at the SM Mall of Asia Concert Grounds. Tickets are available at Ticketnet and Ticketworld outlets.

The adidas Originals Street Party in Manila celebrated the roots of authenticity and Originality at its core—the streets, the very place where Originality comes to life as artists, athletes, musicians, and creative innovators are inspired to create. It was a night of playing on the streets in the truest sense: Marching with Star Wars Troopers, dancing to beatboxers, doodling with painters, participating in foosball competitions, and cheering on skate crew performances in a massive street-level party. What’s more, amazing party loot, inlcluding an Adidas Originals x Sennheiser DJ Headphones, 60 Years Diamond Studded Superstars, Limited Edition DMC Autographed Superstars, and 10-inch, limited-edition adidas Originals Trexi Toy, were awarded to lucky revelers.

This sense of play continues in the adidas Originals theme throughout 2010 as adidas highlights collections that reflect what makes adidas Originals truly unique: a diverse mix of styles and stories, collaborations and creativity. From football lifestyle products that herald the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ to fine Japanese streetwear design in the OT-Tech range, from iconic collaborations with French grafitti artist Fafi, cinema icon
Star Wars , and cool ride Vespa to customizable product lines styled and restyled by you, the creative innovator, adidas celebrates true Originality.
The bloggers were invited to experience the awesomeness of the Adidas street party. There were lots of eye candy there ;D. We get to eat street food, see the storm troopers and darth vader, and see the great adidas originals collection . It was a great night!
Thanks to Az and Khit for inviting us!
