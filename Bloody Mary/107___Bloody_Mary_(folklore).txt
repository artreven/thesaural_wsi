Around The World In 80 Days DVD Report
Steve Coogan
dons the top hat and tails of 19th century inventor
Phileas Fogg , in
Around The World In 80 Days , but the real star of the show is
Jackie Chan
as his hapless valet
Passepartout . With his inimitable blend of slapstick martial arts, he puts the kick in sidekick, and just about compensates for the many holes you could punch through the script :) Coogan retains the pomp of
Alan Partridge
to play the visionary scientist who is mocked by his peers for espousing outlandish ideas about combustible engines, flying machines, and rollerblades! When his credibility is brought into question by the head of The Royal Academy Of Science (a shamelessly hammy
Jim Broadbent ), Fogg stakes his reputation, as well as his livelihood, on the hypothesis that he can circumnavigate the globe in 80 days. What am I doing buying a
Disney movie
you may ask! Well as far as I'm concerned, I bought a  Steve Coogan  movie! I normally avoid
family movies , anything
Disney , and overall niceness, but this was great, it reminded me of the 1960s blockbuster movies like
Those Magnificent Men In their Flying Machines ! Overall a great movie! :) Here is the trailer...

Godsend DVD Report
Godsend
is the story of an eight year old boy named
Adam Duncan . A kind, thoughtful and well behaved child, he is the apple of his parent's eye until one day he is knocked down by a car and tragically killed. With both parents totally grief stricken, the mysterious
Doctor Richard Wells
( Robert De Niro ) offers them another chance of happiness. He can create a clone of Adam that will be identical to the child they lost. Nine months later they have their child back. Identical in every way, it's like Adam had never left them. He has his mother's eyes, his father's smile, but when he crosses the age at which he died terrifying things begin to happen.  I liked
Godsend , the end was a bit odd though, it just stopped (in a dramatic place), started again, then just stopped (in a not so dramatic place!). I'd say watch it if it appeals though! Here is the trailer...

Phoenix Nights Series 2 DVD Report
I've recently started watching a lot of  Peter Kay
(I never watched his stuff until
Amarillo ), so technically I came in
post-amarillo , which is a bit embarassing, as I can't say things like
I was into Kays stuff years ago.. .  So had never seen
Phoenix Nights
before tonight, I bought this DVD for 50p from a car boot earlier today, and I must say its hilarious! The material reminds me of
gentle comedy , like
Victoria Woods Dinnerladies , only this is really funny! Some of the visual jokes are very clever, subtle, and close to genius! All I can say is if you have never seen
Phoenix Nights , your missing a lot! Heres the beginning of episode one, and if you have a look on YouTube, you can watch much more...

You Gotta See This Too Hot For Fox Sports DVD Report
I don't know where I got
You Gotta See This Too Hot For Fox Sports DVD , I certainly wouldn't buy it, so I suspect I was either given it, or it was part of a bundle I bought! Anyway, today I found this DVD in one of my boxes, so I figured I may as well play it! If you like naked skydiving, naked sumo wrestling, naked coleslaw wresting, very nasty sporting injuries, or just stupid people doing things that do lead to nasty injury, then you'll find this DVD funny. I found it unbelievable and rather worrying, but if I'd had a few drinks with my mates, I'd probably laugh too :) If anyone wants some slightly used coleslaw, I think I know where to get 50lb cheap :)

Urban Legends Bloody Mary DVD Report
Urban Legends Bloody Mary
hits all the marks a good horror movie is supposed to hit. Director
Mary Lambert
is an experienced hand ( Pet Sematary
and some
Tales From The Crypt ) and leads
Kate Mara
and
Robert Vito
as fraternal twins Samantha and David Owens give a good, believable performance as two teens caught in a scary mystery about what happened to a girl their age some thirty years ago. Samantha and her friends are drugged and taken to a secluded place by some football players as revenge for an article she wrote for the school newspaper. This is what happened to Mary Banner (aka
Bloody Mary ) and her friends thirty years before so Mary’s spirit decides to get even with the people who tried to hurt Samantha. The reason
Urban Legends Bloody Mary
works is that a lot of the bad guys involved in Samanthas abduction have a by-the-book urban legend death such as deep-frying in a
tanning bed , a
spider laying its eggs
in you and the baby spiders hatching the next day right out of your body, the
vending machine that will fall over
you if you stick your hand in it, and a couple of other
urban myths . I didn't even try to work out who the killer was until the last 20 minutes, which I did instantly, but I was engrossed in the movie! I liked it, a lot, I found myself pretty glued to it, which makes a differance, as many more expensive to make movies have bored me, overall I'd say watch it! Here is the trailer...

Silent Hill DVD Report
Based on the best-selling horror action game,
Silent Hill
stars
Radha Mitchell
as Rose, a desperate mother who takes her adopted daughter, Sharon, to the town of
Silent Hill
in an attempt to cure her of her ailment. After a car crash, Sharon disappears and Rose begins her desperate search to get her back. She descends into a fog of smoldering ash and into the center of the twisted reality of a towns terrible secret. Pursued by grotesquely deformed creatures and a townspeople who are stuck in permanent purgatory, Rose begins to uncover the truth behind the apocalyptic disaster that burned the town thirty years ago. Once You Enter Silent Hill there is no turning back! I had seen a dodgy copy of
Silent Hill
when it first came out, so I was pleased to see a good copy :) I really enjoyed it, the monster sections where very
HP Lovecraft
and pretty tense! Overall a good movie, if your tempted, watch it! Here is the trailer...

Peter Kay Live At The Manchester Arena DVD Report
Peter Kay
returns with a special edition DVD of his
Mum wants a new Bungalow
tour. This new DVD features the show as
filmed at the Manchester Arena
(instead of
Bolton Albert Halls ) and includes the smash hit
Is this the way to Amarillo . What that means is its the same material as
The Bolton Albert Halls  DVD, but filmed at Manchester, with the Amarillo video added, but costs twenty quid -
Bastards ! Its less than 45 minutes long - be warned! I paid £1 for it, so I don't feel gutted, but it had a distinct lack of new material, so I still felt bored! I don't think I laughed at all! If you have seen  The Bolton Albert Halls DVD , dont even bother, even for £1!

Welcome
I collect DVDs, we have over 3,000 titles in the house now! I buy most from Car Boot Sales,Poundshops, markets, sales, and greatly reduced from the internet, but I only buy what I want to watch! I do a short report when I watch them, I got rid of almost 800 titles at Christmas 2010 (low score, duplicates, ones I'd never watch etc.) I continue to wade through them, and appear to be buying slightly less, but still watching like mad :)
