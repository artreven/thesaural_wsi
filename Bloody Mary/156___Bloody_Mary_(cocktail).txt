Re-Kindling My Love of the Sunday Times
I am a New Yorker.
I have lived in Florida for the past 15 years, but as the saying goes, you can take the boy out of the city, but you can't take the city out of the boy.
As a New Yorker, I was weaned on
The New York Times
and grew up in Queens with the ritual of the Sunday Times as deeply ingrained as a cream cheese "schmear" on a fresh baked bagel.
The "Times" was such an important part of our lives that in Social Studies class at
Forest Hills High School
we even learned the "art" of folding the New York Times into a thin vertical quarter, making it easy to read it with one hand on the subway (leaving your other hand free to hang on for dear life!) A Section At A Times... The Sunday Times is an entity in and of itself.
Thick, heavy and filled with "sections" rich with meaty, pithy content.
Every true New Yorker has their favorite section: Sunday Business, Arts and Leisure, Travel, Book Review, The New York Times Magazine, Sports Sunday, Real Estate, Week In Review, Sunday Styles, even Obituaries... everyone has a section they pull out and read first.
Everyone has their own Sunday Times routine.
My Dad's started Saturday evening, when, on the way home from dining out Saturday night, he would always stop at the corner newsstand to get the early Sunday edition, usually delivered by 10pm Saturday night. Sunday, Bloody Sunday... When I lived and worked in Manhattan, my own Sunday Times routine often started with brunch and a good
Bloody Mary
(or two).
I'd organize the sections into my preferred reading order and dive in, starting with Arts and Leisure, and ending with Sunday Sports and the Magazine.
If I was pressed for time, I would set aside (and never get to) the less essential sections.
The comfort of the Sunday Times ritual was such that even when I moved north to Rockland County, and years later south, to Florida, I had the Sunday Times delivered to my home and did my best to continue the tradition. Not So Special Delivery In time, I realized that Sunday Home Delivery of The Times outside of New York was a less than reasonable facsimile for the experience I knew and loved.
The "Florida" version of the paper did not contain all the Sections and delivery service was sporadic at best.
It just wasn't the same and before long I canceled my subscription, and, as a rabid consumer of online news both on my PC and mobile phone, I more or less forgot about the good old "Times." Enter The Kindle Since getting the
Kindle 2
when it first came out, I have used it to read books and documents I send to it, but I had not tried reading any newspapers... until today.
This morning I was poking around the
Kindle Store
when I realized I could download the Sunday Edition of the New York Times for only $.75, a fraction of what I used to pay for the Home Delivery version.
So I did, and it was great.
For the first time in years I enjoyed a lazy Sunday morning sitting on the couch, sipping coffee and reading all my favorite sections of the Sunday Times.
I am already a big fan of ebooks in general and the Kindle specifically, and I found the electronic Sunday Times experience every bit as enjoyable as the papers of my past.
I now know what my new Sunday routine is going to be.
Time to break out the Bloody Mary mix! How about you?
Have you tried reading the Sunday Times or other Newspapers on the Kindle?
