Methods of Mixing cocktails
This Earth Bar Magazine article simply looks at different methods of
making a cocktail.
Build over ice
This is the simplest method of making a cocktail, it
simply involves placing ice in the glass & pouring the ingredients over the top. It can also help
create colourful effects.
Blender
The hardest thing to do well when blending cocktails
is to correctly measure the ice. The beginners method to get the correct amount & limit wastage
until you become confident with the amount of ice that should go into the blender is to fill your glass
with ice, then pour the ice from the glass into the blender.
When pouring ingredients from a blender gently tap
the side of the blender continuously this firstly gives you consistency & a smooth transition into
the glass.
If pouring 2 drinks from the 1 blend only fill the
glasses ½ way to ensure consistency.
Stir
Used most commonly in cocktails containing gin to
avoid bruising the gin. This is my most elegant form of cocktail mixology. The reason for stirring a
cocktail is to get an evenly balanced flavour. It is also used commonly as a way of mixing flavours when
the drink contains a fizzy substance, example Champagne or soft drink.
In cocktails such as the Old fashion the goal is to
slowly infuse the aromatic flavour of bitters with Bourbon, water melted from ice & sugar.
Normally stirred cocktails will be strained. Double
straining is also recommended for martini style cocktails.
Shake
& Strain
The goal of shaking a cocktail is similar to that of
stirring a cocktail except is much more effective when using liqueurs. A Liqueur is much heavier in
density than a spirit due to their high sugar content.
Shaking a cocktail is also a groovy look for any
stylish bar. The technique is simple, pour ingredients over ice into the mixing glass, put metal tin
over the top & shake. Always shake with glass pointed up & hand firmly over the mixing glass.
To separate tap the top of the metal tin firmly on
flat side, put hawthorn strainer on top of tin & strain
into glass.
Muddle Shake & Strain
Over the last 5 years cocktail muddling has become
the most popular way of mixing cocktails by mixologists in all the world trendy bar scenes. The reason
is that it extracts the full flavour of fresh fruit, herbs & spices. Allowing Cocktails to take on
new culinary styles.
To Muddle a cocktail ingredients is simply to crush
the ingredients to extract their flavour. In many fruits such as limes there are huge amounts of flavour
in the fruits skin that is essential to the flavour of drinks such as the Mojito & Caipiroska.
Although most drinks & muddles with sugar it is
not essential.
The reason that we then shake & strain the
cocktail is to remove all the excess pieces of fruit & herbs as it is their wonderful flavours that
we aim to acquire. It is also very important when making martini style cocktails to double strain.
Throwing
This is the latest London bar trend. It is normally
used with Martini’s to aerate the drink enhancing the flavour of the Gin.
The technique simply involves long pouring the
ingredients of a cocktail between two mixing glasses. The same technique used in India to make chai tea.

Bar Spoons. The best bar spoon for my money is the Roslë 10.7 inch bar spoon. It is made of 18/10 stainless steel and is a bit heavy, but it is very well-balanced and extremely durable. Most bar spoons are made of twisted metals and can be rough on the hands after a long night of stirring, but the Roslë spoon is smooth and stirs with ease. Available on amazon.com and barproducts.com.
Strainers. There are three types of strainers used behind the bar: Hawthorne strainers for shaken cocktails, Juleps for stirred, and Fine (or Double) strainers, which are meant to be used in concert with either to strain small bits of muddled fruit or spices. I can't stand the cheap, loosely coiled Hawthorne strainers that are behind most bars; the spring is never tight enough and ice chips are allowed to fall into a cocktail. There are many great Hawthornes, but my two favorites are the elegant Per Alimenti Italian Strainers (cocktailkingdom.com) and the extremely functional OXO stainless Hawthorne strainers (amazon.com). A great Julep Strainer is hard to find: Uber Tools makes a good one, but I prefer the inexpensive, unbranded type that have a diamond shaped hole in the handle, are a bit larger than the regular Julep and fit nicely into a Yarai mixing glass. For Fine Strainers, I use the 3" Conical Stainless Steel Mesh Strainer available on barproducts.com
Jiggers. I've never been a fan of the classic, old-style bowtie jiggers. You need more than one to capture multiple measurements and no one ever uses them correctly (meniscus, people!!!) OXO makes a 2 oz. stainless measuring-cup style that is very popular with bartenders; unfortunately, it is hard to see the inside measurements in a dimly lit bar. But OXO's newest jigger is its best yet. It has a rubber grip in the middle and the graduated lines are etched and show easily even under low lighting. Both are available on amazon.com. And cocktailkingdom.com has some beautiful Japanese-style jiggers that look great in a presentation set or for use at a formal event.
Mixing Glasses. It is easy to just use a pint glass for stirring, but many experienced bartenders have turned to the Yarai mixing glass. It is an elegant presentation piece and the straight-sided design allows for better dilution than the standard slant-sided pint glass. There are two types available on cocktailkingdom.com: seamed and seamless. The seamed is less expensive and sturdier for high volume use; the seamless version is a bit more refined and more fragile.
Muddlers. Many styles of muddlers can be found online. Forget about anything that has a grated or spiked base; it ruins mint and other herbs by extracting the bitter interior oils of the leaves. Mr Mojito has a number of great options, but a really special gift for your favorite bartender is a PUG! Muddler. PUG!'s are hand-turned and individually made by Chris Gallagher, who is intentionally low-tech. The only way to get one is to send him an e-mail (jcgallagher08@hotmail.com), and pay by PayPal or send him a check. They can be made with several different styles of hardwood.
Hand Juicer. There are many different kinds of citrus juicers available, but in my mind there is only one: the Cadillac of juicers, the NorPro Citrus Hand Juicer. In three years, I've probably squeezed over 20,000 limes, lemon and oranges with my NorPro, and it still looks and works like new. And your hands won't get any calluses or blisters as they do when you use the traditional Mexican cast-aluminum juicers. Available on cheftools.com and amazon.com.
Lewis Bags. A Lewis Bag is a sack used for crushing ice. The canvas- like fabric wicks away moisture so that your crushed ice remains dry. I recommend the TAG Bag by Tony Abou-Ganim.
Ice Pick. A well-crafted ice pick is a must for ice carving and shaping. I prefer the Japanese-style Anvil pick available at Cocktail Kingdom. The heavy hammer at the base helps break up large blocks while the tempered steel pick is suited for carving.
Knives. Quality knives are a must for the modern-era bartender. I use the 3-piece Global Knife set, which includes a 3.5-inch Paring Knife, 5-inch Chef's Utility Knife, 7-inch Hollow Edge Santoku Knife.
There are many more tools essential for a modern bar that may be more like stocking stuffers than full0on gifts. These include the OXO peeler, the Microplane 40020 Classic Series Zester/Grater and the Misto stainless steel atomizer (for Bitters).
I hope this list makes for some happy and well-equipped bartenders after the holidays. Cheers!

Shaker Tins.
Shakers are the most important tools behind any bar. I use four basic types of tin sets to shake cocktails: Parisian, Cobbler, Metal on Metal, and Boston shakers. My personal favorites are the WMF Parisian shaker tins. The set looks like a bullet and is shaped for optimum movement inside the tins while shaking. I also love the AG brand Cobbler shakers; they are three-piece, have a built-in strainer and can be used for the Japanese Hard Shake. (Beware of cheaper brand Parisians and Cobblers -- they have a thinner gauge metal and lock up when cold). Metal on Metal tins are also great for achieving maximum chilling for cocktails; my favorite set is the Naranja weighted 28 oz./18 oz. This ratio causes the small tin to sit high inside the large tin and gives a good distance for the ice and the cocktail to travel while shaking. Finally, the classic Boston shaker set uses an 18 oz. glass with a 24-28 oz. tin and is a must behind any bar. You can buy the last two in combo by purchasing a 28 oz. tin, 18 oz. tin and 18 oz. heat-treated pint glass. All are available on cocktailkingdom.com.
