A ‘Picture Perfect’
Launch
Looking like a bright star streaking up into a black sky, a rocket took
off before dawn today from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida carrying
an unmanned capsule filled with food, clothes, and other supplies for astronauts
on the international space station.
But this robotic cargo ship doesn’t
belong to NASA. Instead, it’s owned by a company called SpaceX, which made
history by launching the first ever private spacecraft on a mission to the
station.
SpaceX has a $1.6 billion cargo-delivery contract with NASA,
which is turning routine flights to the station over to industry so that the
veteran space agency can start to focus on more ambitious exploration efforts.

This is a landmark moment in space travel. With the entry of private firms
into the public space game, NASA not only ensures continued support for ISS
projects, but can turn their resources to missions above and beyond near-earth
orbit.
This is the kind of progress that lets NASA worry less about meeting a
bottom line or boldly going where we’ve gone many times before, and instead lets
them start thinking about what’s
next .

A Partial Solar Eclipse over Texas

Explanation:
It was a typical Texas sunset except that most of the
Sun was missing. The location of the missing piece of the Sun was not a mystery
-- it was
behind the Moon . Sunday night's
partial eclipse
of the Sun by the Moon turned into one of the best photographed astronomical
events in history.

another . Pictured above is possibly one of the
more
interesting
posted images -- a partially eclipsed Sun setting in a reddened
sky behind brush and a windmill. The image was
taken Sunday
night from about 20 miles west of
Sundown ,
Texas, USA, just after the
ring of fire
effect was broken by the Moon
moving away
from the center of the Sun. Coming early next month is an
astronomical event
that holds promise to be even more
photographed -- the last partial eclipse of the
Sun by Venus
until the year
2117 .

A total solar eclipse cast a huge shadow on Earth Wednesday,
captured by a Japanese satellite.
Shown here covering Taiwan at 9:30 a.m. local time at nearly
the height of the eclipse, the shadow covered some locations as long as six
minutes, making it the longest solar eclipse of the century. The next one this
impressive will not occur until 2132.

"Lesson
of the Goose"
1. As each goose
flaps its wings, it creates an uplift for the bird behind it. By flying in a
V-formation, the whole flock adds 71 percent more flying range than if each bird
flew alone. Lesson: People who share a common direction and sense of
community can get where they are going quicker and easier when they are
traveling on the thrust of one another.
2. When a goose gets sick,
wounded, or shot down, two geese drop out of formation and follow it down. They
stay with the goose to help and protect it until it is able to fly again or
dies. Then they launch out with another formation to catch up with the flock.
Lesson: If we have as much sense as geese, we will stand by each other.
3. Whenever a goose falls out of the formation, it suddenly feels the
drag and resistance of trying to fly alone and quickly gets back into formation
to take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front.
Lesson: If
we have as much sense as a goose, we will stay in formation with those who are
headed where we want to go.
4. When the lead goose gets tired, it
rotates back into the formation and another goose flies at the point position.
Lesson: It pays to take turns doing the hard tasks and sharing
leadership.
5. The geese in formation honk from behind to encourage
those up front to keep up their speed. Lesson: We need to make sure our
honking from behind is encouraging- -not something less than helpful. This is
Rex Barker, reminding you that there are constant lessons and reminders for us
both as individuals and as humanity It is up to us to learn from them and grow.

The Lone Ranger and Tonto are riding through one of the
many canyons when suddenly rising from the hill on their right are hundreds of
indians. They start to spur their horse forward when they realised that there
are hundreds of indians ahead of them. Wheeling to the left they, once again,
see hundreds of indians rising from the hill. They begin to back away in the
direction from which they had come and they realise, they were surrounded. The
indians had spread out. They were trapped.
The Lone Ranger turns to

Netting a catch I met her on the

soon became twice weekly. I liked her face, her pointed chin, the way
she touched her hair, I loved her smile and glinting eyes, and all beyond
in there I longed to meet her desperately, but only could I
dream, of seeing her in the flesh and not just on the screen I
booked my flight and flew for hours, I was feeling so elated but
finally, when we met her face looked devastated Why was this? I could
not think. Of course, I should have told her I'm really only 4 feet
tall, and my head's a lot more balder. It always seemed too good for
real, the honeymoon was over, I reluctantly went home again, and wept
as I flew over and soon enough , I did groan, the relationship had
ended she broke my heart the wretched bitch, and still it hasn't
mended there is a happy ending though, for after I lost Kiki, I
fell in love with Annabel who doesn't find me geeky Anna is a lovely
sight, she makes me warm inside I have to blow her up, you see cause

First Pinskers Hawk-Eagle Hatched at Philippine
Eagle Foundation
The Philippine Eagle Foundation
announced a first in its conservation breeding program. They successfully
hatched a Pinsker’s Hawk-Eagle chick on April 2 at their conservation breeding
facility after an incubation period of 48 days. The chick is the first Pinsker’s
Hawk-Eagle ( Nisaetus pinskeri ) bred and hatched in captivity. It came
from a natural pair of parents and weighed a mere 57.2 grams when it
hatched.
Once it reaches adulthood, this medium-sized eagle will
look like the picture below. It will have a light brown body with a brown, black
and white belly and a dark brown tail striped with four to five darker, narrow
bands. Its head and under parts will be reddish-brown with black streaks, while
the throat will be white. And its wings will become broad and
rounded.
The Pinsker’s Hawk-Eagle, endemic to the Philippines, is
a species of bird of prey in the Acciptridae family. It is considered threatened
because of the loss of its natural habitat - the subtropical or tropical moist
lowland forest. PEF Executive Director Dennis Salvador said, “The fast
diminishing forests and destruction of their habitats are still the biggest
threats to their survival. We need everyone’s contribution to ensure that the
Pinsker’s Hawk-Eagle population will increase, especially in the
wild."

This latest video,
Ferienne , uses more of

nice beat to boot). The shapes you see here are like peering into the invisible,
using the ferrofluids to reveal the shapes of unseen magnetic fields. These are
forms that we could never create in any other way, and are so random that each
one may never be seen again.

Hans Rosling: Religions and

http://youtu.be/ezVk1ahRF78
Watching Hans Rosling chase data points across a
screen with a huge pointer as he gives breathless play-by-play of statsitical
changes will never get old.
In a planet that’s getting increasingly full, we must
ask a couple of questions: How can we prepare for tomorrow’s population,
whatever it will be? How do birth rates relate to lifestyle around the
world?
I’ve heard it said before that certain religious
beliefs lead to more children per woman. There’s the stereotype extremes of
Latin American Catholics and Northern European athiests. Do they hold
water?
Hans takes a look at world religions, average income
and family planning and how they relate to birth rates and population growth in
the way that only Mr. Rosling can.
I’ll let you watch the details, but controlling
population is most certainly about providing
more
opportunity ,
not less religion. An instant TED favorite.

$1 Million Parking
Spot
Getting parking in New York is pretty hard, so get
ready to pay up if you want your own personal parking spot. How much, you ask?
How bout a cool million bucks:
The private garage at 66 E. 11th St. costs six
times more than the national-average price of a single-family home.
Buying it would be the same as paying a $115 ticket for illegal parking
every day — for 24 years.
For moguls or celebrities, however, the rare
commodity of a Manhattan parking space inside their building, with a curb cut at
the street, is a huge status symbol and selling point. [...]
The hot
space is about 12 feet wide, 23 feet long and more than 15 feet high.
The spot could be “duplexed” if the buyer decides to install an
elevator lift so he or she can slide both the Maserati and the Lamborghini in at
the same time.

Mazatec is an adjective describing things relating to
the
Mazatec people , indigenous
inhabitants of
Sierra Mazateca
in Northern
Oaxaca ,
Mexico . Mazatec tradition includes the cultivation of
entheogens
for spiritual and
ritualistic use. Plants and fungi used for this purpose include
morning glory
seeds, coleus leaves,
psilocybe
mushrooms and
Salvia divinorum
or "Diviners' sage", a species of the
Salvia
(sage) genus with
psychoactive
properties. This latter plant is known to
Mazatec shamans
as
ska María
Pastora , the name containing a reference to the
Virgin Mary .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I was reading the novel, The
Devil's Elixer.
It mentioned a bunch of drugs I was
unfamiliar with, so, I looked them up.
They are
real!
Psilocybin mushroom
Psilocybe
is a
genus
of small
mushrooms
growing worldwide. This genus is best known for its species with
psychedelic or
hallucinogenic
properties, widely known as
" magic mushrooms ", though the
majority of species do not contain hallucinogenic compounds.
Psilocin
and
psilocybin
are the hallucinogenic compounds responsible for the psychoactive effects of
many species in the genus.
Salvia Divnorum
Salvia divinorum
(also known as
Diviner's Sage ,
Ska María Pastora ,
Seer's Sage , and by its
genus name
Salvia ) is a
psychoactive
plant which can
induce
dissociative
effects and is a
potent producer of "visions" and other hallucinatory experiences. Its native
habitat is within
cloud forest
in the isolated
Sierra Mazateca
of
Oaxaca ,
Mexico , where it grows in shady
and moist locations.
Mazatec shamans
have a long and
continuous tradition of religious use of
Salvia divinorum , using it to
facilitate
visionary states of
consciousness
during spiritual healing
sessions. Salvia divinorum
remains legal in
most countries and, within the United States, is legal in the majority of
states. However, some have called for its prohibition. While not currently
regulated by US federal drug laws, several states have passed laws criminalizing
the substance.
Ayahuasca
4 lives of the
skull
Ayahuasca
( ayawaska
pronounced
[ajaˈwaska]
in the
Quechua language ) is any of various
psychoactive
infusions or
decoctions
prepared from the
Banisteriopsis spp.
vine, usually mixed with the leaves of
dimethyltryptamine
(DMT)-containing species of shrubs from the genus
Psychotria .
The brew, first described academically in the early 1950s by
Harvard
ethnobotanist
Richard Evans Schultes , who
found it employed for divinatory and healing purposes by the native peoples of
Amazonian
Colombia , is known by a number
of different names .
Iboga
sacred visionary
root
Tabernanthe iboga
or
Iboga
is a
perennial
rainforest
shrub
and
hallucinogen , native to western
Central Africa . Iboga
stimulates the
central nervous system
when
taken in small doses and induces visions in larger doses. In parts of Africa
where the plant grows the bark of the root is chewed for various pharmacological
or ritualistic purposes.
Ibogaine , the active alkaloid,
is also used to treat substance abuse disorders.
The root material, bitter in taste, causes an anaesthetic sensation in the
mouth
as
well as systemic numbness to the skin.
Borrachero
Imagine a drug that can transform you into a zombie
slave. An automaton that loses all free will, is incredibly compliant but still
appears to be alert and coherent. The drug is easily extracted from a very
common plant, is tasteless, odourless and can be swiftly mixed into drinks, food
and cigarettes. This demon drug is called borrachero. Ask any Colombian local
about borrachero, also known as burundanga, and they’re sure to tell you some
horror story corroborating the description above. Firstly, let us say that
borrachero is real and dangerous. The active substance is scopolamine and is
extracted from the Bugmansia plant, also known as Angel’s Trumpet, which grows
wild throughout the Andes. However the stories about criminals chemically
inducing obedience are a bit of an urban myth.

The

The
googol family
The names
googol
and
googolplex
were invented by
Edward Kasner 's
nephew, Milton Sirotta, and introduced in Kasner and Newman's 1940 book,
Mathematics and the Imagination , in the following
passage:
The name "googol" was invented by a child (Dr. Kasner's
nine-year-old nephew) who was asked to think up a name for a very big number,
namely 1 with one hundred zeroes after it. He was very certain that this number
was not infinite, and therefore equally certain that it had to have a name. At
the same time that he suggested "googol" he gave a name for a still larger
number: "Googolplex". A googolplex is much larger than a googol, but is still
finite, as the inventor of the name was quick to point out. It was first
suggested that a googolplex should be 1, followed by writing zeros until you got
tired. This is a description of what would actually happen if one actually tried
to write a googolplex, but different people get tired at different times and it
would never do to have
Carnera
a better mathematician than
Dr. Einstein , simply because he had
more endurance. The googolplex is, then, a specific finite number, equal to 1
with a googol zeros after it.

Kasner and

Conway and Guy have suggested that
N-plex
be used as a name for 10 N . This gives rise to the name
googolplexplex
for 10 googolplex . This number (ten to the power of a
googolplex) is also known as a googolduplex. Conway and Guy have proposed that
N-minex
be used as a name for 10 −N , giving rise to the name
googolminex
for the
reciprocal
of a googolplex. None of these names are in wide

Man Customizes His Mustang With A
Sharpie
If I didn’t know the back story, I never would have suspected that this
custom paint job was created with permanent marker!
Chris Dunlop took the customization of his Mustang into his own hands,
spending 50 hours and burning through a bunch of Sharpie pens to create this
automotive masterpiece.
The only drawback- if he leaves his car outside during a particularly
acidic rain storm all that hard work will go swirling down the drain. –via

George Lucas Strikes Back … with Low
Income Housing For 25 years, George Lucas tried to develop a
portion of his 6,100-acre property in the posh hills of Marin into an expansion
site for his movie production company. But his neighbors, fearing traffic and
disruption to their neighborhood, blocked the plan. Now, in a move worthy of a
Star Wars saga, the famous filmmaker struck back with an audacious plan:
... after spending years and millions of dollars,
Mr. Lucas abruptly canceled plans recently for the third, and most likely last,
major expansion, citing community opposition. An emotional statement posted
online said Lucasfilm would build instead in a place “that sees us as a creative
asset, not as an evil empire.”
If the announcement took Marin by
surprise, it was nothing compared with what came next. Mr. Lucas said he would
sell the land to a developer to bring “low income housing” here.

Burglar
The balaclava is in the wash, but the crime must go

An Idaho burglar wore a pair of underwear on his
head as he and another man broke into a Fruitland coffee shop. Perhaps he
figured the tighty-whities would do a better job hiding his face than the more
conventional bandana his partner wore. The two bandits kicked in the door and
though they couldn't get the safe, they made off with a cash register containing
about $500. "Who robs something with underwear on their head?" said an
incredulous Jason Wilson, co-owner of a chain of Big Star coffee

to rescue the precious suds before they completely disappeared:

“Some of the cows were also picking through the empties in the recycling bin…
They just went in and helped themselves.”
The cows’ owner came and herded

For years the alternative energy community has been
searching for an organic method, some enzyme or bacteria that can break down the
cellulose efficiently. The search has been unsuccessful...until
recently.
Understanding
the makeup of a bacterium found in the soil of a tropical rainforest may lead to
more efficient production of biofuels, U.S. researchers say. The
production of liquid fuels derived from plant biomass offers a promising
technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels,
but toxic chemicals, especially salty solvents, used in the first steps in the
process are often harmful to bacteria then used to break down the biomass, they
said. Now
scientists led by researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California have discovered how certain bacteria can tolerate those man-made
toxic chemicals used in making biofuels. "Discovering
microbes naturally tolerant to salty liquids and understanding their mechanisms
of tolerance should significantly enhance biofuel production," Lawrence
Livermore's Michael Thelen said. Microbes
in natural environments such as decomposing forest soils produce highly
efficient enzymes to degrade biomass and are often able to adapt to stressful
changes in their environment, the researchers found. The
researchers focused on enterobacter lignolyticus strain SCF1, a bacterium that
can degrade biomass, and found SCF1 grows well in the presence of relatively
high concentrations of the salty liquids used in a pretreatment step in biofuel
production. "Vigorous
efforts to discover and analyze micro-organisms with properties similar to those
of SCF1 have the potential to greatly benefit industrial processes," Thelen
said.

The following is a "history"
collected by teachers throughout the United States, from eighth grade through
college level. Read carefully, and you will learn a
lot. =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- The
inhabitants of ancient Egypt were called mummies. They lived in the Sarah
Dessert and traveled by Camelot. The climate of the Sarah is such that the
inhabitants have to live elsewhere, so certain areas of the dessert are
cultivated by irritation. The Egyptians built the Pyramids in the shape of a
huge triangular cube. The Pyramids are a range of mountains between France and
Spain. The Bible is full of interesting caricatures. In the first book of
the Bible, Guinesses, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree. On of their
children, Cain, once asked, "Am I my brother's son?" God asked Abraham to
sacrifice Isaac on Mount Montezuma. Jacob, son of Isaac, stole his brother's
birth mark. Jacob was a patriarch who brought up his twelve sons to be
patriarchs, but they did not take it. One of Jacob's sons, Joseph, gave refuse
to the Israelites. Pharaoh forced the Hebrew slaves to make bread without
straw. Moses led them to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread, which is
bread made without any ingredients. Afterwards, Moses went up on Mount Cyanide
to get the ten commandments. David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing the
liar. He fought with the Philatelists, a race of people who lived in the
Biblical times. Soloman, one of David's sons, had 500 wives and 500
porcupines. Without the Greeks we wouldn't have history. The Greeks
invented three kinds of columns - Corinthian, Doric, and Ironic. They also had
myths. A myth is a female moth. One myth says that the mother of Achilles dipped
him in the River Stynx until he became intollerable. Achilles appears in The
Iliad, by Homer. Homer also wrote The Oddity, in which Penelope was the last
hardship that Ulysses endured on his journey. Actually, Homer was not written by
Homer but by another man of that name. Socrates was a famous Greek
teacher who went around giving people advice. They killed him. Socrates died
from an overdose of wedlock. In the Olympic games, Greeks ran races,
jumped, hurled the biscuits, the threw the java. The reward to the victor was a
coral wreath. The government of Athens was democratic because people took the
law into their own hands. There were no wars in Greece, as the mountains were so
high that they couldn't climb over to see what their neighbors were doing. When
they fought with the Persians, the Greeks were outnumbered because the Persians
had more men. Eventually, the Ramons conquered the Greeks. History calls
people Romans because they never stayed in one place for very long. At Roman
banquets, the guests wore garlic in their hair. Julius Caesar extinguished
himself on the battlefields of Gaul. The Ides of March murdered him because they
thought he was going to be made king. Nero was a cruel tyranny who would turture
his poor subjects by playing the fiddle to them. Then came the Middle
Ages. King Alfred conquered the Dames. King Arthur lived in the Age of Shivery,
King Harold mustarded his troops before the Battle of Hastings, Joan of Arc was
canonized by Bernard Shaw, and victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their
necks. Finally, Magna Carta provided that no free man should be hanged twice for
the same offense. In medevil time most of the people were alliterate. The
greatest writer of the time was Chaucer, who wrote many poems and versus and
also wrote literature. Another tale tells of William Tell, who shot an arrow
through an apple while standing on his son's head. The Renaissance was an
age in which more individuals felt the value of their human being. Martin Luther
was nailed to the church door at Wittenberg for selling papal indulgences. He
died a horrible death, being excommunicated by a bull. It was the painter
Donatello's interes in the female nude that made him the father of the
Renaissance. It was an age of great inventions and discoveries. Gutenberg
invented the Bible. Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical figure because he
invented cigarettes. Another important invention was the circulation of blood.
Sir Francis Drake circumcised the world with a 100 foot clipper. The
government of England was a limited mockery. Henry VIII found walking difficult
because he had an abbess on his knee. Queen Elizabeth was the "Virgin Queen." As
a queen she was a success. When Elizabeth exposed herself before her troops,
they all shouted, "hurrah." Then her navy went out and defeated the Spanish
Armadillo. The greatest write of the Renaissance was William Shakespear.
Shakespear never made much money and is only famous because of his plays. He
lived at Windsor with his merry wives, writing tragedies, comedies and errors.
In one of Shakespear's famous plays, Hamlet rations out his situation by
relieving himself in a long soliloquy. In another, Lady Macbeth tried to
convince Macbeth to kill the Kind by attack his manhood. Romeo and Juliet are an
example of a heroic couplet. Writing at the same time as Shakespear was
Miguel Cervantes. He wrote Donkey Hote. The next great author was John Milton.
Milton wrote Paradise Lost. Then his wife died and he wrote Paradise
Regained. During the Renaissance America began. Christopher Columbus was
a great navigator who discovered America while cursing about the Atlantic. His
ships were called the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Fe. Later, the Pilgrims
crossed the Ocean, and this was known as Pilgrims Progress. When they landed at
Plymouth Rock, they were greeted by the Indians, who came down the hill rolling
their war hoops before them. The Indian squabs carried porpoises on their back.
Many of the Indian heroes were killed, along with their cabooses, which
proved very fatal for them. The winter of 1620 was a hard one for the settlers.
Many people died and many babies were born. Captain John Smith was responsible
for all this. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

thousands of dollars to pay for her wedding in May 2010 and her honeymoon in
Aruba.
Her scheme unraveled after her husband, Michael
O’Connell, contacted the Times Herald-Record in Orange County to say his bride
had faked her illness. He was not charged, and the couple have since divorced,
although the Times Herald-Record reported he was there to pick her up from jail
on Wednesday.
“To prey on people’s emotions by pretending to have a
terminal illness is unconscionable,” Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said
in a statement. “I am pleased that the community members, who felt so compelled
to generously help a neighbor in need, will be given back their hard-earned
money.”
Besides repaying $13,368.48 to her victims,
Vega was sentenced to time already served in
jail , must do 300 hours of community service and
serve five years on probation. She spent eight weeks in jail before her release
on Wednesday.
I hope her community service is dedicated to
those truly stricken with life-threatening
illness.
Ditto, thanks,
Ed

KURT VONNEGUT: The life of
art
http://zenpencils.com/
Kurt Vonnegut
(1922-2007) was an
American writer known for his unique novels that combined memoir, humour,
satire, cynicism and science-fiction. Vonnegut fought in World War II where he
was captured by the Nazis and as a POW, witnessed the fire bombing of Dresden –
an event which profoundly affected his outlook on life. Vonnegut and his fellow
prisoners were forced to recover dead bodies and clean up a city that he said
resembled the surface of the moon. Vonnegut had a talent for condensing profound
humanistic opinions into concise and simple words.
Here’s a great
article at The AV Club
featuring Vonnegut’s top 15 quotes.
~~~~~~~~~~
"So it goes." Unlike many of these
quotes, the repeated refrain from Vonnegut's classic
Slaughterhouse-Five
isn't notable for its unique wording so much as for how much emotion—and
dismissal of emotion—it packs into three simple, world-weary words that
simultaneously accept and dismiss everything. There's a reason this quote graced
practically every elegy written for Vonnegut over the past two weeks (yes,
including ours): It neatly encompasses a whole way of life. More crudely put:
"Shit happens, and it's awful, but it's also okay. We deal with it because we
have to."

Doom Roulette
With Jose Gonzalez’ “punishment wheel,” patented in 1989, a misbehaving
child can randomly choose the punishment he’ll receive. “From the child’s point
of view, it appears that an inanimate object is choosing and imposing the
punishment, instead of his parents. Direct parent-child conflict is thereby
eliminated.”
Available punishments, provided on decals, include NO TV, TIME OUT,
GROUNDED, 2ND CHANCE, NO DESSERT, DONATE A TOY, PARENT’S CHOICE, K.P., NO
ALLOWANCE, NO SPORTS, NO PHONE, NO FRIENDS, KID’S CHOICE, SWATS [a spanking], NO
VISITING, NO TREAT, and HOUSE CHORES. But “the punishments need not be those
shown in Fig. 4, but could be any set of punishments, expressed in any language,
deemed suitable for the disciplinary style of particular parents and degree of
maturity of their child.”

“Three Sundays in a
Week”
In 1850 Edgar Allan Poe pointed out the confusion that
can result when a ship reckons time while circling the world. Captain Smitherton
and Captain Pratt have just returned from circumnavigating the globe, one
traveling eastward and the other westward, while Kate and her father Mr.
Rumgudgeon have remained in London. On reuniting, they discover some confusion:
Captain Pratt thinks that tomorrow will be Sunday, Smitherton thinks that
yesterday was Sunday, and Kate and Rumgudgeon think that today is Sunday.
Finally Smitherton says:
What fools we two are ! — Mr. Rumgudgeon, the matter
stands thus: The earth, you know, is, in round numbers, twenty-four thousand
miles in circumference. Now the earth turns on its own axis, spins round, these
twenty-four thousand miles, going from west to east, in precisely twenty-four
hours. Well, sir, that is at the rate of one thousand miles an
hour.
Now suppose that I sail from this position a thousand
miles east. Of course, I anticipate the rising of the sun here at London by just
one hour. I see the sun rise one hour before you do. Proceeding in the same
direction yet another thousand miles, I anticipate the rising by two hours;
another thousand, and I anticipate it by three hours: and so on, until I go
entirely round the globe, and back to this spot, when having gone twenty-four
thousand miles east, I anticipate the rising of the London sun by no less than
twenty-four hours; that is to say, I am a day in advance of your time.
Understand?
But Captain Pratt, when he had sailed a thousand miles
west of this position, was an hour, and when he had sailed twenty-four thousand
miles was twenty-four hours, or one day, behind the time at London. Thus, with
me, yesterday was Sunday; thus, with you, to-day is Sunday; and thus, with
Captain Pratt, to-morrow will be Sunday. And what is more, Mr. Rumgudgeon, it is
positively clear that we are all right.
Mr. Rumgudgeon, who had forbidden Kate to marry until
there were “three Sundays in a week,” now relents. Too bad for him — the
international date line would shortly obviate the
problem.

The Power of Positive
Lightning
Airplanes are built to withstand bolts of lightning,
because strikes on planes happen now and again. But in 1999, a glider soaring
above Dunstable, England, was struck by a bolt out of the blue -literally,
because the plane was not in a storm- which ripped the craft apart at the seams,
including peeling apart the laminated layers of its surface.
Suspicion rapidly settled on the phenomenon known as
‘positive lightning’. Awareness of positive lightning’s significance has
gradually increased in recent decades, and it is now believed to comprise up to
5% of all lightning strikes. The negative charge at a storm cell’s base is
balanced by a strong positive charge at the cloud’s anvil-shaped top, up to
60,000 feet above the ground. While there is also a positive charge on the
ground immediately underneath the storm cell, significant charge differentials
can develop between cloud tops and negatively-charged land surfaces much further
away. Occasionally these differentials are sufficient to spark a positively
charged lightning strike— a huge high-energy arc capable of hitting the ground
more than ten miles from the storm itself, often under clear skies and bright
sunshine.
Vast energies are required to deliver these bolts from the
blue. Research suggests that positive lightning can generate currents and
potentials ten times greater than negative strikes: up to 300,000 amps and 1
billion volts, or approximately 300,000.21 gigawatts of power in a single
discharge.
But what happened to the glider and the two men inside?

Gay penguin couple gets an egg of their
own
with one comment
Every spring for six years Gentoo penguins Inca and
Rayas have lovingly built a nest together, only to find that no eggs arrive to
fill it. It doesn’t seem to have dawned on the couple that both of them are
male.
But after the repeated heartbreak of watching other
penguins become parents and raise their young, the “gay” couple finally have
something to celebrate after their keepers gave them an egg of their own to care
for.
Rather than questioning how the improbable scenario
arose, the inseparable pair has seized their one chance at fatherhood with the
zeal of a couple who know they may not get another.
Inca has taken on the “female” role of incubating
the donated egg, obtained by keepers a month ago, and stoically remains atop his
prize for most of the day, refusing the temptation to dip his feathers into the
water.
His partner Rayas, meanwhile, keeps a watchful
guard over the nest while eating whatever he can fit in his beak in preparation
for the traditional male job of feeding his young with regurgitated
fish…
Yolanda Martin, who cares for the pair, said:
“ We wanted them to have something to stay
together for
– so we got an egg. Otherwise
they might have become depressed.”
Ms Martin said it was “lovely” to be able to cheer
people up but emphasised that the penguins are not actually gay – they are just
the best of friends.
You know, it really doesn’t matter what
defines the characteristics of the bond between the two penguins. Just like life
among humans, getting along with each other is more important than satisfying
boundaries defined by someone else.
Yes, life and death issues are different; but, I’m
not talking about the end of the world.
Thanks, Ed ~ this was the feel-good story of the
week!

RANDOM
TIDBITS The
diamond mining industry in South Africa began in 1866, when Stephanus Erasmus
Jacobs found an unusual pebble on the south bank of the Orange River. He gave it
to a friend, who gave it to a friend, and so on, until it finally ended up in
the hands of a professional, who determined that the "pebble" was a 21 1/4-carat
diamond. Princess
Margaret of England once commented on Elizabeth Taylor's 39-carat Krupp diamond,
calling it the most vulgar thing she'd ever seen. When Liz let the Princess try
the ring on, she noticed Margaret admiring it in the light and said, "See? It's
not so vulgar now, is it?" In
1947, DeBeers hired the N.W. Ayer advertising agency to come up with a campaign
that would encourage Americans to buy more expensive diamonds and hang on to
them, instead of pawning or reselling them. The result was the "A diamond is
forever" slogan. Hawaii's
Diamond Head got its name in the late 1700s when western traders found what they
thought were diamonds on the crater. The stones they'd found, however, turned
out to be calcite crystals, not valuable gemstones. A
chemically pure diamond has no color and is clear. Impure diamonds tend to hvae
a yellowish or brownish hue. So-called natural "fancy color" diamonds occur when
trace elements in the stone are irradiated during the gem's creation. Only
about 20 percent of the world's diamond supply is used for jewelry. Diamonds are
used in industry for cutting, grinding, and polishing everything from eyeglasses
to the drums in copying machines to automobile pistons. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There
is always that one lonely, awkward kid in high school who the teacher befriends,
and then sometimes the student develops a crush on the teacher. Usually it ends
there, unless you are one of those crazy types who think they can have a sexual
affair with a fifteen or sixteen-year-old and keep it a secret.
And
then there is this story, where the teacher, or track coach in this case,
befriended the lonely, awkward kid and then went to prom with him.
The
coach is Melissa Bowerman, 41, who had been coaching the Condon/Wheeler track
and field team in Oregon.
Bowerman
said attending the Condon High School prom with a boy from the track team was an
error in judgment, but she said the pair did not have an inappropriate
relationship. She said they danced to a few slow songs but mostly played ping
pong and foosball. The
coach -- or former coach, rather -- who has a son on the track team, said she
went to the prom because the boy felt bad that he lacked a date and had been
struggling in English class.
"If
they go on (academic) probation and suspension, then they can't go to the track
meets," Bowerman said. "I said, 'OK, I will go with you, but we've got to talk
about English first. You're going to do better in English."
So
apparently the prom date was a success. It was only afterward that a problem
arose.
"There
was an investigation done and through that there were some potential details
that arose," Condon superintendent Jan Zarate said. "We started an investigation
that led to us asking her to un-volunteer."
Perhaps
there was more ball play involved than on the foosball table. Either way I guess
it's better than going to prom with your mom.

Harry Potter fans get rid of unwanted owls
--* ULGHAM, England - British bird sanctuaries said they are filling up
with owls as Harry Potter-inspired pet owners get tired of the birds. Pam
Toothill, of the Owlcenter in Corwen, Wales, said she had only six of the birds
prior to the release of the first Harry Potter film, but the number has since
grown to 100 owls. "People saw Harry's owl in the movies and thought how cute
and cuddly they looked. Now they are bored and fed-up with all the work involved
looking after an owl," Toothill said. Kim Olson, owner of the Sanctuary Wildlife
Care Center in Ulgham, England, said many people have been illegally releasing
their pet owls into the wild. "When people saw Harry Potter loads of them wanted
an owl. They've kept them in their shed or garage for a bit and now they've got
bored and they hand them in to us," she said. "It's illegal to release an owl
into the wild because they would take over from the native wild owls, but
obviously a lot of people have ignored that law."
Harry Potter author JK Rowling has asked her fans to do the proper
research before deciding to obtain an owl as a pet. "If anybody has been
influenced by my books to think an owl would be happiest shut in a small cage
and kept in a house, I would like to take this opportunity to say as forcefully
as I can, 'You are wrong,'" she said.

School keeps prom separate from porn expo
--* MIAMI
- Administrators at a Florida school said police were on hand to make sure their
prom did not intermingle with a porn convention going on at the same venue. Gwen
Zaldivar, the activities director for Miami Beach Senior High School, said extra
security steps were taken when administrators discovered the prom held during
the weekend would be sharing the Miami Beach Convention Center with the
Exxxotica Expo pornography convention, WFOR-TV, Miami, reported Monday. "We ...
hired police officers," Zaldivar said. "We [worked] with the Miami Beach
Convention Center to make sure they have their security in place as well."
Zaldivar said police, security workers and teachers stood guard at the venue to
ensure the two events did not intermingle. School officials said their choices
of prom venues were limited. "We do not hold our proms in venues such as hotels
for the safety of our children and to discourage drinking," Zaldivar said.
"Therefore this was the only available location and it's easy to control the
students are safe."

Twilight may be entertainment to most of us, but for some

In Denmark, where religion is not a large part of daily
life, teens seem to use media — often, American media — to explore questions of
good and evil, life after death and destiny, Line Nybro Petersen of the
University of Copenhagen's film and media studies department has found. The
communal experiences of hardcore fans of the series can even echo religious
communities.
"Being a 'Twilight' fan allows the teenagers to engage
in very intense emotional experiences," Petersen told LiveScience. "You can
almost get the sense that these are transcendental emotions, the feeling that
you are part of something bigger than yourself in a semireligious way."

Here’s more on this fascinating kit:
How Does it Work? Alligator Clip
two objects to the MaKey MaKey board. For example, you and an apple. When you
touch the apple, you make a connection, and MaKey MaKey sends the computer a
keyboard message. The computer just thinks MaKey MaKey is a regular keyboard (or
mouse). Therefore it works with all programs and webpages, because all programs
and webpages take keyboard and mouse input.

spray it with water, or apply copper tape).
It’s a fun way to learn about how keyboards and game

Trivia Tidbit:
185 Uses For A
Pig:
It turns out that there’s a lot more to a pig than just meat. The
reality is that almost every part of a livestock animal is put to commercial
use—from the hair and the hide to the internal organs and the bones. Don’t be
grossed out: This kind of recycling has been going on for as long as humans have
been domesticating animals. Only now it’s a little more industrialized.
Shampoo:
You know how some shampoos have a very shiny,
pearly look? That’s often the result of adding fatty acids from pig bones. It’s
also used for this purpose in paint products.

Bowser Beer - A Beer For Dogs
Bowser Beer is
for dogs... seriously!
Bowser Beer
isn't technically beer in the human sense. It
contains no alcohol, no carbonation, and no hops (which can be poisonous to
dogs). Instead the brewer, 3 Busy Dogs Inc. use all natural dog-friendly
ingredients including USDA beef or chicken, Glucosamine, and Malt to create a
canine friendly form of beer. Of course the exact recipe is a secret. Three
different flavors are available: Chicken, Beef, or a Chicken/Beef
Combo.

The Codex Mendoza
The Codex Mendoza is an Aztec codex, created about twenty years
after the Spanish conquest of Mexico with the intent that it be seen by Charles
V, the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. It contains a history of the Aztec
rulers and their conquests, a list of the tribute paid by the conquered, and a
description of daily Aztec life, in traditional Aztec pictograms with Spanish
explanations and commentary. The
Codex Mendoza
is named after Antonio de Mendoza, then the
viceroy of New Spain, who may have commissioned it.

A Self-Portrait of Opportunity
I want you to stop and think about something.
This is a picture of another planet. Where this robot is. Right
now.
As we sit here on Earth in this or any moment, we
each have in our heads a flurry of worries and questions and ideas. And most of
them pertain to our own lives. That’s okay, it’s human nature. We are each the
center of our own universe.
I often think about this in crowded places, like
while in traffic, as the place I’m going is far more important than the place
all of these other people are going. I’m convinced that they feel the same way.
And so we sit.
But that means that there are seven billion
mental universes walking around on this planet. We are staring into them through
little digital windows that we carry in our hands, and certain that this
decision is the most important decision. Everything that is happening is
happening to us.
Yet for the past eight years, there has been a
dusty, six-wheeled rover crawling around the surface of Mars, completely alone.
Incidentally, that rover has exceeded its expected mission of 90 days by
thirty-two times over. That’s admirable, and I can’t help but personify the
little guy. Like a sort of scrappy, diligent explorer, quietly working hard for
the benefit of someone else.
“No complaints, boss!”
Like Johnny 5 meets
Wall-E.
And so we get images like this, reminding us that
every day we can look beyond our personal universe. What a thought! Look at how
much is out there. Think of what else we could see!
Let’s
go.

Whales have a sensory organ
unlike anything we’ve ever seen
It's possible that
whales can sense things that no other living creatures can. Scientists have
discovered a grapefruit-sized mass of vessels and nervous tissues located in
whales' chins, and they believe it's an entirely new kind of sensory organ. It's
possible the organ is what allows these massive creatures to eat using a
lightning-fast mouth movement called "lunge feeding."
To find out more, we spoke with the study's lead
researcher, paleobiologist Nick Pyenson. He says this sensory organ is just one
more thing that makes whales like "mammals from space."

Builds World’s Largest Tetrahedron
Author Shelley Pearsall visited Copley Middle School
in Ohio earlier this month. One of her books, All Shook Up, is about a high
school that built the world’s largest tetrahedron -over 8 feet
tall!
To prepare for her visit, the fifth- and sixth-grade
students built a “Rainbow Tetrahedron,” which is a giant three-dimensional
pyramid made of thousands of smaller folded paper pyramids.
“There are 21,000 individual pyramids in the
structure,” said librarian Bonnie Hershey. “The students folded and glued them
and then we had parents come in to help build it up.”
The resulting structure is
16 feet tall ,
which Pearsall said was the largest tetrahedron she’s seen in all the schools
she has visited.

Ask Smithsonian
Q: Jazz from the 1920s sounds nothing like jazz today. Why
do we use "jazz" for such different music? — Patrick Leonard,
Charlottesville, Virginia A: In the past 90 years, jazz has changed
tremendously, resulting in a myriad of styles: New Orleans, swing, bebop, cool,
hard bop, modal, fusion, Latin jazz and others. The many disparate styles of
jazz are linked by melodies with bent or "blue" notes, call-and-response
patterns, off-beat and syncopated rhythms, and, finally, improvisation—each time
a jazz band plays a piece, it sounds fresh. — John Edward Hasse, Curator of
American Music at the National Museum of American History

We risk great peril if we kill off this spirit of adventure, for we
cannot predict how and in what seemingly unrelated fields it will manifest

effective ways to retain that thrust is to keep exploring possibilities. The
sense of exploration is intimately bound up with human resolve, and for a nation
to believe that it is still committed to a forward motion is to ensure its
continuance. – James A. Michener, author, 1979

Passing
Through
November 1896 saw the start of a strange
wave of airship sightings across the United States — the San Francisco
Call
published the image above on Nov. 19, claiming that the craft had
passed over eastern Sacramento the previous night, where hundreds had seen “its
brilliant searchlight traveling over the city, and who will also swear that they
heard the voices of its occupants and distinguished their merry song and
laughter.”
In the frenzy that followed, the
San
Francisco Chronicle
published an interview with attorney George D. Collins,
who claimed that he represented the airship’s inventor, a wealthy Maine man who
had spent 17 years and $100,000 perfecting the craft. “The reports from
Sacramento the other night were quite true. It was my client’s ship that
inhabitants saw. It started from Oroville, in Butte County, and flew in a
straight line for sixty miles directly over Sacramento. After running up and
down once or twice over the capital, my friend came on a distance of another
seventy miles and landed on a spot on the Oakland side of the bay, where the
ship now lies guarded by six men. In another six days several defects will be
done away with and it is then his intention to fly right over San
Francisco.”
That never happened, and Collins was quickly
forgotten, but it’s interesting to note that 10 years earlier, in 1886, inventor
Moses Cole had patented a strikingly similar “new and improved aerial vessel”.
“It consists of two semi-spheroidal balloons,”
Scientific American
had
reported, “between which are situated the cabins for the passengers and crew,
these being fitted with windows and surrounded by a circular balcony.” Possibly
the
Call’ s artist had used Cole’s patent for inspiration. Or possibly
Collins was telling the truth. Or possibly Martians had adopted Cole’s design as
a disguise. We’ll never know.

Why Men Prefer to Eat Red
Meat
I'd say because it's more delicious, but that's not
what Brian Wansink of Cornell University Food and Brand Lab found out: it's
because meat is macho.
"To the strong, traditional, macho,
bicep-flexing, all-American male, red meat is a strong, traditional, macho,
bicep-flexing, all-American food," write the researchers.
[...]
If meat represents masculinity, it would seem
men would be more likely than women to prefer meat to other foods — a means of
reinforcing gender. To test this idea, the researchers analyzed data of more
than 2,000 university students who indicated how much they liked or disliked
various foods. Male students were significantly more likely than female students
to like beef, meat and orange juice; and the women were significantly more
likely than guys to like salad and vegetables.
This "masculine meat" phenomenon seems to hold
in other countries as well. In one study of 23 languages with gendered pronouns,
the researchers found "that the vast majority of these gendered words and these
languages associate meat with the masculine pronoun," Wansink told LiveScience.

Pro Tips
“Dancing is a sweat job. … When you’re experimenting
you have to try so many things before you choose what you want, that you may go
days getting nothing but exhaustion. This search for what you want is like
tracking something that doesn’t want to be tracked. It takes time to get a dance
right, to create something memorable. There must be a certain amount of polish
to it. I don’t want it to look anything but accomplished, and if I can’t make it
look that way, then I’m not ready yet. I always try to get to know my routine so
well that I don’t have to think, ‘What comes next?’ Everything should fall right
into line, and then I know I’ve got control of the bloody floor.” — Fred
Astaire
“How to hit home runs: I swing as hard as I can, and
I try to swing right through the ball. In boxing, your fist usually stops when
you hit a man, but it’s possible to hit so hard that your fist doesn’t stop. I
try to follow through in the same way. The harder you grip the bat, the more you
can swing it through the ball, and the farther the ball will go. I swing big,
with everything I’ve got. I hit big or I miss big. I like to live as big as I
can.” — Babe Ruth
“Don’t get discouraged because there’s a lot of
mechanical work to writing. … I rewrote the first part of
A Farewell to
Arms
at least fifty times. … The first draft of anything is shit. When you
first start to write you get all the kick and the reader gets none, but after
you learn to work it’s your object to convey everything to the reader so that he
remembers it not as a story he has read but something that has happened to
himself. That’s the true test of writing.” — Ernest Hemingway

Escaped Penguin Spotted in Tokyo
Bay
Remember
No. 337 , the intrepid penguin that escaped from the Tokyo Sea Life Park a couple
of months ago? It has been spotted in Tokyo Bay looking none the worse for
wear:
A Sea Life Park official identified it
as the escapee, recognising a distinctive ring round a flipper.
"It
looks like it's been living quite happily," Kazuhiro Sakamoto said.
"It
didn't look like it has got thinner over the last two months - or been without
food," he added.

Can You Tell Me How To Get To
Diablo III’s Secret Level?
http://youtu.be/7ACv1HQM2AQ
There’s a secret level in Blizzard’s newest

Diablo III
that seems mighty out of place when compared to
the rest of the game. It’s called Whimsyshire, and it’s full of teddy bears,
unicorns, rainbows and a
color palette straight out of
My Little

those undead hordes and stagnant caves, even if the killing doesn’t stop at the

In order to combat food wastage, an

all-you-have-to-eat restaurant:
A Chinese restaurant offering an
all-you-can-eat buffet is charging customers £20 in 'wastage' if they leave food
on their plates.
Managers at the Kylin Buffet in Ocean Road, South
Shields, have put up a notice urging diners to eat up all their food - or face
the penalty charge.
The policy has outraged one mother who was told she
had to pay the £20 after her and her son Sam, 10, and niece Toni, six, left two
onion rings, a piece of prawn toast, and a spring roll on their
plates.

The Dhole: Asia's Unique
Species Of Endangered Wild Dog
The Dhole is also called the Asiatic Wild Dog
or Cuon alpinus. It is not closely related to any other canine, so it is a
species apart from dogs, wolves, foxes or dingoes. This native of Southern Asia
is an endangered species. A Dhole is roughly as large as a border
collie. A pack of Dholes may number about ten, although sometimes four
times that number have been reported in one group. A pack generally has only one
breeding female; males usually outnumber females. Many of us whistle to summon
our dogs. The
Dhole
whistles too to summon other members of the pack, if
they become separated while hunting.

Newgrange Megalithic Passage
Tomb
image credit The
Megalithic Passage Tomb at Newgrange - located in County Meath, on the eastern
side of Ireland - was built around 3200 BC. The kidney shaped mound covers an
area of over one acre and is surrounded by 97 kerbstones, some of which are
richly decorated with megalithic art. It is estimated that the construction of
the Passage Tomb at Newgrange would have taken a work force of 300 at least 20
years. The passage and chamber of
Newgrange
are illuminated by the winter solstice
sunrise. A shaft of sunlight shines through the roof box over the entrance and
penetrates the passage to light up the chamber. The dramatic event lasts for 17
minutes at dawn on the Winter Solstice and for a few mornings either side of the
Winter Solstice.

A pheasant was standing in a field chatting to a
bull. "I would love to be able to get to the top of yonder tree", sighed
the pheasant, "but I haven"t got the energy". Well, why don"t you nibble
on some of my droppings?" replied the bull. "They"re packed with
nutrients". The pheasant pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually
gave him enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. The next day,
after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch and so on. Finally,
after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree,
whereupon he was spotted by a farmer who dashed into the farmhouse, emerged with
a shotgun, and shot the pheasant right out of the tree.

top, but it won"t keep you there. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A big Texan is walking down the main street

This prompts the Texan to attempt to realise
a lifelong dream and he says to Liam, “Say Boy, that’s a fine-lookin horse you
got there, and I’d like to tour this beautiful country on horseback so’s I can
see the sights and hear the sounds of the countryside like they did in the old
days. I’ll buy that horse off of ya, how much ya want.”
Liam says, “O sure and you don’t want to be
messin with this horse he don’t look too good these days.”
“Hey, Boy,” says the Texan, “Don’t you try
to tell me what’s a good lookin’ horse an what isn’t. I been tradin’ horses all
my life long and there ain’t nothin a young country boy like you can tell me
about em. Now you jes name yer price and we’ll get along fine.”
“I’m sayin’ to ye that this horse is not a
good lookin horse mister and ye don’t want any part of ‘im,” says
Liam.
The Texan is getting angry now. “Listen up
Boy, he says, you leave me be the judge of what’s good lookin and what’s not and
jes give me the price and I’ll pay cash right here and now.”
“Oh well,” says Liam, “Two-thousand of your
American dollars then.”
“Deal!” says the Texan and he hands over the
money, Liam unties the horse and the Texan leads him off.
The horse walks smack into the first lampost
in the way, and the Texan turns to Liam and says, “Hey, Boy, you a durned
swindler, you didn’ tell me this here horse was blind!”
“I keep tellin’ you he don’t look too good,”
says Liam, “and you kept saying that’s none of my business, so in the end I gave
up.”

Dear Einstein, Do Scientists
Pray?
In 1936, sixth grader Phyllis wrote a letter to Albert
Einstein on behalf of her Sunday school class. She asked the famous scientists
whether scientists pray:
The Riverside Church January 19,
1936
My dear Dr. Einstein,
We have
brought up the question: Do scientists pray? in our Sunday school class. It
began by asking whether we could believe in both science and religion. We are
writing to scientists and other important men, to try and have our own question
answered.
We will feel greatly honored if you will answer our question: Do
scientists pray, and what do they pray for? We are in the sixth grade, Miss
Ellis's class. Respectfully yours,
Phyllis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~``
January 24, 1936 Dear Phyllis,
I
will attempt to reply to your question as simply as I can. Here is my
answer: Scientists believe that every occurrence, including the affairs of
human beings, is due to the laws of nature. Therefore a scientist cannot be
inclined to believe that the course of events can be influenced by prayer, that
is, by a supernaturally manifested wish. However, we must concede that our
actual knowledge of these forces is imperfect, so that in the end the belief in
the existence of a final, ultimate spirit rests on a kind of faith. Such belief
remains widespread even with the current achievements in science.
But also,
everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced
that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe, one that is vastly
superior to that of man. In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious
feeling of a special sort, which is surely quite different from the religiosity
of someone more naive.
With cordial greetings,
your A.
Einstein

Deserted
Island
A man and his wife had been stranded on a deserted
island for many years. The morning following a bad storm, a new guy washes up on
the shore.
The new guy and the wife are VERY attracted to each
other right away, but they realize that certain protocols will have to be
observed. The husband, oblivious to the new chemistry floating around, is very
glad to see the second man there.
“This is wonderful! Now we’ll be able to have three
people doing 8-hour shifts in the watchtower instead of two people doing 12-hour
shifts.”
The new man is only too happy to help, and in fact
volunteers to do the first shift. He climbs up the tall tower and stands watch,
scanning the ocean horizon for any ships. Soon the husband and wife start
placing stones in a circle in order to make a fire to cook supper. The new man
yells down: “Hey, no screwing!”
They look at each other and yell back: “We’re not
screwing!”
A few minutes later, they start to put driftwood into
the stone circle. Again the new man yells down: “Heeey, no
screwing!”
Again they yell back, “We’re not
screwing!”
Later they are putting palm leaves on the roof of the
shack to patch leaks. Once again the new man yells down from high
above: “Hey, I said no screwing!!”
They yell back, “And we said we’re not
screwing!!”
Finally the shift is over and the new man climbs down
from the tower and the husband starts to climb up. By the time he gets half-way
up, his wife and the new man are already screwing their brains out. Once at the
top, the husband turns around and looks down and says to
himself: “Son-of-a-gun. From up here it DOES look like they’re
screwing.

Three men: a philosopher, a
mathematician and an idiot,were out riding in the car when it crashed into a
tree. Before anyone knows it, the three men found themselves standing before the
pearly gates of Heaven, where St Peter and the Devil were standing
nearby. "Gentlemen," the Devil started, "Due to the fact that Heaven is
now overcrowded, therefore St Peter has agreed to limit the number of people
entering Heaven. If anyone of you can ask me a question which I don't know or
cannot answer, then you're worthy enough to go to Heaven; if not, then you'll
come with me to Hell." The philosopher then stepped up, "OK, give me the
most comprehensive report on Socrates' teachings," With a snap of his finger,
a stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The philosopher read it and
concluded it was correct. "Then, go to Hell!" With another snap of his finger,
the philsopher disappeared. The mathematician then asked, "Give me the
most complicated formula you can ever think of!" With a snap of his
finger, another stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The mathematician
read it and reluctantly agreed it was correct. "Then, go to Hell!" With another
snap of his finger, the mathematician disappeared, too. The idiot then
stepped forward and said, "Bring me a chair!" The Devil brought forward a chair.
"Drill 7 holes on the seat." The Devil did just that. The idiot then sat on
the chair and let out a very loud fart. Standing up, he asked, "Which hole
did my fart come out from?" The Devil inspected the seat and said, "The
third hole from the right." "Wrong," said the idiot, "it's from my
asshole." And the idiot went to
Heaven. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
