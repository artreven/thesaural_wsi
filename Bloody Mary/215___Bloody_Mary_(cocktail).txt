About Vodka
Octal Process, in short means it need only go through filtering and purification 3 times, to achieve the clear smooth taste, with less loss of proof! However the oxen injection process removes more impurities than most competitors standard industry technique of 5-6 excessive filtering's and   leave our competitors products flat and harsh.
Gera Vodka
has the smoothest flavor
of any Vodka we've tested to date!
Try if for yourself and make your own comparison.
Vodka   Polish :  wódka , ( Russian :  водка ,  Czech :  vodka ,  Slovak :  vodka ) is a  distilled beverage  and one of the world's most popular liquors. It is composed primarily of water and  ethanol  with traces of impurities and flavorings. Vodka is made from  fermented  substances like  grain  and potatoes . For a liquor to be denominated  vodka , governments often establish a minimum alcohol content. Vodka's alcoholic content usually ranges between 35–70% by volume. The standard  Polish ,  Russian  and  Lithuanian  vodkas are 40% alcohol by volume (80  proof ). The  European Union   has established a minimum of 37.5% alcohol by volume content for any  European vodka  to be named as such.   Vodka may be distilled from any  starch / sugar -rich plant matter; most vodka today is produced from  grains  such as  sorghum ,  corn ,  rye  or  wheat . Among grain vodkas, rye and wheat vodkas are generally considered superior. Some vodkas are made from  potatoes ,  molasses ,  soybeans ,  grapes ,  rice ,  sugar beets  and sometimes even byproducts of oil refining or wood pulp processing. In some Central European countries like Poland some vodka is produced by just fermenting a solution of crystal sugar and yeast. In the  European Union  there are talks about the standardization of vodka, and the  Vodka Belt  countries insist that only spirits produced from grains,  potato  and  sugar beet   molasses  be allowed to be branded as "vodka", following the traditional methods of production Vodka is traditionally drunk  straight up  in the  vodka belt  countries of  Eastern Europe  and around the  Baltic Sea . It is also commonly used in cocktails  and mixed drinks, such as the  Bloody Mary , the  Screwdriver , the  Sex on the Beach , the  White Russian , the  vodka tonic , and the  vodka martini .

Gera Vodka Coming to Houston Texas
Disclamer: Texas Law
J.A.E. Support s
"The Century Council"
STATE LAW Texas state law does not require that a person over 21 provide any identification to purchase alcohol in Texas. There is nothing in the law that declares specific forms of ID as “valid” for an alcohol purchase. However, a person who sells a minor an alcoholic beverage does NOT commit an offense if the minor falsely represents himself to be 21 years old or older by displaying an apparently valid proof of identification that: contains a physical description and photograph consistent with the minor's appearance; purports to establish that the minor is 21 years of age or older; and was issued by a governmental agency. The proof of identification may include a driver's license issued by any state, a U.S. passport, a military identification card or any other ID issued by a state or the federal government. For that reason, since store clerks, wait staff, and bartenders can be held criminally liable for selling alcohol to a minor, they often require a photo ID issued by a governmental agency, to prove that the person really is 21. A store, bar or restaurant
might or might not
sell alcohol to a person with an expired driver's license, a foreign passport or other ID. What's acceptable in any establishment is a matter of that establishment's private business policies. If the patron is obviously over 21, the establishment may not require any ID at all. WHAT ABOUT CIGARETTES? Unlike alcohol, state and federal law says that anyone under 27 must show identification before purchasing cigarettes. Also different from alcohol, state law provides a statutory defense to the charge of selling cigarettes to someone under 18 when the buyer presented to the defendant apparently valid proof of identification issued by a governmental agency (including a military ID, passport, or out-of-state driver's license).
TABC does not regulate the sale of cigarettes, and any further questions regarding tobacco should be directed to the Office of the State Comptroller.
