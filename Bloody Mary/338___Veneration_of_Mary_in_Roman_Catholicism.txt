The Critics Of Catholic Church ,Please Have a Look Into These..
History
Christianity in India
Main article:
Saint Thomas Christians
Christianity in India is reputed to have been introduced by
Thomas the Apostle
in 52 AD. [ 5 ]
These
Saint Thomas Christians
were known as Nasrani Christians which means believers in Jesus the Nazarete.
[ 6 ]
This community were governed by the Orthodox Bishops from
Persia
and
Babylonia . [ 7 ]
Early missionaries
John of Monte Corvino , was a Franciscan sent to China to become prelate of Peking in around 1307. He traveled from Persia and moved down by sea to India, in 1291, to the
Madras
region or “Country of St. Thomas” .There he preached for thirteen months and baptized about one hundred persons. From there Monte Corvino wrote home, in December 1291 (or 1292).That is one of the earliest noteworthy account of the Coromandel coast furnished by any Western European. Traveling by sea from Mailapur, he reached China in 1294, appearing in the capital “Cambaliech” (now Beijing) [ 8 ]
Friar
Odoric of Pordenone
arrived in India in 1321. He visited Malabar, touching at Pandarani (20 m. north of Calicut), at Cranganore, and at Kulam or Quilon, proceeding thence, apparently, to Ceylon and to the shrine of St Thomas at Maylapur near Madras. He writes he had found the place where Thomas was buried.
Father
Jordanus
Catalani, a French Dominican missionary, followed in 1321-22. He reported to Rome, apparently from somewhere on the west coast of India, that he had given Christian burial to four martyred monks. Jordanus is known for his 1329 “Mirabilia” describing the marvels of the East: he furnished the best account of Indian regions and the Christians , the products, climate, manners, customs, fauna and flori given by any European in the Middle Ages - superior even to Marco Polo’s.
In 1347,
Giovanni de Marignolli
visited the shrine of St Thomas near the modern Madras, and then proceeded to what he calls the kingdom of Saba, and identifies with the Sheba of Scripture, but which seems from various particulars to have been Java. Taking ship again for Malabar on his way to Europe, he encountered great storms.
Another prominent Indian traveler was Joseph, priest over Cranganore. He journeyed to Babylon in 1490 and then sailed to Europe and visited Portugal, Rome, and Venice before returning to India. He helped to write a book about his travels titled The Travels of Joseph the Indian which was widely disseminated across Europe Arrival of the Portuguese
Introduction of Catholicism in India started with the arrival of
Vasco da Gama , [ 1 ]
who was seeking pre-existing Christian nations with which to form anti- Islamic
alliances. The lucrative spice trade was further temptation for the Portuguese crown. [ 9 ]
With the
papal bull
Romanus Pontifex
the patronage of the mission was granted to the
Portuguese
and they were remunerated with a trade monopoly. [ 10 ]
After four decades of prosperous trading they started the proselytization around 1540. Missionaries of the newly founded
Society of Jesus
were sent to Goa and the Portuguese colonial government supported the mission with incentives for baptized Christians. They offered rice donations for the poor, good positions in the Portuguese colonies for the middle class and military support for local rulers and hence these Christians were dubbed
Rice Christians
who even practiced their old religion. At the same time many
New Christians
from Portugal migrated to India as a result of the
inquisition in Portugal . Many of them were suspected
Crypto-Jews , because they were forcibly converted to Catholicism. Both was considered a threat to the immaculateness of the Christian belief. [ 11 ]
Saint
Francis Xavier , in a 1545 letter to
John III of Portugal , requested an
inquisition
to be installed in Goa [ 11 ]
which would spell the end of Portuguese domination in the Christian dominance. [ 12 ]
Latinisation
of St Thomas Christians started in the early 16th century. [ 13 ]
The
Synod of Diamper
was convened by the Portuguese between 20 and 26 June 1599, which with force and torture led most
Saint Thomas Christians
to acknowledge the authority of the
Pope
in
Rome . [ 13 ]
Some of the Christians in the
Coramandel coast
accepted the Catholic faith, but most of St Thomas Christians of the
Malabar
still stayed with the
Assyrian Church
or stayed independent. [ 7 ]
Later conversions
Other than the St Thomas Christians, people of other faiths were
converted
zealously by the Portuguese. This started with
Goa , then spread to fishery coast of
Cape Comorin , inland districts of
Madurai
and the western coast of Bassein, Salcette,
Bombay , Karanja, and Chaul. [ 7 ]
With the advent of suppression of
Jesuits
in 1773 the missionary expansion declined in India [ 14 ]
along with the need for organisations within the Church in India. [ 7 ]
Especially when the
Vicar Apostolate of Bombay
was erected in 1637 [ 15 ]
which was under the direct ruling from Rome, caused misunderstanding between the Portuguese missionary and the Apostolate. [ 7 ]
The
inquisition of Goa
had caused strained relationship and mistrust with the
Hindus
of India [ 12 ]
The strained relations between the Church and the Portuguese missionaries reached a climax when in 1838 the Holy See cancelled the jurisdiction of the three suffragan Sees of Crangaqnore, Cochin, and Mylapur and transferred it to the nearest vicars Apostolic, and did the same with regard to certain portions of territory which had formerly been under the authority of Goa itself. [ 7 ]
Finally in 1886 another concordat was established, and at the same time the whole country was divided into ecclesiastical provinces, and certain portions of territory, withdrawn in 1838, were restored to the jurisdiction of the Portuguese sees. [ 7 ]
Social works
Varghese Palakkappillil
Mother Teresa
Concern with charity was common to
Catholics
and
Protestants , but with one major difference: whilst the former believe that salvation comes from
faith in God which manifests itself in good works
such as charity, the latter could not rely on such a possibility, since they believe that
only one's faith
is a requisite of salvation, and that one's works are insufficient to gain or lose salvation. [ 16 ]
Consequently, Catholic charitable efforts in India have been extensive.
In Portuguese India, for instance, Saint
Francis Xavier
and his fellow missionaries were especially careful to help the local charitable institutions by tending to the sick, both spiritually and physically, and performing other works of mercy. [ 16 ]
The Jesuits' educational institutions, although never succeeding in missionary activities, had left a prestigious impact through their education institutions. [ 17 ]
Education has become the major priority for the Church in India in recent years with nearly 60% of the Catholic schools situated in rural areas. [ 18 ]
Even in the early part of the 19th century, Catholic schools had left its emphasis on poor relief and welfare. [ 19 ]
Though Catholics make up less than 2 percent of India's population, the Church provides an estimated 22 percent of all health-care services, operating 5,000 facilities, and employs 33 percent of Indian health-care workers, including 40,000 Catholic nurses. [ 2 ]

The Catholic Church An Over View..
Origin and mission
See also:
History of the Catholic Church ,
History of the Papacy , and
History of Early Christianity
[ edit ]
Origin
Fresco (1481–1482) by
Perugino
in the
Sistine Chapel
showing Jesus giving the
keys of heaven
to
Saint Peter
According to Catholic doctrine, the Catholic Church is the original Church founded by
Jesus Christ . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]
The
New Testament
records his appointing of the
twelve Apostles
and giving them authority to continue his work. [ 39 ]
One of these,
Simon Peter , was made their leader when Jesus proclaimed "upon this rock I will build my church ... I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven ... ". [ 29 ] [ 40 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ]
In the Catholic view, the coming of the
Holy Spirit
upon the apostles in an event known as
Pentecost
signaled the beginning of the public ministry of the Church and all duly consecrated
bishops
since then are considered the
successors to the apostles . [ 40 ] [ 44 ]
The traditional narrative places Peter in Rome, where he founded a church and served as the first bishop of the
See of Rome , later consecrating
Linus
as his successor, thus beginning the
line of Popes . [ 45 ] [ 46 ]
Elements of this traditional narrative agree with the surviving historical evidence which includes the writings of
Saint Paul , several early
Church Fathers
(among them
Pope Clement I ) [ 47 ]
and some archaeological evidence. [ 45 ]
Although in the past some Biblical scholars thought the word 'rock' referred to Jesus or to Peter’s faith, the majority now understand it as referring to the person of Peter. [ 48 ]
Some historians of Christianity assert that the Catholic Church can be traced to Jesus's consecration of Peter, [ 46 ] [ 49 ]
some that Jesus did not found a church in his lifetime but provided a framework of beliefs, [ 50 ]
while others do not make a judgement about whether or not the Church was founded by Jesus but disagree with the traditional view that the papacy originated with Peter. These assert that Rome may not have had a bishop until after the apostolic age and suggest the papal office may have been superimposed by the traditional narrative upon the primitive church [ 51 ] [ 52 ]
although some acknowledge that the papal office had indeed emerged by the mid 150s. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]
[ edit ]
Mission and purpose
The Church believes that its mission is founded upon Jesus' command to his followers to spread the faith across the world: [ 55 ]
"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age." [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ]
Pope Benedict XVI
summarized this mission as a threefold responsibility to proclaim the word of God, celebrate the sacraments, and exercise the ministry of charity. [ 59 ]
As part of its ministry of charity, the Church runs worldwide agencies such as
Caritas Internationalis , whose national subsidiaries include
CAFOD
and
Catholic Relief Services . Other institutions include
Catholic schools ,
Catholic universities ,
Catholic Charities , the
Society of Saint Vincent de Paul ,
Marriage Encounter , hospitals, orphanages, nursing homes, homeless shelters, as well as ministries to the poor, families, the elderly, AIDS victims, and pregnant and abused women. [ 21 ]
[ edit ]
Beliefs
Main article:
Catholic theology
The
Divine Name
of God above an image of Christ crucified and surrounded by the
angelic hosts
in a Catholic church
altarpiece .
The Catholic Church holds that there is one eternal God, who exists as a
mutual indwelling
of three persons:
God the Father ;
God the Son ; and the
Holy Spirit . Catholic beliefs are summarized in the
Nicene Creed [ 60 ]
and detailed in the
Catechism of the Catholic Church . [ 31 ] [ 61 ]
The Nicene Creed also forms the central statement of belief of other Christian denominations. [ 62 ]
Chief among these are
Eastern Orthodox
Christians, whose beliefs are similar to those of Catholics, differing mainly with regard to
papal infallibility , the
filioque clause
and the
Immaculate Conception
of Mary. [ 63 ] [ 64 ]
The various
Protestant denominations
vary in their beliefs, but generally differ from Catholics regarding the Pope, Church tradition, the Eucharist, veneration of saints, and issues pertaining to
grace , good works and
salvation . [ 65 ]
Catholic belief holds that the Church "... is the continuing presence of Jesus on earth." [ 66 ]
To Catholics, the term "Church" refers to the people of God, who abide in Jesus and who, "... nourished with the
Body of Christ , become the Body of Christ." [ 67 ]
Lumen Gentium
(the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church), affirms that the fullness of the "means of salvation" exists only in the Catholic Church but acknowledges that the Holy Spirit can make use of Christian communities separated from itself to bring people to salvation. It teaches that anyone who is saved is saved indirectly through the Church if the person has invincible ignorance of the Catholic Church and its teachings (as a result of parentage or culture, for example), yet follows the morals God has dictated in his heart and would, therefore, join the Church if he understood its necessity. [ 68 ] [ 69 ]
It teaches that Catholics are called by the Holy Spirit to work for unity among all Christians. [ 68 ] [ 69 ]
The
Council of Jerusalem , convened by the
Apostles
around the year 50 to clarify Church teachings, set the precedent for later
councils of the Church , convened by Church leaders throughout history. [ 27 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ]
The most recent Church council was the
Second Vatican Council , which closed in 1965. [ 72 ]
[ edit ]
Teaching authority, seven sacraments
Based on the promises of Jesus in the
Gospels , the Church believes that it is continually guided by the
Holy Spirit
and so protected
infallibly
from falling into doctrinal error. [ 16 ] [ 73 ]
The Catholic Church teaches that the Holy Spirit reveals God's truth through
Sacred Scripture ,
Sacred Tradition
and the
Magisterium . [ 74 ]
Sacred Scripture, or the
Catholic Bible , consists of those books found in the ancient
Greek
version of the
Old Testament —known as the
Septuagint [ 75 ] —and the 27
New Testament
writings first found in the
Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209
and listed in
Athanasius '
Thirty-Ninth Festal Letter . [ 76 ]
These scriptures make up the 73-book Catholic bible in contrast with the shorter, 66-book bible used by most Protestants. [ 75 ]
The books and works that are upheld as
canonical
by the Catholic Church but not by some other groups are known as the
Deuterocanonicals . Sacred Tradition consists of those teachings believed by the Church to have been handed down since the time of the Apostles. [ 73 ]
Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition are collectively known as the "deposit of faith" ( depositum fidei ). These are in turn interpreted by the
Magisterium
(from
magister , Latin for "teacher"), the Church's teaching authority, which—through
apostolic succession —is exercised by the pope and the
college of bishops
in union with the pope. [ 77 ]
According to the
Council of Trent , Jesus instituted
seven sacraments
and entrusted them to the Church. [ 78 ]
These are
Baptism ,
Confirmation , the
Eucharist , Reconciliation ( Penance ),
Anointing of the Sick
(formerly Extreme Unction or the "last rites"),
Holy Orders
and
Holy Matrimony . Sacraments are important visible rituals which Catholics see as signs of God's presence and effective channels of God's
grace
to all those who receive them with the proper disposition ( ex opere operato ). [ 79 ] [ 80 ]
[ edit ]
God the Father, creation, and original sin
See also:
Original sin
The Archangel
Michael —one of three archangels—shown defeating Lucifer, by
Reni
(1636).
The Church teaches that God is the source and creator of all that exists, [ 81 ]
and that he is a loving and caring entity who is directly involved in the world and in people's lives, [ 82 ]
desiring his creatures to love him and to love each other. [ 83 ] [ 84 ]
Catholicism teaches that while human beings live bodily in a visible, material world, their souls simultaneously occupy an invisible, spiritual world, in which spiritual beings called
angels
exist to "worship and serve God". [ 85 ]
Some angels, however, chose to rebel against God, and thereby became
demons
antagonistic both to God and to mankind. [ 86 ]
Among other names, the leader of this rebellion has been called " Lucifer ", " Satan " and the
devil . [ 87 ]
Satan is believed to have tempted the first humans,
Adam and Eve , whose subsequent act of
original sin
brought suffering and death into the world. [ 88 ]
This event, known in Catholic belief as the
Fall of Man , separated humanity from its original intimacy with God. The Catechism states that the description of the fall, in Genesis 3, uses figurative language, but affirms that "... a deed that took place at the beginning of the history of man" that resulted in "a deprivation of original holiness and justice" that makes each person "subject to ignorance, suffering, and the dominion of death: and inclined to sin". Catholic doctrine accepts the possibility that God's creation occurred in a way
consistent with evolution
but rejects as outside the scope of science any efforts to use of the theory to deny supernatural divine creation. [ 89 ]
The soul did not evolve, according to Catholic doctrine, but was infused into man and woman directly by God. [ 88 ]
The Church believes that people can be cleansed of original sin and all personal sins through
Baptism . [ 90 ]
This sacramental act of cleansing admits a person as a full member of the natural and supernatural Church and can only be conferred on a person once. [ 90 ]
[ edit ]
Jesus, sin and Penance
See also:
Jesus ,
sin , and
Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)
A
confessional
used for the
Sacrament of Penance
at
St. Peter's Basilica ,
Vatican City .
Catholics believe that Jesus is the
Messiah
of the Old Testament's
Messianic prophecies . [ 91 ]
The Nicene Creed states that he is "... the only begotten son of God, ... one in being with the Father. Through him all things were made". In an event known as the
Incarnation , the Church teaches that, through the power of the Holy Spirit, God became united with human nature when Jesus was conceived in the womb of a Jewish virgin named
Mary . Jesus is believed, therefore, to be both fully divine and fully human. It is taught that Jesus' mission on earth included giving people his word and his example to follow, as recorded in the four
Gospels . [ 92 ]
Catholicism teaches that following the example of Jesus helps believers to become closer to him, and therefore to grow in true love, freedom, and fullness of life. [ 93 ] [ 94 ]
Falling into sin is considered the opposite to following Jesus, weakening a person's resemblance to God and turning their soul away from his love. [ 95 ]
Sins range from the less serious
venial sins
to more serious
mortal sins
which end a person's relationship with God. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]
The Church teaches that through the
passion
(suffering) of Jesus and his
crucifixion , all people have an opportunity for forgiveness and freedom from sin, and so can be
reconciled to God . [ 91 ] [ 97 ]
The
Resurrection of Jesus , according to Catholic belief, gained for humans a possible spiritual immortality previously denied to us because of original sin. [ 98 ]
John the Baptist
called Jesus "the
Lamb of God
who takes away the sin of the world", [ 99 ]
in reference to the ancient Jewish practice of
sacrificing lambs
to God. [ 100 ] [ 101 ]
By reconciling with God and following Jesus' words and deeds, the Church believes one can enter the
Kingdom of God , which is the "... reign of God over people's hearts and lives." [ 102 ] [ 103 ]
After baptism, the sacrament of Reconciliation ( Penance
or Confession) is the means by which Catholics believe they can obtain forgiveness for subsequent sin and receive God's grace. Catholics believe Jesus gave the apostles authority to forgive sins in God's name. [ 104 ]
After making an
examination of conscience
that often involves a review of the
ten commandments , the sacrament involves confession of sins by an individual to a priest, who then offers advice and imposes a particular penance to be performed. The penitent then prays an
act of contrition
and the priest administers
absolution , formally forgiving the person of his sins. [ 105 ]
The priest is forbidden—under penalty of
excommunication —to reveal any sin or disclosure heard under the
seal of confession . Penance helps prepare Catholics before they can
licitly
receive the sacraments of Confirmation and the Eucharist. [ 106 ] [ 107 ]
[ edit ]
Holy Spirit and Confirmation
Bernini 's alabaster window in
St. Peter's Basilica
depicts the Holy Spirit as a dove, a common motif in Christian art.
Jesus told his apostles that after his death and
resurrection
he would send them the
"Advocate" , the " Holy Spirit ", who "... will teach you all things". [ 108 ] [ 109 ]
Through the sacrament of
Confirmation , Catholics believe they receive the Holy Spirit. Since the Holy Spirit is a Person of the
Trinity , the Church teaches that receiving the Holy Spirit is an act of receiving God. [ 110 ]
Confirmation, sometimes called the "sacrament of Christian maturity", is believed to increase and deepen the grace received at
Baptism , [ 111 ]
as the confirmand is sealed with the seven
gifts of the Holy Spirit , i.e., wisdom (to see and follow God's plan), understanding, counsel (right judgement), fortitude (courage), knowledge, piety (reverence), and fear of the Lord (rejoicing in the presence of God; a spirit of holy fear in God's presence). [ 112 ] [ 113 ]
The corresponding
fruits of the Holy Spirit
are charity (love), joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, generosity, gentleness, faithfulness, modesty, self-control, and chastity. [ 112 ] [ 113 ]
To be properly confirmed, Catholics must be in a state of grace, which means they cannot be conscious of having committed an unconfessed mortal sin. [ 113 ]
They must also have prepared spiritually for the sacrament, chosen a sponsor for spiritual support, and selected a
saint
to be their special patron and intercessor. [ 111 ]
In the Eastern Catholic Churches, baptism, including infant baptism, is immediately followed by Confirmation and the reception of the Eucharist. [ 113 ] [ 114 ]
[ edit ]
Final judgment and afterlife
Belief in an afterlife is part of Catholic doctrine, the "four last things" being death, judgment, heaven, and hell. The Church teaches that immediately after death the
soul
of each person will receive a
particular judgment
from God, based on the deeds of that individual's earthly life. [ 113 ] [ 115 ]
This teaching also attests to another day when Jesus will sit in a universal judgment of all mankind. [ 21 ] [ 116 ]
This
final judgment , according to Church teaching, will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness. [ 113 ] [ 117 ]
The basis upon which each person's soul will be judged is detailed in the Gospel of Matthew which lists
works of mercy
to be performed even to people considered "the least". [ 116 ] [ 117 ]
Emphasis is upon Jesus' words that "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven". [ 117 ]
According to the Catechism, "The Last Judgement will reveal even to its furthest consequences the good each person has done or failed to do during his earthly life." [ 117 ]
A
priest

Anointing of the Sick ).
There are three states of afterlife in Catholic belief.
Heaven
is a time of glorious union with God and a life of unspeakable joy that lasts forever. [ 113 ] [ 115 ]
Purgatory
is a temporary condition for the purification of souls who, although saved, are not free enough from sin to enter directly into heaven. It is a state requiring penance and purgation of sin through God's mercy aided by the prayers of others. [ 113 ] [ 115 ]
Finally, those who chose to live a sinful and selfish life, did not repent, and fully intended to persist in their ways are sent to
hell , an everlasting separation from God. [ 113 ] [ 118 ]
The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God and his love. [ 113 ] [ 115 ]
He
predestines
no one to hell and no one can determine whether anyone else has been condemned. [ 113 ] [ 115 ]
Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death and be saved "like the
good thief
who was crucified next to Jesus". [ 115 ] [ 119 ]
[ edit ]
Social teaching
See also:
Catholic social teaching
In addition to operating numerous social ministries throughout the world, the Church teaches that individual Catholics are required to practice the spiritual and corporal
works of mercy
as well. The seven corporal works of mercy are: feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, sheltering the homeless, clothing the naked, visiting the sick, visiting the imprisoned, and burying the dead. [ 113 ]
Welcoming strangers, immigrants, and refugees could be said to be another corporal work of mercy. The spiritual works of mercy include: instructing, advising, consoling, comforting, forgiving, bearing wrongs patiently, and praying for the living and the dead. [ 21 ] [ 113 ]
In conjunction with the work of mercy to visit the sick, the Church offers the sacrament of
Anointing of the Sick , [ 113 ]
administered only by a priest. [ 120 ]
Church teaching on works of mercy and the new social problems of the industrial era led to the development of
Catholic social teaching , which emphasizes human dignity and commits Catholics to the welfare of others. [ 21 ] [ 113 ]
[ edit ]
Prayer and worship
Catholic liturgy is regulated by
Church authority [ 121 ]
and consists of the Eucharist and Mass, the other sacraments, and the
Liturgy of the Hours . According to the precepts of the Church, every Catholic is required to attend Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation, [ 113 ]
confess sins at least once a year, receive the Eucharist at least once during Easter season, observe the prescribed days of
fasting and of abstinence
as established by the Church, and also help provide for the Church's needs. [ 122 ]
(For the Latin Church, the holy days of obligation are set forth in the
Code of Canon Law , but they vary from nation to nation, as requested by each nation's conference of bishops and approved by the Holy See.) All Catholics are expected to participate in the liturgical life of the Church, but individual or communal prayer and devotions—while encouraged—are a matter of personal preference. [ 123 ]
Frequent reception of the Eucharist (daily, weekly, or at least once a year) and frequent confession of sins (weekly, monthly, or during Advent and Lent, or at least once a year) are common Catholic practices encouraged by the Church.
[ edit ]
Diverse traditions of worship
Differing liturgical traditions, or rites, exist throughout the universal Church, reflecting historical and cultural diversity rather than a difference in beliefs. [ 124 ]
The most commonly used liturgy is the
Roman Rite
(which is used in most of the
Latin Catholic Church , but not in the Eastern Catholic Churches nor in those parts of the Latin Church where other
Latin liturgical rites
are in use). Presently, this rite exists in two authorized forms: the
ordinary form
(the 1969
Mass of Paul VI , celebrated mostly in the vernacular, i.e., the language of the people) and the
extraordinary form
(the 1962 edition of the
Tridentine
or
Latin Mass
standardized by
Pope Pius V
after the
Council of Trent ). [ 125 ] [ 126 ] [ note 3 ]
In 1980, Pope John Paul II issued a Pastoral Provision which allows members of the
Episcopal Church
(the U.S. branch of the worldwide Anglican Communion) to retain many aspects of Anglican liturgical rites as a variation of the Roman rite when they join the Catholic Church. Such "Anglican Use" parishes exist only in the United States. Other Western rites (non-Roman) include the
Ambrosian Rite
and the
Mozarabic Rite .
The
Eastern Catholic Churches
refer to the Eucharistic celebration as the
Divine Liturgy . Each of the Eastern Catholic Churches uses one of the following Eastern rites: the
Byzantine rite ,
Alexandrian
or Coptic rite,
Syriac rite ,
Armenian rite ,
Maronite rite , and
Chaldean rite .
The Latin Catholic Church and the various Eastern Catholic Churches each follow a
liturgical year —an annual calendar—which sets aside certain days and seasons to celebrate key events in the life of Jesus. [ 128 ]
Advent ,
Christmas
and the
Epiphany
celebrate his expected coming, birth and manifestation.
Lent
is the period of purification and penance that ends during
Holy Week
with the
Easter Triduum . These days recall Jesus' last supper with his disciples, death on the cross, burial and resurrection. The feast of the
Ascension of Jesus
is followed by
Pentecost
which recalls the account of the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus' disciples. [ 128 ]
The remainder of the liturgical year apart from these special periods is known as
Ordinary Time .
[ edit ]
Eucharist
See also:
Eucharist (Catholic Church) ,
Catholic liturgy , and
Sacraments of the Catholic Church
The Eucharist is celebrated at each
Mass
and is the center of Catholic worship. [ 129 ] [ 130 ]
The
Words of Institution
for this sacrament are drawn from the
Gospels
and a
Pauline letter . [ 131 ]
In its main elements and prayers, the Catholic Mass celebrated today, according to professor Alan Schreck, is "almost identical" to the form described in the
Didache
and
First Apology of Justin Martyr
in the late 1st and early 2nd centuries. [ 132 ] [ 133 ]
The Church holds that
Jesus Christ
instituted the Eucharist at the
Last Supper . Catholics believe that at each Mass, the bread and wine become supernaturally
transubstantiated
into the true
Body and Blood of Christ .
The Church teaches that Jesus established a
New Covenant
with humanity through the institution of the Eucharist at the
Last Supper . This is held to be in fulfilment of the Old Testament promise of God's salvation for all the peoples of the world—a covenant sealed by Jesus's sacrifice on the cross. [ 134 ]
In contrast to some Protestant belief, therefore, Catholicism teaches that Jesus's sacrifice is made truly present in the celebration of the Eucharist. [ 125 ]
It is Catholic
dogma
that the
bread
and
wine
brought to the altar at each Mass are changed through the power of the Holy Spirit into the true Body and the true Blood of Christ (termed " transubstantiation ") and that, by consuming these, believers are spiritually nourished and deepen their union with Jesus, are cleansed of venial sins, helped to overcome and avoid sin, unite with the poor and promote Christian unity. [ 134 ] [ 135 ]
Mass consists of two parts, the
Liturgy of the Word
and the
Liturgy of the Eucharist . [ 136 ]
Because the Church teaches that Christ is present in the Eucharist, [ 125 ]
there are strict rules about its celebration and reception. The ingredients of the bread and wine used in the Mass are specified and Catholics must abstain from eating for one hour before receiving Communion. [ 137 ]
Those who are conscious of being in a state of
mortal sin
are forbidden from this sacrament unless they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). [ 137 ]
Because the Church recognizes their celebration of the Mass and priestly ordination as valid sacraments,
intercommunion
with the Eastern Orthodox Churches, Assyrian Church of the East, Polish National Catholic Church, and certain other churches—in "suitable circumstances and with Church authority"—is both possible and encouraged. [ 138 ]
The same is not true for Protestant churches. In very limited circumstances, however, Catholic ministers may give the sacraments of Eucharist, Reconciliation (Penance), and Anointing of the Sick to Protestants. [ note 4 ]
Catholics are not permitted to receive communion in Protestant churches because of their different beliefs and practices regarding Holy Orders and the Eucharist. [ 140 ]
[ edit ]
Liturgy of the Hours
See also:
Liturgy of the Hours
In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus instructs his disciples to "pray always". [ 141 ]
The Liturgy of the Hours, [ 142 ]
or Divine Office, is the Church's effort to respond to this request. It is considered to be an extension of the celebration of the Mass and is the official daily liturgical prayer of the Church. [ 143 ]
It makes particular use of the
Psalms
as well as readings from the New and Old Testament, and various prayers. [ 143 ]
It is an adaptation of the ancient Jewish practice of reading the Psalms at certain hours of the day or night. Catholics who pray the Liturgy of the Hours use a set of books issued by the Church that has been called a
breviary . By
canon law , priests and deacons are required to pray the Liturgy of the Hours each day. [ 144 ]
Religious orders often make praying the Liturgy of the Hours a part of their rule of life; the Second Vatican Council encouraged the Christian laity to take up the practice. [ 143 ] [ 145 ]
[ edit ]
Devotional life and prayer
See also:
Catholic spirituality
In addition to the Mass, the Catholic Church considers prayer to be one of the most important elements of Christian life. The Church considers personal prayer a Christian duty, one of the spiritual works of mercy and one of the principal ways its members nourish a relationship with God. [ 146 ]
The
Catechism
identifies three types of prayer: vocal prayer (sung or spoken), meditation, and contemplative prayer. Quoting from the early
church father
John Chrysostom
regarding vocal prayer, the
Catechism
states, "Whether or not our prayer is heard depends not on the number of words, but on the fervor of our souls." [ 147 ]
Meditation is prayer in which the "mind seeks to understand the why and how of Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to what the Lord is asking." [ 147 ]
Contemplative prayer is being with God, taking time to be close to and alone with him. [ 147 ]
Three of the most common devotional prayers of the Catholic Church are
The Lord's Prayer , the
Rosary
and
Stations of the Cross . [ 148 ]
These prayers are most often vocal, yet always meditative and contemplative.
Adoration
of the
Blessed Sacrament
is a common form of contemplative prayer, whereas
Benediction
is a common vocal method of prayer.
Lectio divina , which means "sacred reading", is a form of meditative prayer. The Church encourages patterns of prayer intended to develop into habitual prayer. This includes such daily prayers as grace at meals, the Rosary, or the
Liturgy of the Hours , as well as the weekly rhythm of Sunday Eucharist and the observance of the year-long liturgical cycle. [ 147 ]
[ edit ]
Mary and the saints
See also:
Marian doctrines of the Catholic Church
Virgin Mary , mother of Jesus
Prayers to,
devotions to , and
veneration
of the
Virgin Mary
and the
saints
are a common part of Catholic life but are distinct from the
worship
of God. [ 149 ]
Catholic teaching maintains that the Church exists simultaneously on earth ( Church militant ), in
purgatory
(Church suffering), and in heaven (Church triumphant); thus
Mary
and all other saints are alive and part of the living Church. [ 150 ]
This unity of the Church in heaven, in purgatory, and on earth is the " Communion of Saints ". [ 150 ] [ 151 ]
Explaining the
intercession of saints , the
Catechism
states that the saints "... do not cease to intercede with the Father for us ... so by their fraternal concern is our weakness greatly helped." [ 149 ] [ 151 ]
The Church holds Mary, as
ever Virgin
and
Mother of God , in special regard. She is believed to have been
conceived without original sin , and to have been
assumed into heaven . These teachings, the focus of
Roman Catholic Mariology , are considered infallible. Several liturgical
Marian feasts
are celebrated throughout the
Church Year
and she is honored with many titles such as
Queen of Heaven
(in Latin,
Regina Coeli ).
Pope Paul VI
called her
Mother of the Church
(in Latin,
Mater Ecclesiae ), because by giving birth to Christ, she is considered to be the spiritual mother to each member of the
Body of Christ . [ 152 ]
Because of her influential role in the life of Jesus, prayers and devotions, such as the
Rosary , the
Hail Mary , the
Salve Regina
and the
Memorare
are common Catholic practices. [ 148 ]
The Church has affirmed the validity of
Marian apparitions
(supernatural experiences of Mary by one or more persons) such as those at
Lourdes ,
Fatima
and
Guadalupe [ 153 ]
while others such as
Međugorje
are still under investigation. Affirmed or not, however, pilgrimages to these places are popular Catholic devotions. [ 154 ]
Pilgrimage
has been an important element of Catholic spirituality since at least the second century. Devotional journeys to the sites of biblical events or to places strongly connected with Jesus, Mary or the saints are considered an aid to spiritual growth, and can become meritorious acts if performed with the right intention. Western Europe has more than 6,000 pilgrimage destinations which generate around 60 million faith-related visits a year. [ 155 ]
[ edit ]
Church organization and community
While the Church considers Jesus to be its ultimate head, the spiritual leader and head of the Church organization is the
pope . [ 156 ]
The pope governs from the
Vatican City
in Rome – a sovereign nation of which he is the head of state. [ 157 ]
Each pope is elected for life by the
College of Cardinals , a body composed of
clerics
(normally bishops) who have been elevated to the rank of
cardinal . The cardinals, who also serve as papal advisors, may select any Catholic male as pope, but if the candidate is not already a
bishop , he must become one before taking office. [ 158 ]
The pope is assisted in the Church's administration by the
Roman Curia , or civil service. The Church is governed according to formal regulations set out in the
Code of Canon Law . The official language of the Church is Latin, although Italian is the working language of the Vatican administration. [ 159 ]
As of 2008, the worldwide Catholic Church comprises 2,795
dioceses
(also called
sees
or, in the East,
eparchies ), grouped into 23
particular Churches
– the
Latin-rite Church
and 22
Eastern Catholic Churches
– each with distinct traditions regarding the
liturgy
and the administration of the
sacraments . [ 160 ]
Each diocese is divided into individual communities called
parishes , each staffed by one or more priests. [ 161 ]
The church community is made up of
ordained
members (such as bishops, priests and deacons,) and the laity. Members of religious orders such as
nuns ,
friars
and
monks
are lay members unless individually ordained as priests. [ 162 ]
[ edit ]
Ordained members and Holy Orders
See also:
Catholic Church hierarchy ,

Priesthood (Catholic Church) , and
Deacon
Ordination
of a Catholic bishop. Two deacons hold the
Book of the Gospels
above his head, during the prayer of consecration.
Men may become
ordained
clergy, through the sacrament of
Holy Orders , as
bishops ,
priests
or
deacons . All
clergy
who are bishops
[ note 5 ]
form the
College of Bishops
and are jointly considered the successors of the apostles. [ 163 ] [ 164 ]
Only bishops can administer the sacrament of Holy Orders. [ 165 ]
They are also responsible for teaching, governing, and
sanctifying
the faithful of their diocese, sharing these duties with the priests and deacons who serve under them. The sacraments of the
Eucharist , Reconciliation ( Penance ) and
Anointing of the Sick
may only be administered by priests or bishops. Deacons and all other clergy may preach, teach, baptize, witness marriages and conduct funeral liturgies. [ 166 ]
Baptism is the only sacrament that may be administered in emergencies by any Catholic, or even a non-Christian who "has the intention of baptizing according to the belief of the Catholic Church". [ 167 ]
Married men may become deacons but only
celibate
men are ordinarily ordained as priests in the
Latin Rite . [ 168 ] [ 169 ]
However, married clergymen who have been received into the Church from other denominations may be exempted from this rule. [ 170 ]
The
Eastern Catholic Churches
ordain both celibate and married men to the priesthood, but married men cannot become bishops. [ 171 ] [ 172 ]
All 23 particular Churches of the Catholic Church maintain the ancient tradition that marriage is not allowed after ordination. Men with transitory homosexual leanings may be ordained deacons following three years of prayer and chastity, but homosexual men who are sexually active, or those who have deeply rooted homosexual tendencies, cannot be ordained. [ 173 ]
[ note 6 ]
Programs designed to prepare men for the
priesthood
can vary from country to country, since they are usually laid down by national bishops' conferences. [ 177 ]
The conferences consult Vatican documents such as
Pastores Dabo Vobis ,
Novo Millennio Ineunte , and
Optatam Totius
to create these programs. [ 178 ]
In some countries, priests are required to have a college degree plus another four years of full-time theological study in a
seminary
or other approved institution. In other countries, a degree is not strictly required, but seminary education is longer. Candidates for the priesthood are also evaluated in terms of human, spiritual and pastoral formation. [ 179 ]
Ordination
is conferred by a bishop through the
laying on of hands , following which the newly ordained priest or deacon is formally clothed in his
vestments , i.e., the
stole
and
chasuble
for priests, or stole and
dalmatic
for deacons. [ 165 ]
The Church teaches that since the
twelve apostles
chosen by Jesus were all male, only men may be ordained as priests. [ 180 ]
While some consider this to be evidence of a discriminatory attitude toward women, [ 181 ]
the Church believes that Jesus called women to different yet equally important vocations in Church ministry. [ 182 ]
Pope John Paul II, in his apostolic letter
Christifideles Laici , states that women have specific vocations reserved only for the female sex, and are equally called to be disciples of Jesus. [ 183 ]
[ edit ]
Lay members, marriage
See also:
Laity ,
Catholic marriage , and
Christian views of marriage

The laity consists of those Catholics who are not ordained clergy. Saint Paul compared the diversity of roles in the Church to the different parts of a body, all being important to enable the body to function. [ 19 ]
The Church therefore considers that lay members are equally called to live according to Christian principles, to work to spread the message of Jesus, and to effect change in the world for the good of others. The Church calls these actions participation in Christ's priestly, prophetic and royal offices. [ 184 ]
Marriage
and the consecrated life are lay vocations.
The sacrament of Holy Matrimony in the Latin rite
is not administered (conferred) by the priest or deacon who presides. Instead, the ministers of the sacrament are the bride and groom, who mutually confer the sacrament upon each other by expressing their consent before the priest or deacon who serves as a witness. In the Eastern Catholic Churches the minister of this
sacrament , which is called " Crowning ", is the priest or bishop who, after receiving the mutual consent of the spouses, successively crowns the bridegroom and the bride as a sign of the marriage covenant. [ 185 ]
Church law makes no provision for
divorce , but
annulment
may be granted when proof is produced that essential conditions for contracting a sacramental union (valid marriage) were absent. Since the Church condemns all forms of artificial
birth control , married persons are expected to be open to new life in their sexual relations. [ 186 ]
Natural family planning
is approved. [ 187 ]
Lay ecclesial movements
consist of lay Catholics organized for purposes of teaching the faith, cultural work, mutual support or missionary work. [ 188 ]
Such groups include:
Communion and Liberation ,
Opus Dei
and many others. [ 188 ]
Some non-ordained Catholics practice formal, public ministries within the Church. [ 189 ]
These are called
lay ecclesial ministers , a broad category which may include pastoral life coordinators, pastoral assistants, youth ministers and campus ministers. [ 190 ]
[ edit ]
Consecrated life
[ edit ]
Religious orders
See also:
Consecrated life (Catholic Church)
and
Catholic religious order
Both the ordained and the laity may enter the
cloistered
consecrated life
as
monks
or
nuns . There are also
friars
and
sisters
who engage in teaching and missionary activity and charity work such as the various
mendicant orders . A candidate takes
vows
confirming their desire to follow the three
evangelical counsels
of chastity, poverty and obedience. [ 191 ]
The majority of those wishing to enter the consecrated life join one of the
religious institutes
which are also referred to as monastic or religious orders. They follow a common rule such as the
Rule of St Benedict
and agree to live under the leadership of a
superior . [ 192 ] [ 193 ]
They usually live together in a community but individuals may be given permission to live as
hermits , or to reside elsewhere, for example as a serving priest or
chaplain . [ 194 ]
Examples of religious institutes include the
Benedictines ,
Carmelites ,
Cistercians ,
Augustinians ,
Dominicans ,
Franciscans ,
Marist Brothers ,
Paulist Fathers ,
Sisters of Charity ,
Sisters of the Destitute ,
Sisters of Mercy ,
Legionaries of Christ
and the
Society of Jesus
(Jesuits), but there are many others. [ 191 ]
[ edit ]
Tertiaries and Oblates
Tertiaries
and " Oblates
(regular)" are laypersons who live according to the
third rule of orders
such as those of the
Secular Franciscan Order
or
Lay Carmelites , either within a religious community or outside. [ 188 ]
Although all tertiaries make a public profession, participate in the good works of their order and in some cases may wear the habit, they are not bound by public vows unless they live in a religious community. They must not be confused with "Oblates (secular)", who are not members of the consecrated life but are laypersons (married or single) or secular priests that have individually affiliated themselves in prayer with a House of their choice without making public vows. They make a formal private promise (annually renewable or for life, depending on the house with which they are affiliated) to follow the rule of prayer in their private life as closely as their individual circumstances and prior commitments permit.
[ edit ]
Other forms of consecrated life
The Church recognizes several other forms of consecrated life, including secular institutes,
societies of apostolic life
and consecrated widows and widowers. [ 191 ]
It also makes provision for the approval of new forms. [ 195 ]
[ edit ]
Membership
Baptism of an infant by
affusion
Membership of the Catholic Church is attained through
baptism . [ 196 ]
For those baptized as children,
First Communion
is a particular rite of passage when, following instruction, they are allowed to receive the sacrament of the
Eucharist
for the first time in the Latin (Western) Church; the Eastern Churches confer the
sacraments of initiation
at once – Baptism, Chrismation (Confirmation) and Eucharist – to unbaptized children or unbaptized adult converts. Those never baptized may be admitted to Baptism by participating in a formation program such as the
Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults . [ 197 ]
Christians – those baptized with flowing water and in the "Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit" – baptized outside of the Catholic Church are admitted through other formation programs but are not re-baptized. [ 198 ]
In all rites, after going through formation and making a profession of faith, candidates are received into the Church. This ordinarily occurs at the
Easter Vigil
on
Holy Saturday . [ 197 ]
Members of the Church can incur
excommunication
for serious violations of ecclesiastical law. Excommunication does not remove a member from the Church but severely limits the member's ability to participate in it. For very serious offenses, the excommunication can be incurred automatically. [ 199 ]
Examples include violating the
seal of confession
(committed when a priest discloses the sins heard in the sacrament of Penance), persisting in
heresy , creating
schism , becoming an
apostate , or having or performing an
abortion . [ 200 ]
Throwing away or retaining for a sacrilegious purpose the
Eucharist
is considered an excommunicable offense. [ 201 ]
Excommunication is the most severe ecclesiastical penalty because it forbids a person from receiving any sacrament. Such offences can only be forgiven by the Pope, the bishop of the diocese where the person resides, or a priest authorized by the bishop to do so. [ 202 ]
A similar concept is a minister's power to refuse to distribute communion to a person not yet declared excommunicated (but nonetheless excommunicated
latae sententiae ) who has publicly committed a very serious sin. [ 203 ]
Excommunication, which is a "medicinal" measure meant to lead to repentance, does not make the person to whom it is applied cease to be a member of the Church. To terminate one's membership, a person must present to the competent Church authority a formal act of
defection . If that person later wishes to rejoin the Church, the procedure is the same as for any baptized non-Catholic, namely by a profession of faith, again before the competent Church authority.

Church membership in 2007 was 1.147 billion people, [ 205 ]
increasing from the 1950 figure of 437 million [ 206 ]
and the 1970 figure of 654 million. [ 207 ]
The Catholic population increase of 139% outpaced the world population increase of 117% between 1950 and 2000. [ 206 ]
It is the largest Christian church, and encompasses approximately half of all Christians, one sixth of the world's population, the largest organized body of any world religion. [ 13 ] [ 208 ]
It is known for its ability to use its transnational ties and organizational strength to bring significant resources to needy situations [ 209 ]
and operates the world's largest non-governmental school system. [ 210 ]
Although the number of practicing Catholics worldwide is not reliably known, [ 211 ]
membership is growing particularly in Africa and Asia. [ 12 ]
Some parts of Europe and the Americas have experienced a shortage of priests in recent years as the number of priests has not increased in proportion to the number of Catholics. [ 212 ]
The Church in Latin America, known for its large parishes where the parishioner to priest ratio is the highest in the world, considers this to be a contributing factor in the rise of Pentecostal and evangelical Christian denominations in the region. [ 213 ]
Secularism
has seen a steady rise in Europe, yet the Catholic presence there remains strong. [ 213 ]
With a high number of adult baptisms, the Church is growing faster in Africa than anywhere else. [ 214 ]
It also operates a greater number of Catholic schools per parish here (3:1) than in other areas of the world. [ 215 ]
Challenges faced include suppression of non-Islamic religious practices by Muslims in
Sudan
and a high rate of
AIDS
in Sub-Saharan Africa. [ 216 ]
The Church in Asia is a significant minority among other religions, comprising only 3% of all Asians, yet it has a large proportion of religious sisters, priests and parishes relative to the total Catholic population. [ 213 ]
From 1975 to 2000, total Asian population grew by 61% with an Asian Catholic population increase of 104%. [ 217 ]
Challenges faced include oppression in communist countries like
North Korea
and
China . [ 218 ]
In Oceania, the Church faces challenges in reaching indigenous populations where over 715 different languages are spoken. [ 213 ]
Of Catholics worldwide, 12% reside in Africa, 50% in the American continents, 10% are in Asia, 27% in Europe and 1% live in Oceania. [ 219 ]

The baptism of

was of immense importance in spreading Christianity throughout Western and Central Europe. [ 220 ]
The influence of the Catholic Church on world culture and society has been vast, first and foremost in the development of European civilization from Greco-Roman times to the modern era. [ 33 ]
The church rejected and helped end practices [ dubious
–
discuss ]
such as human sacrifice, slavery, [ note 7 ]
infanticide, and polygamy in evangelized cultures throughout the world, beginning with the Roman Empire. In addition, the Church played a significant role in moderating some of the excesses of the
colonial
era. [ 222 ] [ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ] [ 226 ]
Over the course of its history, the Church has influenced the status of women, condemning
infanticide ,
divorce ,
incest ,
polygamy
and counting the
marital infidelity
of men as equally sinful to that of women. [ 222 ] [ 223 ] [ 227 ]
The official Church teaching [ 228 ]
considers women and men to be equal, different, and complementary.
Catholic universities, scholars and many priests including
Copernicus ,
Roger Bacon ,
Albertus Magnus ,
Robert Grosseteste ,
Nicholas Steno ,
Francesco Grimaldi ,
Giambattista Riccioli ,
Roger Boscovich ,
Athanasius Kircher ,
Gregor Mendel ,
Georges Lemaître
and others, were responsible for many important scientific discoveries. The Jesuits produced the large majority of priest-scientists, who contributed to worldwide cultural exchange by spreading their developments in knowledge to Asia, Africa, and the Americas. [ 229 ] [ 230 ]
Most research took place in Catholic universities that were staffed by members of religious orders who had the education and means to conduct scientific investigation. [ 229 ]
The 1633 Church condemnation of
Galileo Galilei
created the perception of antagonism between the Church and science of that era. According to historian Thomas Noble, the effect of the Galileo affair was to restrict scientific development in some European countries. [ 229 ]
In part because of lessons learned from the Galilei affair, the Church created the
Pontifical Academy of Sciences , a scientific organization that essentially began in 1603 but developed over time to reach its present form by 1936. [ 231 ]
The Catholic Church was the dominant influence on the development of Western art, at least up to the
Protestant Reformation . Important contributions include its consistent opposition to Byzantine
iconoclasm , its cultivation and patronage of individual artists, as well as development of the
Romanesque ,
Gothic
and
Renaissance
styles of art and architecture. [ 232 ]
Renaissance artists such as
Raphael ,
Michelangelo ,
Leonardo da Vinci ,
Bernini ,
Botticelli ,
Fra Angelico ,
Tintoretto ,
Caravaggio , and
Titian , were among a multitude of innovative virtuosos sponsored by the Church. [ 233 ]
In music, Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church, [ 234 ]
and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European
classical music , and its many derivatives. The
Baroque
style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor. [ 235 ]

Early Christianity
Main article:
History of early Christianity
The Catholic Church considers
Pentecost
to be the beginning of its own history. [ 236 ] [ 237 ]
According to historians, the Apostles traveled to northern Africa, Asia Minor, Arabia, Greece, and
Rome
to found the first Christian communities, [ 236 ] [ 238 ]
over 40 of which had been established by the year 100. [ 239 ]
The
New Testament
gospels indicate that the earliest Christians continued to observe traditional Jewish pieties such as
fasting , reverence for the
Torah
and observance of
Jewish holy days . [ 240 ] [ 241 ]
However, Christians were directed by Jesus to evangelize non-Jewish peoples. As Christianity spread to non-Jews, disputes over observance of the Mosaic law generated intense controversy. A pivotal moment in this dispute occurred in the mid-1st century, when the
circumcision controversy
arose and was ultimately addressed at the
Council of Jerusalem . At this council,
Paul
made an argument that circumcision was no longer necessary, vocally supported by Peter, as documented in
Acts 15 . This position received widespread support and was summarized in a letter circulated in
Antioch . [ 242 ]
In the second century, writings by teachers such as
Ignatius of Antioch
and
Irenaeus
defined Catholic teaching in stark opposition to
Gnosticism . [ 243 ]
Other writers such as
Pope Clement I ,
Justin Martyr ,
Augustine of Hippo
influenced the development of Church teachings and traditions. These writers are collectively known as
Church Fathers . [ 244 ]
Persecution
Early Christians were slaughtered as entertainment in the
Colosseum
in Rome.
Jean-Léon Gérôme , 1883.
Early Christians refused to offer sacrifices to the Roman gods or to worship Roman rulers as gods and were thus subject to
persecution . [ 245 ]
The first documented case of imperially-sponsored
persecution of Christians
occurred in Rome under
Nero
in the first century and re-occurred under various emperors until the
great persecution
of
Diocletian
and
Galerius , which was seen as a final attempt to wipe out Christianity. [ 246 ]
Nevertheless, Christianity continued to spread and was eventually legalized in 313 under
Constantine's
Edict of Milan . [ 247 ]
During this era of persecution, the early Church evolved both in doctrinal and structural ways. The apostles had convened the first Church council, the
Council of Jerusalem , to resolve issues concerning evangelization of
Gentiles . [ 71 ]
While competing forms of Christianity emerged early, the Roman Church retained this practice of meeting in "synods" (councils) to ensure that any internal doctrinal differences were quickly resolved, which facilitated broad doctrinal unity within the mainstream churches. [ 70 ] [ 248 ]
By 58 AD, a large Christian community existed in Rome. [ 249 ]
From as early as the first century, the Church of Rome was recognized as a doctrinal authority because it was believed that the Apostles
Peter
and
Paul
had led the Church there. [ 55 ] [ 250 ] [ 251 ]
The concept of the
primacy of the Roman bishop
over other churches was increasingly recognized by the church at large from at least the second century although disputes over the implications of that primacy would ultimately lead to
schisms . [ 252 ] [ 253 ]
[ edit ]
State religion of the Roman Empire
Despite persecution, Christianity spread and was eventually legalized in 313 under
Constantine's
Edict of Milan . [ 247 ]
Emperor Constantine I
commissioned the
first Basilica of St. Peter
and several other sites of lasting importance to Christianity. [ 254 ]
By this time, the altar as the focal point of each church, the sign of the cross, and the liturgical calendar had been established [ 255 ]
and in 380, Christianity was declared the
state religion
of the Empire. [ 256 ]
After the legalization of Christianity, a number of doctrinal disputes led to the calling of
ecumenical councils . The doctrinal formulations resulting from these ecumenical councils were pivotal in the history of Christianity. The
first seven Ecumenical Councils , from the
First Council of Nicaea
(325) to the
Second Council of Nicaea
(787), sought to reach an
orthodox
consensus and to establish a unified
Christendom .
In 325, the
First Council of Nicaea
convened in response to the threat of
Arianism ; in order to encapsulate the basic tenets of the Christian belief, it promulgated a creed which became the basis of what is now known as the
Nicene Creed . [ 257 ]
In addition, it divided the church into geographical and administrative areas called dioceses. [ 258 ]
The
Council of Rome
in 382 established the first
Biblical canon
when it listed the accepted books of the
Old
and
New Testament . [ 259 ]
The
Council of Ephesus
in 431 [ 260 ]
and the
Council of Chalcedon
in 451 defined the relationship of Christ's divine and human natures, leading to splits with the
Nestorians
and
Monophysites . [ 70 ]
Constantine moved the imperial capital to Constantinople, and the Council of Chalcedon (AD 451) elevated the See of Constantinople to a position "second in eminence and power to the bishop of Rome". [ 261 ] [ 262 ]
Rome had particular prominence over the other dioceses; it was considered the see of Peter and Paul, it was located in the capital of the empire, it was wealthy and known for supporting other churches, and church scholars wanted the Roman bishop's support in doctrinal disputes. [ 263 ]
From
c
350 to
c 500, the bishops, or popes, of Rome steadily increased in authority. [ 249 ]

Following the collapse of Roman power in Western Europe, the Catholic faith competed with
Arianism
for the conversion of the barbarian tribes. [ 264 ]
The 496 conversion of
Clovis I , pagan king of the
Franks , marked the beginning of a steady rise of the Catholic faith in the West. [ 265 ]
The
Rule of St Benedict , composed in 530, became a blueprint for the organization of
monasteries
throughout Europe. [ 266 ]
As well as providing a focus for spiritual life, the new monasteries preserved classical craft and artistic skills while maintaining intellectual culture within their schools,
scriptoria
and libraries. They also functioned as agricultural, economic and production centers, particularly in remote regions, becoming major conduits of civilization. [ 267 ]
Pope Gregory the Great
reformed church practice and administration around 600 and launched
renewed missionary efforts [ 268 ]
which were complemented by other missionary movements such as the
Hiberno-Scottish mission . [ 269 ] [ 270 ]
Missionaries such as
Augustine of Canterbury , Saint
Boniface ,
Willibrord
and
Ansgar
took Christianity to the Anglo-Saxons and other Germanic people. [ 269 ]
In the same period the Visigoths and Lombards moved from Arianism toward Catholicism, [ 265 ]
and in Britain the full reunion of the Celtic churches with Rome was effectively marked by the
Synod of Whitby
in 664. [ 270 ]
Later missionary efforts by
Saints Cyril and Methodius
in the ninth century reached
greater Moravia
and introduced, along with Christianity, the Cyrillic alphabet used in the southern and eastern Slavic languages. [ 271 ]
While Christianity continued to expand in Europe, Islam presented a significant military threat to Western Christendom. [ 272 ]
By 715, Muslim armies had conquered Syria, Jerusalem, Caesarea, Alexandria, Iraq and Persia, Carthage and much of the Iberian Peninsula. [ 273 ]
From the 8th century,
Iconoclasm , the destruction of religious images, became a major source of conflict in the eastern church. [ 274 ] [ 275 ]
Byzantine emperors
Leo III
and
Constantine V
strongly supported Iconoclasm, while the papacy and the western church remained resolute in favour of the veneration of
icons . In 787, the
Second Council of Nicaea
ruled in favor of the
iconodules
but the dispute continued into the early 9th century. [ 275 ]
The consequent estrangement led to the creation of the
papal states
and the papal coronation of the Frankish King
Charlemagne
as Emperor of the Romans in 800. This ultimately created a new problem as successive Western emperors sought to impose an increasingly tight control over the popes. [ 276 ] [ 277 ]
Eastern and Western Christendom grew farther apart in the 9th century. Conflicts arose over ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the Byzantine-controlled south of Italy, missionaries to Bulgaria and a brief schism revolving around
Photios of Constantinople . [ 274 ] [ 278 ]
Further disagreements led to Pope and Patriarch excommunicating each other in 1054, commonly considered the date of the
East–West Schism . [ 279 ]
The Western branch of Christianity remained in communion with the Pope and remained a part of the Catholic Church, while the Eastern (Greek) branch that rejected the papal claims became known as the
Eastern Orthodox churches . [ 280 ] [ 281 ]
Efforts to mend the rift were attempted at the
Second Council of Lyon
in 1274 and
Council of Florence
in 1439; however, both attempts failed to heal the schism, even though in each case both the Eastern Emperor and Eastern Patriarch agreed to the reunion [ 282 ]
because they were unable to change the attitudes of the Eastern Churches at large. [ 283 ]
Some
Eastern churches
have subsequently reunited with the Catholic Church. [ 281 ]
In spite of recent attempts at reunification, the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Church remain in schism although
excommunications were mutually lifted
in 1965. [ 284 ]
High Middle Ages
Further information:
High Middle Ages
The
Cluniac reform
of monasteries that had begun in 910 sparked widespread monastic growth and renewal. [ 285 ]
Monasteries introduced new technologies and crops, fostered the creation and preservation of literature and promoted economic growth. Monasteries, convents and cathedrals still operated virtually all schools and libraries. [ 286 ] [ 287 ]
Despite a church ban on the practice of
usury
the larger abbeys functioned as sources for economic credit. [ 288 ]
The 11th and 12th century saw internal efforts to reform the church. The
college of cardinals
in 1059 was created to free papal elections from interference by Emperor and nobility. Lay investiture of bishops, a source of rulers' dominance over the Church, was attacked by reformers and under
Pope Gregory VII , erupted into the
Investiture Controversy
between Pope and Emperor. The matter was eventually settled with the
Concordat of Worms
in 1122 where it was agreed that bishops would be selected in accordance with
Church law . [ 289 ] [ 290 ]
Pope Urban II
at the
Council of Clermont
(1095), where he preached the
First Crusade ; later
manuscript illumination
of c. 1490
In 1095,
Byzantine
emperor
Alexius I
appealed to
Pope Urban II
for help against renewed
Muslim invasions , [ 291 ]
which caused Urban to launch the
First Crusade
aimed at aiding the Byzantine Empire and returning the
Holy Land
to Christian control. [ 283 ] [ 292 ]
The goal was not permanently realized, and episodes of brutality committed by the armies of both sides left a legacy of mutual distrust between Muslims and Western and Eastern Christians. [ 293 ]
The sack of Constantinople during the
Fourth Crusade , conducted against
papal
authorisation, left Eastern Christians embittered and was a decisive event that permanently solidified the schism between the churches. [ 294 ] [ 295 ]
The crusades also saw the formation of
military orders
which included the
Hospitallers ,
Templars
and later, the
Teutonic Knights
all of whom provided social services as well as guardianship of pilgrim routes. [ 296 ]
The Teutonic Knights conquered the then-pagan
Prussia . [ 296 ]
The Templars became noted bankers and creditors who were suppressed by King
Philip IV of France
shortly after 1300. [ 297 ]
Later,
mendicant orders
were founded by
Francis of Assisi
and
Dominic de Guzmán
which brought
consecrated religious life
into urban settings. [ 298 ]
These orders also played a large role in the development of cathedral schools into
universities , the direct ancestors of the modern Western institutions. [ 299 ]
Notable
scholastic
theologians such as the Dominican
Thomas Aquinas
worked at these universities, his
Summa Theologica
was a key intellectual achievement in its synthesis of
Aristotelian
thought and Christianity. [ 300 ]
Twelfth century France witnessed the emergence of
Catharism , a
dualist
heresy
that had spread from Eastern Europe through Germany. After the Cathars were accused of murdering a
papal legate
in 1208, [ 301 ]
Pope Innocent III
declared the
Albigensian Crusade
against them. When this turned into an "appalling massacre", [ 302 ]
he instituted the first
papal inquisition
to prevent further massacres and to root out the remaining Cathars. [ 302 ] [ 303 ] [ 304 ]
Formalized under
Gregory IX , this
Medieval inquisition
put to death an average of three people per year for heresy. [ 297 ] [ 304 ]
Over time, other
inquisitions
were launched by secular rulers to prosecute heretics, often with the approval of Church hierarchy, to respond to the threat of
Muslim invasion
or for political purposes. [ 305 ]
King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella
of Spain formed an inquisition in 1480, originally to deal with distrusted converts from Judaism and Islam to Catholicism. [ 306 ]
Over a 350-year period, this
Spanish Inquisition
executed between 3,000 and 4,000 people, [ 307 ]
representing around two percent of those accused. [ 308 ]
In 1482
Pope Sixtus IV
condemned the excesses of the Spanish Inquisition, but Ferdinand ignored his protests. [ 309 ]
Some historians argue that for centuries Protestant propaganda and popular literature exaggerated the horrors of the inquisitions in an effort to associate the Catholic Church with acts committed by secular rulers. [ 310 ] [ 311 ] [ 312 ]
Over all, one percent of those tried by the inquisitions received death penalties, leading some scholars to consider them rather lenient when compared to the secular courts of the period. [ 307 ] [ 313 ]
The inquisition played a major role in the final expulsion of Islam from Sicily and Spain. [ 272 ]
At the end of the 13th century,
Pope Boniface VIII
was involved in a heated conflict with Philip IV of France. After a falsified papal bull was circulated by Philip in a "smear campaign" against the pope, Boniface promulgated
Unam Sanctam . [ 314 ]
This clarified the spiritual responsibilities of the pope as supreme over the temporal responsibilities of monarchs. [ 314 ]
When Philip subsequently attempted to kidnap Boniface, the townspeople came to his rescue. [ 314 ]
Later, the Papacy came under French dominance, with
Clement V
in 1305 moving to
Avignon . [ 315 ]
The
Avignon Papacy
ended in 1376 when the Pope returned to Rome [ 316 ] [ 317 ]
but was soon followed in 1378 by the 38-year-long
Western schism
with separate claimants to the papacy in Rome, Avignon and (after 1409) Pisa, backed by conflicting secular rulers. [ 318 ]
The matter was finally resolved in 1417 at the
Council of Constance
where the three claimants either resigned or were deposed and held a new election naming
Martin V
Pope. [ 318 ] Reformation and Counter-Reformation
Main articles:
Protestant Reformation ,
English Reformation ,
Counter-Reformation , and
Catholicism and the wars of religion
In 1509, the scholar
Erasmus
wrote
In Praise of Folly ,
a work which captured a widely held unease about corruption in the Church. [ 319 ]
The
Council of Constance , the
Council of Basel
and the
Fifth Lateran Council
had all attempted to reform internal Church abuses but had failed. [ 320 ]
As a result, rich, powerful and worldly men like Roderigo
Borgia
( Pope Alexander VI ) were able to win election to the papacy. [ 320 ] [ 321 ]
In 1517,
Martin Luther
included his
Ninety-Five Theses
in a letter to several bishops. [ 322 ] [ 323 ]
His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of
indulgences . [ 322 ] [ 323 ]
Huldrych Zwingli ,
John Calvin , and others further criticized Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into a large and all encompassing European movement called the
Protestant Reformation . [ 263 ] [ 324 ]
In Germany, the reformation led to a nine-year war between the Protestant
Schmalkaldic League
and the Catholic Emperor
Charles V . In 1618 a far graver conflict, the
Thirty Years' War , followed. [ 325 ]
In France, a series of conflicts termed the
French Wars of Religion
were fought from 1562 to 1598 between the
Huguenots
and the forces of the
French Catholic League . The
St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre
marked the turning point in this war. [ 326 ]
Survivors regrouped under
Henry of Navarre
who became Catholic and began the first experiment in religious toleration with his 1598
Edict of Nantes . [ 326 ]
This Edict, which granted civil and religious toleration to Protestants, was hesitantly accepted by
Pope Clement VIII . [ 325 ] [ 327 ]
Whitby Abbey ,
England , one of hundreds of monasteries destroyed during the
Reformation
The
English Reformation
under
Henry VIII
began more as a political than as a theological dispute. When the annulment of his marriage was denied by the pope, Henry had Parliament pass the
Acts of Supremacy , 1534, which made him, and not the pope, head of the English Church. [ 328 ] [ 329 ]
Although he strove to maintain the substance of traditional Catholicism, Henry initiated and supported the
confiscation and dissolution of monasteries , friaries, convents and shrines throughout England, Wales and Ireland. [ 328 ] [ 330 ] [ 331 ]
Under Henry's daughter,
Mary I , England was reunited with Rome, {Henry's
Act of Supremacy
was repealed (1554)}, but the following monarch,
Elizabeth I , {second
Act of Supremacy , 1558} restored a separate church which outlawed Catholic priests [ 332 ]
and prevented Catholics from educating their children and taking part in political life [ 333 ] [ 334 ]
until the
first Catholic Relief Act
of 1778 began the process of eliminating many of the anti-Catholic laws. [ 335 ] [ 336 ]
The Catholic Church responded to doctrinal challenges and abuses highlighted by the Reformation at the
Council of Trent
(1545–1563), which became the driving force of the Counter-Reformation. Doctrinally, it reaffirmed central Catholic teachings such as
transubstantiation , and the requirement for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation. [ 337 ]
It also made structural reforms, most importantly by improving the education of the clergy and laity and consolidating the central jurisdiction of the Roman Curia. [ 337 ] [ 338 ] [ 339 ] [ note 8 ]
To popularize Counter-Reformation teachings, the Church encouraged the
Baroque
style in art, music and architecture, [ 235 ]
and new religious orders were founded. These included the
Theatines ,
Barnabites
and
Jesuits , some of which became the great missionary orders of later years. [ 342 ]
The Jesuits quickly took on a leadership in education during the Counter-Reformation, viewing it as a "battleground for hearts and minds"; [ 343 ]
at the same time, the writings of figures such as
Teresa of Avila ,
Francis de Sales
and
Philip Neri
spawned new schools of spirituality within the Church. [ 344 ]
In central Europe, the Counter-Reformation presented the
Habsburg dynasty
with an opportunity to "combat Protestantism and consolidate their realms in the name of God". [ 343 ]
Toward the latter part of the 17th century,
Pope Innocent XI
reformed abuses that were occurring in the Church's hierarchy, including
simony ,
nepotism
and the lavish papal expenditures that had caused him to inherit a large papal debt. [ 345 ]
He promoted missionary activity, tried to unite Europe against the Turkish invasion, prevented influential Catholic rulers (including the Emperor) from marrying Protestants but strongly condemned religious persecution.
Age of Discovery
Just before the
Fall of Constantinople
to the Muslim
Ottoman Empire
in 1453, [ 346 ]
in an effort to combat the spread of Islam, Pope
Nicholas V
granted Portugal the right to subdue and even enslave Muslims, pagans and other unbelievers in the papal bull
Dum Diversas
(1452). Several decades later European explorers and missionaries spread Catholicism to the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania.
Pope Alexander VI
had awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands to Spain and Portugal [ 347 ]
and the ensuing
patronato
system allowed state authorities, not the Vatican, to control all clerical appointments in the new colonies. [ 348 ]
Although the Spanish monarchs tried to curb abuses committed against the Amerindians by explorers and conquerors, [ 349 ]
Antonio de Montesinos , a Dominican friar, openly rebuked the Spanish rulers of
Hispaniola
in 1511 for their cruelty and tyranny in dealing with the American natives. [ 350 ] [ 351 ]
King Ferdinand
enacted the
Laws of Burgos
and
Valladolid
in response. The issue resulted in a crisis of conscience in 16th-century Spain [ 351 ] [ 352 ]
and, through the writings of Catholic clergy such as
Bartolomé de Las Casas
and
Francisco de Vitoria , led to debate on the nature of human rights [ 351 ]
and to the birth of modern international law. [ 353 ] [ 354 ]
Enforcement of these laws was lax, and some historians blame the Church for not doing enough to liberate the Indians; others point to the Church as the only voice raised on behalf of indigenous peoples. [ 355 ]
Nevertheless, Amerindian populations suffered serious decline due to new diseases, inadvertently introduced through contact with Europeans, which created a labor vacuum in the New World. [ 349 ]
In 1521 the Portuguese explorer
Ferdinand Magellan
made the first Catholic converts in the Philippines. [ 356 ]
The following year, the first Franciscan missionaries arrived in
Mexico , establishing schools, model farms and hospitals. When some Europeans questioned whether the Indians were truly human and worthy of baptism,
Pope Paul III
in the 1537 bull
Sublimis Deus
confirmed that "their souls were as immortal as those of Europeans" and they should neither be robbed nor turned into slaves. [ 357 ] [ 358 ] [ 359 ]
Over the next 150 years, missions expanded into southwestern North America. [ 360 ]
Native people were often legally defined as children, and priests took on a paternalistic role, sometimes enforced with corporal punishment. [ 361 ]
Elsewhere, Portuguese missionaries under the Spanish Jesuit
Francis Xavier
evangelized in India and
Japan . [ 362 ]
By the end of the 16th century tens of thousands of Japanese followed Roman Catholicism. Church growth came to a halt in 1597 under the Shogun
Tokugawa Iemitsu
who, in an effort to isolate the country from foreign influences, launched a severe persecution of Christians or
Kirishitan 's. [ 363 ]
An underground minority Christian population survived throughout this period of persecution and enforced isolation which was eventually lifted in the 19th century. [ 363 ] [ 364 ]
The

In the Americas, Franciscan priest
Junípero Serra
founded a series of new missions in cooperation with the Spanish government and military. [ 365 ]
These missions brought grain, cattle and a new way of living to the Indian tribes of California.
San Francisco
was founded in 1776 and
Los Angeles
in 1781. In a challenge to Spanish and Portuguese policy,
Pope Gregory XVI , began to appoint his own candidates as bishops in the colonies, condemned slavery and the slave trade in the 1839 papal bull
In Supremo Apostolatus , and approved the ordination of native clergy in the face of government racism. [ 366 ]
Yet in spite of these advances, the Amerindian population continued to suffer decline from exposure to European diseases. [ 367 ]
In South America, Jesuit missionaries tried to protect native peoples from enslavement by establishing semi-independent settlements called
reductions . In China, despite Jesuit efforts to find compromise, the
Chinese Rites controversy
led the
Kangxi Emperor
to outlaw Christian missions in 1721. [ 368 ]
These events added fuel to growing criticism of the Jesuits, who were seen to symbolize the independent power of the Church, and in 1773 European rulers united to force
Pope Clement XIV
to
dissolve the order . [ 369 ]
The Jesuits were eventually restored in the 1814 papal bull
Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum .
Enlightenment
Toward the latter part of the 17th century,
Pope Innocent XI
reformed abuses by the Church, including
simony ,
nepotism
and the lavish papal expenditures that had caused him to inherit a large papal debt. [ 345 ]
He promoted missionary activity, tried to unite Europe against the Turkish invasions, and condemned religious persecution of all kinds. [ 345 ]
In 1685 King
Louis XIV
of France
revoked the Edict of Nantes , ending a century-long experiment in religious toleration. However the religious conflicts of the 16th and 17th centuries played a major role in provoking a backlash against Christianity in 18th century Europe. In a philosophical and cultural movement known as " the Enlightenment ", the power and influence of the Church over Western society declined as ideologies such as rationalism, secularism, nationalism, anti-clericalism, liberalism and freemasonry challenged it. [ 371 ]
These movements culminated in the violent
anti-clericalism
of the
French Revolution . Direct attacks on the wealth of the Church and associated grievances led to the wholesale nationalisation of church property in France. [ 372 ]
Large numbers of French priests refused to take an oath of compliance to the
National Assembly , leading to the Church being outlawed and replaced by
a new religion of the worship of "Reason" . [ 372 ]
In this period, all monasteries were destroyed, 30,000 priests were exiled and hundreds more were killed. [ 372 ]
When
Pope Pius VI
sided against the revolution in the
First Coalition ,
Napoleon Bonaparte
invaded Italy. The pope was imprisoned by French troops, and died in 1799 after six weeks of captivity. Napoleon later re-established the Catholic Church in France through the
Concordat of 1801 . [ 373 ]
The end of the Napoleonic wars brought Catholic revival, renewed enthusiasm, and new respect for the papacy due in part to his "heroic stand against the tyrant". [ 374 ] [ 375 ]
The papal states were returned, and the Church was "liberated" from its servile ties to European kings thus freeing the Church to return to its "true spiritual mission." [ 374 ]
In the Americas, Franciscan priest
Junípero Serra
founded a series of new missions in cooperation with the Spanish government and military. [ 365 ]
These missions brought grain, cattle and a new way of living to the Indian tribes of California.

Los Angeles
in 1781. In a challenge to Spanish and Portuguese policy,

In South America, Jesuit missionaries tried to protect native peoples from enslavement by establishing semi-independent settlements called
reductions . In China, despite Jesuit efforts to find compromise, the
Chinese Rites controversy
led the
Kangxi Emperor
to outlaw Christian missions in 1721. [ 368 ]
In 1773 European rulers united to force
Pope Clement XIV
to
dissolve the Jesuits . The expulsion of the
Society of Jesus
from the principal Catholic nations of Europe and their colonial empires is seen by some as the first major triumph of the secularist notions of the self-styled
Age of Enlightenment . The suppression was also seen by many as an attempt by Catholic monarchs to gain control of revenues and trade that were previously dominated by the Society of Jesus, this included the takeover destruction of the Jesuit reductions and the enslavement of many of their previously-protected inhabitants.
With the reaction against the anti-clerical excesses of the Revolution, especially after
1815 , came Catholic revival, renewed enthusiasm, and new respect for the papacy. [ 375 ]
The Jesuits were finally restored in the 1814 papal bull
Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum . [ 370 ]
Industrial age
In response to growing concern about the deteriorating working and living conditions brought about by the
Industrial Revolution ,
Pope Leo XIII
published the encyclical
Rerum Novarum . This set out
Catholic social teaching
in terms that rejected socialism but advocated the regulation of working conditions, the establishment of a living wage and the right of workers to form trade unions. [ 376 ]
The Catholic Church exercised a prominent role in shaping the labor movement in the United States. In 1933, two American Catholics,
Dorothy Day
and
Peter Maurin , founded a new Catholic peace group, the
Catholic Worker
that would embody their ideals of pacifism, commitment to the poor and to fundamental change in American society.
Although the
infallibility of the Church
in doctrinal matters had always been a Church dogma, the
First Vatican Council , which convened in 1870, affirmed the doctrine of
papal infallibility
when exercised in certain specifically defined pronouncements. [ 377 ] [ 378 ]
This decision in many eyes gave the pope "enormous moral and spiritual authority over the worldwide" Church. [ 371 ]
Reaction to the pronouncement resulted in the breakaway of a group of mainly German churches which subsequently formed the
Old Catholic Church . [ 379 ]
The loss of the
papal states
to the
Italian unification
movement created what came to be known as the
Roman Question , [ 380 ]
a territorial dispute between the papacy and the Italian government that was not resolved until the 1929
Lateran Treaty
granted sovereignty to the Holy See over Vatican City. [ 381 ]
By the close of the 19th century, European powers controlled most of the African interior. Catholic missionaries followed colonial governments into Africa and built schools, hospitals, monasteries and churches. [ 382 ]
In Latin America, a succession of
anti-clerical
regimes came to power beginning in the 1830s. [ 383 ]
Church properties were confiscated and basic civil and political rights denied to religious orders and the clergy. [ 384 ]
The 1930's also saw violence against clergy and expropriation of Church properties in Spain and the Soviet Union. [ 385 ]
During the 1936–39 Spanish Civil War, over 6,000 [ 386 ]
priests and nuns were killed
by republicans and anarchists. [ 387 ]
In the Soviet Union, persecution of the Church included the execution and exiling of clerics and the confiscation and closure of churches. [ 388 ]
On 20 July 1933, the Vatican signed an agreement with Germany, the
Reichskonkordat , which guaranteed the Church certain rights and freedoms. [ 389 ] [ 390 ]
Violations of this led to
Pope Pius XI
issuing the 1937 encyclical
Mit brennender Sorge [ 389 ] [ 391 ] [ 392 ] [ 393 ]
which publicly condemned
Nazi
persecution of the Church, neopaganism and the culture of racial superiority.
Catholic Mortal Agony of Christ chapel at
Dachau concentration camp . Of the 2700 ministers who were imprisoned there during
World War II , over 2600 were Catholic priests, 2000 of whom ultimately did not survive. [ 397 ]
After the
Second World War
began in September 1939, the Church condemned the invasion of Poland and subsequent 1940 Nazi invasions. [ 398 ]
During the war, several thousand Catholic clergy were imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps. [ 397 ]
In the
Holocaust ,
Pope Pius XII
directed the Church hierarchy to help protect Jews from the Nazis. [ 399 ]
However, the Church has also been accused of encouraging centuries of
antisemitism
and Pius himself of not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities. [ 400 ] [ 401 ]
Debate over the validity of these criticisms continues to this day. [ 402 ] [ 403 ] [ 404 ]
Following the
Soviet doctrine regarding the exercise of religion , postwar
Communist
governments in Eastern Europe severely restricted religious freedoms. Even though some clerics collaborated with the Communist regimes, [ 405 ]
the Church's resistance and the leadership of
Pope John Paul II
have been credited with hastening the downfall of communist governments across Europe in 1991. [ 406 ]
The
rise to power
of the Communists in China in 1949 led to the expulsion of all foreign missionaries. [ 407 ]
The new government also created the
Patriotic Church
whose unilaterally appointed bishops were initially rejected by Rome before many of them were accepted. [ 407 ] [ 408 ] [ 409 ]
The
Cultural Revolution
of the 1960s led to the closure of all religious establishments. When Chinese churches eventually reopened they remained under the control of the Communist party's Patriotic Church, and many Catholic pastors and priests continued to be sent to prison for refusing to renounce allegiance to Rome. [ 408 ]
Second Vatican Council and beyond
The Catholic Church initiated a comprehensive process of reform under
Pope John XXIII . [ 410 ]
Intended as a continuation of the
First Vatican Council , the
Second Vatican Council
(1962–1965), developed into an engine of modernization, making pronouncements on religious freedom, the nature of the Church and the mission of the laity. [ 410 ]
The role of the bishops of the Church was brought into renewed prominence, especially when seen collectively, as the college of the successors of the
Apostles
in teaching and governing the Church. This college does not exist without its head, the successor of St. Peter (the Pope). It also permitted the
Latin liturgical rites
to use vernacular languages as well as
Latin
during
Mass
and other sacraments. [ 411 ]
Christian unity
became a greater priority. [ 412 ]
In addition to finding more common ground with the various Protestant denominations, the Catholic Church has reopened discussions regarding the possibility of reconciliation between the Eastern Orthodox churches and the Catholic Church. [ 413 ]
Changes to old rites and ceremonies following Vatican II produced a variety of responses. Although most Catholics "accepted the changes more or less gracefully", some stopped going to church and others tried to preserve what they perceived to be the "true precepts of the Church". [ 414 ]
The latter form the basis of today's
Traditionalist Catholic
groups, which believe that the reforms of Vatican II have gone too far.
Liberal
Catholics form another dissenting group, and feel that the Vatican II reforms did not go far enough. The liberal views of theologians such as
Hans Küng , and
Charles Curran , led to Church withdrawal of their authorization to teach as Catholics. [ 415 ]
In the 1960s, growing social awareness and politicization in the Church in Latin America gave birth to
liberation theology , a movement often identified with
Gustavo Gutiérrez
who was pivotal in expounding the melding of
Marxism
and
Catholic social teaching . A cornerstone of the Liberation Theology were
ecclesial base communities , groups uniting clergy and laity in social and political action. Although the movement garnered some support among Latin American bishops, it was never officially endorsed by any of the Latin American Bishops’ Conferences. At the 1979 Conference of Latin American Bishops in Puebla, Mexico, Pope John Paul II and conservative bishops attending the conference attempted to rein in the more radical elements of liberation theology; however, the conference did make a formal commitment to a "preferential option for the poor". [ 416 ]
Archbishop
Óscar Romero , a supporter of the movement, became the region's most famous contemporary martyr in 1980, when he was murdered by forces allied with the government of El Salvador while saying Mass. [ 417 ]
In
Managua ,
Nicaragua , Pope John Paul II criticized elements of Liberation Theology and the Nicaraguan Catholic clergy's involvement in the
Sandinista National Liberation Front . Both
Pope John Paul II
and
Pope Benedict XVI
(as Cardinal Ratzinger) have denounced the movement. [ 418 ]
Pope John Paul II maintained that the Church, in its efforts to champion the poor, should not do so by advocating violence or engaging in partisan politics. [ 419 ]
Liberation Theology is still alive in Latin America today, although the Church now faces the challenge of Pentecostal revival in much of the region. [ 418 ]
The
sexual revolution
of the 1960s precipitated
Pope Paul VI 's 1968 encyclical
Humanae Vitae
(On Human Life)
which rejected the use of
contraception , including
sterilization , claiming these work against the intimate relationship and moral order of husband and wife by directly opposing God's will. [ 420 ]
It approved
Natural Family Planning
as a legitimate means to limit family size. [ 420 ]
Abortion
was condemned by the Church as early as the first century, again in the fourteenth century and again in 1995 with Pope John Paul II's encyclical
Evangelium Vitae
(Gospel of Life) . [ 421 ]
This encyclical condemned the " culture of death " which the pope often used to describe the societal embrace of
contraception ,
abortion ,
euthanasia ,
suicide ,
capital punishment , and
genocide . [ 421 ] [ 422 ]
The Church's rejection of the use of
condoms
has provoked criticism, especially with respect to countries where the incidence of
AIDS
and
HIV
has reached epidemic proportions. The Church maintains that in countries like Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged alongside condom use, greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in those countries solely promoting condoms. [ 423 ] [ 424 ]
Feminists
disagreed with these and other Church teachings and, with a coalition of American nuns, called on the Church to consider the
ordination of women . [ 425 ]
They stated that many Church documents contained anti-female prejudice and studies were conducted to discover how this may have developed as it was deemed contrary to the openness of Jesus. [ 425 ]
These events led Pope John Paul II to issue the 1988 apostolic letter
Mulieris Dignitatem
(On the Dignity of Women) , which declared that women had a different, yet equally important role in the Church. [ 426 ] [ 427 ]
In 1994 the apostolic letter
Ordinatio Sacerdotalis
(On Ordination to the Priesthood)
further explained that the Church follows the example of Jesus, who chose only men for the specific priestly duty. [ 182 ] [ 428 ] [ 429 ]
The documents of the Second Vatican Council expressed a new attitude of openness in the Catholic Church toward non-Catholics including Protestant, and Orthodox Christians as well as non-Christians including members of the Jewish faith and Muslims. In the years since, major ecumenical projects have been undertaken with these major religious groups to improve relationships and establish areas of theological agreement and practical cooperation.
Since the end of the twentieth century,
sex abuse by Catholic clergy
has been the subject of media coverage, legal action, and public debate in
Australia ,
Ireland
and the
United States . [ 430 ]
Present
World Youth Day
is a Catholic international youth event initiated by Pope John Paul II.
The Pope remains an international leader who regularly receives heads of state from around the world. As the head of the
Holy See , he occasionally addresses the United Nations where the Holy See is the only
non-member observer state
with all the rights of full membership except voting. [ 431 ]
The 2005 election of
Pope Benedict XVI
saw a continuation of the policies of his predecessors. His first encyclical
Deus Caritas Est
(God is Love)
discussed the various forms of
love
and re-emphasized marriage and the centrality of
charity
to the Church's mission. [ 59 ]
Following outcry from Muslims over Pope Benedict's
Regensburg address , in which he quoted a Byzantine emperor's remarks critical of Islam, a May 2008 summit between the pope and a delegation of Muslims came to an agreement that religion is essentially non-violent, and that violence can be justified neither by reason nor by faith. [ 432 ]
In October 2009, the Vatican announced the creation of new ecclesiastical structures to receive
Anglican
converts to the Catholic Church. [ 433 ] [ 434 ]
The Church also sponsors the
Pontifical Academy of Sciences , which provides the Pope with information on scientific matters [ 231 ]
and whose international membership includes British physicist
Stephen Hawking
and
Nobel laureates
such as U.S. physicist
Charles Hard Townes . In politics, the Church actively encourages support for candidates who would "protect human life, promote family life, pursue social justice, and practice solidarity" which translate into support for traditional views of marriage, welcoming and support for the poor and immigrants, and those who would work against abortion.
