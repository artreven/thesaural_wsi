Edited by Will Shortz
This Sunday’s delightful acrostic draws a quotation from

by David Feldman, the sixth in a series of " Imponderables"
books by Feldman.
Most questions in this volume have been posed by readers of the previous volumes, and the author asks his reading public to submit questions for future books. Experts in the various fields are either quoted or paraphrased in the answer along with commentary from the author. The final section of the book is devoted to Frustables unanswerable "imponderables") -- new, updated, and those that "will not die."
The index is thorough and useful; however, reference librarians would find a cumulative index extremely helpful. (unanswerable "imponderables")-- new, updated, and those that "will not die."
