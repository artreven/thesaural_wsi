Epiphany
(feeling)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
This article is about the feeling. For
the feast day, see
Epiphany (holiday) .
An
epiphany
(from the
ancient Greek
ἐπιφάνεια,
epiphaneia , " man ifestation, striking
appearance") is the sudden realization or comprehension of the (larger)
essence or meaning of something. The term is used in either a
philosophical
or
literal
sense to signify that the claimant has "found
the last piece of the puzzle and now sees the whole picture," or has new
information or experience, often insignificant by itself, that illuminates a
deeper or
numinous
foundational
frame of reference .
Epiphanies of sudden comprehension have also
made possible leaps in
technology
and the
sciences . Famous
epiphanies include
Archimedes ' realization of how to estimate the volume of a given
mass, which inspired him to shout " Eureka !" ("I
have found it!"). The biographies of many mathematicians and scientists
include an epiphanic episode early in the career, the ramifications of which
were worked out in detail over the following years. For example,
Albert Einstein
was
struck as a young child by being given a compass, and realizing that some unseen
force in space was making it move. An example of a flash of
holistic
understanding
in a prepared mind was
Charles Darwin 's
"hunch" (about natural selection) during
The Voyage of the
Beagle .
English
versions of the Nicene Creed in current use
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The
Nicene Creed , composed
in part and adopted at the
First Council of Nicaea
(325) and revised with additions by the
First
Council of Constantinople
(381), is a
creed
that summarises
the orthodox faith of the Christian Church and is used in the
liturgy
of most
Christian Churches. This article endeavours to give the text of
English-language translations in current liturgical use.
Other English translations are given in
scholarly works such as J.N.D. Kelly's
Early Christian Creeds
and Philip
Schaff's
Creeds of Christendom , and in prayer books of many
denominations.
1973 draft ICET text
While work by the
International
Consultation on English Texts
(ICET)
was still in progress, the Roman Catholic Church in the United States published
its English version of the Roman Missal, incorporating for the Nicene Creed the
ICET draft as it stood in 1973. This version remains in use in the United
States until late November 2011, but in other countries the Roman Catholic
Church uses (again until 26 November 2011) ICET's slightly later definitive
text, published in 1975. The points where the 1973 text differs from the later
version are here indicated in italics.
We believe in
one God,
the Father , the Almighty
maker of
heaven and earth,
of all that
is
seen
and unseen.
We believe in
one Lord, Jesus Christ,
the only
Son
of God ,
eternally
begotten of the Father,
God from God,
Light from Light,
true God from
true God,
begotten, not
made,
one
in Being
with the
Father.
Through him
all things were made.
For us men
and for our
salvation
he came down
from
heaven
by the power
of the
Holy Spirit
he
was
born of
the
Virgin Mary , and
became
man.
For our sake
he was
crucified
under
Pontius
Pilate ;
he
suffered,
died,
and was buried.
On the third
day he
rose again
in
fulfillment
of
the
Scriptures ;
he
ascended into heaven
and is seated
at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again
in glory to
judge
the living and the dead,
and his
kingdom will have no end.

the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of Life,
who proceeds
from the Father and the Son.
With the
Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.
He has spoken

Church .

sins .
We look for
the
resurrection of the dead ,
and the life
of the
world to come .
Amen .
"Of one Being with the Father"
(1975) replaced "one in Being with the Father" (1973), which, when
spoken, could be confused with "one, in being with the Father".
"He became incarnate from the Virgin
Mary, and was made man" (1975) replaced "He was born of the Virgin
Mary, and became man" (1973): neither Greek "σαρκωθέντα" nor
Latin "incarnatus" means "born", and the 1973 text linked
hominization ("became man") with birth ("he was born").
"He suffered death and was buried"
(1975) replaced "he suffered, died, and was buried" (1973):
"παθόντα" in Greek and "passus" in Latin are indicative of
a suffering demise; but the 1973 draft inserted an extra verb,
"died", not present in the original Greek or Latin.
Observation on the 1988
version
"For us men and for our salvation" has
been the usual translation of "δι' ἡμᾶς τοὺς ἀνθρώπους καὶ διὰ τὴν ἡμετέραν
σωτηρίαν". The 1988 ELLC ecumenical version omits the word
"men", corresponding to "τοὺς ἀνθρώπους". Instead of simply
omitting the word "men", some replace it with the word
"all", equivalent to replacing "τοὺς ἀνθρώπους" with
"πάντας".
In the original Greek text, "τοὺς
ἀνθρώπους" (tous anthropous), usually translated as "men", is
unambiguous, since "ἄνθρωποι" (anthropoi) means human beings, while
"ἄνδρες" (andres) means male human beings, as opposed to
"γυναῖκες" (gynaikes), female human beings.
Reduction of the phrase "for us
men" to "for us" or "for us all" has been criticized
as ambiguous and capable of being understood to refer merely to the members of
the congregation reciting the creed. Omission of the word "men" is
felt to be in harmony with the notion of
limited atonement , as
opposed to that of universal atonement seen as implicit in the phrase when
translated with the word "men" (understood in the inclusive sense of
this word).
The 1988 ecumenical version also renders
"ἐνανθρωπήσαντα" (for which the usual and more literal translation is
"was made man" or "became man") as "became truly
human", avoiding again the word "man".
Rapture
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
For other meanings, see
Rapture (disambiguation) . In
Christian
eschatology ,
the
Rapture
is a reference to "being caught up" referred to in
1 Thess 4:17 ,
when, in the
End Times , the
Christians
of the world will be gathered together in the air to meet
Jesus
Christ . Rapture is used in at least two senses, in the
sense of
pre-tribulation
views in which a group of people will be "left behind" and as a
synonym for the
Resurrection
generally There are many views among Christians regarding the timing of
Christ's return
(including whether it will occur in one event or two), and various views
regarding the destination of the aerial gathering described in 1 Thessalonians
4. Some denominations, such as Catholics (as described in the Catechism of the
Catholic Church 676 and 677) and Orthodox, do not accept the doctrine at all,
but affirm the resurrection as the catching away. It was largely developed by
Americans from the 17th century to the present, with certain Roman Catholics
fostering before, as described in the Doctrinal History section below.
Second
Coming of Christ
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
"Second Coming" redirects
here. For other uses, see
Second Coming (disambiguation ) . The
Second Coming of Christ , the
Second Advent , or the
Parousia ,
is the anticipated return of
Jesus
from
Heaven
to
Earth .
This prophecy is found in the
canonical
gospels
and is part of most
Christian eschatologies .
Christians generally believe the anticipated event is predicted in
Biblical Messianic prophecy .
Views about the nature of Jesus' Second Coming vary among
Christian denominations
and sometimes among individual Christians within these denominations. For
example, in most
English
versions of the Nicene Creed in current use
is the phrase:
"He [Jesus (He is us)] will come again in glory to
judge
the living and the dead , and
his
kingdom
will have no end. ... We look for the
resurrection of the dead ,
and the life of the
world to come .
Amen ."
World
to Come
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
(Redirected from
World to come )
World to Come
is a religious
eschatological
phrase
reflecting the belief that the "current world" is flawed or
cursed
and will be replaced in the future by a better world. The concept is similar to
the concept of
Heaven ,
but
Heaven
is another place outside of the
world .
Dispensation
of the fulness of times
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
For other uses, see
Dispensation
(disambiguation) .
In
Christianity , the
dispensation
(or administration) of the fulness of times
is thought to be a world order
or administration in which the heavens and the earth are under the political and/or
spiritual government of
Jesus . The phrase is derived from a passage in
Ephesians
1:10 ( KJV ), which reads: "That in the dispensation of the fulness of times
he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven,
and which are on earth; even in him."
The term "fulness of times" was
designated as a specific period of time by a variety of theologians and pastors
in the 19th century and early 20th century.
Jonathan
Edwards
equated the term with the eternal state.
Charles Taze Russell
(1852–1916) considered the fulness of times to
consist of the
millennial age
as well as the
"ages to come" .
George Soltau, a
dispensationalist , placed the "dispensation of the fulness of
times" after the millennial age.
John Nelson Darby
held a formidable body of doctrine on the subject of
the biblical significance of the dispensation of the fulness of times. Darby's
literal translation of
Ephesians
1:10 is: "Having made known unto us the mystery
of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself
for the administration of the fulness of times, [namely] to head up all things
in Christ, the things in heaven and the things on earth, in Him in whom also we
have an inheritance," (from
Darby Bible ).
According to some
postmillennialists ,
the dispensation of the fullness of times is thought to take place
prior
to the
Second Coming
of Jesus. For example, in the
Latter Day Saint
movement , the dispensation of the
fulness of times is often interpreted as the era after which the
Church
of Christ
is said to have been
restored to the earth by the religion's founder
Joseph Smith, Jr.
beginning in the
1820s . In this sense,
the "dispensation" refers to the administration of truth and/or
priesthood
by the Church and its leaders, guided by
revelation .
Son of man
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
(Redirected from
Son of Man )
For other uses, see
Son of man
(disambiguation) .
The phrase ' son of man'
is a primarily
Semitic
idiom
that originated in Ancient
Mesopotamia , used to
denote humanity or self. The phrase is also used in
Judaism
and
Christianity . The
phrase used in the Greek, translated as Son of man is
ὁ υἱὸς τοὺ ἀνθρώπου .
As an idiom for the future human, it can be translated gender-neutrally as
offspring of Mankind, or Man's child.
Definition
Substance :
the creator of all life /seed / semen
(Hebrews10:34 “KJV”
a greater and more enduring
substance )
The original
Greek version of the New Testament ( Novum Testamentum
Graece )
uses the term
parousia (παρουσία from the Greek literal meaning of parousia: divine presence,
derived from "para": beside, beyond, and "ousia":
substance ) the
"appearance and subsequent presence with" (in the ancient world
referring to official visits by royalty or God).
The Second Coming is also referred to as the Second
Advent, from the Latin term " adventus " ,
for " Coming "
(Come-ing). The study of biblical last days comprise a body of theological
knowledge called Christian eschatology.
Matter is a
term that traditionally refers to the
substance (semen) that all life is made of,
though
Aristotelian hylomorphism holds that matter is not necessarily a material
category. The common way to identify this " substance " is through its physical properties;
a common definition of matter is anything that has mass and occupies a volume.
However, this definition has to be revised in light of quantum mechanics, where
the concept of "having mass" and "occupying space" are not
as well-defined as in everyday life. A more general view is that bodies are
made of several
substances
, and the properties of matter (including mass and volume) are determined not
only by the substances themselves, but by how they interact. In other words,
matter is made up of interacting "building blocks"( His/his semen the creator of all
life ), the so-called particulate theory of matter.

Sacred semen:
In societies, it’s revered because it is believed to be magical. It is
also widely believed to be of supernatural origin and is, as a result,
considered sacred. Semen is currently and has long been revered by traditions as
a very important constituent of human physiology.
