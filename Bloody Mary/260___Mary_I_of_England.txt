Digging up Mona Lisa
This is a little weird. In order to determine once and for all the identity of the model for the
Mona Lisa , an art historian in Italy
is going to dig up the remains
of a woman who died almost 500 years ago.
Lisa Gherardini was the wife of a wealthy silk merchant. She died in 1542—her death certificate was recently discovered—and now they believe her remains are interred at a convent in Florence. I guess a lot of people think she might have been the model for Da Vinci’s famous painting.
I, like many people, am curious about the identity of the
Mona Lisa , but I’m not sure we should be digging up 500-year-old ladies to find out. The art historian, Silvano Vinceti, will be exhuming Lisa Gherardini’s remains, extracting DNA from her skull, and then using it to “rebuild her face.” From there he hopes to confirm that this noblewoman was the model for the
Mona Lisa .
I don’t know, I think I’d rather keep it a mystery. The
Mona Lisa , of course, is on display at the Louvre in
Paris . I’ve seen it. It’s very cool. It’s one of those things that, when you look at it, really does seem to give off some kind of mysterious power. I think some of that magic might be lost if we confirm that it's Lisa from 1542 based on a rebuilt face modeled on DNA extracted from her skull.

Rebuilding in Japan
Of course there’s been a lot of tough news from Japan the past few weeks since the earthquake. So I was happy when a coworker of mine passed along this
optimistic story
from last week.
The story is about a stretch of the Great Kanto Highway in Naka, Japan. The road was destroyed by the quake—as you can see from the “before” photos, it was severely cracked and damaged. I’m not a highway construction expert, but I would think such extensive damage would take a very long time to fix.
Amazingly, crews from a Japanese highway repair company were able to fix the road in just six days. News of the feat made its rounds in the online news media, and it’s easy to see why. The quick reconstruction is an amazing display of Japan’s resiliency and determination (not to mention efficiency), and it’s a welcome positive symbol of the country’s rebuilding process after the tragedy.
Of course, it will take a long time for things to get all the way back to normal in Japan. I’m pulling for as speedy a recovery as possible, and so are the folks at EF College Break. Japan is always a favorite for EFCB travelers—I know they can’t wait to get back there.

Trafalgar Square’s fourth plinth
I suppose it may be boring to blog about a slab of stone, but there’s something about the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square that I find interesting.
A plinth, for those who don’t know (I had to look it up), is a heavy base that supports a statue. Trafalgar Square in London has four plinths. Three of the plinths support permanent statues of national heroes. The fourth plinth is empty. So it has become famous in its own right. It even has its own
Wikipedia page .
The fourth plinth was originally supposed to have an equestrian statue of William IV on it, but they ran out of money, so the plinth stayed empty. Eventually (a little more than a decade ago), they decided that the fourth plinth would display an ever-changing series of modern art works. I think this is a great idea. It’s like the other three plinths are honoring the past, while the fourth plinth always has an eye to the present and future. Right now it has a big ship in a bottle.
This week
they announced the sculptures
that will be up on the fourth plinth in 2012 and 2013. In 2012 it will be a statue of a boy on a rocking horse. And in 2013 it will be a large blue
cockerel
(otherwise known as a cock, which has been giving people all over the world the chance to crack jokes).
Anyone taking a
trip to London
will surely visit Trafalgar Square, a hugely popular meeting place right in the heart of the city. Be sure to check out the fourth plinth.

UNESCO’s favorite intangibles
Last week
UNESCO
released its latest “intangible cultural heritage” list. I hadn’t heard of this specific list—I knew about
UNESCO World Heritage sites , but I had never heard of the “intangible” list. Basically it recognizes the treasured traditions, customs, foods, dances, etc., from cultures around the world. All told, 46 items from 11 countries were added to the list.
I like this list. I like it because it includes weird things like oil wrestling in Turkey, scissor-dancing in Peru, and falconry. I also like that it includes extremely general things like French dining and Mediterranean diet.
A couple of Spanish items also caught my eye. One, the Flamenco, pleased me because I like the Flamenco, have seen a Flamenco show in Seville, and have written about Flamenco shows for
EF College Break . Another, Catalonian human towers (or
castells ), is close to my heart because I’ve
blogged
about them and because I think it's one of the more unique traditions I’ve heard of.
I also like this list because of what it represents in terms of travel. How it’s about more than just seeing sights and landmarks. Don’t get me wrong, I love seeing famous monuments as much as the next guy. But my favorite thing about travel is the cultures. It’s the people, the foods, the shows, the art, the festivals. When I go to Spain, for example, I don’t just want to see the palaces and cathedrals. I want to see Flamenco and people building giant towers out of themselves.
It’s nice to see UNESCO giving these things their due.
Here's the list .

Lady Gaga wax dummies around the world
Get excited, Lady Gaga fans. The flamboyant superstar singer will soon be the subject of the
biggest wax figure launch
in the history of Madame Tussaud’s famous wax sculpture empire.
Eight lucky cities will have the honor of hosting a wax Gaga. Happily, all five of the international destinations are on
EF College Break trips , so you can get out there and see the masterpieces for yourself in London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Shanghai or Hong Kong.
Madame Tussaud’s
in London is the world’s most famous wax museum and a personal favorite of mine. Some might roll their eyes at the idea of a wax museum. Some might think it’s boring to look at wax sculptures. Not me. I can't get enough Madame Tussaud’s. I fell in love with it on a trip to London as a kid, when my young mind was blown by the incredible realism of the sculptures, especially Eddie Murphy. It’s truly unbelievable how realistic many of the dummies look. I don’t know how they do it. It’s something you have to see to believe. I proudly recommend a visit to Madame Tussaud’s.
As for Lady Gaga, she was chosen because of her popularity, and, more importantly, because of her elaborate and outlandish outfits, which will be featured in the displays around the world. Included will be her latex body suit with Minnie Mouse buns, as well as her lace body stocking/face mask/Marie Antoinette wig ensemble. Her dress made from raw meat will not be featured.

JR’s prize-winning street art around the world
If you’re traveling anywhere in the world, keep your eyes open for giant works of art plastered on the sides of buildings. It could be another masterpiece of the mysterious French street artist/photographer
known as JR . This week JR won the TED prize. If you, like me, don’t know what the TED prize is, it’s an annual award given by TED (Technology Entertainment and Design). The group gives $100,000 to someone they think has changed the world and will continue to do so. JR’s world-changing art has been on display all over the globe—everywhere from Brazil to Kenya to Israel to Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and many more. Have you ever seen it? I don’t know if I have. I don’t know if I’d heard of JR before today. I hope to see some of his works some day during my travels. I love great street art, especially the large, bold eye-opening kind. And when there’s some kind of good message in there, explicit or implicit, all the better. JR's is particularly amazing.
This is
my favorite .
And
this one .
Here,
check out the whole gallery . Now let's go out and travel and see some of his handiwork first-hand.

Paris’s new fizzy fountain
It’s important to drink plenty of water while you travel, and in today’s environmentally conscious world, I’m happy to see that the city of Paris has taken a step to cut down on plastic water bottle consumption: they’ve installed the country’s first
fizzy water fountain . Sparkling water
is popular in Europe, and especially in France. I have to say, I was never a sparkling water person before, but when I lived in Prague I got into it. Not only does it hydrate (like regular water), but the bubbles are also good for the digestive system. Plus, sparkling water feels somehow more substantial than regular water. It’s like an actual drink. Anyway, Paris’s new fizzy water fountain was unveiled last week in one of the city’s many parks (for some reason, the articles don’t say which one). By all accounts, it has been received with great enthusiasm by the Parisians. As I said, the French love their sparkling water, and this stuff’s free. I am sure this is probably the first of many fizzy water fountains in Paris. If you'll be visiting Paris in the future, you're in luck. And, if you really don’t like the fizz, don't worry, there's also regular tap water at every fountain. Stay hydrated, everyone.

Thai senators do some kickboxing in Bangkok
I wish our senators did this.
In Bangkok, two Thai senators
went two rounds in a Thai kickboxing match
in an effort to promote the sport internationally. Fifty-nine-year-old Payap Tongchuen fought against Direk Tungfang (64 years old) in a boxing ring set up in front of the Thai parliament building. The referee declared the match a draw, but spectators thought Direk was the better fighter.
Thai kickboxing (known as Muay Thai) is the national sport of Thailand, and it’s gaining popularity around the world. Though I have never Thai kickboxed myself, I did write about it once for the EF College Break
Eye on Bangkok newsletter , so the sport has a special place in my heart. (I also loved Jean-Claude Van Damme in
Kickboxer .)
Muay Thai is known as the Art of Eight Limbs, because competitors can use their hands, shins, elbows, and knees (two of each). In Bangkok, there are several places to catch a match in person, the most well-known being Ratchadamnoen and Lumphini Stadiums. Sounds to me like a great way to spend some free time—I like sports and I like culture, so when I’m in another country I always like to attend a local sporting event. After a lively introduction, live music, and the placing of bets, the match begins, and opponents try to knock each other out by punching, elbowing, kicking, kneeing and foot-thrusting.
In Monday’s senatorial showdown at the parliament building, there was no knockout. But judging by the fact that I’m writing this and you’re reading it, it seems the senators’ plan was a success. We are indeed spreading the word about Thai’s national sport.

Venice’s first female gondolier
Venice will have its
first-ever female gondolier . Every official gondolier in Venice (the people in white-and-blue striped shirts and black pants who row tourists through the canals) must belong to the gondoliers’ guild. And now, 24-year-old Giorgia Boscolo will be the first woman to have the honor. Congrats to her.
Yes, it seems a little late in coming (men have dominated the gondolier profession for about 900 years), but, as Venice mayor Giorgio Orsoni says, this will undoubtedly open the door for many more female gondoliers to come (the mayor phrases it much more poetically than me: “other women will pick up the coveted oar of a gondola.”)
Back in olden times, the traditional profession of gondolier would be passed down from father to son. These days, however, anyone can go through the very specific schooling program in an attempt to land the job.
Prospective rowers must go through very intense training and exams. They have to spend hundreds of hours on the canals learning how to steer the classic banana-shaped boats. They also have to take several practical and written tests to prove their knowledge of the canal system and the city’s landmarks, as well as sailing laws and the English language. Only the best of the best get the chance to be an official gondolier.
I’m happy for Giorgia. She says her love of gondolas goes back to her childhood days, floating on the canals with her father, who is a retired gondolier. She has always dreamed of one day holding the job herself. Now she will. It’s always nice to see a life’s dream fulfilled. Especially when that life's dream looks
like this .

Ad for London Dungeon is too horrifying
I thought
this story
from London was pretty funny. A digital poster ad for the
London Dungeon
had to be taken down because it was too terrifying for children.
The digital ad, which was posted in Tube stations and trains, showed a standard portrait of the 16th-century English Queen, Queen Mary I, otherwise known as
Bloody Mary . After a few moments, the Queen suddenly changed into a flesh-eating zombie.
Apparently, the zombie caused many young children to freak out. So, Britain’s official Advertising Standards Authority ordered the ad’s removal. I especially enjoyed this part of the agency’s official explanation for banning the ad: "We also considered that when the face morphed into the scary character, the bloody gashes, white flesh, rotting teeth, red eyes and the threatening expression meant it was not suitable for young children to see.”
Fair point.
While the ad may be too much for little children, I have only good things to say about the London Dungeon itself. I’ve had good times there. You wander through spooky medieval London, looking at ghastly tableaus of torture, mayhem and horror. Scary sound effects and background noise add to the ghoulish atmosphere.
I have a real affinity for tableaus (my favorite ride at Disneyworld is Pirates of the Caribbean). And it looks like they’ve added some new features to the London Dungeon since I was there a few years back. They now have a Drop Ride to Doom, a Boat Ride to Hell, and the new Bloody Mary attraction. And they still have the old faithfuls like Jack the Ripper and Sweeney Todd.
Some people might tell you the London Dungeon is stupid. But those people are just scared.
