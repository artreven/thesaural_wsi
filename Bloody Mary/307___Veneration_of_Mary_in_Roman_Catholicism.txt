Nuestra Senora de Guia
Posted on
March 14, 2012
by
Reynaldo de Leon
The statue of
Nuestra Senora de Guia   or “Our Lady of Guidance” is the oldest among all those venerated Marian image in the Philippines.
The image of the Our Lady is similar as to the image of the Nuestra Senora de Antipolo, which the Our Lady of Good Voyage.
On May 19 1571 (Saturday), Miguel Lopez de Legaspi envade  Manila in honor of the King of Spain, Felipe II. On this occasion one of his soldiers roamed places and reached as far as the seashore (now the site of the Ermita Church) and witnessed the natives pagan worship to a beautiful statue of the Virgin Mary placed on top of trunk surrounded by pandan. From that day, according to Anales dela Cathedral de Manila, the Virgen de Guia began to shed the rays of charity i never so many miracles which she wrought in behalf of the people especially the navigators. It is in this light that she was given the title Guia (guide).

Saint Jude Thaddeus the Apostle
Posted on
March 10, 2012
by
Reynaldo de Leon
Jude Thaddeus
was the brother of another apostle, St. James the Less and he is the “mystery” apostle because he’s the one the synoptic gospels disagree on. Mark and some versions of
Matthew
list him as Thaddeus; some versions of Matthew list him as
Lebbeus ; some versions of Matthew list him as Judas the Zealot; Luke lists him as
Judas, son of James.
Saint Jude is the
Patron Saint of the Hopeless . Many
Filipinos
prayed for him.   His novena day is every Thursday.

San Vicente Ferrer
Posted on
March 8, 2012
by
Reynaldo de Leon
Roman Catholic Saint. St. Vincent Ferrer was a Dominican priest and missionary. He was a celebrated preacher who converted thousands of people to Christianity during his various tours across Europe. One of his many converts was a rabbi, who later became a Catholic bishop. St. Vincent was an advisor to both the King of Aragon and Pope Benedict XIII. He was often followed by large crowds of penitents, which often numbered in the thousands. Although greatly admired by many people, St. Vincent continued to observe an austere life of prayer and fasting. He was considered to be a miracle worker, and was reported to have the gift of speaking in tongues. He is the patron saint of all builders, including construction workers, tile makers, plumbers and pavement workers. In the 1450s, St. Vincent Ferrer was canonized by Pope Calixtus III.
