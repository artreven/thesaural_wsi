The Possession (2012)
Tweet
At first, I wasn't excited for this movie, I am trying to convince myself that laugh hard as possible in this movie. But at the end I think this movie is one of the outstanding as in horrific ever since year 2011/2010, it can say that it is better than 'Paranormal Activity', 'The Devil Inside' and more. Thanks to
Nuffnang

Sadako 3D (2012)
Tweet
Have you watched Ring (1998) or The Ring (2002)? Sadako 3D (2012) is talking about Sadako Yamamura itself in this movie, so the storyline is totally different than 2 previous movie I mention about. I'm going to post some spoiler in this post, so you cant avoid reading these spoiler.
Ai Hashimoto as Sadako, well . . . this Sadako in this movie looks kinda 'hot' eh? Indeed she got the chill look but I would think that she is too chubby to become Sadako LOL! She only appear at the end of the movie while she is trying to possess Akane body.

Katy Perry: Part of Me (2012)
Tweet
Hello all! Just finish watching Katy Perry: Part of Me just now at GSC One Utama. This movie tell you that: what kind of family background she have, what she encounter in her relationship, her tight schedule on her tour concert in year 2011 and more. Some fans out there may expect a karaoke style of Katy Perry movie, but it is not musical enough. What I like about this movie is all about her, it makes me want to hear more songs from her (because I missed some of her song). What I dislike is . . . the stage performance will split up and slot her own story right middle of the song.
Katy Perry herself in this movie, without make-up. She still looks gorgeous :) One of the major reason to watch this movie is you get to see the detail of her personal life or what she did before she went up the stage and perform.
This is the stage that will always show up in this Katy Perry: Part of Me movie, and I was expecting that the fireworks would just burst off from . . . If you watch the MTV, you will know what I mean right? LOL!
My rating would be 6/10, it is a fine movie. I am more fancy towards action and Sci-Fi movie, not on musical . . . At least this Katy Perry movie got some excitement over there! If you ask me to watch musical movie such as Phantom of the Opera (2004), I would fall asleep LOL (Maybe I was too tired that time)! Fans of Katy Perry are encourage to watch this movie too!
Thanks for reading, by Kian Fai.

Hungry Ghost Festival - Highland Towers Incident
Tweet
Source:
Link
Source:
Link
Date: 11, 12, 1993.  Time: 11.30am +/-
Highland Towers got 12 years history, without any warning, "Block A" collapse with no reason. With the fall of Block A, people who staying in Block B and C need to evacuate and move out immediately. Rescue team discover 48 dead bodies cum with 30bags of human flesh.
Inside the tower, some people discover that there is many rice box contain foods for the prayers to the lost soul. Most the the food eaten by stray dogs, and Block B & C entrance got the container for burning hell note. To get the prove, newspaper reporter ready to go pay a "visit", luckily that day they went is raining and the atmosphere is darker than normal day. Block B & C is being abandon for long time and it becomes more creepy and ever.
(I hope you get the meaning of it, translated from the video link below)
Source:
Link
Before I post my opinion over here, I would like to pray for the victims.
I was wondering, what is so special about Highland Towers. Because I see people from forum listed this place as one of the famous HAUNTED place that must visit. I thought Highland Towers it is just a tower, it is actually 2 apartments which is haven't collapse yet ever since the "Block A" collapse without any warning. And I thought Highland Towers is at Genting Highland, silly me . . .
Not only this incident happen on Highland Towers (I strongly believe that the cause of Highland Towers collapse is relate towards landslide + the land is not firm enough to handle the BALANCE of Highland Towers), there is few landslide happening on year 1999, 2002, 2006 and year 2008! Feel free to read her
post
and understand more about.
People who with weak heart but really wanted to visit this place, I suggest you to read more article about haunted location via online, don't risk your own life.
Thanks for reading, by Kian Fai.

Hungry Ghost Festival - Mirror
Tweet
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest among us all? - Evil Queen from Snow White.
Mirror is one of the famous object that people use to play with it, in Movie, Stories, Horror Elements and etc. Since my post is related to Horror, I would try to make it fast and short and do my best to extend the horror as far as I can.
Personally I dislike to see the mirror for more than 10seconds, unless I need to squeeze out my pimples from my face. Because I would think that my reflection will change while I still standing still right in front of the mirror. Actually it would not be that easy to see your reflection change right after 10seconds or something, unless you are so unfortunate that you got curse by some anonymous, such as some dirty stuff follow you go everywhere that you go.
Have you ever heard some theory? Twelve a.m. on the midnight, put 2 candles and lit it, then slice apple in front of the mirror. The skin of the mirror must not break it, what you will saw from the mirror is a spectra appeared and show you your future "partner". I try to google again in Chinese version, the result is show up the ghost face that stay inside the mirror. Just . . . don't try to do it ok? Because the result is the same, you will get freak out by it.
There is another story . . . don't bother to try it, just google:
Bloody Mary . What I found out from Wiki, they stated the same source that what I typed on previous paragraph.
I hate looking at the car mirror while I was driving, the car mirror that show backseat/back view of the car. I got good imagination, so I will think something silly instead of something creative. I also hate looking at the monitor reflection while I switch off my monitor, luckily my 1 years old monitor is matt surface, else I will cry myself a river.
Basically I think I am posting crap again in this post, to be frankly here, I am running out of idea. Because I live myself too happy and joyful, and I hope I got some real juice from my brain for the next Horror post! Stay tune buddy!
Thanks for reading, by Kian Fai.
P.S.: Please do not try it, responsible is in your own hand, not me!

The Bourne Legacy (2012)
Tweet
The Bourne Legacy is the fourth movie of Bourne Series, the only different between this movie and other Bourne movie series would be: no Matt Damon, talking about another agent in the secret program. Even thou you didn't watch previous Bourne movie series, I think it is alright to watch this without any hesitation.
