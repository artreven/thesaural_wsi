Incarnation   The Bible, at least in the strict technical sense of the word, never speaks or even hints of incarnation, regarding God becoming a human being.
Nor does it talk about incarnation in regards to the creation of man, as in “ensoulment.”   Incarnation is actually a quite specific term denoting a particular concept, principle, and philosophy of thought, that for the most part
is never mentioned or even alluded to throughout the Scripture
in regards to man’s creation, the Word becoming flesh, and our future resurrection/transformation. Language matters.
Words matter.
I believe the proper Biblical philosophy is
transformation
rather than incarnation.
Let the reader fully understand, this is not some supercilious wrangling or quibbling about words – this goes right to the heart of the matter .
How did man
become
alive?
How did God
become
a human being?
How will redeemed man
become
incorruptible?
The answer to all three questions involves the same principle or concept.
Therefore, all three questions are of paramount close relation.
Answer any one, and you have the starting point for both of the others.
And the answer, I believe, lies in the oft portrayed biblical concept of
transformation . Let’s start where the Bible starts, “How did man
become
alive? In Genesis 2:7 the Bible says that the formed body,
man , became alive when God breathed the life force or life principle into him.
Scripturally it is called
the breath of life .
It is the same means whereby God made every air-breathing creature alive; and all air-breathing creatures share
the exact same
breath of life.
The breath of life is the non-personalized, non-individualized life force or life principle which makes organized matter
become
alive.
Scripture says the as yet
not-living
body that God formed, called
man
–with the entering of the breath of life, became a
living
body/soul/human being/person.
That is precisely, and exactly what the Bible teaches.
The Bible portrays man as a formed body that became
animated
(dynamic) by the entrance of
the breath of life
–the very gifting of life from God.
Man is therefore scripturally portrayed and understood as an animated body.   Man was a non-animated formed body that became animated.
Now, what we need to fully grasp here is what took place, exactly.
The formed as yet
not-living
body was
transformed
into a living body/soul/human being/person What we need grasp, is that the principle present, and employed by God, was one of
transformation , rather than incarnation (ensoulment).
God did not insert a soul into the body – that would have been a type of incarnation
most often referred to as ensoulment.
Rather, God
transformed
the “body” from a state of non-living
organized
matter, into a
living , breathing, human person.   Biblically, we must never forget that man is always and in all ways viewed wholistically, and cannot be separated into some kind of constituent self-sustainable parts;
man is always a
whole being:
the body-soul-person, all in one,
indivisible!   Man was
transformed
into being a living breathing human person.   Now, let’s talk about how God transformed
into being
a human being; our second question:
How did God
become
a human being?
God did become a human being:
100% fully human.
God did this without giving up being God: 100% fully God.
And this was accomplished without any mixing of the two natures.
So,
God the Son , the second personoftheGodhead (the Trinity, or better, Triunity),
became
a human being.
The Bible relates that exact history, in this precise
chalk full of meaning
fashion:
“The Word
became
flesh.” Once again, we have the same concept in play as we found in Genesis.
John 1:14 harkens directly back to the Genesis account of the creation of man.
The idea being portrayed is one of
transformation:
The Word
became
flesh.
So, what exactly is going on here?
What does it
mean
that the Word became flesh?
I think it willbeveryinstructive at this point to ask these two questions, 1.
What is the basis of God’s life? 2.
What is the basis of man’s life? In essence, we are asking what the nature of God is, and what the nature of man is.
In order to understand what took place when God
became
a human being, we must first understand what God is and what man is, in regards to their respective
natures . What is the basis of God’s life?
ANSWER:
God is Spirit What is the basis of man’s life?
ANSWER:
Man is flesh Therefore, for God to become a human being, God must become
flesh , which is exactly what the Scriptures teach.
The difference in the respective
natures
provides the key to understanding what the Bible means by saying that the Word
become
flesh.
To help us better visualize this, here are both of the above answers charted out.
Please , contemplate and study them carefully:   God God is Spirit God’s life is Spirit-based God is the Spirit-based
Creator God is Spirit, and the
nature
of God
is Spirit God’s life is the life of Spirit.     Man Man is flesh Man’s life is flesh-based Man is a flesh-based
creature Man is flesh, and the
nature
of man
is flesh Man’s life is the life of flesh   Flesh
means specifically, “living matter” (i.e., flesh, bone, blood, etc.) that an
air-breathing
organism (creature) is comprised of.
Flesh is living matter.
Flesh is living
organized matter .
Flesh is the
life-basis ofall air-breathers, including
man .
Jesus came in the flesh.   1 Timothy 3:16 New American Standard Bible (NASB) 16
By common confession, great is the mystery of godliness:    He who was revealed in the flesh,
Was vindicated in the Spirit, *****   The Godhead is comprised of three persons; three persons
in
or
of
one nature.   God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit:
three persons.
All three persons have the same
singular
nature, one nature:
Spirit.
The Trinity, or Triunity, the Godhead (the word the Scripture uses) is
three persons in
one nature:
three persons; one nature. The
Son of God
becoming a human being resulted in Jesus, who was 100% man and 100% God,
but one
person .
Jesus was one and the same person as the Son of God.
Thus Jesus was
one person, with two
natures:
one person, two natures.
The Word became flesh, God (the Son)
transformed
into flesh, the human being called Jesus.
The Word
became
flesh –without stopping being Spirit.
So, what does that mean?
Well, first off the Bible does not say anything about the Word
incarnating
into a human being.
Rather, it precisely says that the Word
transformed into
(became) flesh.
What the Bible is teaching is that the mystery of godliness –God becoming a human being is the action of the Son of God becoming a
flesh-based
person.
The Son of God had always been
alive .
The Son of God had always been a
person .
But, in the Son of God
becoming
a human being, the Son of God became
flesh-based
(as well as retaining His Spirit-based
nature , too).
And that is the mystery.
The Word of God
transformed
into a
flesh-based
human being without stopping being the Word of God, Spirit.
The concept and principle being portrayed is
transformation , not incarnation. Let us now examine the third question:
How will redeemed man
become
incorruptible? The life for a
believer
is a life of
transformation .
From start to finish we are being
transformed .
We were, in being saved,
transformed
from the dead to the living.
We were dead and “became
alive,”
as in spiritually quickened (another kind of transformation) by regeneration.
Throughout our walk of faith, the Scripture tells uswearebeing continually
transformed
by the Holy Spirit into the image and likeness of Jesus, the Christ.   2 Corinthians 3:18 New American Standard Bible (NASB) 18
But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being
transformed
into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.   Proceeding to our final area of inquiry, we find that for every
true believer , the resurrection is also –a
transformation:
the transformation from corruptibility to incorruptibility. Resurrection literally means to stand erect, again.
This standing erect is the Bible’s way of establishing real world
rubber meets the road
observable de facto evidence of living again.
Man is resurrected to a state of living, again.
Man lives, breathes, and moves, again.
Resurrection for
true believers
proceeds in this fashion:
Reformation
= the lifeless body is to be fully
re-formed,
again
Reanimation
= the re-formed body is sparked to life, again
Resurrection
= to stand and walk, again; to come forth
alive , again Transformation
= the newly resurrected life
becomes
incorruptible                                          a
resurrected living body/soul human being/person   …transforms
into incorruptibility   Every
true believer
will be
transformed
from corruptibility and susceptibility to inevitable death,
into:
incorruptibility.
We will
become
incorruptible and enjoy immortal and eternal life.
The process in that event doesn’t, in even the slightest way, hint of any kind of incarnation as the effective means, but rather
bespeaksinvolumes
the concept and philosophy of
transformation .   Ø
Man was
transformed
into a living person …the
living
body/soul/human being/person   Ø
The Word was
transformed
into flesh …and thus became a
flesh-based
human being:
Jesus   Ø
We are being
transformed
into …the
image and likeness
of Christ   Ø
We will be
transformed
into incorruptibility …in order to live in
eternity future
with Jesus, our Lord     I believe I have fully established that the Biblical word, concept, and principle is
transformation , not incarnation.
In this season of celebration about the birth of Jesus, let us rejoice in the
transformation
of the Word into a human being, even Jesus, the Christ!     Merry Christmas       Richard Eric Gunby     Ending note: Below is an excerpt on “incarnation” from Wikipedia.
The author is using incarnation in its most general, watered down, non-descript sense.
It is well written.
And, yes, I agree, speaking in broad terms we can
symbolically
speak of
the incarnation of God
–meaning that God came to earth, or God
broke into
history, as a human being.
But, please keep in mind, that in actual point of
supranatural
fact, it was not an incarnation; it was a
transformation .     The
Incarnation
in traditional
Christianity
is the belief that
Jesus Christ
the second person of the
Trinity , also known as
God the Son
or the
Logos
(Word), "became flesh" by being conceived in the womb of a woman, the
Virgin Mary , also known as the
Theotokos
(God-bearer). The Incarnation is a fundamental
theological
teaching of
orthodox (Nicene) Christianity , based on its understanding of the
New Testament . The Incarnation represents the belief that Jesus, who is the non-created second
hypostasis
of the
triune God , took on… human… nature and became
both man and God . In the
Bible
its clearest teaching is in
John 1:14 : "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us." [1] In the Incarnation, as traditionally defined, the divine nature of the Son was joined but not mixed with human nature
[2]
in one divine Person [hypostatic union],
Jesus Christ, who was both "truly God and truly man". ________ From:

"God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit: three persons. All three persons have the same singular nature, one nature: Spirit. The Trinity, or Triunity, the Godhead (the word the Scripture uses) is
three persons in one nature:
three persons; one nature.
The Son of God becoming a human being resulted in Jesus, who was 100% man and 100% God, but one person. Jesus was one and the same person as the Son of God. Thus Jesus was
one person, with two natures:
one person, two natures. "
Here is the problem in this seemingly-logical argument:
three persons in one nature  .....     then this
one person, with two natures.
So which is it????
Moreover, if Jesus
" was 100% man and 100% God, but one person."
then how could he speak of  God as a second person saying "My Father .." or "Your Father..." in so many instances?
It is understandable if you believe in a mystery or if you make a mystery of your belief, but trying to explain is a totally wishful thinking.

ThinkAloud:   Thanks for stopping by and leaving a quality question and summation of your thoughts, reactions, and feelings to what you read and to time honored
supposedly
Biblically-based theological assertions (i.e., Trinity, dual nature of Jesus).  And thanks for reading my essay.
Yes, I do believe in the Trinity and in Jesus being God come to earth, and that he was/is fully man and fully God.
We cannot and will not ( as you ably point out ) ever COMPREHEND the Trinity, nor also the fact that Jesus had/has two natures.
The best that any "flesh-based" creature such as you or I will ever do this side of Judgment Day is to APPREHEND the outline, so to speak.  Francis Schaeffer had a nice way of putting it, that we cannot know and tell the exhaustive or comprehensive truth; but we can tell (some) true-truth; and the limited truth we tell can indeed be understood or seen as evidenced as objectively true.
So, I would offer, or make the friendly suggestion that it is
not all
"wishful thinking."   But rather, it is incomplete truth existing in a fallen, sinful world.
Also, I would ask you
to please keep in your mind
as you mull over these thoughts and reflect on these subjects, that it is the
finite creature
who is trying to APPRHEND truth about the
infinite Creator .  That is so very important to remember, I think.  Finite minds do not serve
too awesomely well
approaching infinite truth.  That is not making an excuse, my friend, that's just juggling the reality at hand.
Now, what further distinguishes Biblical revelation from all other "religions" or sacred writings, is that while God will always retain some mystery because He will always be above us (in magnitude of being) He has
none the less
given man
true-truth
in the Biblical record, and true believers from every age (I'm talking about
thinking believers ) have testified that the Biblical truth lines up with what they/we know from experiences and experience in the world.
Therefore, my intention was
to present as clear and precise an outline as I possibly could.
I am not hiding in a mystery, but I do freely acknowledge we can but repeat truth after God (thinking His thoughts after Him); or grope around in utter blindness and darkness.
I perfer the light.
p.s.=  Plese, also try to keep in mind the difference in, "what is a person?" versus, "what is one's nature?  God the Father is one person who enjoys communication with the other two distinct
persons  of the Triunity.  The three are distinct --as to personhood.  But they are one (singular), as to
nature .

Thanks for your response and kind words REG.
MY main point is this: Why create a mystery where none existed then try to explain part of it saying that no one can fully explain or understand a mystery?
There are few factual truths that no one can or would deny:
1-  When you say
"the finite creaturewho is trying to APPRHEND truth about the
infinite Creator"
you in fact are stepping into a totally delusional world. It is a given that A Created Entity can never ever be able to explain or understand its Creator other than what the Creator tells that Entity about Itself/Himself. When Thinking Believers or Theologians try to go any further in that regard they are entering forbidden territories leading to all kinds of wrong and in fact insulting ideas about that Creator.
2- Mary conceived a child while still a Virgin. Why should that lead to the assumption that the Child was a Son of God. God created Adam with no father or mother and He created Eve without a mother, so why is it a mystery for Him to create Jesus in Mary's womb without a father. It is that simple ....
3- Jesus was given a message to deliver to the people and he did as commanded by his Father. Jesus was given few powers as a gift from his "Father" to prove his authenticity as a speaker for God. He never claimed anything else. He said some statements that were misinterpreted 300 years later to mean that he was God/Son of God. Noah, Abraham, Moses and Mohammad all said similar statements clearly meant that the way to God was Through them, Through believing in them ...etc. For that to be taken to mean that they or Jesus were anything but deliverers of God's Message is a stretch that is not supported by any facts they ever uttered.
As you indicated clearly no human can ever understand the "Nature" of God. You, however, think that an
" incomplete truth existing in a fallen, sinful world"
is a valid way to apprehend the Infinite Creator. That is very very dangerous REG. Half-Truths are misleading and in fact worse than total lies.
The nature of God is and will always be beyond human understanding. All we can know is some of His attributes not His Nature. Jesus' nature, however, has no mystery in it anymore than Adam's or Eve's nature and none of the two, or anyone else, claimed to be anything other than a totally human being. So why would the third cause this kind of mystery about his nature if it was not for those who are intentionally twisting his words?.

Hmm...?  Oh well.
I miss-understood.  I thought you wanted to have a friendly and civil
dialogue .
When in reality, you simply wanted to vent your hatred of Jesus coming in the flesh and being God at one and the same time.
I thought you were genuinely searching --but no, you are just trying in desperation to hold up your own set of "I think's" as somehow awesomely significant.
I thought you were seriously comptemplating things, but your super-fast response echo's nothing but emptiness,
in my opinion .
I do not pass on "half-truths."
Do not slander me such .  A "half-truth" is something which is also  half-false .  I, rather, simply as best as I can, repeat the Bible's true-truths.  If you choose to not believe
them , that's your choice.  That's fine.  Be happy.
Though I do feel sorry for you ...( even as I am sure
you would be tempted to voice similar regarding me in some kind of touche move. )
Don't.
Peace.
Have a fine life.
No need to respond.

"I miss-understood. I thought you wanted to have a friendly and civil dialogue"
I definitely can also say that!!!
Why is the angry and dismissive response?
I have nothing regarding Jesus other than Great respect and Love for what he delivered. I merely stated few facts that even you could not challenge since they all are a given historical and scriptural facts.
I also, did not intend to "slander" you, or anyone else for that matter, regarding "half-truth". May be i should have used "incomplete truth" instead, but that is what i meant to say. Half-truth in no way also means, by necessity, "half-false", the same as "incomplete truth".
It is a shame that when it comes to a critical point in an argument, some decide to hide behind imaginary "hatred" or "insults" where none existed.

imo- As individuals we learn, discover, realize, etc. at different rates, times, etc.
Some people can deep study and come to a realization of a big picture through the words, understanding, philosophy, etc.........and others can come to a realization of a big picture simply by faith, a parallel, etc.
Void of a deep understanding or lengthy study........
a person can choose to believe by faith.  A person can parallel their life to that of the Son of God/Jesus....and say, is that possible, for Jesus to be the Father and the Son?  To always be, but yet be born?
Paralleling;
My dad was a father.  He had a son.  His son became a father.
So, is it possible for a human to be a father and a son....?  Yes
Could the son exist without the father...? No
Did the son always exist with the father....? Yes, but the son was not manifested, brought into recognition until a given point in time.
Does that make the son nonexistant....? No, it made him ...unrevealed.
Is the son a father, and part of his own father, and part of his own child....? Yes
The DNA of discovered science says, we are "made up" genetically of our fathers and we to our children.
The Bible says, God the Father and Jesus are one.....and we are His children....and we have the capability to recognize He is in us....as well as the capability to be in Him.......and to have that recognition manifested, birthed, revealed to the world, (per our own actions and proclamations), to be Sons of God.

Your last paragraph is what i exactly meant about the nature of Jesus. I have no idea if you really realize its deeper meaning. Unbiased reading of that paragraph means a simple fact i tried to explain to REG, i.e. Jesus is no different than any other human when it comes to Father/Son relationship with God. Jesus' only distinction is that he was commanded by God, THE FATHER, to deliver a message. Anything else regarding God's nature is not supported anywhere with any valid evidence and it is impossible, in principle, to even think a human can even imagine it. It is beyond our human capability and any attempt in that regard leads to confusion and misunderstanding.
Thanks Rachel for bailing out REG from his predicament

Well actually....I can grasp the understanding from the limits of a human mind....paralleling the father / son / one relationship.....while still believing there is a holy divine distinction between Jesus and any other man.
I certainly believe we all have a role to play in the big scheme of things, and while at times we may have similar roles to Jesus, that He is divinely above and beyond the measure of any other human man.  While Jesus was/is a physical example for us to TRY our best to be as He.....no man in this life will accomplish such a feat.

Indeed MM: As said above, " I do freely acknowledge we can but repeat truth after God (thinking His thoughts after Him); or grope around in utter blindness and darkness.
I perfer the light."
God help us to think His thoughts after Him.  But we have got to want to do so.  kind of like, "Study to show yourselves approved..." Has kind of a biblical ring to it, doesn't it?
Amen!
p.s.=  One thing I have learned over the years (in regards to myself, first, and others) is a large part of learning is
wanting to learn .  In example, someone not well versed in the arguments taking place in this essay
none the less
can read it and try their best;
then,
he or she can came back 3 to 6 months later (etc.)
and read it again
--and be surprised how much more you grasp it.
Then too, grab a dictionary or use
www.dictionary.com
and look up the words while thinking and trying to understand, " what the heck is he saying????"
It has been my experience in life that in order to learn we have got to want to learn.  maybe something like, "Keep on asking, Keep on searching, Keep on knocking... etc."  Hmm?  Sounds familier, doesn't it?
