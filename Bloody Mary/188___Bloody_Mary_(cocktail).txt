The Husband’s Bloody Mary or Maria Recipe

The Husband's special recipe.
I am so spoiled at home. The Husband is just the best ever. He does the laundry. He makes me fine drinks. He generally treats me like a princess! Yep, it’s a regular love-fest around here, and I’m not ashamed to say it!
For those of you who were eyeing the
Bloody Mary
from my Easter post, here’s the recipe. There’s only one problem: The Husband uses home made salsa in his, which I haven’t posted a recipe for yet. And it’s not because I’m being stingy, it’s because we haven’t perfected it yet.
We fell in love with a salsa called O-Roy-O that was made and sold here in town. The Husband and his friends said that it tasted just like the salsa from a restaurant that used to be here in
Laguna Beach : La Paz. Well, now we can’t find O-Roy-O in our stores anymore, so we resorted to making it ourselves, thanks to the original recipe that one of The Husband’s friends found on the interweb.
The problem is that it’s very vague, so we’ve been trying out batches until we get it right. It makes so much that it takes a while for us to get through. I’ll share it soon and you can play around with it as you like.
For this recipe, you can add some pico de gallo, but you’ll need to blend it until it’s quite fine or you’ll just stuff up your straw. (That is, if you use a straw like I do!)
We needed a Bloody Maria today to go with our carnitas and egg sopes (leftovers from the lovely Troy, from dinner at The Smith’s house last week), because the Tiny Kitchen Remodel is set to start today. I think. The planning seems to be never-ending, and I just want to get it started and done! I added the pic just for
The Mouse . I thought he’d appreciate it. The ingredients are: Store-bought sopes,
half-home made refried beans , carnitas, fried egg, avocado, cilantro and home made salsa. I added a little Valentina hot sauce by the time it got to the table.
I think I may need another one just to deal with the suspense. It is killing me.
Here’s the Bloody Mary/Maria recipe for you all:
(Makes one drink)
6-8 oz. organic tomato juice
2.25 shots of vodka (Mary) or tequila (Maria) (add more or less to your alcoholism level)
6-8 shakes of
Worcestershire sauce
1 dash of
garlic powder
1 dash of onion powder
2 dashes of celery salt
3 grinds of black pepper
Juice from half a lime
Juice from a quarter of a lemon
1 Tbs hot salsa or 1 dash of red chile flakes
Celery stick and pepperoncini to serve
Pour all ingredients over ice in a cocktail shaker. Shake til well blended and pour into a chilled glass. Add stalk of celery, pepperoncini and straw, and serve.
Very delicious, very filling!

Thanks–we are ridiculously cute, and I love it!
And the Tiny Kitchen Remodel shouldn’t take too long since it is really tiny. If we start tomorrow, after taking out all the contents today, then it should be done by Wednesday. Fingers crossed!

Oh those Bloody Maria’s look thirst-quenchingly good!
I’m kinda stuck on the name O-Roy-O.
Phonetic for…?
Never mind… Best of luck with the remodel.
Anxiously awaiting the unveiling!

He named it after his son, and the company name had his daughter’s name in it. Doesn’t roll off the tongue, does it?
I can’t wait for it to get started–and finished–either! Thanks!
