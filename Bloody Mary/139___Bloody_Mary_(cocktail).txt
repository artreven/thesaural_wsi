The hottest chilli
vodka
in the world is to go on sale at
Selfridges .
The Naga Chilli Vodka rates 1000,000 on the
Scoville scale
- the international method of measuring the heat in a chilli - making it the most potent chilli vodka ever to be sold. The chilli used in the vodka is the
Naga Jolokia , which is known to be one of the hottest
chillies
it is possible to grow: hotter than most law-enforcement grade pepper sprays.
The drink is made by fermenting litres of vodka with 18kg of the fiery peppers. The resulting concoction is left for several weeks to infuse. Once the vodka has turned a dark
caramel colour , the infusion is complete and the vodka can be bottled. The resulting spirit measures 100,000 on the Scoville scale - twice as hot as
Tabasco , and almost on a par with the level of heat from a
Habanero
or
Scotch bonnet
chilli. Expert mixologists recommend the new vodka be used in a classic
Bloody Mary
for a drink with extra kick.
