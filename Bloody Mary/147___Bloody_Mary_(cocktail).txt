The Husband’s Bloody Mary or Maria Recipe
15
Apr
The Husband's special recipe.
I am so spoiled at home. The Husband is just the best ever. He does the laundry. He makes me fine drinks. He generally treats me like a princess! Yep, it’s a regular love-fest around here, and I’m not ashamed to say it!
For those of you who were eyeing the
Bloody Mary
from my Easter post, here’s the recipe. There’s only one problem: The Husband uses home made salsa in his, which I haven’t posted a recipe for yet. And it’s not because I’m being stingy, it’s because we haven’t perfected it yet.

Yes, we like tacos. So sue us.

Jul
Are you bored yet? I hope not, because I’m really enjoying writing this blog! So, this is a few days late, as we had these on
It wasn't even Taco Tuesday!
Wednesday night, another veggie-dinner night. I was happy to find the tomatillos at Whole Foods, because I love a green salsa, even though The Husband usually doesn’t. But I knew if I made it from scratch I’d win him over. Which I did–he loved them, and especially the salsa. Which I must say, was quite good.
And non-vegans, please, add cheese to these tacos! We were on our cleanse, so no dairy, but they really deserved some nice cotija cheese crumbled on top. In SoCal, you can find this and other delicious Mexican cheese varieties in the cooler section near the processed cheese. I would recommend investing–it lasts for a while and is great in salads as a nice substitute for feta. Speaking of feta, those who do not live in SoCal, like my dear friend Gaby in London, should use feta on top of these tacos. Although cheddar would work in a pinch.
And Londoners, if you can’t find tomatillos, try Booths near St. Paul’s Cathedral. They have a stall at Borough Market, or at least they used to. (How I miss that market!) You can get jalapeños there too, but I’m not sure about serranos. Substitute a green Thai or Indian chili if you can’t find the Mexican variety.
So here we go with the recipe, with my notes, as usual!
