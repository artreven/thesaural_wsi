You're fighting The Guy Made Of Bees
No sooner have the words escaped your lips than a harsh, buzzing drone fills the air. A honeybee crawls from the drain of the sink, followed by another, and soon a huge cloud of them swarms around you. The swarm coalesces into a roughly humanoid figure, a horrible parody of a man, formed from a densely-packed swarm of hovering, buzzing bees. A mouth-like hole opens in the figure's "head", and the droning of the swarm modulates into a harsh, grating voice:
"We are Bees. We hate you."
Dang, man. You couldn't've summoned Beetlejuice instead? At least he was funny.
Hit Message(s):
It punches you with a fist made of bees. It stings!
Ouch! Oof! Eek! Ouch! Argh! Eek! Eek! Ow! Ow! Ouch!
The swarm grabs you in a beehug, which is like a bearhug but pointier.
Ugh! Ooh! Ooh! Eek! Ooh! Argh! Ouch! Argh! Ouch! Ugh!
The swarm of bees envelops you, stinging viciously from all sides.
Ow! Ugh! Ugh! Argh! Oof! Argh! Eek! Ugh! Eek! Ooh!
The guy made of bees charges you. Man, this thing must weigh as much as The Hulk!
Ouch! Oof! Eek! Argh! Ouch! Eek! Ooh! Oof! Ooh! Oof!
Miss Message(s):
The swarm of bees attempts to envelop you, but you flail your arms wildly and they back off.
After Combat
You hold the mirror up in front of your opponent for a second, and then it slips out of your fingers and shatters on the ground at your feet. As this happens, each of the bees that comprise your opponent disintegrates, and they all fall to the ground in a puff of black and yellow. Pshew.
You acquire an effect:
Bad Luck (duration: 7
Adventures )
You acquire an item:
guy made of bee pollen
(100.0% chance) *
You gain 40 < substat >.
Occurs in
The Haunted Bathroom
every fifth time "Say Guy made of bees" is chosen from
Having a Medicine Ball , if not already defeated.
Notes
This monster cannot be
copied .
Does
not
appear in the Haunted Bathroom during the
Bees Hate You
special challenge path , but does
show up
in another place instead.
Can only be easily defeated using an
antique hand mirror .
Using
Pickpocket
on this monster will yield a
handful of bees
about 10% of the time. The
guy made of bee pollen , however, cannot be acquired through
Pickpocket .
If the Guy Made of Bees is not defeated during combat, whether from
running away
(with or without consuming an adventure) or being beaten up, you must say "Guy made of bees" another five times in order to summon him again.
Cobain Dougans managed to defeat him without resorting to an antique hand mirror, but he was a level 117 Pastamancer when he did this. He also had a
Levitating Potato
as his familiar, to trip the Guy's devastating attacks.
If you have
Ambidextrous Funkslinging
and use an
antique hand mirror
and the
Mysterious Island Arena
flyer you will instantly complete the side-quest and avoid being beaten up, as the Guy Made of Bees has a very high
ML . This still works without the mirror -- the only downside is that you get
Beaten Up . Be sure to use the antique hand mirror in the second slot, otherwise the mirror will kill the monster and the flyers will not be used.
Another excellent tactic is to hit the Guy Made Of Bees with
Entangling Noodles
(or
stunning items ) to give you several turns to use the flyers and the
antique hand mirror . If you have the
navel ring of navel gazing , you can sometimes dodge the Guy's attacks, and may not need to resort to stunning.
References
Oddly, this is
not
a reference to "Candyman." See Riff's
comment
on the matter.
This opponent may be a reference to the Marvel supervillain
Swarm , whose body was formed entirely of bees.
The opponent's statement that "We are Bees" as well as the fact that he speaks in a "droning" voice is possibly a reference to the
Borg 's characteristic line in
Star Trek ,
"We are the Borg."
"We are Bees. We hate you" may also refer to the song "We Are Snakes And We Hate You," by
Inverted Silence .
Beetlejuice
is a humorous film about an undead creature named Betelgeuse, who bills himself as a "bio-exorcist" and tries to drive away the living humans who have moved into a haunted house, disturbing the ghostly occupants. He is summoned (and subsequently dismissed) by saying his name three times.
It may also reference the popular urban legend of " Bloody Mary ", who is summoned upon saying her name a number of times, commonly 3 or 5.
The message "Man, this thing must weigh as much as The Hulk!" refers to a humorous question which Jick and Co. found especially funny: "Who would win in a fight: the
Incredible Hulk , or the Incredible Hulk's weight in bees?". Riff first quoted the line on the June 12, 2006, radio show, citing a Woot.com podcast as its source.
The Guy's backstory is given in the " The Tale of the Mysterious Beekeeper ," a
Yuletide
adventure.
