Ramadan
( Arabic : رمضان‎
Ramaḍān , Arabic pronunciation:
[rɑmɑdˤɑːn] ) (also
Ramazan ,
Ramzan ,
Ramadhan ,
Ramdan ,
Ramadaan ) is the ninth month of the
Islamic calendar . It is the
Islamic
month of
fasting , in which participating
Muslims
refrain from
eating ,
drinking
and
sexual activities
from
dawn
until
sunset . [1]
Fasting is intended to teach Muslims about patience, humility, and
spirituality. It is a time for Muslims to fast for the sake of
God
( Arabic : الله‎, trans:
Allah )
and to offer more prayer than usual. During Ramadan, Muslims ask
forgiveness for past sins, pray for guidance and help in refraining from
everyday evils, and try to purify themselves through self-restraint and
good deeds. As compared to the
solar calendar , the dates of Ramadan vary, moving backwards about eleven days each year
depending on the moon .
Muslims believe Ramadan to be an auspicious month for the revelations
of God to humankind, being the month in which the first verses of the
Qur’an
were revealed to the Prophet
Muhammad , as well as the month in which the
Annunciation
of the birth of
Jesus
to the
Virgin Mary
took place.
i would like 2 take this oppurtunity  to wish all my muslim frenz all around da world have a good ramadhan and may this ramadhan make us a better person ^.^
