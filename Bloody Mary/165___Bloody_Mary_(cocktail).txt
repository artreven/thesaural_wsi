Fashion Friday: I wear my sunglasses at night... Well, really I don't because I'm not that cool.
You know how every once in a while a certain someone wears a certain pair of sunglasses and all of a sudden.... POW!! Everyone is after those glasses trying to capture THAT look? Like Tom Cruise in Risky Business with the Ray Band Wayfarers. The right glasses at the right time can be magic.  Well, I had a little magic moment of my own the other week in the sunglass store.  I tried on this amazing new style from Prada... They were light weight and slim, but just big enough... The caramel color was so me it was painful... I loved them.. It was instant and it was deep.  But I didn't get them. For once I let my logical thinking brain lead me away from the store, I didn't really need to spend that kind of money on sunglasses that day... or so I thought.  Since then I have been waking up in the middle of the night searching my bedside table, I have imagined whole outfits around those glasses and then brought myself back to the reality that I didn't buy them! What was I thinking??  And that dear readers brings me here today. I want to let you know that sunglasses are a vital and crucial part of your wardrobe.  I am a firm believer that if you have nice versions of the 3 main accessories, 1. Shoes 2. Bag 3. Sunglasses you can pretty much get away with wearing anything. Be it a vintage dress, a cheap,cute score from Forever 21, or a t-shirt and your sweats. It just makes you look pulled together from head to toe.  So here are some of our fave summer shades, we hope you find some that are just right for you. Because baby, summer ain't over till it's over.  (I think Lenny Kravitz said that)  (Dita)   Starting with these adorable little turquoise framed Dita's.  A new style for Dita they are called the
Sunbeam
and come in 4 different color options. I heart how light weight the frame is, like aviators but better for those of us who can't pull off the classic aviator shape.  Now don't be nervous, we are not gonna go all expensive on you guys.. Because while I do believe a nice pair of shades is a fair purchase, you can look super cute in a pair of affordable and adorable little cheapies.  (Urban Outfitters)  Hey Lolita, nice to meet ya. These saucy little hearts are available from
Urban Outfitters
and also come in 4 different colors. I just lurve the pink! But for only around $16 why not get two pairs?  Another score from Urban for your summer loving are these AMAZING and already in my shopping cart snake print gold glasses. Can we all say, YUMMMMMMM?  Because I know I did.  Yeah, I kind of can't believe it... Cute, super stylish and at this price you can go swimming in them. A beautiful and sea loving friend,  Mrs. McNair told me she lost her Chanel's in the ocean!!! Oh goodness I feel for her! So to all the girls, our new plan is leave the pricey ones in the beach bag when you hit the water and grab your Target specials!  Another super iconic look is the HUGE glasses that Jackie O wore. Now as much as we heart us our Nicole Richie.. We know that Jackie was the Originator of this look. Although Miss Richie brought it back for our generation.  Amazing and Huge, bold and dramatic. These glasses are not so much incognito as in-your-face-o, and we love that!  (In Style)   Check out sexy Anne Hathaway in her attention grabbing giant red frames from  Jee Vice! While we are talking about attention grabbing, it takes some confidence to rock these bad boys.  (Hype Beast) From the stylish
Maison Margelia
we bring you the visor glasses! We have no words to describe how unbelievably fashion forward these are. I can't wit to meet the person brave enough to wear them!  But quirky is fun, you know we heart anything that pushes the envelope... Not that we are going to wear it.. We just can appreciate it. Case in point,  The Olsen twins.  (Photo credit: Unknown) Super uber ultra stylish.. Like ooozing style and the first to take a chance on a new look, these sisters have been selling this round granny/hippie glasses look for a while now. And I have to say I'm not buying it, not that that matters because you know who is? Karl Lagerfeld! And every other designer who has introduced a pair of the Yoko Ono-esque shades.  But I say if you are gonna go bold and quirky, then you better go
Grey Ant . And it isn't just because he is am amazingly talented and genuine guy, it is because his super oversized Wayfarer style shades are actually super flattering and fun!  Grey Ant (Diavolina)   I know because I tried to steal my sisters pair but she was not having it. You can get your own at
Diavolina
if you are in Los Angeles or on the website.  Oh Prada, you and your butterfly sunglasses! How dare you?! Because if you don't look like the model in this picture, chances are this shape is gonna be a little hard to pull off...  Oh yeah, unless you are Nicole Richie and then they look super cute and stylish.  (Photo credit: Unknown)   These super bright Rubber Ducks are so very "Summer 2009" so that means you should get yours now!  (Rubber Duck) I am really feeling the purple and white! One of my all time favorite color combos!  But the yellow with the little duck are just too cute to pass up!  (Rubber Duck)   Karma Loop
carries a whole bunch of color options, check them out.  Oh my goodness! We just found the COOLEST vintage sunglass site!!  Giant Vintage Sunglasses Please
check them out! I have not been this excited about a site for a while!! Amazing and huge selection, plus all the kids in the pictures look super cute!  I think I could spend hours browsing this website. But instead I will go to bed and dream of the Prada glasses that got away.... Although, they do have them at my local Sunglass Hut...Hmmm Express yourself.  (Amazing and super cool photo found on a site called: MrSikhNet.com) XOXO- Things-We-Heart

Decor to Die For: We heart All White Rooms That Pack A Gentle Pop
I feel like we should apologize to our faithful (and of course, new readers) for our late posts lately.
As the stunning Miss Me stated yesterday...we have been the hostesses with the mostest's lately...traveling in a 3 ring circus of fun.
Due to late nights and uber early mornings, we are forced to post a wee bit late....so forgive us, we will be on track soon! Yummmmmmmm....visualize opening your doe eyes and seeing the warm crispness of clean white walls, fluffy white pillows, decadent creamy couches...ahhhhhh heaven. There is something sooo uber chic,
inviting and zen like about a well done white room. So this obsession white white rooms that pop started when I moved into my 1st real apartment. Just moving from the craziness of Hollywood and leaving my "Vampire Nights" (aaahhh that reminds us of Edward C....OMFG we are still in uber heartville with you EC...ooopsies)
behind..I needed a place of good, clean, and peaceful. I envisioned everything being white...like heaven....and every book, trinket or crystal (yup...crystals..super pretty in white rooms!) or pillow would pop out at you and welcome you in. So the mission was on...I painted my floors white, got a white bed, white walls, white linens....hmmmm why did I feel like I was stuck in a cotton ball instead of a cloud of chicness? pillow s Time to figure it out. When done right there is nothing like it...just add in a few pops of crispy bright colors and textures and watch out Kelly W! But if done wrong...you will feel trapped or sterile like being in a hospital or insane asylum. Here are some amazing examples of fantastical, spectacularly chic white rooms with a pop. First and certainly foremost...living rooms...our fav! (there are quite a few examples of LRs but you can always use what you see here and apply to a different room) This LR the perfect example of a white room done right.
There may not be a small punch or pop of bright colors (our fav) but wow is it stunning. decor pad The gorge charcoal grey couch, against the crisp white and perfect textures, make this living room welcoming and TDF!
AHHHHHH it's sooooo good!!!!
OK bookmark that one and file away!
For all you modern lovers how cute is this room? The bold and modern white, against the small painted pop walls is so cute and fun. Cococozy It's clean, crisp, and bright.
There are not too many textures or different elements, but it's great.
The contrast of the lime green and turq walls against the whiteness is fab! Wowzers!
How f'n chic and sleek is this gorge white living room?
SOooooo crispy and clean. Nathan Egan The pop of the bright pink pillow and the grey stark lines in the beautiful rug help keep it lively and not sterile. The ebony wood of the vintage style chairs against the white boucle fabric is soooo TDF!
To make the room more inviting and livable they added bright touches of floral arrangements and muted colored 70's art. OK...everyone take a deep breath..in and out...in and out... for these next 2 rooms.
They both (totally different vibes) manage to make Shabby Chic furniture and styling, anything but Shabby and totally Chic.
They are the perfect mixture of textures, crispy white with bright pops, gorge furniture and wonderful clashes of modern and vintage. This would be the perf living room for a beach town. elle decor The vintage white furniture with the warmth of the
industrial wood table mixed with the fluffy rug against the black wood flooring is simply divine. OK...wow!
Really?
Yup this is real. Domino mag...tear! How great is this vintage settee covered in ridiculously luscious bright pillows? The bright pops of color from the pillows and the fun and bright trinkets on the perfectly styled bookshelf are fantastic!
Paired with chrome sconces and a black and white silhouette picture take this eclectic mix to the next level of chic and inspirational. Perfect, perfect, perfect foyer of gorgeousness, fun, vivaciousness and chicness!!!! apt therapy Of course its from our BF
Jonathan Adler
for
Liz Lange . Imagine walking into this fun, tart, bright and vivacious space!
The white is the perfect background for the bright and bold accessories to tell the perfect story and give off a fabulously j'adorable vibe.
UGGHHHH JA...we HEART YOU! OK...we are back...on to the place where the magic happens...well some magic..the magic that fills your belly and where most of your time is spent hanging...the kitchen. There are no words...none at all that can explain my extreme jealousy (in a very good way and every once in a while bad way) of white and marble kitchens.
No words at all other than...HEAVENLY CHIC! (sorry for the yelling). Oh, hello....welcome to our perfectly warm and inviting white kitchen. hot Yup it's totally white and clean and warm.
Oh yes that is an industrial farm house table to help make it even more rad and inviting.
Oh...haha yes...those cute turquoise and chrome accents are terribly amazing and chic. Yup...again we have another ridic and crazy chic white kitchen. apt therapy The pop accents are really more from the big chrome pendant lights and mix of textures and eras than bold pops of color.
But it somehow totally works and is anything but sterile and boring.
What I wouldn't do for a marble table like that with white cane chairs anchored by plush wingbacks.
YUMMM. Speaking of eating...try not to feel envious of this tiny dining nook. right bank So small, yet so perfectly and stylishly jam packed with pops of bright color and fun.
The white becomes it's own bright color when paired with a loud yellow arc lamp and fun zebra rug below gorge white molded chairs. Looking for a bit more design friendly way to do a white kitchen?
Here it is. all the best Just a pop of sea glass blue on the backsplash (i hate that word) matched with blue cushioned barstools against the marble and white cabinets....easy peasy beautiful. OK...you may be saying (well maybe it's my inner voice telling me)... "I can't put together rooms like that?
Where the heck am I gonna find those items in an affordable way and with in reach? I am lost when it comes to different textures and mixing vibes"
Well, inner voice and friends alike, here is the easiest and most wallet friendly way to do so.
Here are 2 examples of how simple, bold and bright accessories can turn an all white room into utter Chicville. All white desk and white walls...meet a fuchsia chair and leopard rug. Apartment Therapy
VOILA!
Done and done. Gorgeousness does not do this simple white marble bathroom justice...but the sunshine yellow accessories do. Brown D Inc So easy and simple yet it makes suuuch a big impact. Be inspired...be bold...have fun...you live there after all. P.S. Oxy Clean and Fantastic are your friends for white rooms P.P.S. PBJ sandwiches on toddler fingers are not. P.P.P.S. But imagine how relaxing it is after you wipe up all of the stains to sit in your room o' heaven. Ohhhh we are relaxed and ready for bed again ;)
yawn!!! xoxo t.w.h.

Random Hearts: Gizmo!!
Wow... Really is it 12pm?  Well, we have no excuse for being late everyday of the week this week this week except for the fact that it has been a busy one for the things we heart girls...  Lets just say what we have been up to this week is akin to hosting a wedding each night for 6 nights in a row...  Last night while we were sipping our Vodka and Club Soda's and taking deep breaths preparing for our hostess' with the mostess' duty we saw a really awesome friend of ours...  (dr.snafu) Lets call him Fireball, and lets just say God had his metal on he day he created Fireball. This guys is not messing around. Long flowing locks and full on almost ZZ Top status beard... But as bad-ass as this guy looks, what came to Miss Me's mind was Gizmo! The cuddly fury little ball of love from the movie Gremlins!  Remeber the Gremlins? The totally awesome movie from the 1980's with none other then the lovely Phoebe Cates?  This dad buys his son a little fury love ball from a creepy old Chinese man and doesn't pay attention to the strict set of rule the old guy gives him?  Then Gizmo starts multiplying when he gets wet and then they feed him after midnight and suddenly there are hundreds of gross green slimy gremlins running around the town causing havoc?  AMAZING!!  So we dedicate this post to Fireball, because we cant help but wanna cuddle him when we see him and lurking inside that adorable exterior is a super bad ass.  XOXO- Things-We-Heart

Yummies: We heart Hangover Cures...not the hangover!
Really? This is how we feel? Uggggghhhhh !
We are never drinking again!
Well at least not tonight :)
hee
hee .
There is
nothin ' more fun than a night out drinking with a few of your favorite girls...NOTHING (well perhaps a shopping spree at Barney's...we digress). Drinking, dancing, laughing, drinking, strutting, drinking, falling...then passing out with all of your makeup on only to wake up with a CRAZY headache to the sound of the TV you left on and the smell of what ever you accidentally ordered from room service. hangover What??
Noooo ..not us!
We just meant we are sure it has happened to other people ;) But seriously...what the heck is it with
hangovers ?!
They ruin your day as well as other peoples around you.
You are stuck inside on a gorge day praying to the
porcelain
God. Well have no fear...the girls of T.W.H. are here! We bring you...HANGOVER CURES!.... ooooppsie . Sorry to shout that
sooo
loud... shhhhh .
Here they are. The first and most popular for literally centuries...The Hair of the Dog.
Super cute saying and it actually works!
So it simply means...what ever you drank the night before that got you in this predicament...drink again in the am.
(but
obv
not to the degree that got you here in the first place) Speaking of Hair of the Dog....the #1 cure in the US is....a
Bloody Mary . The breakfast of champions!
The tomato juice and the celery are full of vitamins and a wee bit o' fiber to get that system flowing (if you know what we mean...well girls don't because we don't do stuff like that), the spices help get the blood flowing and it is "The Hair of the Dog" too. Make your own!
or just have the cute boy at the pool bring you one. Our
numero
2 cure?
Well..it's none other than the one and only.....greasy yummy super bad for you in the best way possible...fast foods!
Nothing will make you feel instantly better than a slice of pizza... yummmmm Or a plate of salty...delicious french fries dipped in ranch dressing. The salt will help you retain water from the dehydrating effects of the alcohol. (we may have made that up, but it sounds super official) Or the ultimate dynamic duo... doughnuts and Toxic Hell
quesadillas . WOW!
1 of each and we promise you...you will be out and about in no time flat.
We don't know why but greasy or fatty foods just help.
So don't question it...eat it and feel better.
Diet tomorrow! ( shhhh
don't tell our trainers) OK, don't want to feel guilty about your hangover cure methods and foods?
Here are 2 that are great for hangovers and for your bikini body (just no where near as fun to eat) Bananas and eggs.
Yup!
Simple and they work. Church of banan a Bananas (like Gatorade...another GREAT helper) are chock full of
potassium , to aid against dehydration, and electrolytes that the nasty Vodka Soda or Jack N Coke you drank deplete your body of. Eggs are full of cysteine, a substance that helps your liver break down last nights toxins and soak up the remainder of them still floating around in there. Oh wait!!
We forgot the most important one!
Drink tons of water and coconut water.
You need to flush out your body and replenish the good fluids that the mean alcohol fluids kicked out. Last but not least...the
hangover pill .. hmmmm
sounds interesting. It's full of vitamins and minerals that you need the day after.
But we found 2 problems with it... 1. You have to take during and after you drink. "Cheers guys!
woooo
hooooo !!!
Oh wait!
I have to take a hang over pill"
Hi Debbie Downer... 2. You also have to take the next day...um..hello..have you met my new
BFF
the toilet and barf bowl? Things not to do although they seem like they would totally work- Coffee- Although it feels
suuuper
good to drink a cup o'
joe
(i just did and then read what will happen to me in an hour....dang it!) about an hour after you do...you may feel worse since its a diuretic and depletes your bod of h2o. Aspirin- This is a no no!
Super bad for your tummy and liver..especially when mixed with that nasty friend...alcohol But the best thing ever to do for a nasty hangover?
Crawl into bed (or a friends), rent movies, close the drapes and order pizza and grilled cheese and milk shakes. P.S. Sorry for the late post!!!
But we are sure you have figured out why ;) P.P.S. You know when your mom (or friends) say not to mix alcohol???
LISTEN! A rad mask that people started to use for hangovers ;) xoxo
