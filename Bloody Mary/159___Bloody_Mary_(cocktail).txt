Wasabi Bloody Mary
Wasabi Bloody Mary
El Bloody Mary con Waswabi.  Today we go back to basics, for the "Wasabi" Bloody Mary.
Now, the
Bloody Mary
has some contentious beginnings, but these days it's almost universally known as a menu item throughout the world, and maintains a reputation as a " morning after " drink ...or " if it were anything else at 8:30 am, you'd have a problem " drink.
Places like to
pretend they're trendy
by offering a " wasabi Bloody Mary ," but both they and their customers are so dumb, that they don't realize that such a name is full of shit. See, Wasabi is wasabi and not wasabi... That means if it's green and in a tube or tin and from the "Asian" section of the store and costs less than $20, it's
not actually wasabi .
We here at Pinky Mixology embrace this misnomer, because one's interpretation may add validity within the context of... nah fuck it, it's because we're cheap and lazy.
Also, real wasabi tastes different and is expensive, and if you mixed it in a Bloody Mary, you'd probably hardly notice.  Real wasabi is not meant to be put in a cocktail like this so don't sweat it.
Don't add salt.  The other things that go in this have enough salt in them already.
Always be sure to grind pepper fresh into this, because the crapola in the pre-filled shakers at the diner or from wherever are just full of the worst kind of shit.
You will notice if you try them side by side.
Also, a problem with the "mix"of pepper corns you see here, is that they are different sizes, which plays hell with most grinders including mine.  You might wanna try using a bladed spice grinder (aka cheap coffee grinder).
Real wasabi
comes from the roots of a water plant, and looks nothing like the green crap
you get at your local sushi a-go-go place in the mall. As mentioned, real wasabi is impossible to use in a drink like this anyway, so just roll with the
tube stuff .
The spice mix you make should be strong because it's a concentrate, and so it's going to get diluted in the rest of the drink.
The good old
pointy top squeeze bottle
makes a great way to let guests spice up their own drinks at the level they want, so the pussies in the room can still have some.
You can usually find these bottles at the dollar stores.
Also, this stuff just doesn't really go bad, since it's super salty-spicy.
Another
BBQ Bloody Mary
how-to on the lazy side is
here .
One of the best places to try a great garlic and dill infused vodka, is the
Russian Vodka Room
in New York.
It's worth it, but make sure you go on a weekday, otherwise, you're in for quite the long wait.
So I'm drivin' home from the bar and I bash into this chick from the office and I'm all like "hey bloody, is your name Mary? 'cause I could sure use another cocktail!"
...hahaha. Nah, just kidding, she's in the trunk.
Of course, like many (but not all) cocktails, you can skip the alcohol in this one and just leave it as a nice spicy tomato juice drink for the " Virgin Mary " crowd.
It will still have the same spicy qualities and you'll still look
hipster-cool when you have it with "brunch" at 4pm over in Williamsburg
or Portland or wherever.
Something's wrong w/ the "next time" photo.
Guess you're all in for a surprise on 06/07.
