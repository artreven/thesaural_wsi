Eww.  That sounds really gross.
The drink is called a Michelada.  It is a mix between a
Bloody Mary
and a beer.  Hence, the title.
I found the recipe on
NocheLatina.com , although there are many varying recipes elsewhere.
Ingredients:
(about) 1 Tbsp. Lime juice
(about) 1 Dash of salt
(about) 2 Dashes of Cayenne pepper sauce (I used Frank’s RedHot)
(about) 2 Dashes of Worcestershire sauce (I used Lea & Perrins)
(about) 1 Bottle of Mexican beer (I used Dos Equis and Corona Extra)                                    Lots of Ice
This recipe is all about personal preference.  I used extra hot sauce and extra lime, because those are my favorites.
I also used (about) 1 Dash of Kikkoman Soy Sauce to give it more flavor.  You didn’t think I could follow a whole recipe did you?  I got the idea of soy sauce from other sites’ Michelada recipes – there is some method do the madness.
Directions:
Mix altogether.  Trust your instincts.  Use more of your favorite ingredients until it’s perfect.
Overall, the drinks were alright.  I enjoy a spicy Bloody Mary more than a Michelada, but hey, I still drank them.  I even went through the trouble of rimming the glasses with salt, so I couldn’t let them go to waste.  The salt, by the way, made all the difference.
As for the beers,
Corona
is usually my Mexican beer of choice.  I was feeling extra spontaneous, though, and got
Dos Equis
also.  I was glad that the crazy side of me
The Dos Equis Michelada was tastier, but I did drink both.
showed itself while I stood there in the beer aisle of the grocery store – the Dos Equis Michelada was excellent.   (Those cerveza websites are worth checking out).
