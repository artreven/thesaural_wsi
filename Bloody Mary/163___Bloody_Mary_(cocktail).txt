ودکا
( روسی :
Водка ؛
لهستانی : wódka)یکی از پرمصرف‌ترین
نوشیدنی‌های تقطیری
است. ودکا بدون طعم‌دهنده یک مایع شفاف و بی‌رنگ است که از آمیختن
آب
با
اتانول
تولید می‌شود. معمولاً با تقطیر
شرابی
که از تخمیر غلات یا سیب‌زمینی به دست آمده
الکل اتیلیک
تقریباً خالص تهیه می‌کنند و سپس آن را با نسبتی خاص با آب مخلوط می‌کنند تا ودکا درست شود. اصولاً هرچه ودکا بی‌رنگ و بی‌بوتر باشد، کیفیت آن بالاتر و خالص‌تر است. معمولاً در آخرین مرحله تهیه ودکا، آن را از
زغال چوب
رد می‌کنند تا باقی‌مانده مزه و بوی آن از بین برود. [۱]
ودکا یک
نوشیدنی الکلی
با درصد
الکل
بالا (بین ۳۵ تا ۵۰ درصد) است. ودکای سنتی
روسیه
و
لهستان
معمولاً ۴۰ درصد الکل دارد. ودکایی که در لهستان، روسیه، جمهوری چک، استونی، لاتویا، اوکراین و لیتوانی به فروش می‌رسد ۴۰٪ است.
ودکای اروپایی
حداقل ۳۷.۵٪ است. همچنین ودکایی که در آمریکا به فروش می‌رسد حداقل ۴۰٪ است. تعیین میزان ۴۰٪ به گستردگی و به طور اشتباه به
دیمیتری مندلیف
نسبت داده می‌شود.
به طور سنتی ودکا همراه با آب، یخ یا دیگر ترکیبات مصرف نمی‌شود. همچنین ودکا در بسیاری از
کوکتل‌ها
مانند
مارتینی ودکا ،
تونیک ودکا ،
بلادی مری
استفاده می‌شود.

تاریخچه [ ویرایش ]
کلمه «ودکا» از
زبان روسی
می‌آید و حالت تصغیر کلمه «وُدا» (به
روسی :
Вода ) به معنی «آب» است. [۲]
در دوران
امپراتوری روسیه
از « سیب‌زمینی
له‌شده» برای تهیه ودکا استفاده می‌شد، اما اکنون در
روسیه
از دانه‌هایی خالص غلات برای تهیه ودکا استفاده می‌شود. [۳]

Vodka
( Polish :
wódka
[ˈvutka] ,
Russian :
водка
[ˈvotkə] ) is a
distilled beverage
composed primarily of water and
ethanol , sometimes with traces of impurities and flavorings. Traditionally, vodka is made by the distillation of
fermented
cereal grains
or
potatoes , though some modern brands use other substances, such as fruits or sugar.
Since the 1890s, the standard Polish, Russian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian and Czech vodkas are 40%
alcohol by volume
ABV (80
proof ), a percentage that is widely misattributed to
Dmitri Mendeleev . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
The
European Union
has established a minimum of 37.5% ABV for any "European vodka" to be named as such. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Products sold as "vodka" in the
United States
must have a minimum alcohol content of 40%. [ 5 ]
Even with these loose restrictions, most vodka sold contains 40% ABV. For homemade vodkas and distilled beverages referred to as "moonshine", see
moonshine by country .
Vodka is traditionally drunk
neat
(not mixed with any water, ice, or other mixer), though it is often served chilled in the
vodka belt
countries (Belarus, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Ukraine). It is also commonly used in
cocktails
and mixed drinks, such as the
vodka martini ,
Cosmopolitan ,
vodka tonic ,
Screwdriver ,
Greyhound ,
Black
or
White Russian , and
Bloody Mary .

Etymology
The " vodka belt " countries of Northern, Central and Eastern Europe are the historic home of vodka. These countries have the highest vodka consumption in the world.
The name "vodka" is a
diminutive
form of the
Slavic
word
voda
(water), interpreted as
little water :
root
вод- ( vod- ) [water] + -к- ( -k- ) (diminutive
suffix , among other functions) +
-a
( postfix
of
feminine gender ). [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
The word "vodka" was recorded for the first time in 1405 in
Akta Grodzkie , [ 9 ]
the court documents from the
Palatinate of Sandomierz
in Poland. [ 9 ]
At the time, the word vodka ( wódka ) referred to chemical compounds such as
medicines
and
cosmetics ' cleansers, while the popular beverage was called
gorzałka
(from the
Old Polish
gorzeć
meaning "to burn"), which is also the source of Ukrainian
horilka
(горілка). The word vodka written in
Cyrillic
appeared first in 1533, in relation to a medicinal drink brought from Poland to Russia by the merchants of
Kievan Rus' . [ 9 ]
Some Russian
pharmaceutical
lists contain the terms "vodka of grain wine" (водка хлебного вина
vodka khlebnogo vina ) and "vodka in half of grain wine" (водка полу хлебного вина
vodka polu khlebnogo vina ). [ 10 ]
As alcohol had long been used as a basis for medicines, this implies the term vodka could be a noun derived from the verb
vodit’ ,
razvodit’
(водить, разводить), "to dilute with water". Grain wine was a spirit distilled from alcohol made from grain (as opposed to grape wine) and hence "vodka of grain wine" would be a water dilution of a distilled grain spirit.
Although the word
vodka
could be found in early manuscripts and in
lubok
pictograms, it began to appear in Russian dictionaries only in the mid-19th century. It was attested in
Sámuel Gyarmathi 's Russian-German-Hungarian glossary of 1799, where it is glossed with Latin
vinum adustum
("burnt [i.e. distilled] wine"). [ 11 ]
In English literature the word vodka was attested already in the late 18th century. In a book of his travels published in English in 1780 (presumably, a translation from German),
Johann Gottlieb Georgi
correctly explained that "Kabak in the Russian language signifies a public house for the common people to drink
vodka
(a sort of brandy) in." [ 12 ]
William Tooke
in 1799 glossed
vodka
as "rectified corn-spirits". [ 13 ]
In French,
Théophile Gautier
in 1800 glossed it as a "grain liquor" served with meals in Poland ( eau-de-vie
de grain ). [ 14 ]
Another possible connection of "vodka" with "water" is the name of the medieval alcoholic beverage
aqua vitae
( Latin , literally, "water of life"), which is reflected in Polish
okowita , Ukrainian
оковита , Belarusian
акавіта , and Scandinavian
akvavit . (Note that
whiskey
has a similar etymology, from the
Irish / Scottish Gaelic
uisce beatha /uisge-beatha.)
People in the area of vodka's probable origin have names for vodka with roots meaning "to burn":
Polish :
gorzała ;
Ukrainian :
горілка,
horílka ;
Belarusian :
гарэлка,
harelka ;
Lithuanian :
degtinė ;
Samogitian : degtėnė, is also in use, colloquially and in
proverbs [ 15 ] );
Latvian :
degvīns ;
Finnish :
paloviina . In
Russian
during the 17th and 18th centuries, горящѣе вино or горячее вино ( goryashchee vino , "burning wine" or "hot wine") was widely used. Others languages include the German
Branntwein ,
Danish
brændevin ,
Dutch :
brandewijn ,
Swedish :
brännvin , and
Norwegian :
brennevin
(although the latter terms refer to any strong alcoholic beverage).
History
Scholars debate the beginnings of vodka. [ 16 ]
It is a contentious issue because very little historical material is available. [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
The first production was either in Poland in the 8th century, or in the area of today's Russia in the late 9th century according to different sources. [ 16 ] [ 19 ]
According to the Gin and Vodka Association (GVA), [ 19 ]
the first distillery was documented over three hundred years later at Khlynovsk as reported in the Vyatka Chronicle of 1174. For many centuries, beverages differed significantly compared to the vodka of today, as the spirit at that time had a different flavor, color and smell, and was originally used as medicine. [ 19 ]
It contained little alcohol, an estimated maximum of about 14%, as only this amount can be attained by natural fermentation. The
still , allowing for distillation ("burning of wine"), increased purity, and increased alcohol content, was invented in the 8th century. [ 20 ]
Poland
In Poland, vodka ( Polish :
wódka ; obsolete:
gorzałka ) has been produced since the early
Middle Ages
with local traditions as varied as the production of
cognac
in France, or Scottish
whisky . [ 21 ]
The world's first written mention of the drink and of the word "vodka" was in 1405 from
Akta Grodzkie
recorder of deeds , [ 9 ]
in the court documents from the
Palatinate of Sandomierz
in Poland [ 9 ]
and it went on to become a popular drink there. At the time, the word
wódka
referred to chemical compounds such as
medicines
and
cosmetics ' cleansers, while the popular beverage currently known as vodka was called
gorzałka
(from the
Old Polish
verb
gorzeć
meaning "to burn"), which is also the source of Ukrainian
horilka
(горілка). The word written in
Cyrillic
appeared first in 1533, in relation to a medicinal drink brought from Poland to Russia by the merchants of
Kievan Rus' . [ 9 ]
In these early days, the spirits were used mostly as medicines. Stefan Falimierz asserted in his 1534 works on
herbs
that vodka could serve "to increase fertility and awaken lust".
Wódka lub gorzała
(1614), by Jerzy Potański, contains valuable information on the production of vodka. Jakub Kazimierz Haur, in his book
Skład albo skarbiec znakomitych sekretów ekonomii ziemiańskiej
( A Treasury of Excellent Secrets about Landed Gentry's Economy , Kraków, 1693), gave detailed recipes for making vodka from
rye .
Chopin
Wyborowa
Żubrówka
Luksusowa
Some Polish vodka blends go back centuries. Most notable are
Żubrówka , from about the 16th century;
Goldwasser , from the early 17th century; and aged
Starka
vodka, from the 16th century. In the mid-17th century, the
szlachta
(nobility of Poland) were granted a monopoly on producing and selling vodka in their territories. This privilege was a source of substantial profits. One of the most famous distilleries of the aristocracy was established by Princess
Lubomirska
and later operated by her grandson, Count
Alfred Wojciech Potocki . The Vodka Industry Museum, located at the park of the Potocki country estate has an original document attesting that the distillery already existed in 1784. Today it operates as " Polmos Łańcut ". [ 22 ]
Vodka production on a much larger scale began in Poland at the end of the 16th century, initially at
Kraków , whence spirits were exported to
Silesia
before 1550. Silesian cities also bought vodka from
Poznań , a city that in 1580 had 498 working spirits distilleries. Soon, however,
Gdańsk
outpaced both these cities. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish vodka was known in the Netherlands, Denmark, England, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary,
Romania ,
Ukraine ,
Bulgaria
and the
Black Sea
basin.
Early production methods were rudimentary. The beverage was usually low-proof, and the distillation process had to be repeated several times (a three-stage distillation process was common). The first distillate was called
brantówka , the second was
szumówka , and the third was
okowita
(from
aqua vitae ), which generally contained 70–80% ABV. Then the beverage was watered down, yielding a simple vodka (30–35% ABV), or a stronger one if the watering was done using an
alembic . The exact production methods were described in 1768 by
Jan Paweł Biretowski
and in 1774 by
Jan Chryzostom Pasek . The late 18th century inaugurated the production of vodka from various unusual substances including even the
carrot . [ 21 ]
Though there was clearly a substantial vodka cottage industry in Poland back to the 16th century, the end of the 18th century marked the start of real industrial production of vodka in Poland ( Kresy , the eastern part of Poland was controlled
by the Russian empire
at that time). Vodkas produced by the nobility and clergy became a mass product. The first industrial distillery was opened in 1782 in
Lwów
by
J. A. Baczewski . He was soon followed by Jakub Haberfeld, who in 1804 established a factory at
Oświęcim , and by Hartwig Kantorowicz, who started producing
Wyborowa
in 1823 at
Poznań . The implementation of new technologies in the latter half of the 19th century, which allowed the production of clear vodkas, contributed to their success. The first rectification distillery was established in 1871. In 1925, the production of clear vodkas was made a
Polish government
monopoly. [ 21 ]
After
World War II , all vodka distilleries were taken over by Poland's
Marxist–Leninist government . During the martial law of the 1980s, the sale of vodka was rationed. Following the success of the
Solidarity
movement and the
abolition of single-party rule in Poland , many distilleries began struggling financially. Some filed for bankruptcy, but many were privatized, leading to the creation of various new brands. [ 21 ]
Russia
Russian Vodka in various bottles and cups
A type of distilled liquor designated by the Russian word
vodka
came to Russia in the late 14th century. In 1386, the
Genoese
ambassadors brought the first
aqua vitae
("the water of life") to Moscow and presented it to
Grand Duke
Dmitry Donskoy . The liquid obtained by distillation of grape
must
was thought to be a concentrate and a "spirit" of wine ( spiritus vini
in Latin), from where came the name of this substance in many European languages (like English
spirit , or Russian
спирт,
spirt ).
According to a legend, around 1430, a monk named
Isidore
from
Chudov Monastery
inside the
Moscow Kremlin
made a recipe of the first Russian vodka. [ 23 ]
Having a special knowledge and distillation devices, he became the creator of a new, higher quality type of alcoholic beverage. This "bread wine", as it was initially known, was for a long time produced exclusively in the
Grand Duchy of Moscow
and in no other principality of
Rus'
(this situation persisted until the era of industrial production). Thus, this beverage was closely associated with Moscow.
Until the mid-18th century, the drink remained relatively low in alcohol content, not exceeding 40% ABV. Multiple terms for the drink were recorded, sometimes reflecting different levels of quality, alcohol concentration, filtering, and the number of distillations; most commonly, it was referred to as "burning wine", "bread wine", or even in some locations simply "wine". In some locations, grape wine may have been so expensive that it was a drink only for aristocrats. Burning wine was usually diluted with water to 24% ABV or less before drinking. It was mostly sold in taverns and was quite expensive. At the same time, the word
vodka
was already in use, but it described herbal
tinctures
(similar to
absinthe ), containing up to 75% ABV, and made for medicinal purposes.

Nizhny Novgorod , Russia.
The first written usage of the word
vodka
in an official Russian document in its modern meaning is dated by the decree of
Empress
Elizabeth
of 8 June 1751, which regulated the ownership of vodka distilleries. By the 1860s, due to the government policy of promoting consumption of state-manufactured vodka, it became the drink of choice for many Russians. In 1863, the government monopoly on vodka production was repealed, causing prices to plummet and making vodka available even to low-income citizens. The taxes on vodka became a key element of government finances in Tsarist Russia, providing at times up to 40% of state revenue. [ 24 ]
By 1911, vodka comprised 89% of all alcohol consumed in Russia. This level has fluctuated somewhat during the 20th century, but remained quite high at all times. The most recent estimates put it at 70% (2001). Today, some popular Russian vodka producers or brands are (amongst others)
Stolichnaya
and
Russian Standard . [ 25 ]
During the late 1970s, Russian culinary author
William Pokhlebkin
compiled a history of the production of vodka in Russia, as part of the
Soviet
case in a trade dispute; this was later published as
A History of Vodka . Pokhlebkin claimed that while there is a wealth of publications about the history of consumption and distribution of vodka, virtually nothing had been written about vodka production. One of his assertions was that the word "vodka" was used in popular speech in Russia considerably earlier than the middle of the 18th century, but the word did not appear in print until the 1860s. Pokhlebkin's sources were challenged by David Christian in the
Slavic Review
in 1994. Christian criticised the lack of valid references in Pokhlebkin's works stating that his work has an obvious pro-Russian bias. Pokhlebkin is also known for his Pan-Slavic sympathies under the leadership of Russia, and sentiments which in David Christian's opinion discredits majority of his work, especially his
History of Vodka . [ 26 ]
Sweden
A miniature bottle of Absolut Vodka.
Up until the 1950s, vodka was not used as a designation for Swedish distilled beverages, which were instead called
brännvin
("burn-wine"), the word having the same etymology as the Dutch
Brandewijn , which is the base for the word
brandy . This beverage has been produced in Sweden since the late 15th century, although the total production was still small in the 17th century. [ 27 ]
From the early 18th century, production expanded, although production was prohibited several times, during grain shortages. Although initially a grain product,
potatoes
started to be used in the production in the late 18th century, and became dominant from the early 19th century. [ 28 ]
From the early 1870s, distillery equipment was improved.
Progressively from the 1960s, unflavoured Swedish
brännvin
also came to be called vodka. The first Swedish product to use this term was
Explorer Vodka , which was created in 1958 and initially was intended for the American export market. [ 29 ]
In 1979,
Absolut Vodka
was launched, reusing the name of the old
Absolut Rent Brännvin
("absolutely pure
brännvin ") created in 1879.
Vodka has become a popular source of insobriety among young people, with a flourishing black market. [ 30 ]
In 2013, the organizers of a so-called "vodka car" were jailed for two and a half years for having illegally provided thousands of liters to young people, some as young as thirteen years old. [ 31 ]
Production
An old Ukrainian vodka still.
Vodka bottling machine, Shatskaya Vodka ( Shatsk, Russia )
Vodka may be distilled from any
starch - or
sugar -rich plant matter; most vodka today is produced from
grains
such as
sorghum ,
corn ,
rye
or
wheat . Among grain vodkas, rye and wheat vodkas are generally considered superior. Some vodkas are made from
potatoes ,
molasses ,
soybeans ,
grapes ,
rice ,
sugar beets
and sometimes even byproducts of oil refining [ 32 ]
or wood pulp processing. In some Central European countries, such as Poland, some vodka is produced by just fermenting a solution of crystal sugar and yeast. In the
European Union
there are talks about the standardization of vodka, and the
Vodka Belt
countries insist that only spirits produced from grains, potato and sugar beet molasses be allowed to be branded as "vodka", following the traditional methods of production. [ 33 ] [ 34 ]
In the United States, many vodkas are made from 95% ethanol produced in large quantities by agricultural-industrial giants
Archer Daniels Midland
and Midwest Grain Processors. Bottlers purchase the base spirits in bulk, then filter, dilute, distribute and market the end product under a variety of vodka brand names. [ 35 ]
Distilling and filtering
A common property of the vodkas produced in the United States and Europe is the extensive use of filtration prior to any additional processing including the addition of
flavorants . Filtering is sometimes done in the
still
during
distillation , as well as afterwards, where the distilled vodka is filtered through
activated charcoal
and other media to absorb trace amounts of substances that alter or impart off-flavors to the vodka. However, this is not the case in the traditional vodka-producing nations, so many distillers from these countries prefer to use very accurate distillation but minimal filtering, thus preserving the unique flavors and characteristics of their products.
The master distiller is in charge of distilling the vodka and directing its filtration, which includes the removal of the "fore-shots", "heads" and "tails". These components of the distillate contain flavor compounds such as
ethyl acetate
and
ethyl lactate
(heads) as well as the
fusel oils
(tails) that impact the usually desired clean taste of vodka. Through numerous rounds of distillation, or the use of a fractioning still, the taste is modified and clarity is increased. In contrast, distillery process for liquors such as
whiskey ,
rum , and
baijiu
allow portions of the "heads" and "tails" to remain, giving them their unique flavors.
Repeated distillation of vodka will make its ethanol level much higher than is acceptable to most end users, whether legislation determines strength limits or not. Depending on the distillation method and the technique of the stillmaster, the final filtered and distilled vodka may have as much as 95–96% ethanol. As such, most vodka is diluted with water prior to bottling.
Polish distilleries make a very pure (96%, 192 proof, formerly also 98%)
rectified spirit
(Polish language:
spirytus rektyfikowany ). Technically a form of vodka, it is sold in liquor stores rather than pharmacies. Similarly, the German market often carries German, Hungarian, Polish, and Ukrainian-made varieties of vodka of 90 to 95% ABV. A
Bulgarian
vodka,
Balkan 176° , has an 88% alcohol content.
Everclear , an American brand, is also sold at 95% ABV.
Flavoring
Main article:
Flavored liquor
While most vodkas are unflavored, many flavored vodkas have been produced in traditional vodka-drinking areas, often as home-made recipes to improve vodka's taste or for medicinal purposes. Flavorings include red pepper, ginger, fruit flavors, vanilla, chocolate (without sweetener), and cinnamon. In Russia, vodka flavored with honey and pepper,
pertsovka
in Russian, is also very popular. In Poland and Belarus, the leaves of the local
bison grass
are added to produce
żubrówka
(Polish) and
zubrovka
(Belarusian) vodka, with slightly sweet flavors and light amber colors. In Lithuania and Poland, a famous vodka containing honey is called
krupnik .
This tradition of flavoring is also prevalent in the
Nordic countries , where vodka seasoned with herbs, fruits and spices is the appropriate strong drink for several seasonal festivities. Sweden has forty-odd common varieties of herb-flavored vodka ( kryddat brännvin ). In Poland and Ukraine, a separate category ( nalyvka
in Ukraine and
nalewka
in Poland) is used for vodka-based spirits with fruit, root, flower, or herb extracts, which are often home-made or produced by small commercial distilleries. Their alcohol contents vary between 15 and 75%. In
Estonia , vodkas are spiced with barbaris, blackcurrant, cherry, green apple, lemon, vanilla and watermelon flavors. [ 36 ]
More recently, people have experimented with producing more unusual flavors of vodka, such as very hot chili flavored vodka [ 37 ]
and even
bacon vodka . [ 38 ]
Today
According to
The Penguin Book of Spirits and Liqueurs , "Its low level of
fusel oils
and
congeners —impurities that flavour spirits but that can contribute to the after-effects of heavy consumption—led to its being considered among the 'safer' spirits, though not in terms of its powers of intoxication, which, depending on strength, may be considerable." [ 39 ]
Since the year 2000, due to evolving consumer tastes and regulatory changes, a number of 'artisanal vodka' or even 'ultrapremium vodka' brands have appeared.
European Union regulation
The recent success of
grape -based vodka in the United States prompted traditional vodka producers in the Vodka Belt countries of
Poland ,
Finland ,
Estonia ,
Lithuania , and
Sweden
to campaign for
EU legislation
that will categorize only spirits made from grain or potatoes as "vodka". [ 33 ] [ 34 ]
This proposition provoked heavy criticism from south European countries, which often distill used
mash
from wine-making into spirits; although higher quality mash is usually distilled into some variety of
pomace brandy , lower-quality mash is better turned into neutral-flavored spirits instead. Any vodka not made from either grain or potatoes would have to display the products used in its production. This regulation entered into force in 2008. [ 4 ]

Alcohol and health
In some countries,
black-market
or " bathtub " vodka is widespread because it can be produced easily and avoid taxation. However, severe poisoning,
blindness , or death can occur as a result of dangerous industrial ethanol substitutes being added by black-market producers. [ 40 ]
In March 2007 in a documentary,
BBC News
UK sought to find the cause of severe
jaundice
among imbibers of a "bathtub" vodka in Russia. [ 41 ]
The cause was suspected to be an industrial disinfectant ( Extrasept ) – 95% ethanol but also containing a highly toxic chemical – added to the vodka by the illegal traders because of its high alcohol content and low price. Death toll estimates list at least 120 dead and more than 1,000 poisoned. The death toll is expected to rise due to the chronic nature of the
cirrhosis
that is causing the jaundice. However, there are also much higher estimates of the annual death toll (dozens or even hundreds of thousand of lives) produced by the vodka consumption in Russia. [ 42 ]
