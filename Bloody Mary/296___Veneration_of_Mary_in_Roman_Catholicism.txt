Máire
The name that was used in Ireland (Éire) for
The Blessed
Virgin Mary  was Muire and interestingly, her name was so honored that it was rarely used as a
first name until the end of the fifteenth century. Then
Máire
became
acceptable as a given name but the spelling Muire was reserved for the
Blessed Mother.
"Mary" appears in other languages: Arabic: مريم (Maryam); Septuagint Greek: Μαριάμ, Mariam, Μαρία, Maria
Late Latin: Maria, Māryām; Syriac: Mart Maryam
A woman named Mary Murphy in English would be known in Irish as Máire Ní Mhurchú if she is unmarried
and Máire UíMhurchú if she is married
