Queen Ravalona - Bloody Mary Of Madagascsar
Part 1:
Ranavalona I
( born
Rabodoandrianampoinimerina (Ramavo) ; c. 1782 
August 15 ,
1861
Antananarivo ) was a
Merina
Queen of
Madagascar . After succeeding her husband,
Radama I , and becoming Queen, she was also known as
Ranavalo-Manjaka I . Over the course of her bloody reign, and after it, she was referred to by Western scholars as the
Modern
Messalina , the
Bloody Mary
of Madagascar ,
Most Mad Queen of History ,
Wicked Queen Ranavalona , and the
Mad Queen of Madagascar
and
Female
Caligula . Many Africans, especially people in Madagascar, do not share that point of view; while they recognize that her regime was autocratic they see her as a ruler who resisted foreign economic and cultural invasion. The death of nearly half the population (largely by torture) during her reign is seen as a unique cultural quirk.
Ranavalona's background is in dispute. One source indicates that she was born into the
Menabe
tribe somewhere between 1782 and 1790. Little is known of Ranavalona's early life, but it was during her first years that the King
Andrianampoinimerina
was attempting to unite Madagascar's various factions under a single crown. The king of the Menabe ruled the western portion of the island, and he was unwilling to unify. Because of this, Andrianampoinimerina's successor, Radama I, did the next best thing by marrying the eldest daughter of Andrian-Tsala-Manjaka and his wife Rabodo Andrian-Tampo.
Laidler indicates that Ranavalona was adopted by King
Andrianampoinimerina
as a reward to her father who had uncovered a plot. She was later married at the age of 22 but cheated on him with his favorite son.
Radama then became king of the Merina upon his fathers death, and succeeded in unifying the island. Ranavalona is suspected to have caused Radamas death by poisoning him.
When Radama died in 1828, he left no descendants, and according to the local matrilineal custom, the rightful heir was Rakotobe, the eldest son of Radama's eldest sister. Ranavalona however gained knowledge of her husband's death before Rakotobe and his followers, secured the loyalty of the military leaders, and captured her potential opponents. She usurped the throne on
August 1 ,
1828
after eliminating any potential rivals.
Ascending to the throne, Ranavalona swore to uphold the customary rites and old beliefs, and to defend her realm. Radama had started to modernize and westernize the country, but now with Ranavalona restoration was instituted as the old power brokers  priests, judges, slave merchants  regained control, supported by the Merina military. Ranavalona had most of the relatives of her late husband Radama I executed, repudiated the treaties he had negotiated with the
British empire
and legalized the
slave trade . A preferred method to determine the guilt of an accused was the
tanguena
ordeal. Xenophobic and warned about European colonial expansion, she persecuted and expelled foreigners, including the island's six British missionaries, who left the island in 1835 not without having established a
Malagasy -English dictionary.
In addition to a prosperous farming activity, the Merina economy was driven by the annual predatory military expeditions against other Madagascar tribes during the dry season. However more and more historians think that she allowed for the unification of Madagascar through
Merina supremacy. These historians do not regard her empire building as colonialism. Robbing and plundering, the Merina forces descended from the highlands and left a destructive path in the countryside. In this war against their own countrymen converted to European religion, she maintained control and supremacy of her loyalists. Dissident religious belief was seen as a decadent European intrusion on traditional Magalasy ways, to be stamped out without mercy.

Part 2
Ranavalona was a violent persecutor of the native Christians after expelling the alien missionaries failed to eradicate
Christianity
from her island. All people who possessed a bible, or outwardly claimed to be Christian, were executed.
Some were trussed up like chickens and thrown from hilltops repeatedly until they died. Others were dressed in the bloody skins of animals and had hunting dogs set upon them. Some were yoked together like cattle and placed in the thick tangled jungles of Madagascar where they would break their necks trying to get free, or would get caught in the undergrowth and starve to death. One of Ranavalona's favorite methods of execution was to have a prisoner placed in a pit at the bottom of a hill and have her soldiers, at the top of the hill, tip over pots of boiling water; when the water reached the pit, it would slowly rise up and boil the prisoner alive.
The French, who held some islands off Madagascar, were interested in gaining control over Madagascar; a move that was opposed by the British who had an interest in maintaining a safe passage to
India . With the abrogation of the Anglo-Merina friendship treaty, however, Ranavalona became vulnerable as British arms were no longer being delivered. She was able to repel a French attack on Foule Point in 1829, but in the long run, she was in a precarious position. Fortunately for her, help arrived when
Jean Laborde
got shipwrecked off Madagascar in 1832.
Laborde was introduced to the Queen and, given his knowledge and background, was commissioned to produce cannons, muskets, and gun powder. He was given the manpower and resources to create an early industrial empire in order to fulfill the needs of a modern army, making the kingdom independent from the supply of weapons from the colonial powers. In addition, there is little doubt that he had to attend to the queen's personal wishes.
Her son, Prince Rakoto, was officially born in 1829 and his official father was King Radama I who had actually died more than nine months prior to the birth. However, according to the local custom of the time he was considered Radama's son. Laborde was close to him and educated him. With mounting hate of the queen's reign, both on Madagascar and in Europe,
Joseph-François Lambert
sought the help of the French to end her reign. He travelled to her court in May 1857, and conspired with Laborde and local leaders to topple her and place her son Rakoto on the throne. The world traveller
Ida Pfeiffer
was unwittingly drawn into the plot. The conspiracy, however, was discovered, locals executed, and the Europeans banned. Ranavalona did not dare to execute the Europeans as not to give cause for reprisals. However, she made sure that the normally week-long trip to the coast became gruesome and protracted to 53 days so that the Europeans arrived emaciated at the embarkment port. Ida Pfeiffer never fully recovered and died the following year, presumably from
malaria .
During the final years of her reign, worried by news about European civilization's expansion over Africa and Asia and the spread of
abolitionist
doctrine, she maintained her brutal and repressive control and kept the slave trade intact. She died peacefully on
August 15 ,
1861
in her sleep after a rule of 33 years. Nearly half of her population had died due to the atrocities of her rule. She had resisted the attempts of the colonial powers to modernize the island for the time being, but modern historians blame this more on the balance of British and French interests in the area, each power preventing the other from taking decisive action. Britain and France came to an agreement in the early 1890's, and soon the island would become a French dominion.
Her son, Prince Rakoto, succeeded her as King
Radama II .

Yikes, she sounds bonkers so far! As for her full first name - can you imagine her parents sitting round discussing baby names? "Oh I think we'll name her something simple, with a million letters!"

Well she did keep the French & English from conquoring her country neither of which had the best record for religious tolerance themselves.
I may not have approved for her methods the ends don't justify the means but I can see why she is not badly regarded in her own land

Yeah, too bad, she didn't die in one of her favorite pits of boiling water. I had never heard of her before. I learn so much here.
