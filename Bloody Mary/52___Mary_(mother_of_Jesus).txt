According to
Pope Benedict XVI , Christians are the most persecuted group in the contemporary world. [1]
According to the World Evangelical Alliance, over 200 million Christians are denied fundamental human rights solely because of their faith. [2]
Persecutions occur in North Korea, many Muslim countries, India, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines.
Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia
Afghanistan
In
Afghanistan ,
Abdul Rahman , a 41-year-old citizen, was charged in 2006 with rejecting Islam ( apostasy ), a crime punishable by death under
Sharia
law. He has since been released into exile in the West under intense pressure from Western governments. [3] [4]
In 2008, the
Taliban
killed a British charity worker,
Gayle Williams , “because she was working for an organisation which was preaching Christianity in Afghanistan” even though she was extremely careful not to try to convert Afghans. [5]
Algeria
On the night of 26–27 March 1996, seven
monks
from the monastery of
Tibhirine
in
Algeria , belonging to the
Roman Catholic
Trappist
Order of
Cistercians
of the Strict Observance (O.C.S.O.), were kidnapped in the
Algerian Civil War . They were held for two months, and were found dead on 21 May 1996. The circumstances of their kidnapping and death remain controversial; the
Armed Islamic Group
(GIA) claims responsibility for both, but the then French military attaché, retired General
Francois Buchwalter , reports that they were accidentally killed by the Algerian army in a rescue attempt, and claims have been made that the GIA itself was a
cat’s paw
of Algeria’s secret services ( DRS ).
Islamists looted, and burned to the ground, a
Pentecostal
church in
Tizi Ouzou
on 9 January 2010. The pastor was quoted as saying that worshipers fled when local police left a gang of local rioters unchecked. [6]
Egypt
See also:
Persecution of Copts
While the Egyptian government does not have a policy to persecute Christians, it discriminates against them and hampers their freedom of worship. Its agencies sporadically persecute Muslim converts to Christianity. [122]
The government enforces
Hamayouni Decree
restrictions on building or repairing churches. These same restrictions, however, do not apply to mosques. [7]
The government has effectively restricted Christians from senior government, diplomatic, military, and educational positions, and there has been increasing discrimination in the private sector. [8] [9]
The government subsidizes media which attack Christianity and restricts Christians access to the state-controlled media. [10]
In
Egypt
the government does not officially recognize conversions from Islam to Christianity; because certain interfaith marriages are not allowed either, this prevents marriages between converts to Christianity and those born in Christian communities, and also results in the children of Christian converts being classified as Muslims and given a Muslim education. [11]
The government also applies religiously discriminatory laws and practices concerning clergy salaries. [12]
Foreign missionaries are allowed in the country only if they restrict their activities to social improvements and refrain from proselytizing. The
Coptic
Pope Shenouda III
was internally exiled in 1981 by President
Anwar Sadat , who then chose five Coptic bishops and asked them to choose a new pope. They refused, and in 1985 President
Hosni Mubarak
restored Pope Shenouda III, who had been accused of fomenting interconfessional strife. Particularly in Upper Egypt, the rise in extremist
Islamist
groups such as the
Gama’at Islamiya
during the 1980s was accompanied by attacks on Copts and on Coptic churches; these have since declined with the decline of those organizations, but still continue. The police have been accused of siding with the attackers in some of these cases. [13]
Many colleges dictate quotas for Coptic students, often around 1 or 2% despite the group making up 15% of the country’s population. There is also a separate tax-funded education system called Al Azhar, catering to students from elementary to college level, which accepts no Christian Coptic students, teachers or administrators.
Hundreds of Christian Coptic girls have been kidnapped and forcibly converted to Islam, as well as being victims of rape and forced marriage to Muslim men. [14]
On 2 January 2000, at least 21
Christians
were killed by
Muslims
in the Al
Kosheh Massacres
in southern Egypt. Christian properties were also burned. [15]
In April 2006, one person was killed and twelve injured in simultaneous knife attacks on three Coptic churches in Alexandria. [16]
In November 2008, several thousand Muslims attacked a Coptic church in a suburb of Cairo on the day of its inauguration, forcing 800 Coptic Christians to barricade themselves in. [17]
In April 2009, two
Christian
men were shot dead and another was injured by
Muslim
men after an
Easter
vigil in the south of
Egypt . [18]
On 18 September 2009, a Muslim man, Osama Araban, beheaded a
Coptic Christian
man in the village of
Bagour , and injured 2 others in 2 different villages. He was arrested the following day. [19]
On the eve of 7 January 2010, Copts were going out of Mar-Yuhanna (St. John) church in
Nag Hammadi
city when three
Muslim
men in a car near the church opened fire killing 8
Christians
and injuring another 10. [20] [21]
On 2011 New Year’s Eve, as
Christians
were leaving a
Coptic Orthodox Church
in the city of
Alexandria
after a New Year’s Eve service a car bomb exploded in front of the Church killing more than 20 and injuring more than 75. [22] [23] [24]
On 7 May 2011, an armed group of Islamists, attacked and set fire to two churches including
Saint Menas
Coptic Orthodox Christian Church and the Coptic Church of the Holy Virgin, in
Cairo . The attacks resulted in the deaths of 12 people and more than 230 wounded. It is reported that the events were triggered by a mixed marriage between a Christian woman and a Muslim man. [25]
In July 2012,
Dahshur ‘s entire Christian community, which some estimate to be as many as 100 families, fled to nearby towns due to sectarian violence. The violence began in a dispute over a badly ironed shirt, which in turn escalated into a fight in which a Christian burned a Muslim to death, which in turn sparked a rampage by angry Muslims, while the police failed to act. At least 16 homes and properties of Christians were pillaged, some were torched, and a church was damaged during the violence. [26]
Indonesia
In January 1999 [27] [28]
tens of thousands died when Muslim gunmen terrorized Christians who had voted for independence in
East Timor . [29]
In
Indonesia , religious conflicts have typically occurred in
Western New Guinea ,
Maluku
(particularly
Ambon ), and
Sulawesi . The presence of Muslims in these regions is in part a result of the
transmigrasi
program of population re-distribution. Conflicts have often occurred because of the aims of radical
Islamist
organizations such as
Jemaah Islamiah
or
Laskar Jihad
to impose
Sharia , [140] [141]
with such groups attacking Christians and destroying over 600 churches. [30]
In 2006 three Christian girls were beheaded as retaliation for previous Muslim deaths in Christian-Muslim rioting. [31]
The men were imprisoned for the murders, including Jemaah Islamiyah’s district ringleader Hasanuddin. [32]
On going to jail, Hasanuddin said, “It’s not a problem (if I am being sentenced to prison), because this is a part of our struggle.” [33]
Later on November 2011, another attack from Islamic community happen in Ambon. Muslims set fire to several Christian houses, forcing the occupants to leave the buildings. [146]
In December 2011, a second church in
Bogor ,
West Java
was ordered to halt its activities by the local mayor. Another Catholic church had been built there in 2005. Previously a Christian church, GKI Taman Yasmin, had been sealed. Local authorities refused to lift a ban on the activities of the church, despite an order from the
Supreme Court of Indonesia . [34]
Local authorities have persecuted the Christian church for three years. While the state has ordered religious toleration, it has not enforced these orders. [35]
In
Aceh Province , the only province in
Indonesia
with autonomous Islamic Shari’a Law, 20 churches in
Singkil Regency
face threat of demolition due to gubernatorial decree requires the approval of 150 worshippers, while the ministrial decree also requires the approval of 60 local residents of different faiths. On 30 April 2012, all the 20 churches (17 Protestant churches, 2 Catholic churches and one place of worship belonging to followers of a local nondenominational faith) have been closed down by ordered from the Acting Regent which also ordered members of the congregations to tear down the churches by themselves. Most of the churches slated for demolition were built in 1930s and 1940s, and now the regency only has 2 churches open, both built after 2000. [36] [37]
Iran
See also:
Christianity in Iran
Though
Iran
recognizes
Assyrian
and
Armenian
Christians as ethnic and religious minorities (along with
Jews
and
Zoroastrians ) and they have representatives in the
Parliament , after the
1979 Revolution , Muslim converts to Christianity (typically to Protestant Christianity) have been arrested and sometimes executed. [38]
Youcef Nadarkhani
is an Iranian Christian pastor who has been sentenced to death for refusing to recant his faith. [39]
Iraq
According to
UNHCR , although Christians (almost exclusively ethnic
Assyrians
and
Armenians ) represent less than 5% of the total Iraqi population, they make up 40% of the refugees now living in nearby countries. [40]
Northern Iraq remained predominantly
Assyrian ,
Aramaic
speaking and
Christian
until the destructions of
Tamerlane
at the end of the 14th century. The
Assyrian Church of the East
has its origin in what is now South East
Turkey
and
Assuristan
(Sassanid
Assyria ). By the end of the 13th century there were twelve
Nestorian
dioceses in a strip from
Peking
to
Samarkand . When the 14th-century Muslim warlord of Turco-Mongol descent,
Timur
(Tamerlane), conquered
Persia ,
Mesopotamia
and
Syria , the civilian population was decimated. Timur had 70,000
Assyrian Christians
beheaded in
Tikrit , and 90,000 more in
Baghdad . [41] [42]
In the 16th century, Christians were half the population of Iraq. [43]
In 1987, the last Iraqi census counted 1.4 million Christians. [44]
They were tolerated under the
secular
regime of
Saddam Hussein , who even made one of them,
Tariq Aziz
his deputy. However persecution by Saddam Hussein continued against the Christians on an ethnic, cultural and racial level, as the vast majority are Mesopotamian Aramaic speaking Ethnic Assyrians (aka
Chaldo-Assyrians ). The Assyrian -Aramaic language and written script was repressed, the giving of Hebraic/Aramaic Christian names or
Akkadian / Assyrio-Babylonian
names forbidden(Tariq Aziz real name is Michael Youhanna for example), and Saddam exploited religious differences between Assyrian denominations such as
Chaldean Catholics ,
Assyrian Church of the East ,
Syriac Oryhodox
and
Ancient Church of the East Many . Assyrians were ethnically cleansed from their towns and villages under the Anfal Campaign in 1988.
Recently, Chaldo-Assyrian Christians have seen their total numbers slump to about 500,000 to 800,000 today, of whom 250,000 live in
Baghdad . [158]
An exodus to the neighboring countries of
Syria ,
Jordan
and
Turkey
has left behind closed parishes, seminaries and convents. As a small minority, who until recently were without a militia of their own, Assyrian Christians have been persecuted by both
Shi’a
and
Sunni
Muslim militias,
Kurdish
Nationalists, and also by criminal gangs. [45] [46]
Many Assyrian Christians are departing for their ancestral heartlands in the
Nineveh plains
around Mosul. Assyrian militias have recently been set up to protect villages and towns [47] [48]
As of 21 June 2007, the
UNHCR
estimated that 2.2 million Iraqis had been displaced to neighboring countries, and 2 million were displaced internally, with nearly 100,000 Iraqis fleeing to Syria and Jordan each month. [49] [50]
A 25 May 2007 article notes that in the past seven months only 69 people from
Iraq
have been granted
refugee
status in the United States. [51]
In 2007,
Chaldean
Catholic priest Fr.
Ragheed Aziz Ganni
and subdeacons Basman Yousef Daud, Wahid Hanna Isho, and Gassan Isam Bidawed were killed in the ancient city of
Mosul . [52]
Fr. Ragheed Aziz Ganni was driving with his three deacons when they were stopped and demanded to convert to Islam, when they refused they were shot. [53]
Six months later, the body of
Paulos Faraj Rahho , archbishop of
Mosul , was found buried near
Mosul . He was kidnapped on 29 February 2008 when his bodyguards and driver were killed. [54]
In 2004, five churches were destroyed by bombing. Tens of thousands of Christians fled the country. [55] [56]
In 2010-11-01 was an attack on the
Our Lady of Salvation
Syriac Catholic
cathedral [57]
of
Baghdad ,
Iraq , that took place during Sunday evening
Mass
on 31 October 2010. The attack left at least 58 people dead, after more than 100 had been taken hostage. The
al-Qaeda -linked
Sunni
insurgent group [58]
The
Islamic State of Iraq
claimed responsibility for the attack; though Shia cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Iraq’s highest Catholic cleric condemned the attack, amongst others.
Lebanon
The war in Lebanon saw a number of massacres of both Christians and Muslims. Among the earliest was the
Damour Massacre
in 1976 when Palestinian militias attacked Christian civilians. According to an eyewitness: The attack took place from the mountain behind “It was an apocalypse,” [said Father Mansour Labaky, a Christian Maronite priest who survived the massacre at Damour:] ‘They were coming, thousands and thousands, shouting “Allahu Akbar! (God is great!) Let us attack them for the Arabs, let us offer a holocaust to Mohammad!”, And they were slaughtering everyone in their path, men, women and children.’ [59] [60] [61]
The persecution in Lebanon combined sectarian, political, ideological, and retaliation reasons. The
Syrian regime
was also involved in persecuting Christians as well as Muslims in Lebanon.
In 2002, a currently unidentified gunman killed Bonnie Penner Witherall at a prenatal clinic in
Sidon, Lebanon . She had been
proselytizing
and attempting to convert Muslims to Christianity. [62]
Malaysia
See also:
Freedom of religion in Malaysia
In
Malaysia , although Islam is the official religion, Christianity is mostly tolerated.However, to be a member of the majority race (the
Malays ), one is legally required to be a Muslim. If a non-Muslim marries a Muslim, they are legally required to convert to Islam. There has been a debate over whether Malaysia is a liberal
Islamic state
or a very religious
secular state .
Christians are forbidden to proselytize Muslims. Only Muslims are allowed to proselytize. In the 21st century, Christians have been accused of proselytizing Muslims. This accusation led to a raid on a Christian church by the
Religious Police . [63]
Pakistan
In
Pakistan
1.5% of the population are
Christian .
Pakistani law
mandates that “ blasphemies ” of the
Qur’an
are to be met with punishment. Ayub Masih, a Christian, was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to death in 1998. He was accused by a neighbor of stating that he supported British writer
Salman Rushdie , author of
The Satanic Verses . Lower appeals courts upheld the conviction. However, before the
Pakistan Supreme Court , his lawyer was able to prove that the accuser had used the conviction to force Masih’s family off their land and then acquired control of the property. Masih has been released. [64]
In October 2001, gunmen on motorcycles opened fire on a Protestant congregation in the
Punjab , killing 18 people. The identify of the gunmen are unknown. Officials think it might be a
banned
Islamic group. [65]
In March 2002, five people were killed in an attack on a church in
Islamabad , including an American schoolgirl and her mother. [66]
In August 2002, masked gunmen stormed a Christian missionary school for foreigners in Islamabad, six people were killed and three injured. None of those killed were children of foreign missionaries. [67]
In August 2002, grenades were thrown at a church in the grounds of a Christian hospital in north-west Pakistan, near Islamabad, killing three nurses. [68]
On 25 September 2002 two terrorists entered the “Peace and Justice Institute”,
Karachi , where they separated Muslims from the Christians, and then murdered seven Christians by shooting them in the head. [69] [70]
All of the victims were Pakistani Christians. Karachi police chief Tariq Jamil said the victims had their hands tied and their mouths had been covered with tape.
In December 2002, three young girls were killed when hand grenade was thrown into a church near Lahore on Christmas Day. [71]
In November 2005 3,000 militant Islamists attacked Christians in Sangla Hill in Pakistan and destroyed
Roman Catholic ,
Salvation Army
and United
Presbyterian
churches. The attack was over allegations of violation of blasphemy laws by a Pakistani Christian named Yousaf Masih. The attacks were widely condemned by some political parties in Pakistan. [72]
On 5 June 2006 a Pakistani Christian stonemason, Nasir Ashraf, was working near
Lahore
when he drank water from a public facility using a glass chained to the facility. He was assaulted by Muslims for “Polluting the glass”. A mob developed, who beat Ashraf, calling him a “Christian dog”. Bystanders encouraged the beating and joined in. Ashraf was eventually hospitalized. [73]
One year later, in August 2007, a Christian missionary couple, Rev. Arif and Kathleen Khan, were gunned down by militant Islamists in
Islamabad . Pakistani police believed that the murders was committed by a member of Khan’s parish over alleged sexual harassment by Khan. This assertion is widely doubted by Khan’s family as well as by Pakistani Christians. [74] [75]
In August 2009, six
Christians , including 4 women and a child, were burnt alive by
Muslim
militants and a
church
set ablaze in
Gojra , Pakistan when
violence
broke out after alleged desecration of a
Qur’an
in a wedding ceremony by Christians. [76] [77]
On 8 November 2010, a Christian woman from
Punjab Province ,
Asia Noreen Bibi , was sentenced to death by hanging for violating Pakistan’s blasphemy law. The accusation stemmed from a 2009 incident in which Bibi became involved in a religious argument after offering water to thirsty Muslim farm workers. The workers later claimed that she had blasphemed the Prophet Muhammed. As of 8 April 2011, Bibi is in solitary confinement. Her family has fled. No one in Pakistan convicted of blasphemy has ever been executed. A cleric has offered $5,800 to anyone who kills her. [78] [79]
On 2 March 2011, the only Christian minister in the Pakistan government was shot dead. He was targeted for opposing the anti-free speech
“blasphemy” law , which punishes insulting Islam or its Prophet. [80]
A fundamentalist Muslim group claimed responsibility. [81]
Saudi Arabia
“Non-Muslim Bypass:” Non-Muslims are barred from entering
Mecca . An example of
religious segregation . [82] [83 ]

Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia
is an
Islamic state
that practices
Wahhabism
and restricts all other religions, including the possession of religious items such as the Bible, crucifixes, and Stars of David. [197]
Christians are arrested and lashed in public for practicing their faith openly. [84]
Strict
sharia
is enforced. Muslims are forbidden to convert to another religion. If one does so and does not recant, they may be executed.
Somalia
In
Somalia
25 November 2010 Nurta Mohamed Farah, age 17. was shot and killed after fleeing her parents home where she had endured much torture and drugging, by them, in hopes that she would renounce her faith in Jesus Christ. [85]
Sudan
In Sudan, it is estimated that over 1.5 million Christians have been killed by the
Janjaweed , the Arab Muslim militia, and even suspected
Islamists
in northern Sudan since 1984.
It should also be noted that Sudan’s several
civil wars
(which often take the form of genocidal campaigns) are often not only or purely religious in nature, but also ethnic, as many black Muslims, as well as Muslim Arab tribesmen, have also been killed in the conflicts.
It is estimated that as many as 200,000 people had been taken into
slavery
during the
Second Sudanese Civil War . The slaves are mostly
Dinka
people. [86] [87]
Tunisia
Since the
Tunisian revolution
of 2011, there has been religious violence consisting of Muslim attacks on Christians in Tunisia. [88]
Turkey
In modern
Turkey , the
Istanbul pogrom
was a state-sponsored and state-orchestrated
pogrom
that compelled Greek Christians to leave
Istanbul , the first Christian city in violation to the
Treaty of Lausanne
(see
Istanbul Pogrom ). The issue of Christian genocides by the Turks may become a problem, since Turkey wishes to join the
European Union . [89]
The
Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople
is still in a difficult position. Turkey requires by law that the
Ecumenical Patriarch
must be an
ethnic Greek , holding Turkish citizenship by birth, although most of the
Greek minority
has been expelled. The state’s expropriation of church property and the closing of the Orthodox
Theological School of Halki
are also difficulties faced by the Church of Constantinople. Despite appeals from the United States, the
European Union
and various governmental and non-governmental organizations, the School remains closed since 1971. In November 2007, a 17th century chapel of
Our Lord’s Transfiguration
at the Halki seminary was almost totally demolished by the Turkish forestry authority. [205]
There was no advanced warning given for the demolition work and it was only stopped after appeals by the
Ecumenical Patriarch . [90]
Persecution of Christians has continued in modern Turkey. On 5 February 2006, the Catholic priest
Andrea Santoro
was murdered in
Trabzon
by a student influenced by the reactions following the
Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy . [91]
On 18 April 2007, 3 Christians were murdered in the
bible publishing firm
in
Malatya , [92] [93]
coincidentally, the hometown of
Mehmet Ali Ağca , the assassin who shot and wounded
Pope John Paul II
on 13 May 1981. In December 2007, Adriano Franchini, a catholic priest of the
Capuchin order
in Turkey, was stabbed in the stomach after Sunday mass. Franchini led the church of the
Virgin Mary
in
Ephesus . [94]
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
Turkey invaded Cyprus
in 1974. The United Nations has documented their systematic destruction of churches of the
Church of Cyprus
from 1974 though 2003. [95] [96]
Many churches were vandalized and their artifacts stolen. [97]
Church mosaics and frescoes were removed and ended up in Europe’s black market or sold openly in specialist stores and auction-houses. Some churches were demolished and some have had their use changed to mosques and stables. [98]
Yemen
Three Christian missionaries were killed in their hospital in Jibla,
Yemen
in December 2002. A gunman, apprehended by the authorities, said that he did it “for his religion.” [99]
Other countries with large Muslim populations
India
Muslims in India who convert to Christianity have been subjected to harassment, intimidation, and attacks by Muslims. In
Jammu and Kashmir , the only Indian state with a Muslim majority, a Christian convert and missionary, Bashir Tantray, was killed, allegedly by militant Islamists in 2006. [100]
A Christian priest, K.K. Alavi, a 1970 convert from Islam, [101]
thereby raised the ire of his former Muslim community and received many death threats. An Islamic terrorist group named “The
National Development Front ” actively campaigned against him. [102]
In the southern state of India,
Kerala ,
Islamic Terrorists chopped off the hand of Professor T.J.Joseph due to allegation of blasphemy of prophet .
Nigeria
In the 11 Northern states of
Nigeria
that have introduced the Islamic system of law, the
Sharia , sectarian clashes between Muslims and Christians have resulted in many deaths, and some churches have been burned. More than 30,000 Christians were displaced from their homes
Kano , the largest city in northern Nigeria. [103]
Boko Haram
conducts terrorist attacks against Christians.
Philippines
In the Philippines, the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front
and
Abu Sayyaf
has attacked and killed Christians. [104]
India

Anti-Christian violence in India
See also:
Religious violence in Orissa
The
Sangh Parivar
and related organisations have stated that the violence is an expression of “spontaneous anger” of “vanvasis” against “ forcible conversion ” activities undertaken by missionaries. These claims have been disputed by Christians [105]
a belief described as
mythical [106]
and
propaganda
by Sangh Parivar; [107]
the Parivar objects in any case to all conversions as a “threat to national unity”. [108]
Religious scholar Cyril Veliath of
Sophia University
stated that the Hindu attacks on Christians were the work of individuals motivated by “disgruntled politicians or phony religious leaders” and where religion is concerned the typical Hindu is an “exceptionally amicable and tolerant person (…) Hinduism as a religion could well be one of the most accommodating in the world. Rather than confront and destroy, it has a tendency to welcome and assimilate.” [109]
According to Rudolf C Heredia, religious conversion was a critical issue even before the creation of the modern state. Whereas
Nehru
wanted to establish a “a secular state in a religious society” [110]
Gandhi
opposed the Christian missionaries calling them as the remnants of colonial Western culture. [111]
He claimed that by converting into Christianity, Hindus have changed their nationality. [112]
In
its controversial annual human rights reports
for 1999, the
United States Department of State
criticised India for “increasing societal violence against Christians.”The report listed over 90 incidents of anti-Christian violence, ranging from damage of religious property to violence against Christians pilgrims. [113]
In 1997, twenty-four such incidents were reported. [114]
Recent waves of anti-conversion laws in various Indian states passed by some states is claimed to be a gradual and continuous institutionalization of
Hindutva
by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour of the US State Department. [115]
In July 2006, Madhya Pradesh government passed legislation requiring people who desire to convert to a different religion to provide the government with one-month’s notice, or face fines and penalties. [116]
In August 2006, the
Chhattisgarh
State Assembly passed similar legislation requiring anyone who desires to convert to another religion to give 30 days’ notice to the district magistrate. [117]
China

Christianity in China
The communist government of the People’s Republic of China tries to maintain tight control over all religions, so the only legal Christian Churches ( Three-Self Patriotic Movement
and
Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association ) are those under the
Communist Party of China
control. Churches which are not controlled by the government are shut down, and their members are imprisoned.
In 2009, Christians must worship in registered, regulated churches. According to the Jubilee Campaign, an interdenominational lobby group, about 300 Christians caught attending unregistered
“house churches”
were in jail in 2004.
Gong Shengliang, head of the South China Church, was sentenced to death in 2001. Although his sentence was commuted to a jail sentence,
Amnesty International
reports that he has been tortured.

The establishment of
French Indochina
once led to a high Christian population. Regime changes throughout the 19th and 20th centuries led to some increased persecution of minority religious groups. Killings, torture or imprisonment and forced starvation of local groups are common in parts of Vietnam and Laos, especially in more recent years. [119]
