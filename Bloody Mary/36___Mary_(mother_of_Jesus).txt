Back in November  IrishCentral reported  that an
Irish American
tourist believed she saw
Jesus
in the
Cliffs of Moher
and now a 19-year-old from
County Laois
swears that the
bruise
on his thigh is an apparition of the
Lord .
Joe.ie  reports that Martin Carroll studies primary school teaching in Marino,
North Dublin . This bruise was the result of a nasty wallop during a hurling clash.

Apparitions of Jesus in
Ireland .
“Surely by now you’ve heard of the most recent sighting in Ireland – an American pilot who claims to have seen and photographed the image of  Christ at the Cliffs of Moher . Her sighting has come to find good company with others around Ireland. Here are some of the reported religious apparitions from Ireland.
1. Virgin and Child on stump in Rathkeale, Limerick
Legend has it that a female spectre which haunted the churchyard in Rathkeale, Limerick, was so terrifying that all who looked upon her died soon after. A local man banished the ghost by slicing off her arm with his sword and praying for the rest of the night. In an odd coincidence in 2009, the Limerick Newsire reported that a tree stump in the churchyard contains the image of the
Virgin Mary
and Child, and that hundreds of visitors had come to the area to pray.
2. Weeping Statue in Dungloe at the Kerrytown shrine in Donegal (2009)
The Independent reports that on September 29, 2009, fourteen people claimed to witness crosses that formed in the sky above the shrine, before the statue became animated and began to weep. The shrine had become a popular site after producing a religious apparition seventy years ago.
3. Kerrytown, Donegal (1939)
Perhaps further supporting the 2009 visions in Dungloe, visions were reported here in 1939 also. An
apparition of the Virgin Mary
appeared on a dark knight to be shining bright on a nearby granite rock.
