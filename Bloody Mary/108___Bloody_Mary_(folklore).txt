Prophet / Lilith / Angels
Sam and Dean are shocked to discover a series of books entitled "Supernatural" that accurately detail their lives as demon hunters. They confront the oblivious author (a brazen and young man by the name of Chuck Shirley) who, it turns out, is a prophet of the Lord. Chuck describes an encounter Sam will soon have with Lilith, and while Dean wants to avoid her, Sam wants to face her. Castiel tells Dean that prophecies can't be averted, while the boys alternately prepare for and try to avoid their fates, but Dean learns that if a prophet were to be in the same room as an demon a battle would take place. Dean was puzzled by this, but Castiel made it clear that prophets are protected by archangels(the most fiercest weapon of heaven). Dean thanks Castiel and takes Chuck to their motel room where they find Sam and Lilith. Dean warns Lilith about the archangel and Lilith escapes.
