I live in BDR, Bandar DiRaja. Ah Longs are common here, Ah Bengs and Ah Lians also live here. We greet people with unique ..|.. hand gesture. We greet your mom if you stare at us. We cucuk your car if you hog the road. We invent innovative double parking technique. One way street here means one-&-the-other-way street. Welcome to Bandar DiRaja, the town with largest Gagak population and second largest human population in this BullehLand. Nothing is impossible here.

Sri Ayutthaya Thai Restaurant @ USJ
It's one of the weekends that my sis suddenly craved for durian. So we headed to USJ area for our dinner in the plan to drop by the
durian stall
nearby. Turned into the housing area with only 2 rows of shops in the vicinity which you would not expect a fine dining restaurant operate here... Sri Ayutthaya Restaurant. An authentic Thai restaurant, begins
with its genuine Thai style setup... As authentic as the waitress was in Thai traditional garment. Now the food... The coconut juice with
lychees , that's what I was told. But in fact, it's lychee juice with 2 slim slices of coconut. The
dragon fruit
juice... Looks like
Bloody Mary . I never like dragon fruit in particular the red dragon fruit, it looks dirty to me. Come to dishes, for sure the dish you wouldn't want to miss when dine in a Thai restaurant... The
Tom Yam Goong . Not as hot spicy as I expected, but my bro in law was already sweaty wet like standing in the rain. Hehe... Now the green curry... Watch out chili padi or pepper seed when you enjoy this dish, if you are not a spice taker. The
Kai Lan
with salty fish... It's a very common dish but it tasted good. Try the crispy salty fish. Finally the baby squids... High cholesterol but very fresh and "cute" to chew. The bill was +/- RM150 for 4, very reasonable price for a dinner. It would be a lot cheaper if we did not order juices that attributed 25% of the bill. And mind you, unlike other fine dining restaurants, we specifically ordered small or medium size for all dishes, but the serving was big that we had portion of them leftover. Sri Ayutthaya has 2 branches. The first is located in Bangsar, next to Victoria Station... GPS Coordinates: N3 08.376 E101 39.467. The one I visited is at USJ 11/3J... click to enlarge GPS Coordinates: N3 02.826 E101 34.810. You can get both details in MFM map.
