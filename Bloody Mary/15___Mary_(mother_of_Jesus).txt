Sir,
Being a citizen of India ,I Mamta Dhody Kalra,resident of 1513,Outram Lane ,Mukherjee Nagar
,Delhi ,would like to bring to your notice matters of national security and relevance which have come to my notice on my consistent and pertinent
perusal of National Newspapers ; as well as events that have taken place in my life and my family members inclusive of my immediate maternal/paternal family stationed in Jabalpur at the address –MIG-22; Katanga Housing Board Colony ,Jabalpur 482001.My endeavor is laced with patriotism and high regard for
the judiciary as the most important organ of the country,and definitely not to offend its sensibilities. I am empowered by the Constitution of India which is the protector of my Fundamental Rights as a citizen of undivided
India [Part 3-Articles 12 -to - 35] and directs me to fulfill my Fundamental Duties [Part 4 / 4A
,Article 51A]-as a citizen of this country.Refer to Page 1.
Please be informed that the majority religion of this country called India is Hinduism ,which is empowered by love and peace principles and does not recognize terror and violence ; but rejects cowardice.Every religion has its own symbolism which is manifested in the form of significant names ,dates/numbers
and
colors.Usually we see a psychological manifestation of the same in the day to day life of followers of different faiths.How this becomes pertinent to the Judiciary is the all too powerful words called
“Mens Rea”.
Whenever any crime is commited two words come to the fore :-
1.
Actus
reus
Latin for a "guilty act." The actus
reus
is the act which, in combination with a certain mental state, such as intent or recklessness, constitutes a
crime . For example, the crime of theft
requires physically taking something (the actus
reus ) coupled with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the object (the mental state, or
mens rea ).
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actus_reus
2.Mens Rea
The mental component of criminal liability. To be guilty of most crimes, a defendant must have committed the criminal act (the actus
reus ) in a certain mental state (the mens rea). The mens rea of robbery, for example, is the intent to permanently deprive the owner of his property.
Criminal intent . The state of mind indicating culpability which is required by statute as an element of a crime.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea
The terms actus reus and mens rea are derived from the principle stated by
Edward Coke , namely, rectus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea,1 which means: "an act does not make a person guilty unless (their) mind is also guilty", i.e., the general test is one that requires proof of fault, culpability or blameworthiness both in behaviour and mind.
RELIGION FORMS THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENT OF THE MIND.
There are certain symbols of faith .For example muslims impose green color ,the number 22 after their Hegira of 622
and Hindus orange color as well as the number 13 which is representative of the 13 th
Samskara of marriage and 13 th
day of Death rituals.Number 16 denotes the death Samskara of Hindus.Dance and music is attributed to the Natraja image of Shiva as the protector of the Universe as well as its destroyer ;and the death /MOKSHA principle of Hindus.Hindus attach special importance to this as it is said that music and dance are supposed to be dear both to God Hanumanji as well as Shivaji and they are believed to shower their blessings and prevail peace on Earth ..Any religion which bears feelings of enmity with this will try to flout the music principle as well as inflict terrorism on the 13 th
day as well as insult the feelings of brotherhood which should prevail in fellow citizens living with feelings of peace and tolerance with each other.
All these things have to be kept in mind by the judiciary while judging simple cases .They become very important when class and religion/ethnic violence takes place and the judiciary like Sherlock Holmes have to get at the perpetrator of class illwill
,hate and crime..The 1984 Sikh riots,Gujrat clashes all were not aimed at a class of people ,but if properly investigated were instigated by a very evil nexus of selfishness on the part of certain class of people for religious dominance and ill begotten wealth having filthy criminal undertones . The media as well as the Judiciary up till now have only laid stress on who suffered and how much compensation is to be given ,without going into the roots of why such violence took place.Just opposite to this are the sufferings of the Kashmiri Brahmins a Peaceful class of people who were subjected to rape and violence only for the purpose of Thuggee and looting on the part of the perpetrators. So proper investigation becomes a must ,for the same thumb rule does not apply to every ethnic clash . For example inflicting/instilling
terror into the hearts
,especially psychological ;is the patent of the Koran for the unbelievers in Islam.Please refer to the pages 254-407
and
the letter to the DG ASI on psychological terrorism ,from pages 398-407.
I am quoting
incidents from my own life so that they form a frame of reference just like quotation of cases from law journals ,as well as the fact that my paternal family was an illustrious family who were punished for being good and changing religion to Sanatan Hinduism from Sikhism.
I am also going to include the parts of the judgmentsgiven by the courts in italics for reference in this letter.
The first case is of Mohammad Afzal Guru ,who along with other terrorists was party to the attack on Parliament on 13-12-2001,the year in USA when supposedly OSAMA toppled the World Trade Tower on 11/9/2001.Let me first apologize to the Judiciary for dissecting their judgement .But when National interests take a setback the common citizen has to intervene.Refer to :-

Pakistan
President Pervez Musharraf said
on Monday that if provided evidence, he would take action against the
militant groups accused by

“The genesis of this case lies in a macabre incident that took place close to the noon time on 13th December, 2001 in which five heavily armed persons practically stormed the Parliament House complex and inflicted heavy casualties on the security men on duty. This unprecedented event bewildered the entire nation and sent shock waves across the globe. In the gun battle that lasted for 30 minutes or so, these five terrorists who tried to gain entry into the Parliament when it was in session, were killed. Nine persons including eight security personnel and one gardener succumbed to the bullets of the terrorists and 16 persons including 13 security men received injuries.--------------------------
The appeals filed by the State against the acquittal of S.A.R. Gilani and Afsan Guru are hereby dismissed.”
The points that I would like to bring before the judiciary which I found deficient are:-
1.The Parliament attack was not a solitary incident of bombing a highway by terrorists but an attack on the very structure and ethos /psyche
of
India
and its polit bearers and would have resulted in a declaration of emergency.
2.The investigation team of the Police had no interaction with the rest of the terrorists in the gang still absconding ,inspite of being given full knowledge by Mohd.Afzal about the hide outs of terror equipment /arms in
Delhi
and his arrest in Shrinagar.They investigated only those on the cell phone records of deceased or arrested terrorists.
{“triggering off extensive and effective investigations spread over a short span of 17 days which revealed the possible involvement of the four accused persons who are either appellants or respondents herein and some other proclaimed offenders said to be the leaders of the banned militant organization known as "Jaish-E-Mohammed". After the conclusion of investigation, the investigating agency filed the report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. against the four accused persons on 14.5.2002. Charges were framed under various sections of Indian Penal Code (for short 'IPC'), the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as 'POTA') and the Explosive Substances Act by the designated Court.
The designated Special Court presided over by Shri S.N. Dhingra tried the accused on the charges and the trial concluded within a record period of about six months. 80 witnesses were examined for the prosecution and 10 witnesses were examined on behalf of the accused S.A.R. Gilani. Plethora of documents (about 330 in number) were exhibited. The three accused, namely, Mohd. Afzal, Shaukat Hussain Guru and S.A.R. Gilani were convicted for the offences under Sections 121, 121A, 122, Section 120B read with Sections 302 & 307 read with Section 120-B IPC, sub-Sections (2), (3) & (5) of Section 3 and Section 4(b) of POTA and Sections 3 & 4 of Explosive Substances Act. The accused 1 & 2 were also convicted under Section 3(4) of POTA.”}
3.For a case of such magnitude the days given to the investigation were 17 and the investigative agency is also named.The case had to be transferred to the CBI/CID KASHMIR for finding out the terror links of the accused who conspired to blow up the Indian Parliament.
4.Death sentence was imposed without through investigation of the case ,inspite of having such dreaded terrorists in their hands as well as the Interpol was not alerted for possible extradition of other terror links seeing the extreme benevolence of even powerful countries like the USA who have promised a war on terror.Even Musharraf Sahib had promised to co operate as is evident from the video clip link enclosed;in the beginning of this letter.
No efforts were made by the police or the CBI in
Delhi
as well as
Kashmir
and no team of
Delhi
police visited Shrinagar/J&K to find out about all the terror machines involved in the Attack on Parliament in which so many honest officers lost their lives.
Disgusted relatives of the same even refused gold medals as their martyrdom had gone waste and only merited the garlands of the publicity hungry political leaders roaming about with Z security and burning up valuable Indian money in their maintenance. The same should have been given to the honest police team who would have visited the locales of
Kashmir
amidst terror and won back the homes of the Kashmiri Brahmins.
5.The Supreme Court can order an investigation on the same only if it is directed to do so and no one amidst the entire Parliamentarian leaders felt the need to order an extensive investigation into the same.HANGING AFZAL WILL NOT END TERROR IN KASHMIR ,NEITHER WILL IT WIN BACK THE HOMES OF THE PANDITS.Rather it will serve to eliminate the only sources of information available to the investigative agencies of the Indian Government.
6.I beg the judiciary to order an extensive investigation into the Parliament Attack Case and make the Delhi Police and CBI an authority on the Same with the recruitment of the bravest officers from all over
India
and Protection for their children and Homes,along with handsome compensation in event of martyrdom.

{“(iii)
Five heavily armed persons entered the Parliament House complex
in a white Ambassador Car. The said five persons (hereinafter referred to as the 'slain' or 'deceased terrorists') were heavily armed with automatic assault rifles, pistols, hand and rifle grenades, electronic detonators, spare ammunition, explosives in the form of improvised explosive devices viz., tiffin bombs and a sophisticated bomb in a container in the boot of the car made
with enormous quantity of ammonium nitrate. The High Court observed: "The fire power was awesome enough to engage a battalion and had the attack succeeded, the entire building with all inside would have perished."”}
7.No effort was made on part of the Police to investigate as to how these terrorists could procure so many arms ,who was behind the group “ Jaish”,What was their source of “Finance” and whether INTERPOL COULD HAVE HELPED IN A CASE OF SUCH MAGNIMITY.INTERPOL REPORT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE JUDICIARY IN THIS CASE.
http://www.interpol.int/
8.No effort was also made to find out the links of these terrorists with the underworld of Mumbai who are their main tools in India.If a perusal is done to what happened in my family ,the honorable court will see that it was not terrorists who attacked my home ,but criminal elements of Mumbai underworld .Latika Rana’s selection in the prelims of the Judicial services examination in 2005 ,when her family created terror in my house no. 1513,her serial number 72 in the list submitted being the number of the Indian evidence Act of 1872,her links with my husband ,her signing of the tenant papers in my house with only “Latika” and her tenancy in my house without any books all show how terror equipment is selected in the Judiciary itself and they work for the Syndicate ,in their entire career .If the learned court will see the List it begins with a muslim name:-

Also I had suggested religious intervention through same in the BABRI MASJID DEMOLITION CASE by virtue of GROUP MIND.Refer to pages-61-to -62, to the High Court in 2004 by sending Fax.
9.There are serious apprehensions on my part as to the exams conducted for Judicial Services wherein the candidates have no knowledge or experience of the Judiciary ,its journals ,books or cases ,wherein the admissions are ruled by the tuition centre targets of Mukherjee Nagar Delhi,and their nefarious connections with the underworld.What kind of judgment system can we hope for after this?.Please refer to pages 50-to-112. A woman who was so involved in creating terrorism in my house had the time to study for judicial services exam also?With her mobile in her mouth all the time and spying on all that was being done in my house and timing her visits to coincide with my sojourns outside the four walls of my house,and having no books of value /law journals or membership to any library ,when did Latika Rana know how to deliver judgements in the Judiciary of Delhi,especially being a bonafide resident of Meerut and having no knowledge about Delhi?The whole escapade reeks of corruption and farce
and should be sent to the vigilance department of the High Court as to how they feel justified in appointing residents of Meerut to Delhi High Court?
“Six fake identity cards purportedly issued by Xansa Websity, 37, Bungalow Road, New Delhi to different students with their address as 120-A, Adarsh Nagar, Delhi and the telephone number as 9811489429.”
10.As I have apprised the Court of the purport of psychological implications of religious numbers ,whence 7 is used to indicate the Ram Avtaar;8 of Krishna Avtaar of Vishnuji,the number 37 is used for either the ARYA SAMAJ ACT OF 1937 or the demeaning ARTICLE 370 of Kashmir.BOTH ARE SURVIVING BY THE LUST AND GREED OF MEN AND WOMEN FOR ALL THAT THEY CANNOT HAVE LEGALLY AND INVOLVES KILLING OF INNOCENT MOTHERS ,AN ATTACK ON THE VERY FABRIC AND CULTURE OF HINDU SOCIETY AS WELL AS THE ORGAN TRADE OF THE MULTI CRORE MEDICAL TOURISM in India ,AN EXAMPLE BEING GANGA RAM HOSPITAL,DELHI.For this purpose itself Arya Samaj had demanded minority status to increase their numbers and medical termination of innocent women whence they can get old men married to women young enough to be their daughters ,first convert to shia muslim religion and get married by the Registration of Marriages Act 1955, kill first wife medically ,sell her body and organs and get free top medical care for disease ridden body of old man and benefit of his post in Government hierarchy,and then drink cow urine and reconvert to Hinduism by Arya Samaj minus idols,holy books and Samskaras ,with Sex and Crime ruling the house.
WILL HINDUISM NOW BE ONLY OF CARNAL PLEASURES OF ARYA SAMAJ IN
INDIA ?WHO WILL MARRY YOUNG MEN/WHO WILL GIVE BIRTH TO CHILDREN?
Refer to pages 48-to-52.
“(ii)
While investigations were on at the spot, PW20 came to the Parliament Complex and met PW1. PW20 provided the first leads to the investigating officials by informing PW1 that he had sold the Ambassador car used in the attack (DL 3C J 1527) on 11.12.2001. He had come to the spot after seeing the said car on the television screen. PW20 had brought with him a delivery receipt dated 11.12.2001, photocopy of the identity card of one Ashiq Hussain etc. PW20 identified the deceased terrorist (Mohammad) at Gate No.1 as being the said Ashiq Hussain who had purchased the car.”
10.Please see the number of the Ambassador car-the same number of Shivaji’s birth of 1627 is present as Shivaji had destroyed the Psychological Terrorism of Muslims.This number is also present in my terror struck report card of 11th class of St.Joseph’s Convent ,Jabalpur ,whence I had scored 327 marks.I would also like to tell the learned judges as to how even the children of patriotic persons are targeted.The final exams of 10th class were conducted twice on my father’s warning to the Principal that he would report the matter to the Education department and I overwrote the marks of one of them in disgust.But the 10th class exams -Maths marks are for the court to judge in both; as Maths was taken by Sir Rao ;a South Indian who refused to be party to filth. .Refer to pages 30 to 34.
11.My fathers belief in Sharda Mata and Durga Mata was targeted as he refused to become a Sikh -when my eldest brother got Small Pox at a time when no one in the entire State had small pox .This is because of the religious belief of Hindus linking Small Pox as the advent of Bari Mata or Goddess Durga.Refer to page 11.If Bio Terrorism is the Forte of Sikhs and Muslims due to the presence of 200 Gurudwaras in Pakistan, then we can well imagine future India AND AS TO WHY THE 1984 Sikh Riots or Operation Blue Star took place.If the Court orders an investigation in the terrorism of my house; they will find Arya Samjhis /Sikhs/Jains /Guptas and Muslims behind the filth. Refer to pages -2-to-37.Such was the terror unleashed on my late father who was medically terminated on 16-11-1994 ,that he had even stopped wearing an underwear,as older generations of staunch Hindus do not wear them and attribute it to the Sikhs.Refer to page 19.This will make the court understand why staunch Hindus also invest in the music business.My father was targeted viciously by the lower class of people by misusing their poverty ;whence he learnt to abuse them back,in the same mother /father; fucker language as it can be immensely terrifying for a person to know that people who have no respect for the disciplinary authority of India and would not mind being Sarkari MehMaan and enjoying good food; can ransack their home and women.AN EXAMPLE IS THE MUKHERJEE NAGAR SLUMS ADJOINING THE GURUDWARA.Such slums are mostly inhabited by refugees from Pakistan and Bangladesh who have no respect for the Law. This was how my father was attacked for not following Sikh Religion and thereafter his children.But the nexus of Sikhs is with the Jains and Guptas as well as the Muslims of Terror and in a bog way for supporting Arya Samaj and its idol less ideology.Birds of a feather ;flock together.Its another thing to be idol less and another to be party to loot ; crime and murders.Refer to page 332.
http://www.answers.com/topic/birds-of-a-feather-flock-together
Refer to pages 254 to 429,especially to the underlying message in page number-332,like Da Vinci Code,where in the photograph the actors are trying to convey a message using religious symbols.
“[With the recoveries of the cell phones and SIM cards and on an analysis of the details of phone numbers noted on the slips of papers in the light of the call records, the investigation narrowed down to three numbers, namely, 9811489429, 9811573506 and 9810081228 which belonged to Afzal, Shaukat
and Gilani respectively. It was also found that the first two numbers were cash cards and hence the details regarding their ownership were not available. However, as regards 9810081228, the information was received from the service provider (AIRTEL) that SAR Gilani with the residential address 535, Dr. Mukherjee Nagar,
Delhi
was the regular subscriber.PW66 then took steps on December 13th for obtaining permission from
the Joint Director, I.B. as per the requirements of Indian Telegraph Act for
keeping surveillance and tapping of the mobile phone Nos.9811489429, 9811573506 and 9810081228. On 14th December, at 12.52 hours, an incoming call to Gilani's No. 9810081228 was intercepted by S.I. Harender Singh (PW70).
The call was in Kashmiri language.
A Kashmiri knowing person (PW71) was requested to interpret the call recorded on the tape. He translated the call in Hindi which was recorded in Ext. PW66/4. That was a call from the brother of Gilani which was made from
Srinagar .
On the same day, at
8.12 P.M.
a call was intercepted on the number 9811573506 which disclosed that one woman was talking in a state of panic to a male person whom she addressed as Shaukat.
This conversation was transcribed by PW70 as per PW 66/3.
The subsequent forensic analysis revealed that the male voice in the conversation was of the accused Shaukat Hussain and that the female voice was that of his wife accused No.4 who was the recipient of the call.
The call came from
Srinagar . Both the intercepted conversations were analysed and considered by PW 66 (Inspector M.C. Sharma) at about
10 P.M.
on 14th December. PW 66 resultantly drew an inference that the persons who were conversing on the two mobile phones were having knowledge about the attack on Parliament and that two persons namely, Shaukat and Chotu who were connected with the case were in
Srinagar .
The calling No. 0194 492160 was sent to the Central Agency of Srinagar Police for surveillance.
(iv)
The next move was to arrest Gilani, which according to the prosecution was at about
10 A.M.
on December 15th when he was entering his house at Mukherjee Nagar.
Shri Gilani is alleged to have made disclosures to the investigating agency, the contents of which were recorded subsequently as Ex. PW 66/13.
The disclosure statement implicated himself and the other accused in the conspiracy to attack the Parliament.
According to the prosecution, he disclosed the facts on the basis of which further investigation was carried out, certain recoveries were effected and discovery of facts took place.
The identity of the deceased terrorist Mohammad and others, the part played by Shaukat and Afzal and other details are said to have been given by him.
According to the prosecution, Shri Gilani then led the Investigating Officer to the house of Shaukat which was also located at Mukherjee Nagar. “
12. Confessional statement of first prosecution witness GILLANI itself led to a lead and arrest of the other terrorists.”
THIS IS THE MAIN BASIS OF THE CASE WHICH THE JUDICIARY SHOULD NOT FORGET IN ITS JUDGEMENT AND ITS ACQUITAL OF Gillani.}
13.Further it has been brought clearly to the judiciary that here was a network having its roots in the education itinerary of Delhi and there was need to scrutinize the students who were joining the tuition centers as well as different Universities in the capital,their places of residence as well as to their duration of stay .From this case their involvement with the terror network of Kashmir as well as the underworld of Mumbai became loud and clear.I was working for the religion and the Kashmiri Pandits of the country since long and my house was attacked by the organized crime network, one of the perpetrators clearly being selected in the Civil Services of Judiciary;Latikas Rana;whose name rings a bell obout the Nepal massacre perpetrated by none other than Arjun Singh’s Daughter in law previously Devyani Rana.Please refer to pages -191 to 234.
The psychological terrorism purport leaks through.This is also punishable as it makes the person guilty of criminal intent, intimidation and conspiracy. Please read extracts from the synopsis that I have submitted to the
Delhi
University
on

“Unsoundness of Mind.
Insanity Defense
Any Psychotic/Neurotic illness can be a precipitating factor. Law requires the proof of
unsoundness of mind at the time of committing offence.
Hence any psychiatrist cannot predict that his/her patient can commit murder under the clause of insanity as he/she was under his/her treatment.The side effects of drugs/medicines are also taken into account by Law.For example in Schizophrenia treatment ,the Neurotransmitter –Dopamine; levels are lowered by medication.This produces symptoms of Parkinson’s disease which may physically
incapacitate a patient so much that it may be unthinkable that he/she may commit a violent crime in that state.
There are Specific rules for “unsoundness of mind” in the Indian Penal Code-Section 84 and also in the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is believed that mental illness is like any other illness and hence treatable.The Mental Health Act-1987 is also applicable.Cases of Psychotic Paranoid states where actual criminal conspiracy(120A,120B) has taken place deserves special mention in the Forensic Arena.
Here it is relevant to prove that the patient is telling the truth about abnormal conditions taking place with him/her which may be a part of a criminal conspiracy to prove the person mentally ill for vested interests.
The person has been rendered mentally ill by making conditions around him/her highly disturbing.
Of Criminal Force and Assault-Sections-349,350,351,352,354,355,357 can establish if the individual was mentally and physically assaulted.
Of Criminal Intimidation,Insult and Annoyance-Sections-503,506,507,509.can establish if any fear was induced in the person.
Here it is worth mentioning that serious violation of anyone’s privacy and then tampering and manipulating his/her life can cause extreme psychic injury.Such crimes however can be unearthed only with the help of the police.They are called private sting operations and have become a reality in India.Some of the methods of obtaining information about a person are:-
a.Phone Tapping
b.Computer hacking
c.Hidden cameras
d.Detective monitoring,stalking
e.Giving monetary or other benefits to servants and relatives to take out information.
Other examples of where Forensic Psychology can be very useful are :-
a.Diminished responsibility
b.Insanity Defense
c.Irresistable Impulse.
d.Provocation (legal)
e.Sustained Provocation
f.Crimes of passion
g.Mitigating circumstances
h.Murder Suicide
i.False cases of Implicating Mental Illness for vested interests.

{‘According to the prosecution, she was arrested at about
10.45 a.m.
on 15th
December. The truck number given by her was flashed to
Srinagar .
Srinagar
police was successful in apprehending the two accused Afzal and Shaukat while they were in the truck belonging to Navjot. On their pointing out, the laptop computer and an amount of Rs. 10 lac were recovered from the truck by the SDPO, Srinagar (PW61).
A mobile handset without any SIM card was also found.
It transpired that this hand set was used in the operation i.e. No. 9811489429 which established contacts with deceased terrorists minutes before the attack.
Mohd. Afzal and Shaukat Hussain, who were arrested by the Srinagar Police at about
11.45 A.M. , were brought to
Delhi
in a special aircraft
and were formally arrested in
Delhi . The investigation was handed over the PW76 (Inspector Gill of Special Cell) on 16th December.”}
14.From the above extract of the judgement it becomes clear that Shrinagar Police was working for arresting the culprits and would further co operate in rounding up other assassins and heinous mongrels.It also necessitates the urgency of further investigation as I fear utmost for the life of Madame Smt Sonia Gandhi ruling the Parliament as on date,which can be attacked again or its members. Confession of Navjot led the police to arrest Afzal and Shaukat in Shrinagar and recover incriminating evidences.The whole case rests on leads built up one after the other and not suddenly along with seizure of incriminating documents as well as arms and explosives from the places directed by the accused.

It is the case of the prosecution that on interrogation, they made
disclosure statements (Ex.PW 64/1 and PW 64/2) in relation to their role in the conspiracy.
On December 16th, Afzal and Shaukat led the investigating team to the various hideouts, viz., Indira Vihar and Gandhi Vihar where the terrorists stayed.
On the search of these places, the police recovered chemicals, prepared explosives, detonators, gloves, mixer grinder, motor cycles one belonging to Shaukat and the other purchased by the deceased terrorist
Mohammad from PW29 which was allegedly used for reconnaissance (reccee).
On December 17th , the investigating officer took Mohd. Afzal to the mortuary at the L.H. Medical College
Hospital where Afzal identified the bodies of the five deceased terrorists as Mohammad (dead body found at Gate No.1), Raja, Rana, Hamza (dead bodies found at Gate No.9) and Haider (dead body found at Gate No.5). From December 17th to December 19th, Afzal led the police to various shops from where the chemicals and other materials required for preparing explosives were purchased and also the shops from where red light found on the seized car, motor cycle, dry fruits, mobile phones etc. were purchased.
From December 17th onwards, the laptop was analysed by the IO with the assistance of an expert PW72.
PW72 submitted a report narrating
the results of his examination.
The laptop was also sent to BPR&D Office in
Hyderabad
and another report from PW73 was obtained.
The forensic analysis revealed that the documents found at the spot with the deceased terrorists including various identity cards and sticker of the Home Ministry, were found stored in that laptop.”}
15.From the above it becomes evident that Gillani ;Afzal and Shaukat can lead the police and the Interpol to the hide outs of the other terror machines,but nothing has been
done till date ,nor any records submitted of criminal rounding up by the Police of India.It could have also leaded them to busting the Organized Crime network,its beneficiaries as well as its molls.There exists a separate organized crime cell both in the structure of the Delhi Police as well as Mumbai Police.It becomes all the more mandatory as even POTA was invoked in the case without the investigation and arrest of the other criminals.There exists a Durrand Line near Tajkistan ,Wherein the American Soldiers are on duty.Its agreement with the British expired in 1993 being drawn up by Mortimer Durrand of Sehore,in 1893;for 100 years.The real ownership to the same should pass to the UNO as it will go a long way in solving terrorism in Kashmir.Are the American Soldiers protecting the country in the name of their God Jesus Christ- the Peaceful or are they giving succor /asylum to heinous ,blood thirsty hounds of the most morally degenerated kind?
{“(vii)
On the same day i.e. 19th December, there was another crucial development.
According to the prosecution, the three accused Afzal, Shaukat and Gilani expressed their desire to make confessional statements before the authorized officer.
On 20th December, PW80 made an application before the DCP (Special Cell) (PW60) for recording the confessional statements of these three accused.
PW60 gave directions to PW18 to produce the three accused at the Officers Mess,
Alipur
Road ,
Delhi .
On the next day i.e. 21st December, the accused
Gilani was first produced before PW60 at the Mess building.
However, Shri Gilani refused to make a statement before PW60 and the same was recorded by him.
Thereafter, Shaukat Hussain was produced before PW60 at
3.30 P.M.
Shaukat Hussain expressed his desire to make the confessional statement and the same was recorded by PW60 in his own handwriting which according to him was to the dictation of Shaukat.
The confessional statement recorded purportedly in compliance with Section 32 is marked as Ex. PW60/6.
The other
accused Afzal was also produced before PW60 at
7.10 P.M.
on 21st December. After he expressed the desire to make the confession, his statement was recorded by PW60 in his own handwriting allegedly as per the dictation of the said accused. This is Ex.PW60/9. PW80 obtained copies of the confessional statements in sealed envelopes. In substance, both Afzal and Shaukat confessed having been parties to the conspiracy to launch an attack on the
Parliament House.
The details of the confessions will be adverted to later.
On 22nd December PW80 produced the accused persons before the Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (PW63) in compliance with Section 32 of POTA.
The learned Magistrate conducted the proceedings in respect of each of the
accused persons in order to satisfy himself that the statements recorded by
PW60 were not the result of any inducements or threats.
No complaint of any
such threat or inducement was made to PW63. Shaukat Hussain and SAR Gilani were remanded to judicial custody on 22nd December itself.
However, the police custody of Mohd.Afzal was allowed for the purpose of conducting certain investigations in the light of the supplementary disclosure statement made by him to PW80.”}
16.The accused them selves requested for confession and senior police officers as well as Chief Metropolitan Magistrate saw that no physical or mental harm or intimidation had been inflicted on the
accused.It seems that the retraction of confessions later on are due to some outside threats and intimidations which are made to such criminals as the criminal nexus does not want the accused to tell about their whereabouts.In a country where cases are made on Indira Gandhi for her nexus with the Ford government and the Watergate scandal,and she is also accused of having underhand KGB links,it cannot be ruled out that an attack on Parliament could have been perpetrated without the involvement of the super powers and antagonistic powers like Bangaldesh as well as Pakistan.WE MUST ALSO NOT FORGET THE MOST HEINOUS OF THE MUSLIMs ; BACKING THE SYNDICATE OF INDIA ;IS PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANISATION .The entire details have already been submitted to the learned court in the shape of a PIL filed by me on 15-5 2007 as well as the learned court may well peruse through papers submitted from an annual of Competition Success review 1980 as well as notes on the Indian emergency of 1975 from Wikipedia wherein there is a clear indication of the involvement of the Arab States as well as PLO behind organized crime of India ,the killing of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi by the syndicate as well as the political nature and international backing to organized crime in India.
Refer to pages 287-to -394.This mandates for an immediate seizure of all posts of scrutiny in J&K by the Special Police –CBI as well as Delhi Police recruiting good officers from all over India ,to apprehend the perpetrators of organized crime in India lurking in the valley as it poses direct threat to the security of India.When organized crime is involved the matter passes from the army to the police of India.It also becomes mandatory in the light of retraction of confession by the accused Afzal,which was given with full consent that the accused be provided z security and assisgned to both judicial and police custody as he is an important link to both terrorism in Kashmir and organized crime in India.He should be questioned rigorously on all his contacts in the valley as Government initiative to end terrorism in Kashmir as well as resettlement of the Kashmiri Brahmins.As to Gillani ,he can unfold all the foreign plots to assassinate the leaders of India and lay the Parliament open to lapses in security.Giving Afzal death penalty will destroy an important source of investigation and make the judiciary liable of sedition and perjury=: the voluntary violation of an oath or vow either by swearing to what is untrue or by omission to do what has been promised under oath : false swearing.Without taking out the requisite information which find no place in the tutorial judgement,as to foreign links ,Indian links; the groups backing Afzal, their source of finance and supply of arms,to attack the Parliament.The Judiciary and the Police should not leave the CONVICTS EITHER OUTSIDE OR IN DEATH.The honorable Judiciary should not forget that these are no ordinary criminals but guilty of DIVISION /CHAPTER SIX-VI –OFFENCES AGAINST THE STATE. of the IPC.Assigning such prime witnesses to the gallows would have serious consequences for the country.They should be given witness protection and never allowed bail.As also they should be confined to solitary cells with only their holy books for company and accompanied by guards always as prisoners are being killed in the Tihar jail.
We must also give the police officers assisgned to the case special
protection as well as the Judges.The recent Mulayam Assets case as Well as Hasina Parker case ,the murder suicide of Justice Adhikari of Jabalpur High Court in the 80s,all show that the Judges/their families ;to a sensitive case;are vulnerable to militant/organized crime attack.The organized crime nexus
factor becomes evident ;if we delve into the recent murder of Jessica Lal in the Kutub Minar area by the nexus of Islamic militants ,whose indirect aim of isolating the said area for crime was achieved by this act.Please refer to the report submitted to DG ASI by me on
May 28 2007-pages 398-to-407.The same has been done by Arya Samaj in Nigam Bodh Ghat wherein indirectly in nexus with Jains ;all the religious structures of Hindus were destroyed as the owners-
Jains have put an appeal in the minority commission for grant of minority status; as also their being not Hindus.The Hindu Marriage Act by its very existence; however ;nullifies their claims.However the Congress Digvijay Singh Goverment had allowed the Jains ; minority status in Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh ,where they are extremely dense ;flouting all rules.As per Supreme Court rulings a minority is going to be decided demographically by Linguistic standards.Jains speak Hindi .
17.If the Islamic militants have a co alliance with the said Mohd.AFZAL he can also become a prime witness for the prosecution and reveal all the names of the persons behind the Parliament Attack living in the garb of respectability .The said claims however should not be made public however ,unless investigated by the MHA in alliance with the INTERPOL.

International liaison
Interpol seeks to forge ties with all international bodies, governmental authorities and non-governmental organizations whose mission to fight crime and protect the public’s safety.
These collaborations occur formally, through the signing of co-operation agreements and adoption of international conventions, and more informally, through Interpol’s participation in international symposia, conferences and working groups, and vice versa.
The aims are to ensure that expertise and information are shared; that resources are not wasted or efforts duplicated; and that all organizations with a stake in the fight against international crime are able to exploit their comparative advantages most effectively.
Interpol has signed co-operation agreements with the United Nations – including related bodies such as UNESCO – the International Criminal Court and regional authorities such as the European Central Bank, Organization of African Unity and Arab Interior Ministers’ Council.

18.The Parliament attack case was not merely bombing of a place by a terrorist but an attack on the highest revered institution of democratic India,wherein honest Police officers in the service of their nation lost their lives.However inspite of having two such terrorist in their hands who have their links with the terror being created in Kashmir ;5 terrorists dead,there is no mention in the judgement about any investigative efforts on the part of the Delhi police ,in their approaching any international investigative agency as the Interpol,or even their own efforts to unearth terrorism.We must not forget that the Bush Administration has a full Army stationed on the borders of Afghanistan and Iraq to combat Islamic terrorism.And there is not a single enlightening sentence in the entire judgement as to how Indian Police did anything to know the links of Terrorists who have been awarded Capital punishment for terrorism and slander to the very spirit and Constitution of India as well as violence,except for their links with Jaish group.
{“The learned counsel also argued that POTA was invoked on 19th when further evidence came to light revealing a planned terrorist act at the behest of certain terrorist organizations.”
“Confessions are considered highly reliable because no rational person would make admission against his interest unless prompted by his conscience to tell the truth.
"Deliberate and voluntary confessions of guilt, if clearly proved are among the most effectual proofs in law". (vide
Taylor 's
Treatise on the Law of Evidence Vol. I). This point assumes relevance in the context of such disclosures made by the first two accused viz. Afzal and Shaukat.
The admissibility of information said to have been furnished by both of them leading to the discovery of the hideouts of the deceased terrorists and the recovery of a laptop computer, a mobile phone and cash of Rs. 10 lacs from the truck in which they were found at
Srinagar
is in issue.
The DCP(PW60) handed over a sealed envelope containing the confessional statements to PW80 the I.O. who produced the accused Afzal and two others before the Addl. Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate (ACMM),
Delhi
on 22.12.2001 together with an application Ext. PW63/1. The ACMM was examined as PW63. The ACMM stated that he opened the sealed envelope containing Exts.PW60/9 & PW60/6 which are the confessional statements of Afzal and Shaukat, and Ext.PW60/3 which is the statement of Gilani and perused them. The ACMM then recorded the statements of the accused persons. The two accused Afzal and Shaukat confirmed having made the confessional statement without any threat or pressure. The proceedings drawn by him is Ext.PW63/2. The accused signed the statements confirming the confession made to the DCP. The statement of Mohd. Afzal and his signature are marked as Exts.PW63/5 & 63/6. PW63 stated that he made enquiries from the accused persons and none of them made any complaint of use of force or threat at the time of recording confession. He also deposed that he gave a warning that they were not bound to make the statement before him. A suggestion that Mohd. Afzal did not appear before him nor did he make the statement, was denied. The ACMM, after drawing up the proceedings, sent the accused Afzal to police custody for a week at the instance of I.O. PW80 for the reason that he was required to be taken to certain places in
Kashmir
for further investigation.
We shall now give the gist of the confessional statement of Mohd. Afzal which is Ext.PW60/9 read with Ext.PW60/7. First, he mentions about joining JKLF, a militant outfit during the year 1989-90, receiving training in Pak Occupied Kashmir in insurgent activities and coming back to India with arms, his arrival in Delhi with his cousin Shaukat for studies, coming into contact with SAR Gilani A3 while studying in Delhi University, surrendering before BSF in 1993 on the advice of his family members, returning back to his native place Sopore and doing commission agency business, coming into contact with one Tariq of Anantanag at that time, who motivated him to join 'Jihad' for liberation of Kashmir and assured him of financial assistance, Tariq introducing him to one Ghazibaba (proclaimed offender) in Kashmir who further exhorted him to join the movement and apprised him of the mission to carry out attacks on important institutions in India like Parliament and Embassies and asked him to find a safe hideout for the 'Fidayeens' in Delhi.
During that meeting, he was introduced to Mohammed and Haider, Pak nationals and militants. In the month of October, 2001, he rang up to Shaukat and asked him to rent out accommodation for himself and Mohammed. In the first week of November, he and Mohammed came to
Delhi . Mohammed brought with him a laptop and Rs.50,000. Shaukat took them to the pre- arranged accommodation in Christian Colony Boys'
Hostel. He revealed to Shaukat that Mohammed was a Pak militant of Jaish-E-Mohammed and came to
Delhi
to carry out a Fidayen attack. After a week, he arranged another safe hideout at A-97, Gandhi Vihar. Mohammed collected money through 'hawala'
and gave Rs.5 lakhs to be handed over to Tariq in
Srinagar . Accordingly, he
went to
Srinagar
and gave the money to Tariq. At the instance of Tariq, he brought two other militants Raja and Hyder to
Delhi
and both were
accommodated at the hideout in Gandhi Vihar. In order to complete the task assigned by Ghazibaba, he along with Mohammed went to the shops in old
Delhi
area and purchased 60 KGs of Ammonium Nitrate, 10 KGs of Aluminum powder, 5 KGs of Sulpher and other items in order to facilitate preparation of explosives by Mohammed. After a week or so, Mohammed gave another 5 lakhs of rupees to be handed over to Tariq. Tariq asked him to take along with him two other militants, Rana and Hamza. They were carrying two holdalls which contained rifles with loaded magazines, grenade launcher, pistols, hand
grenades and shells, electric detonators and other explosives. They also stayed in Gandhi Nagar hideout initially. After reaching
Delhi , he arranged for another accommodation at 281, Indira Vihar. Mohammed purchased mobile phones and SIM cards from the markets and received directions from Ghazibaba from a satellite phone. He used to meet Shaukat and Gilani and motivate them for Jihad. Shaukat provided his motorcycle for conducting 'recce'. Meetings were also arranged in the house of Shaukat for deciding future course of action. In those meetings, Gilani and Shaukat's wife Afsan also used to be present. At the meetings, various targets such as Delhi Assembly, Parliament ,
UK
& US Embassy and Airport were discussed. Then, after conducting survey of all the targets, Mohammed informed Ghazibaba that they should strike at the Indian Parliament. A final meeting was held in the house of Shaukat in which all were present and plans for attack on Parliament House were finalized. }
19.The above extract from the judgement clearly proves how far reaching the contacts of Afzal were ,which were not investigated by the Delhi Police.It also shows the hawala connection of the Mumbai underworld.
It also shows that the involvement of Interpol is a must in this case of International Terrorism.
{“Shaukat then came and met him at Azadpur mandi and both went to Gilani's house and gave him Rs.2 lakhs. Gilani in turn asked him to give the money at his house in
Kashmir . Then he and
Shaukat left for
Srinagar
in Shaukat's truck. They were apprehended by the
Srinagar
police on 15th. The police recovered from them laptop with the accessories and Rs.10 lakhs. They were then brought to
Delhi
and at
Delhi
he got recovered explosives and other materials from the hideouts.”}
20.Thus the
court forgets and mislays the fact that the convicts themselves wanted to get their confessions recorded before the police commissioner in the first place.The fear of having been caught and subsequent execution in the minds of the terrorists themselves is a big confession inducer to lighten their sentences.The confessions however are incomplete and are a narrative of the incidents rather than throwing light on the real mastermind behind the crime ,with the criminals having access to Parliament routes,Vice President car’s presence ,so much ammunition and master plot ,with even the date 13-12-2001 being of highly psychologically damaging connotation for Hindus,who form the major section of Indian population.The 13th Samskara is of marriage and the 13th date as the last day of funeral rites of Hindus.Atalji ‘s Parliament itself was 13th.It is also the birthday date 13-1-1990 date of my son and serious harm was inflicted on me too personally on 13-1-2006 on my son’s 16th birthday,wherein my eye was burst open by my so called husband.He chose no other date to pick up a quarrel with me and inflicted serious harm on me both physically and mentally on my son’s 16th birthday.No police compliant of the same was made by me as on serious injury compliant on 13-7-2004 at Mukherjee nagar Thana ,I was sent to Ganga Ram Hospital by the SHO,and treated for Maniac Depressive Psychosis, [compliant on page – 74] as also my son’s impending 10th Board Examinations in March 2006.The modus operandi of inflicting harm on 13th remaining same in both cases. I have submitted photographs of same.The test for
MD-
psychosis is distortion of thought and orientation to such an extent that a person cannot even repeat a four lettered word backwards.For eg. Say- “:RANA” AND THE PSYCHOTIC WILL SAY NARA INSTEAD OF ANAR.Using number 22 after 622 Islamic hegira and inflicting psychological terrorism is the modus operandi of Islam.Refer to letter to DG ASI.Also refer to the letter sent to Municipal Corporation Jabalpur for my father’s death certificate (medically terminted on 16-11-1994.}Pages-237-to 331 and 398-to 421.
{“Shri Jethmalani contended that Afzal in the course of his interview with the TV and other media representatives, a day prior to recording of a confession before the DCP, while confessing to the crime, absolved Gilani of his complicity in the conspiracy. “}
21.{International criminals had access to the media}
{“Coming to the details of evidence relating to hideouts and recoveries, it is to be noted that the accused Afzal is alleged to have made a disclosure statement to PW66 Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma on
16th December, 2001 .
It is marked as Ext.PW64/1. In the said disclosure statement, all the details of his involvement are given and it is almost similar to the confessional statement recorded by the DCP. The last paragraph of the statement reads thus:
"I can come along and point out the places or shops of Delhi wherefrom I along with my other associates, who had executed the conspiracy of terrorist attack on the Parliament, had purchased the chemicals and containers for preparing IED used in the attack, the mobile phones, the SIM Cards and the Uniforms. I can also point out the hideouts of the terrorists in
Delhi . Moreover, I can
accompany you and point out the places at Karol Bagh wherefrom we had purchased the motorcycle and Ambassador car. For the time being, I have kept the said motorcycle atLal Jyoti Apartments, Rohini with Nazeerand I can get the same recovered.
"
This statement has been signed by Mohd. Afzal. In fact it is not required to be signed by virtue of the embargo in Section 162(1). The fact that the signature of the accused Afzal was obtained on the statement does not, however, detract from its admissibility to the extent it is relevant under
Section 27.”}
22.Thus the pliability of the three Gillani,Afzal and Shaukat to tell about the terror scenario ,both in the capital as well as Shrinagar mandates that their capital punishment/punishments
should be suspended for the present moment and the Delhi Police and CBI instructed by the Honarable SUPREME COURT OF INDIA to take them into confidence so that they lead them to all the terror outfits of Kashmir and POK,as well as INTERPOL alerted.
23.I request the Honorable Supreme court to also peruse through the documents numbering 1-to-446 ,consisting of scans of pictures taken by me,news paper clippings as well as articles and e-mails sent to the press.
I would also like to to bring to the knowledge of the Court that Mukherjee Nagar houses ,are a serious threat to the nation if the Tuition centres remain and nothing is done to make a list of all the tenants living in them.There are thousands of people missing in Kashmir and Pakistan in light of the recent earthquake.The Presidents of the various RWAS of these colonies were instructed by me in 2003 through Mukherjee Nagar Police station; to keep a list of the tenants ;their antecedents,duration of stay and Parent addresses ,which was discarded by the upper echelons of society who are feeding on the women and making merry with second marriages.
The next case of Manu Sharma elaborates on this issue itself as well as serious lapses of investigation in the case itself.There is a filthy nexus of the politicians and the police in this as they are eating out of the sex earnings of the syndicate.
Coming back to Manu Sharma;he is the son of the famous politician Vinod Sharma of Haryana who holds considerable power in the Hindu faction of Haryana politics .Since operation Blue star and the 1984 riots there was a division of thought in the already tense Sikh /Jat/Hindu
politics of Haryana which shares the capital Chandigarh ,the bone of contention; with Punjab.Due to the religious sanction of Article 25 of the Constitution ,the Sikhs are allowed to keep arms.Unfortunately due to the hate generated after 1984,the endeavors of Sikhs to make Khalistan ,many Sikhs started using their deadly weapons ,openly available in front of the Golden Temple Amritsar ;for criminal intimidation and terror .The presence of 200 Gurudwaras in Pakistan and the migration of Sikhs to America and USA gave them a powerful backing as well as criminal conspiracy with the terror tactics of Pakistan.To top it they have a nasty habit of intolerance for Sanatan idol worshippers of Temple Hinduism ,which made them collude with the most filthy killer nexus of organ trade/infliction of psychiatric diseases ,especially in women,of Arya Samaj;1937 Act.
If people give up fear that a person has deadly weapons ,the sharp toys become as useless as mutton kitchen knives ,which are always available to house wives to terminate pigs of adulterous husbands.
There is no need to feel fear of such mutton cutting housewife
brandishing Sikh swords .I also have many big knives in my kitchen as also scissors ,and
I also take them out of my house for some work or the other.It does not mean that I am going to cut up anybody.
But this does not come to the common psyche who do feel intimidated by Sikhs and their mutton swords.Therefore in Haryana where Sikhs are next door neighbors and totally allied with
Pakistan ,the Haryanavis started keeping licensed arms to brandish ,as Sikhs do theirs.Refer to page 114.
This was intolerable to certain foul elements who wanted the Santan Hindus without weapons and scared of Sikhs.The entire Jessica Lal case rests on this possession of licensed arms by the Haryanavis to make themselves equal to Sikhs,who were not only using their arms for criminal intimidation and instilling fear but also were literally helping in the annihilation of innocent mothers in collusion with muslims and Arya Samaj.Women are upholders of religious values in a house and if she is destroyed ,and sex introduced in a house the whole fabric of Hinduism can be terminated.The money factor was supplied and utilized by the Jains and Banias who see nothing but money –Chamadi jaye par damadi na jaye.
The presense of arms does not mean that one can freely use them too.Law comes into the picture.The solution now is to allow people in Haryana to keep arms or stop the arms carrying Sikhs too as no one likes to be intimidated by swords in the name of religion.The website of Sonipat is extremely good and trend setting/exemplary for licensed arms.Please visit :-
http://sonipat.nic.in/arm.asp.
The second political factor was supplied by the within Congress opposition of the terror backed tatics of Digvijay Singh of Dewas Indore in opposition to the good politics of the educated politician Ajit Jogi.Ajit Jogi was brought into politics by Rajeev Gandhi and had roots in the policies of the real Nehru parivar who wanted a solution to the Kashmir/Ayodhya and Jerusalem problem.He was also against the sick annihilation and organ trade of women which was Pakistan/underworld /arya sammaj 1937
backed .Please refer to pages 274 to 333 and 416 to 446.
The theory like the two gun theory which was being circulated at the time of Jessica Lal murder in 1999 was that Mr. Vinod Sharma who was strictly against the terror tactics of the Sikhs and had close links with Mr.Ajit Jogi was being constantly threatened ,as well as his family, by the Mumbai underworld.He had provided arms to his family to protect themselves as also serving to be exemplary to the rest of the Jats. Herein when Manu Sharma was visiting Delhi , in the month of April he was summoned on his cell phone by someone in the party being hosted at the Qutub Collonade, regarding giving of important information behind the terror being created for his family in Haryana, especially as Bina Ramani’s husband Mailot had Canadian connections, Canada being a strong hold of Sikhs.Refer to the Kanishka Bombing of 23rd June 1985.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182
{23rd June being the death dates of Sanjay Gandhi and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee,one a victim of Kashmiri terrorism and the other of Syndicate gangs [emergency 1975]}
.When Siddharta/Manu Sharma
reached there ,the party had already finished and his acquaintances told him to collect a drink
from the bartenders.When he reached the bar Jessica was shot.He had his gun to protect himself and not for killing anybody and especially as he was on a terror busting mission against organized crime ,wherein even people of Sanjay Gandhi’s stature are not spared.But to his utter shock he was implicated in the case and Bina Ramani told him that he had a gun in the party and no one else and he was the killer.
The boy panicked and tried to escape .Manu Sharma is 1977 born and this makes him only 22 years at the time of murder .The rest is history and already on the record of the Judiciary.The vote bank politics of the Congress,the business concerns of the Sharma family as well as the terror network of the Sikhs and Muslims did not allow his father to reveal the true story and that his family was under the threat of the Mafia who had killed so many Congress leaders .The main motive behind the killing was to public ally shame Venod Sharma and deprive the Hindus of a good leader who had dared to challenge the Sikhs arms act.This indirect killing was same as the breaking up of the Nigam Bodh Ghat Mandirs ;or my home to sabotage the work being done against the killers.
Please see the cards given to me by my husband and his brother Mahendra residing in Mehrauli on my 22nd Birthday on 29-1-1986; to know the psyche of these islamists controlled.Also see that my own elder Jathani-sister in law wore not only bangles and Mangalsutra fashioned in similar design as mine; but also muslim green sari on my wedding day-17-10-1985.Pages 68-to-70 and 95.Deliberately no photographer was called on my marriage at Dhaula Kuan DSOI ;and the photos were taken
by my brother on a small camera ;or video reel was made by Mahendra Kalra.No photo of Sunita Kalra was taken
and the ones which were taken by my brother Vipin Dhody were either spoilt or smudged.However her profile gives her away as also the color of her sari in page 95.My married life was sabotaged from day 1, and I have some how carried this burden throughout
as the country I live in is India and my surname was Chopra Dhody.
In cases of underworld orgainsed crime ;even the confessions of the accused are coerced seeing the amount of people involved in the cruel nexus.My entire colony is involved ;as the colony of Indore where my brothers were stationed in the annihilation of my family.The house Number 1510 where Latika Rana is staying presently
was previously occupied by Sikhs who had a huge black Alsatian,whom they took out for walks only when I came out of my house.In my house too before Latika Rana was put up as a tenant ;one Sikh and One Gupta Boy were put as tenants by Mr.Kalra.In both the instances Sikhs occupied the houses which were occupied later by
Latika Rana and family.My younger brother Gagan Dhody was bitten by the Alsatian of the neighbor whom he went to wish Happy Holi in Indore.The symbol of Syndicate bank is also Black Dog.These people declare openly all that they do to achieve the purpose of instilling fear into the hearts of the unbelievers of Islam.See page 279 wherein openly Mind is mentioned under the photo of Osama in Times of India.Entire colonies testify against you if you are the victim of the mafia and the person himself may speak against his own interests ; if the threat to his family members are conveyed to him.Was’nt there a Shravan Kumar at Kutub Collonade symbolically as there was a dog living with the Sikh family in such cooped up premises of house no.1510,in Outram Lane?The Tarkhans did not even know the difference between Gurmukhi and Punjabi when I spoke to them once.The filthy towering Sardar tried to intimidate me
along with his big Dog,as if the dog living in my house was not enough for me.
There are many points in the judgement which prove this story as under.
1.The appellant Manu Sharma was under great mental tension when he reached the precincts of the Tamarind Court and he had a gun with him.On asking for a drink in the bar ;someone came from behind him and poked something in his back whereupon reacting psychologically and predictably ,he turned and he took out his gun and fired a shot in the air .On turning back he saw Jessica was falling down with blood gushing out of her wounds.
2.Jessica was witness to the shady happenings at the Tamarind Court where upon alliances were being arranged between old men and young women and being sent out of the country.Refer to pages
151 to 174 and especially to 171-172.Here the learned Court will see that it is the picture of a Board of a Boutique being run by Malini , daughter of Bina Ramani,wherein the women is supplying clothes for Honeymoon,upstairs.
I belong to a very high class family and
know all about designer clothes ,but have never come across clothes which are meant only for a honeymoon.That was no place to advertise the clothes ; as the Boutique was outside and the vistors to a bar are never of young age that she was advertising her ware.The connotation of upstairs is also clear as usually people live in the groundfloor and rent out their first floors.Please see page 154 wherein I took the photos of this board by parking my car outside the gate and climbing the roof of my car.In page 155 you will see that there is a large expanse of empty land behind the Colonnade from where the killer could have come after the party was over and no one chanced to see him.The probability is also that the persons who entered the bar with Manu Sharma were themselves carrying guns.
3.The place was so small and Manu a big Politician’s son .How come no one recognized him and he had to be spoken about as a chubby
boy with white t-Shirt.If there was such a public uproar of shielding high up criminals then how come Manu’s existence was so small that there was a need for an identification parade.A person is not known in a small time party he attends and that also a politician’s son ,who always appeared in the partys of the HT city newspaper?,some times even with Priyanka Gandhi?He needed an identification parade?Refer to page 157.The entire existence of Ramani was forged and she was into illicit trade and ulta chor kotwal ko dante,she implicated Manu Sharma.How can the learned courts rely on such a witness ,who was openly advertising trousseau for broken homes as is evident by her scissor door. Refer to page 151.
4.The Olive bar as well as Qutab Collonade was the property of the ASI and part of the ancient Dharam Shala made in 1918 belonging to Hindus and the ASI had no business to dispose it off to such cheats.Refer to pages 167 and 408-412.The pictures clearly show the presence of a Dharam Shala.All this may have serious implications for the coming generations if the rights of Hindus are so auctioned.Page 158 –to 166 further show how The Jogi family too was implicated in murder, and another news of the day 29-4-1987,which happens to be the day of Ajit Jogi’s birthday as he was born in the same year 1946 as Sonia Gandhi and George Bush.29-4-1946.Refer to page 274 wherein there is an appeal to historians and academicians to solve the Ayodhya issue by presenting facts.Clearly there is an attempt by bad muslims to vilify and implicate all those who are involved in the peaceful projects of India.
5.The list of candidates having Latika Rana’s name at 72 also has a Muslim name in the beginning .Such a co incidence is not at all possible.My house has also been destroyed by the syndicate ,due to the greed and weakness of my- so called , dead husband.All the books of law and otherwise are a waste till people like Latika Rana and Mr.Kalra rule the public posts.
6.Even if we see the case as seen by the Judiciary then it is section 304 and not Section 302 which would be applicable to Manu Sharma as Jessica Lal was not known to Manu ,neither was he habitual of killing people with his pistol ,which he had bought and kept due to the threats of the 1993 Bomb Blast gang whose year number was given to him by the High Court.193/2006.1993 also happened to be the year of the expiry of the agreement of the Durrand Line ,which is the key to solving the Kashmir issue and people like me have gone Hoarse in the throat shouting to the press about it ,from roof tops.1993 also happens to be the birth year of my different daughter,Abeer Kalra-23-8-1993[Sunday] whose birth certificate was changed by Delhi Public School[Hawala Kandis].Please refer to pages 249 and 250.HER BODY IS CAST IN THE MOULD OF THE ARDHNARESHWAR FORM OF SHIVA AS WELL AS THE MAP OF WEST BANK.IT IS AMAZING;EVEN FOR ME!These muslims who cast terror in the hearts of others are themselves rats when they try to conceal other religions strengths.Are they afraid that such a birthday would cast the authenticity of prayers as also my birthday on 29-1-1964[Wednesday] ,after the death of rose bearing Gulab Singh Chacha Nehru on 27th of May 1964,or my son’s Birthday on the 13th Samskara of Hindus –marriage -the institution that has been made filthy by the Guru of Mr,Kalra –Dayanand who died on 31st Day for destroying the 13th samskara of innocent mothers.No matter how much people would like to destroy the sacred institution of Marriage ,the very birth of my son on
13-1-1990[Saturday] strengthens it and makes people who change their religion to get married also guilty of Bigamy by section 494 of IPC;AND MURDER IF THEY KILL MOTHERS BY SECTION 302 IPC,EVEN IF A STORY OF NATURAL DEATH IS CONCOTED IN ALLIANCE WITH THE MEDICAL FILTH.
7.It should be also brought to the knowledge of the learned court that Mr.Kalra belongs to Mehrauli and has staunch 1937 Arya Samaj leanings as well as being their gang
member ,seeing the amount of torture he has meted out to me.A strong parallel has been drawn in names in the present case;keeping in mind that I have been working on the Ayodhya and Forensic Psychology issue since 1986 and Ajit Jogi faction of the Congress had similar leanings.
Coming to the judge ment delivered In Italics :-
“It is also argued that the convict is not a habitual criminal or incorrigible and that it cannot be said that he cannot be reformed. Counsel submits that law does not envisage vengeance but cares for reformation. He
submits that the law would be satisfied if a sentence of imprisonment for lifeis inflicted upon this convict.”}
8.The Judiciary has not seen that Manu Sharma is no paid killer and neither has criminal leanings ,and was only 22 years of age , on 29-4-1999.This itself leads to the imposition of section 304 as Jessica was not known to Manu Sharma.
“The murder though intentional having been committed without premeditation”
9.The murder was not intentional as intent necessitates long association or knowledge about the person killed. Killing Jessica was of no purpose to Manu Sharma. He was also not liquor hungry by logic as he has his own pub in
Chandigarh .

Copyright© 2006, Practical Lawyer
1. Criminal Appeal No. 193 of 2006 challenges the judgment of the Additional Sessions Judge dated 21.2.2006 in Sessions Case No. 105 of 2001,arising out of FIR No. 287/99, Police Station, Mehrauli, whereby the learnedJudge has acquitted the respondents of all charges framed against them.
2. Brief facts of the case, as have been noted down in the judgment underchallenge by the Additional Sessions Judge, are as follows :
"That on 29.4.1999 at Qutub Colonnade at ?Once upon a time? Restaurant also called 'Tamarind Cafe' a Thursday party was going on. At Thursday party--------------
charged against them. Accused Siddharth Vashisht @ Manu Sharma, VikasYadav and Amardeep Singh Gill be taken into custody forthwith and lodged in Central Jail, Tihar. The appeal is disposed of in the above terms.”
Please peruse through the following:-
“At about 2 a.m. Shyan Munshi was present at Tamarind Cafe situated at Qutub Colonnade five six persons including one waiter were also present there, one person aged 30-32 years came out from the back side of bar and asked for two drinks of liquor. The waiter did not serve him the liquor as the party was already over. Jessica Lal and Malini Ramani who were also present there also tried to make him understand that party was over and that there was no liquor available with them. On this that person took out a pistol and fired one shot at the roof and fired another shot at Jessica Lal which hit her near her left eye as aresult of which she fell down. Jessica Lal was rushed to Ashlok hospital from where she was shifted to
Apollo
Hospital . On 30.4.99 in the early morning hours Jessica Lal was declared dead at
Apollo
Hospital .”
10.Manu Sharma is 1977 born and was 22 years old on
29-4-1999 ,the day of the murder.
11.Clearly the investigative team has not told the Court about the time when Manu Sharma came and for what purpose?How can a guest come so late and if he did ,did not the guard at the entrance stop him as the private Thursday Mailot
Party was already over ,there being no customers on that day?
12.Who was known to him at the Tamarind court Restaurant and who had invited him ?
13.How was he not known to such a small crowd; in the small place; being such a big CONGRESS Politician’s son figuring in newspapers when such a big noise was made about a big man’s son being punished ! and his throwing his weight around.Clearly he had not gate crashed into the party AND HE WAS NO CUSTOMER.Some one must be knowing when he entered the private party which was going on. Who had invited Vikas Yadav and Gill ?How were they known to the Raminis?
14.Clearly it has been said that it was a private party of Thursday and Manu Sharma had been called as a
guest by the witnesses.Merely being present together at the time of crime does not establish the fact that Manu Sharma came at the same time with them.Did they call him and later implicated him in the case by virtue of their criminal backings seeing the whole political scenario and arms escapades of Haryana and Punjab with the Sikhs trying to project a mercenary arms image?
15.The issue of carrying a private licensed gun in the strife torn Haryana and
Punjab
background ;as also being exemplary, being a top politician’s son ; was the reason behind the murder; to dissuade the rest of the Haryana to carry arms . The Judiciary should not forget that this the case of a politician of the Congress belonging to Haryana in the back drop
of the Sikh riots of 1984.If my case is investigated by the CBI /police it will clearly show mercenary Sikhs can be with their arms overload and syndicate alliance.
16.No mention has been made as to when Manu arrived ,and in the altercation which occurred during the murder ,who shot at Jessica.The finger poking of some one at your back can instill enough fear in a person already in the scenario of eminent danger to family ( necessitating the carrying of a gun), to fire a shot in the air to dissuade possible assailants . This was the theory in 1999 that some one poked a finger behind the 22 year old hot headed Shravan Kumar imaged boy Manu Sharma who sensed eminent danger as he had been so fed in the brain lately at that time,who fired a shot in the air to scare possible assailants as he was not a habitual killer and on turning back found Jessica dead by a second bullet fired by some one else.The personality of the boy had been studied and his predictability was used to implicate him in the murder of Jessica Lal.
17. It is strange that Jessica died exactly at
4:37
am.37 is also the number of Arya Samaj also
present at the Nigam Bodh Ghat bench ;where the temples have been destroyed.Refer to pages 327-to-329 and especially to 80 to see the purport of the bench of 1937,at Nigam bodh Ghat being managed by Arya Samaj.
“Beena Ramani, and told her that someone had fired a shot at Jessica Lal and Jessica Lal had received injuries in that firing. The learned Judge also returned a finding that Beena Ramani tried to stop one person named, Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma, who was coming along with Shyan Munshi. She also told him to give her the gun.”
18.Was Bina Ramani not scared of a person she did not know to have demanded the gun from him and what was the surety that he would not have fired at her?What was her purpose to demand the gun?No one in their right senses demand the gun from a killer.Was she his mother to have such controlling power or did she have links with him from before ? In any case demanding a gun from so called killer is illogical and made up.
19.What was the mode of conveyance?How did Gill , Yadav and Manu
Sharma reach the party and at what time?
20.This case
has a psychological connotation for the general public that keeping a gun could implicate a person in murders jokes apart as keeping of mutton Kitchen knives ; by house wives .
“The next witness of utmost importance of the case is PW-20, Beena Ramani. She states that she is the owner of a property near Qutub Minar bearing No. H-5/6,
Mehrauli Road ,
New
Delhi
which was acquired in September, 1995. The property has a shopping arcade in the name of 'Qutub Colonnade', the name of the restaurant was 'Tamarind Court Cafe' which had a proper licence for eating house. The licence of the restaurant was in the name of 'Once Upon a Time' which started business in 1996. She goes on to depose that parties in the restaurant could be booked on any day as per the desire of the customer, but on Thursdays there used to be special private parties where guests could come by invitation. She goes on to say that liquor was served in the courtyard on Thursday parties. PW-6, Malini Ramani, used to manage these Thursday parties. The witness further states that she knew Jessica Lal and Shyan Munshi and that there was a proper staff to run the restaurant although friends did help in the Thursday parties. Jessica Lal and Shyan Munshi were friends of Malini Ramani and were helping her on that night. The witness goes on to depose that on the night of 29.4.1999, a Thursday party was organized to bid farewell to her husband who was leaving for a found-the-world trip. The party was over by
1/1.30 a.m.
These Thursday parties and special parties were organized generally and were held in the courtyard and on the roof top. After the party was over, she was anxious to clean up the place and relieve the waiters so that they were available for proper duties on the following morning. At that time, there were some guests left in the courtyard and she spotted some guests in the restaurant where nobody was supposed to be. She walked towards the restaurant. While she was moving towards the restaurant, she crossed Malini Ramani . She moved into the steps of the restaurant and saws a few people standing next to the counter and heard a firing shot. A moment later, she heard another shot. At that time, Jessica Lal, who was standing with some people at the far end, was seen by the witness falling down. There was a door to her right which was swung open with Shyan Munshi coming out with some other person saying that Jessica had been shot. The witness told Shyan Munshi to call Police or doctor or ambulance and was stopping the man accompanying him. There was commotion. All the people who were with Jessical Lal starting coming out. The companion of Shyan Munshi was wearing a white T-shirt. He was chabbi and fair and this witness asked him as to who he was and why he was there and also why he had shot Jessica Lal. The witness also asked him to give her his gun, which she thought he was having. The person in the white T-shirt denied having shot yet, the witness goes on to say, she asked him again and he kept quiet shaking his head that it was not him. As all others were leaving, the person in the white T-shirt shoved the witness aside and went out. The witness followed him all the way to the front gate of the main building. She could not catch hold of this person. In the meantime, she was shouting instructions to guests to call hospital or to take Jessica Lal. On reaching the gate, she saw her husband standing there and told him that this was the man who had shot Jessica Lal and to see in what car he was getting into. The witness goes on to say that the person who was told to be seen by her husband was with some friends at the time of occurrence inside the cafe. The witness identified Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma by touching him and also went on to identify Amardeep Singh Gill, Alok Khanna and Vikas Yadav as the persons along with Manu Sharma.
Further, the witness goes on to say that from the gate she returned to the restaurant where the waiters had slipped a table cloth under Jessica's body. The witness continued to give instructions to get medical help for Jessica and removed her to
Ashlok
Hospital . Jessica Lal was still alive and was removed to
Ashlok
Hospital
in the car belonging to Sanjay Mehtani. The witness goes on to say that the report about the incident was lodged in her presence by Shyan Munshi. Jessica Lal was then removed to
Apollo
Hospital
where she was declared dead. A week later, she saw Sidhartha Vashisht at the Police Station 36. This witness was cross-examined by counsel for Sidhartha Vashishta @ Manu Sharma, but to no meaningful end. In other words, her testimony remained unchallenged. The trial court while dealing with this witness has held that this witness does not further the case of the Prosecution as the witness was not an eye witness to the occurrence but a witness to the presence of Sidhartha Vashishta @ Manu Sharma, Amardeep Singh Gill, Alok Khanna and Vikas Yadav at the Qutub Colonnade. The trial court also held that the deposition of this witness was vague since she thought that Manu Sharma was carrying a gun and also felt that he may have shot Jessica Lal. The Court also held that mere feelings were not enough and did not mean that Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma had actually fired a shot at Jessica Lal. The trial court further went totally wrong in holding that PW-20 had admitted not seeing Sidhartha Vashisht firing a shot at Jessica Lal, but it was only her feeling. With great respect to the learned Judge, we find this is 'a complete misreading of evidence'. There is no suggestion let alone an admission on the part of PW-20, Beena Ramani, that she had not seen the accused Sidhartha Vashisht firing a shot at Jessica Lal. On the contrary, we find positive assertion by the witness to the following effect : ?I saw a few people standing next to the counter and I heard a shot. A moment later, I heard another shot. Jessica Lal was standing with people at the far end and I saw her falling down. There was a door to my right. It could be swung open and Shyan Munshi came out with another person who was either ahead of him or behind him. Shyan Munshi said that Jessica Lal had been shot. I told Shyan to call the police or doctor or ambulance and I stopped the man accompanying him. There was commotion. All the people who were with Jessica Lal earlier, started coming out. The companion of Shyan was wearing white Tshirt. He was Chabbi and fair and I asked him as to who he was. ?Why are you here and why he shot Jessica Lal. I also asked him to give me his gun. I thought he might be having a gun?. He said that it was not him. I asked him again and he kept quiet and shaking his hand that it was not him. As all others were leaving, herefore, the companion of Shyan also shoved me aside and went out. I ran after him. Again said behind him all the way to the front gate of the main building. He was a few steps ahead of me and I could not catch him. In the meantime, I was shouting instructions to the guests to call hospital or to take Jessica Lal. I reached the gate. My husband was standing there and I told him
that this was the man, who had shot Jessica Lal and to see in what car he get into.? 37. This statement of Bina Ramani clearly shows that she had herself seen Sidhartha Vashisht shooting Jessica Lal as otherwise she had no reason to ask him why he had shot Jessical Lal. The aforesaid view taken by the trial Court appears to have been taken on a concession made by the Special Public Prosecutor himself who put forth this argument that it was her feeling that Manu Sharma might have shot at Jessica Lal and also that she had admitted that she was not an eye witness. The trial court, however, instead of itself reading the evidence of Bina Ramani proceeded to wrongly record acceptance of this submission of the prosecutor. If the evidence of the witness had been read properly, the Court could not have held that this witness had admitted that she had not seen Manu Sharma firing at Jessica Lal. There is no suggestion, let alone an admission on the part of PW-20, Bina Ramani, that she had not seen the accused Sidhartha Vashisht firing a shot at Jessica Lal. This kind of approach of the trial Court has caused grave miscarriage of justice. There is no doubt thatthe Court is not supposed to simply convict someone without any evidence but at the same time the Court is also to ensure that guilty is not allowed to go scotfree simply by accepting concessions made by the Public Prosecutor.38. Beena Ramani's presence as an eye witness was sought to be challengedby recourse to the deposition of PW-46, Madan Kumar, and PW-47, JatinderRaj, who were employees at the Qutub Colonnade. It was argued that MadanKumar rushed to the spot after hearing 'goli lag gai' and saw Jessica Lal lyingon the floor. Some guests, Beena Ramani and Jatinder Raj were present there.This part of the deposition is sought to mean that Beena Ramani did not confront Manu Sharma nor followed him nor asked George Mailhot to keep a watch on Manu Sharma. However, from an analysis of the testimony of PW-46, we find that he came to the spot subsequent to the fire. He did not hear the firing but heard people shouting ?goli lag gai?. It is then that he ran down by which time Beena Ramani must have returned to the Cafe after confronting Manu Sharma. This witness certainly deposes to the presence of Beena Ramani at the spot. He also corroborates Beena Ramani's actions thereafter. PW-47, Jatinder Raj, has stated that he was counting cash and was tallying the same when he heard firing of two shots from the side of the Cafe. He saw from the gate of his office people coming in and going out. At that time he saw Bena Ramani at the stairs of the cafe. He rushed towards her and both went inside the cafe. This, by itself, does not show that when the shots were fired, the witness was along with Beena Ramani in the Cafe. He also came soon after Beena Ramani had come back to the Cafe. Since he was the in-charge of the cash, he would have never left the cash unattended or without securing it before running out. We, therefore, find no substance in the criticism that Beena Ramani was not present when the shots were fired.
39. From the above it cannot be said that Beena Ramani had not seen Sidhartha Vashiushth @ Manu Sharma firing at Jessica Lal. On the contrary, it is a positive statement of the witness that it was Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma who fired at Jessica Lal after which Jessica Lal fell down. The witness is a witness of events that took place and is an eye witness to the main occurrence.”
21.It is highly presumptuous of the learned judges delivering the statement that Bina Ramani was a dependable witness.She at no time delved into the fact that at an unearthly hour of 1:45 am ,when she had been on her toes since morning and seeing her age ,how did she have the presence of mind or strength to demand the gun from a possible killer.A woman who always remained aware of the designer hub in her vicinity did not know Manu Sharma who supposedly himself is in the entertainment business?How is it that a person himself running a pub,was hungry/thirsty for liquor? Was he not having enough at his own?After the details of the Punjab Haryana arms tussle and Chandigarh imbroglio the learned court must have become aware as to how Politicains and their families are framed in high profile crimes to rob them of their seats in Parliament.Chandigarh should be given to Punjab as the other areas of Haryana are suffering for development because of it and it is the only access of the Sikhs in the politics of Haryana.Hissar would be a much more desired capital.Has Kashmir passed into the hands of so called empty land Khalistan or Pakistan whence it has its capital as Shrinagar?
“Not many people in
Chandigarh
are surprised at the acquittal of this allegedly high profile criminal. Until a few days before the judgment, 29-year-old Manu was seen attending parties in the town, and running his popular disco-cum-pub, Blue Ice, in
Chandigarh ’s posh Sector 17 market. He has a reputation for throwing well-organized parties around town. Shortly after he was released on bail in 2003, there was a fight between employees of Blue Ice and some customers; Manu too was reportedly involved, but his name was dropped from the case and the disco’s manager was booked instead.”

“33. PW-6 is Malini Ramani, She states that in the year 1999 parties were organized at Qutub Colonnade. Liquor was consumed at these parties. On 29.4.1999 there was a party at the Qutub Colonnade which was a Thursday. It was organized to bid farewell to her step father, George Mailhot, who was going abroad for five months. The witness was at Qutub Colonnade on that evening. Jessica Lal was also there. Her mother, (Beena Ramani) was also present. Shyan Munshi was also present. The party was over around
1.00 a.m.
approximately and at about
1.45 a.m.
the witness went along with Sanjay Mehtani to the restaurant to look for something to eat. The witness was holding a drink in her hand. She found Jessica Lal was there in the restaurant and Shyan Munshi along with some waiters was also present. She went behind the food counter looking for something to eat inside the Cafe but could not find anything. In fact, according to the witness, there was nothing to eat or drink for the last hour or so and lots of people were asking for more to drink and to eat.
While they were standing at the restaurant, a couple of persons went in. They were about 4 or 5 in number.
One of them asked this witness if he could have two whisky. The gentleman was wearing jeans and white T-shirt. He was in his mid twenties with fair complexion. His built was on the plump side. The witness showed her inability to provide liquor as the bar had closed.”
22.The above account of Malini clearly shows that there were many people present looking for food and drink in the wee hours of the morning.How is it that no one recognized Manu Sharma?Why did the court not order Bina Ramani to produce the Guest List of her invitees as this happens to be a case where the son of a Politician working for the people is involved?How many people could be accommodated at the roof top and the courtyard of Bina Ramani’s Thursday parties that no one was witness to what happened to Jessica Lal ?
Was her Courtyard as big as the Banquet hall of a 5-Star Hotel that people could not recognize each other?The fact emerges loud and clear with the symbolic nuances of the case
and the psychological interpretation that the Jessica Lal murder was engineered to oust Vinod Sharma and family from Haryana politics as also finish all their national endeavors along with Ajit Jogi’s family.It also emerges loud and clear with the open presence of Yadav ,that the mafia was involved and Jessica was killed by a paid killer as she wanted to spill the beans on all the high profile men sitting on high chairs in Delhi Government who had abandoned their faithful wives by converyting either to Muslim religion or Arya Samaj.The presence of Yadav and Gill
is to instill fear in all those who would like to intervene as the entire organ trade of hospitals is resting on the killing of innocent mothers and the lust of men.Jessica a true women wanted to tell all that was being arranged in front of the Qutub Minar and she was killed for it.Gill and Yadav are no friends of Manu but his blackmailers and menancing.The family of Sikhs living in 1510 Outram Lane with a Black Dog ,Latika Rana ;as well as the Sikh family in the ground floor of 1514[now shifted],also projected
family images,but were highly heinous and vile in their purports having a very evil syndicate backing of sex and crime.It is highly dangerous for the Judiciary if such elements are being chosen amongst them and shows how Judge Adhikari died from his own home happenings in his bathroom with his own pistol.Mr.Adhikari also happened to be a good friend of my father and visited my home often in 14/9 Napier Town.
Jabalpur ,belonging to Arya Samajhis –Mr and Mrs.Saroj Dani. Keeping licensed arms shouldnot be treated as abnormal as it is also allowed in the
USA
they being no different from mutton knives of the kitchen.
It should not only be the prerogative of Sikh religion strongly aligned with Arya Samaj .The birth of Arya Samaj itself was in Sikh locales of
Punjab . Both take law in their own hands and keeping licensed arms is the only solution to the psychological intimidation of such filth.
23.Coming back to the case not once has Ramani deposed that she saw Manu Sharma shooting Jessica at point blank range.She has said that she saw Jessica falling down and Manu Sharma holding a Gun,which a tired frail women like her demanded and that also when she has claimed that she did not know Manu Sharma.An eye witness means she should confess under oath that she saw Manu Sharma’s gun pointing towards the head and not stomach of Jessica lal and the shot being fired.
Her daughter has deposed that she saw 4-5 men who went inside with Manu.Then how is it that they did not see Jessica being shot or how can Ramani be sure that the other people accompanying Manu were not armed ? Was a search for arms conducted in the place on
30-4-1999 ?Who was the home Guard Shravan Kumar and how long since he was posted on duty?
24.Clearly this case is for the psychological intimidation of people working with the politician Venod Sharma to show the killer strength of the Mafia in
India
and as to what happens if people go against them.My father Mr.Dhody faced these killers and Justice Sodhi should also order a reinvestigation. After all living with Arya Samajis in 14/9 Napier Town and living with Mr.Kalra has not altered the faiths of myself or my
entire maternal/ paternal family;and will remain so till our deaths,maybe on symbolic days of 3/5/13/16/27/23/21/12 or 22?The court will also wonder as to why I have put the Pope in legal papers.It is because the centre of Christain faith is the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem ;as the river Jordan where Christ was Baptised and not Rome,and the Christain faith is as threatened to day in the West Bank as Hinduism in India and Nepal..Mother Mary after the death of her holy son Jesus and subsequent Resurrection traveled with John to Turkey where the Church of Holy Wisdom stands today and is as important to Christain faith .It stands vilified today with minarets like Taj Mahal,a symbol of sex rather than learning ,with faiths like Arya Samaj.The court is intelligent enough to understand without me having to speak more on this issue.Please also see the scans of pictures of Kashmiri Migrant camps in Delhi to see the plight of the Sarawatis of Brahmins and how symbolic foundation stones are proclaiming that such places are the Manoranjan Kendras of the old men.Manoranjan was a film :-

He strikes up a conversation with a good-looking young woman named Nisha, and tells her that there is a possible violation of Suppression of Immoral Trafficking Act taking place on this street. He witnesses several women soliciting men, and decides to call in the paddy wagon, and get them arrested. Alas, one of the men frequenting the prostitutes is none other than Ratan's superior officer, who immediately summons Ratan, and has him removed from service on corruption charges. Nisha takes pity on a homeless and unemployed Ratan, and asks him to live with her. He does not want her to sell her body, and so he decides to work at night, and during the day he takes on the guise of a rich Nawab and spends time with her. Things go along smoothly, until Ratan decides that it is now time to get rid of the "Nawab", and he does so, only to find out that the police have been informed that he has killed the Nawab, and they are out to arrest him.

Such nuances although missing the eye of the general public have serious mental onslaughts on the persons suffering from terrorism.Kashmiri Brahmins are one of them as nearly 5000 have expired from stress diabetes itself.Can the court punish for such murders?Refer to page 374-378.The learned Court will see the Varista Nagrik Kendra of Lajpat Nagar housing the Kashmiri Brahmins.Also see pages 75 to 100 and especially 77 and its back page whence I was prescribed a muslim green carton of medicines by nu-life hospital when Mr.Kalra bursted my eye on 13-1-2006 ,the 16th birthday of my son Aneesh Kalra,and they did not even work as they were fake. I was sent to Ganga Ram hospital on 13-7-2004 on police compliant made by me of violence

The Authority has constituted High Court Legal Services Committee at Delhi High Court, Legal Services Authority at Tis Hazari and its Sub-Offices at Patiala House Courts and Karkardooma Courts Complex.The Legal Services Authority Act, 1987 was enacted to effectuate the constitutional mandate enshrined under Articles 14 and 39-A of the Constitution of India. The object is to provide ‘Access to Justice for All’ so that justice is not denied to citizens by reason of economic or other disabilities. However in order to enable the citizens to avail the opportunities under the Act in respect of grant of free legal aid, it is necessary that they are made aware of their rights.Legal aid is an essential part of the Administration of Justice. “Access to Justice for all” is the motto of the Authority. The goal is to secure justice to the weaker sections of the society, particularly to the poor, downtrodden, socially backward, women, children, handicapped etc. but steps are needed to be taken to ensure that nobody is deprived of an opportunity to seek justice merely for want of funds or lack of knowledge. To ensure this the Authority organizes Legal Literacy and Awareness Camps in different parts of N.C.T. of

Also how many men in
Delhi
have converted to Muslim religion ,by voluntary disclosure of muslim religious authority in
Delhi , if they are not a scared lot,and are upholders of true faith.
Coming back to the cases I request the Court to take two small words into cognizance called
“Mens Rea” and then review the cases .Also upon seeing the filthy context of the number 22 and its terror inflicting purports ,I request the Court to see through pages 267-to-269 and 239 -to-248 to themselves judge how numbers are used to inflict psychological terrorism.The green color of the card given to me by Kalra on my 22nd Birthday on page 68 shows what kind of marriage I was living in,for the past 21 years.The green color of Sunita Kalra’s sari also speaks the same on 17-10-1985,on page 95. The green carton of medicines given to me on 13-1-2006 after inflicting terrorism also shows same .It shows that time has come when such psychological terrorism can have serious repercussions on a person’s brain and lead him/her to crime as they offend a person’s religious sentiments and sensibilities. Is not making obscene gestures/sounds
a part of outraging a person’s modesty in Section 509 of IPC wherein mens rea or psychological implications are manifest to the crime.?
If the judiciary does not take cognizance of these factors then actual criminals and perpetrators to crime will go unpunished and we will have a psychologically ravaged Hindu society ,even deprived of God under the flag of Filthy Arya Samaj.At least the image of God provides
succour to a war ravaged spirit.Please see how my brothers Vipin Dhody and Gagan Dhody were targeted in Indore to the extent that they were sent to neuro surgeons by their so called friends saying that there was some thing wrong with their brains and they are imagining things .Refer to pages 123 to 127.The idea was to inflict psychological terrorism and loot them of their jobs and belongings.The main culprit in this psychological terrorism is the mobile phone being used by criminals to terrorize each other only,for the day is not far that in the game of one up man ship of looting each other ,they will end up with the entire nation being ruled by another country who will even destroy their faith.
The biggest example is Carol Grace who stood exposed in front of a gaping audience,as the archeological pursuits in
Jerusalem
today looking for a married Jesus of Protestant faith..Please see page 3.Jesus was 33 years old when he died at the cross in 29A.D. and he never married . Mary did not take any Bahu along with her to Turkey and the Church of Holy Wisdom is not a farce.True religion is being destroyed in quest for power as is the purity of women,who is a mother,a wife ,a sister ,a daughter and a friend –no ,more.There can be no marriage vow better than the Christian vow of
“IN BETTER OR IN WORST “-“TILL DEATH DO US PART” AMEN.

Islam
Under Scrutiny by Ex-Muslims “Honor Killing” is Absolutely Islamic!
by
Syed Kamran Mirza
01 Jul, 2005 (Updated 16 Jan,
2008)
Honor
killings, which occur with shocking regularity in certain parts of
the Middle East and South Asia, target women whose actions – actual
or suspected – violate the honor of their family, an honor which is
thought to depend on the sexual purity of its female members.
Victims are always being killed/slaughtered mercilessly by her own
family members. Honor killing is a manifestation of global
phenomenon in general and Muslim nations in particular. Since this
terrible inhumane practice does exists only among the Muslims of the
world—very often civilized people do blame Islam as the precursor of
this dreadful act. Most others do not agree with this notion at all;
and they try to put the blame on the tribal/cultural practice, and
do not consider Islam is anyway responsible for it. In this essay I
shall analyze the real issues, cause and origin, and pattern of this
heinous act amongst the Muslims of the world to postulate if there
is any link, or incitements that originates from the very core of
Islam. What is honor killing? Honor killing is the bone chilling horrific cruelty committed by the
family members—father, mother, brothers, brother-in-laws, even in
some cases own sisters also. In this terrible episode the victim is
always the daughter/sister or other blood related young women who
get killed. Perpetrators are always the family members stated above.
Family honor is one of the core values of Arab society. Anything
from speaking with an unrelated man, to rumored pre-marital loss of
virginity, to an extra-marital affair, refuses forced marriages;
marry according to their will; or even women and girls who have been
raped—can stain or destroy the family honor. Therefore, family
members (parents, brothers, or sisters) kill the victim in order to
remove the stain or maintain, and protect the honor of the family.
Killers are given light sentences, sometimes with little or no jail
time at all. The killers mainly defend their act of murder by
referring to the Koran and Islam. Family guardian will say that they
are merely following the directives set down in their Islamic
ethical beliefs.
Honor killing is committed
by the family members - father, mother, brothers,
brother-in-laws and even in some cases sisters
These barbaric killings occur only to save the honor of the
family, and not for any animosity or for wealth or gold. In 100%
of cases—the killers have no animosity, rather they love the
girl as their own daughter or sister, but they kill the girl
anyway upon their ethical compulsion to save their family honor,
or to erase family stigmas. The victims cry, beg for their life
but the family members become merciless (out of their ethical
prejudices and also religious burden of fear) and kill the
victim. After killing family members usually mourn and cry for
the victim (usually loving daughter or sister) but feel solace
that they have done the right thing to save their family honor.
And this kind of cruel killings to save family honor had
happened, still happening, and will remain to happen—only to a
Muslim family. Honor killings happen only to some designated
Muslim nations such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Yemen,
Lebanon, Egypt, Sudan, the Gaza strip and the West Bank
(Palestine), Jordan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria,
Somalia, Turkey, Iran and some other south and central Asian
countries. Bangladesh though a Muslim majority country—regular
pattern of honor killings never happened as of today. But it is
not unknown or impossible to record some stray incidences in
Bangladeshi rural Muslim family (only) in which girl was
poisoned by family members, or asked to commit suicide after
being impregnated by unwed sexual intercourse. However, this
same kind of case history was never heard, or recorded in the
non-Muslim family of Bangladesh.
Honor killing is different from other killings
Honor killing should never
be confused with wife beating, or wife killings by husbands or
other relatives.
Honor killing should never be confused with wife beating, or wife
killings by husbands or other relatives. Since pre-historic ancient
time people assassinated, killed, or poisoned their wives or
husbands, or other family members for either adultery, love affairs
(Poro-keya prem) with other man besides her husband, or for property
disputes—and these are simple homicide in English terminology. They
are never called honor killing. This kind of homicides did occur,
still occurs, and will occur in any nations, or race throughout the
human history and these are not any race, or religion related
happenings by any standard. Honor killings also should never be
confused, or mixed up with killings for dowry, acid throwing by
unsuccessful/disappointed love stalkers (as frequently happened in
the Indian sub-continent), or any other violence against women.
These are simply not honor killings, which is the topic of this
essay. Some sample cases of horrific honor killing:
Case-1: " Two months ago, when she tried to run away yet again,
Kina (father of the girl) grabbed a kitchen knife and an ax and
stabbed and beat the girl [his daughter] until she lay dead in the
blood-smeared bathroom of the family's Istanbul apartment. He then
commanded one of his daughters-in-law to clean up the mess. When his
two sons came home from work 14 hours later, he ordered them to
dispose of the 5-foot-3 corpse, which had been wrapped in a carpet
and a blanket. The girl's head had been so mutilated, police said,
it was held together by a knotted cloth."
Case-2: "Kifaya Husayn, a 16-year-old Jordanian girl, was lashed
to a chair by her 32-year-old brother. He gave her a drink of water
and told her to recite an Islamic prayer. Then he slashed her
throat. Immediately afterward, he ran out into the street, waving
the bloody knife and crying, 'I have killed my sister to cleanse my
honor.' Kifaya's crime? She was raped by another brother, a
21-year-old man. Her judge and jury? Her own uncles, who convinced
her eldest brother that Kifaya was too much of a disgrace to the
family's honor to be allowed to live. The murderer was sentenced to
fifteen years, but the sentence was subsequently reduced to seven
and a half years, an extremely severe penalty by Jordanian
standards."
Case-3: “A 25-year-old Palestinian who hanged his sister with a
rope: "I did not kill her, but rather helped her to commit suicide
and to carry out the death penalty she sentenced herself to. I did
it to wash with her blood the family honor that was violated because
of her and in response to the will of society that would not have
had any mercy on me if I didn't . . . Society taught us from
childhood that blood is the only solution to wash the honor."
Case-4: "Samia Sarwar, 29, mother of two boys aged 4 and 8, was
shot dead today in lawyer Hina Jillani's office by a bearded man
accompanying her mother and uncle. `He's my helper, I can't walk,'
said the mother, when Hina told the two men to get out. As the
mother went to sit down in front of Hina's desk, and Saima stood up
from her chair, the bearded man whipped out a pistol from his
waistcoat and shot Saima in the head, killing her instantly."
When Samia Sarwar sought a divorce from her
violent husband she was gunned down in the office of her lawyer Hina
Jilani. The killer was taken there by her own mother.
•
Case-5:
ABU QASH, Palestine: Amira Abu Hanhan Qaoud (mother of 9 children)
killed her daughter ‘Rofayda Qaoud’ who had been raped by her
brothers and was impregnated. Armed with a plastic bag, razor and
wooden stick, Qaoud entered her sleeping daughter's room last Jan.
27, 2003. "Tonight you die, Rofayda," she told the girl, before
wrapping the bag tightly around her head. Next, Qaoud sliced
Rofayda's wrists, ignoring her muffled pleas of "No, mother, no!"
After her daughter went limp, Qaoud struck her in the head with the
stick. The 43-year-old mother of nine said. "I had to protect my
children. This is the only way I could protect my family's honor."
•
Case-6: A 23 year old Rania Arafat, whose plight was broadcast live
on national TV in Jordan. Rania was promised to her cousin as a very
young child. Rania repeatedly told that she doesn't love him and she
is in love with someone else. She pled with her family to allow her
to marry her lover, instead. She ran away twice, including two weeks
before her forced marriage. She wrote to her mother and pled for
forgiveness and understanding. Her parents promised that she would
not be harmed and she could return home. On August 19, 1997, Rania
returned home. The same night, her younger brother, Rami, shot her
five times in the head and chest, killing her immediately. Her
youngest brother was chosen to commit the murder not only to allow
his defense to find protection under the laws protecting so-called
honour crimes, but also because he was a juvenile. Rami served six
months in jail for his crime.
Case-7: Amal, another Arab woman and victim of honour killing
was run away because she insisted on her independence. Her family
said that they were ashamed because of that and the gossip of
neighbors. One night, when she returned home and went sleep, her
brother accompanied by Amal's father, strangled her. He said: "I
strangled her. She didn't fight back. I recited the "Holly Koran" as
she was dying… it took a few minutes and she was dead." He and his
father both given light sentences.
Every two weeks a young woman is killed in
Jordan alone in the name of family honour
•
Case-8: Death of Aqsa Pervez: A reflection on Canadian
Muslim-Pakistanis-Honor killing in Canada!, December 16, 2007 A young Mississauga teenager (16-year old) Aqsa Pervez, was killed
by her father last week who later called the police and confessed.
Mohammad Pervez is now in police custody and his case hearings have
begun. The young girl was killed by strangulation for her refusal to
wear the hijab.
Case- 9: Texas manhunt on for father of slain his two girls
(January 3, 2008) Texas authorities continued a manhunt today for an Egyptian-born
taxi driver accused of murdering his two teenage daughters. Yaser
Abdel Said, 50, was wanted on a warrant for capital murder after
police say he shot the girls Tuesday and left them to die in his
taxi, which was found parked in front a hotel in Las Colinas, a
suburb north of Dallas. Police said Mr. Said should be considered
armed and dangerous. Friends of Amina Yaser Said, 18, and Sarah Yaser Said, 17, described
the girls to the Dallas Morning News as "extremely smart — like
geniuses," saying the slain sisters had been enrolled in advanced
placement classes and were active in soccer and tennis at suburban
Lewisville High School. Family and friends told reporters that the
girls' Westernized lifestyle caused conflict with their Muslim
father, who immigrated from Egypt in the 1980s. "He was really strict about guy relationships and talking to guys,
as well as the things she wears," Kathleen Wong, a friend of the
girls, told KTVT-TV, the Dallas CBS affiliate. Two boys who said
they had been dating the sisters told KXAS-TV in Dallas that Mr.
Said was upset that his daughters were involved with non-Muslims. "She just wanted a normal life, like any American girl wanted," one
of the boys told the NBC affiliate station, adding that Sarah "was
always kind, gentle, always cheerful, always had a smile on her
face."
Amina and Sarah Said are dead but .... family
honour intact
Honor killing is a cultural/tribal phenomenon!!! Most Muslim apologists and also some gullible westerners want to
argue that the ‘so called “honor killing” is not Islamic and it’s a
tribal/cultural vice.’ This statement is utterly untrue and only a
wish full covers up. It’s true that in pre-Islamic Arab culture this
heinous honor killing of women did exist; likewise, many other
uncivilized practices like stoning, flogging, beheading, slavery etc
also existed in the pre-Islamic Arab society. But Islam did
incorporate entirely most of these inhumane/uncivilized practices of
pagan society, which they now call them Allah’s laws. Had it been the tribal/cultural practice, ‘honor killing’ would
exist amongst the Arabs only. But honor killing does happen amongst
the non-Arab Muslims also. Also Arabs belonged to all religions
(Muslims, Christians, Jews, Bhai etc.) would practice honor killing
with equal prevalence. Fact of the matter is—no Arab Christians,
Jews or Bahai etc do practice this uncivilized act at all. Only Arab
Muslims do practice this heinous act with a regular pattern. Honor killing does happen only amongst the Muslims and
these
honor killings get support and encouragement from the ethical
teachings of religion Islam.
In 1986 this kind of honor killing
did happen in the United States of America in an Arab Muslim family.
In 2003 honor killing happened in Sweden again in a Muslim family.
However, some very rare, sporadic case of such killing might have
happened in other society or people of other religion. But they are
no where near to compare with the regular pattern, or routine
feature of honor killings which do happen in the Muslim nations that
I have mentioned. It has been reported that in Pakistan and in
Jordan several hundreds of “honor killings” do happen every year.
Perhaps, it will be more plausible to name this so called ‘honor’ as
the “Islamic honor”, which Muslims stupendously try to save by
killing their love one!
Dictums of Quran and Hadiths which may
dictate/incite honor killing: Quran- 4:15 “If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, take the
evidence of four (reliable) witness from amongst you against them;
if they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them.
Or God ordain for them some (other) way.” Quran-24:2 “The woman and the man guilty of adultery or
fornication—flog each of them with hundred stripes: Let no
compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by God, if
ye believe in God and the last day.” Quran-17:32 “ Nor come nigh to adultery: for it is a shameful (deed)
and an evil, opening the road (to other evils). Quran-33:33 “stay quietly in your houses, and make not a dazzling
display.” Now some sahih hadiths: Bukhari: Volume 7, Book 63, Number 196: Narrated Abu Huraira: A man from Bani Aslam came to Allah's Apostle
while he was in the mosque and called (the Prophet ) saying, "O
Allah's Apostle! I have committed illegal sexual intercourse." On
that the Prophet turned his face from him to the other side,
whereupon the man moved to the side towards which the Prophet had
turned his face, and said, "O Allah's Apostle! I have committed
illegal sexual intercourse." The Prophet turned his face (from him)
to the other side whereupon the man moved to the side towards which
the Prophet had turned his face, and repeated his statement. The
Prophet turned his face (from him) to the other side again. The man
moved again (and repeated his statement) for the fourth time. So
when the man had given witness four times against himself, the
Prophet called him and said, "Are you insane?" He replied, "No." The
Prophet then said (to his companions), "Go and stone him to death."
The man was a married one. Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari said: I was
one of those who stoned him. We stoned him at the Musalla ('Id
praying place) in Medina. When the stones hit him with their sharp
edges, he fled, but we caught him at Al-Harra and stoned him till he
died. (See also Bukhari: Volume 7, Book 63, Number 195.) Sahi Bukhari: 8:6814: Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah al-Ansari: “A man from the tribe of Bani
Aslam came to Allah’s Messenger [Muhammad] and informed him that he
had committed illegal sexual intercourse; and he bore witness four
times against himself. Allah’s Messenger ordered him to be stoned to
death as he was a married person.” Sahi Muslim No. 4206: “A woman came to the prophet and asked for purification by seeking
punishment. He told her to go away and seek God’s forgiveness. She
persisted four times and admitted she was pregnant. He told her to
wait until she had given birth. Then he said that the Muslim
community should wait until she had weaned her child. When the day
arrived for the child to take solid food, Muhammad handed the child
over to the community. And when he had given command over her and
she was put in a hole up to her breast, he ordered the people to
stone her. Khalid b. al-Walid came forward with a stone which he
threw at her head, and when the blood spurted on her face he cursed
her.” Sahih Al-Bukhari Vol 2. pg 1009; and Sahih Muslim Vol 2. pg 65: Hadhrat Abdullah ibne Abbaas (Radiallahu Anhu) narrates the lecture
that Hadhrat Umar (Radiallaahu Anhu) delivered whilst sitting on the
pulpit of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). Hadhrat Umar (Radiallahu
Anhu) said, "Verily, Allah sent Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wa
Sallam) with the truth, and revealed the Quran upon him. The verse
regarding the stoning of the adulterer/ess was from amongst the
verse revealed (in the Quraan). We read it, secured it and
understood it. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) stoned and
we stoned after him. I fear that with the passage of time a person
might say, ‘We do not find mention of stoning in the Book of Allah
and thereby go astray by leaving out an obligation revealed by
Allah. Verily, the stoning of a adulterer/ress is found in the
Quraan and is the truth, if the witnesses are met or there is a
pregnancy or confession." Al-Bukhari: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Whoever
guarantees me that he will guard his chastity, I will guarantee him
Paradise”. Al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nisa’i and others: Abu Hurayrah reports that the Messenger of Allah said, “No one
commits adultery while still remaining a believer, for faith is more
precious unto Allah than such an evil act!” In another version, it
is stated, “When a person commits adultery he casts away from his
neck the bond that ties him to Islam; if, however, he repents, Allah
will accept his repentance”. Al-Bayhaqi: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “O mankind!
Beware of fornication/adultery for it entails six dire consequences:
three of them relating to this world and three to the next world. As
for the three that are related to this world, they are the
following: it removes the glow of one’s face, brings poverty, and
reduces the life-span. As for its dire consequences in the next
world they are: it brings down the wrath of Allah upon the person,
subjects him to terrible reckoning, and finally casts him in
hell-fire.”

The above Quranic verses and authentic sahih hadiths clearly
demonstrate beyond doubt that Prophet Muhammad, under Allah’s
direction, stoned adulterers to death and flogged fornicators.
Allah’s decree/choice of death for fornicators (Quran: 4:15) and
flogging adulteress 100 times with no mercy (Quran: 24:2, which also
could lead to certain death) has clearly sanctioned/dictated
dreadful punishment for sexual intercourse outside marriage. It is
from these scriptural divine spirits Iranian fundamentalist Islamic
government practices stoning and flogging adulterers even today. The
Iranian Supreme Court sanctioned that an adulteress should be buried
up to her chest and stoned to death. Mullahs of Iran know the
hadiths quite well. This august body is closely following Allah’s
prophet. It is also quite prudent to consider that Muslim parents
those who are practicing honor killing are directly motivated, or
influenced by the above scriptural and historical (Hadiths) support;
hence they are able to commit heinous crime called ‘honor killing’
with (almost) impunity, exultantly and with ample satisfaction that
they are following the strict Islamic ethical code to guard
chastity, as the holy Prophet repeatedly cautioned Muslims so
seriously to guard their women’s chastity. Islamic ethics for adultery: The Arabic word ‘Zina’ means all extramarital sexual intercourse
between a man and a woman. According to Islam “Zina” constituted
social suicide—an entire society commits suicide over time if it
allows fornication and adultery to go unpunished in the Islamic
style. As per Islamic justice—unmarried fornicators receive a
hundred stripes, but married adulterers must die by stoning, as
described in the sahih hadiths. Opinion of some famous Islamists about Zina The
Saudi Ambassador to London, Ghazi al-Qusaibi, says that stoning may
seem irrational to the western mind, but it is "at the core of the
Islamic faith." An intellectual, the Saudi ambassador to London
asserted that stoning adulterers to death is a legitimate punishment
for society. He also says that Westerners should respect Muslin
culture on this matter. Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and Islamic scholar at the
Islamic Institute of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, states: “Adultery in Islam is one of the most heinous and deadliest of
sins. Its enormity can be gauged from the fact that it has often
been conjoined in the Qur’an with the gravest of all sins: shirk or
associating partners with Allah.” Hani Ramadan head of the Islamic Center in Geneva (Hani Ramadan is
the elder brother of famed Swiss Muslim intellectual Tarek Ramadan,
who are both the grandsons of Hassan Al-Banna, the founder of
Egypt’s outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.) stated, “Islam has taken a firm and decisive stance against Zina
(fornication or adultery). Allah, the Almighty, commands in explicit
and unequivocal words: “And come not near unto adultery. Lo! it is
an abomination and an evil way.” (Al-Isra’: 32).” Mufti Muhammad Aashiq Illahi Muhajir Madani (Illuminating Discourses
on the Noble Qur’an, Karachi, Pakistan, Zam Zam, 2003) also follows
this tactic of describing society that does not undergo Islamic
punishments for the two sexual crimes. Families fall into ruin,
which means society also is ruined. Sexual sins also cause
widespread disease (vol. 6, pp. 360-66). Al Skudsi bin Hookah , (roving reporter and foreign correspondent
for The Gaza Gajeera.): “I am very unhappy. Our way of life is under attack. And we are
not fighting back. Deep down, we know that when a woman has
disgraced her family, nothing will restore honor except by killing
her. This is understood in Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, Egypt, the
Gaza strip and the West Bank. So why are we Arabs telling the
Western press that honor killing is cultural, that it is not really
part of Islam? Our way of life is based on maintaining our honor.
And make no mistake about it: a woman does tarnish her family's
honor by engaging in pre-marital sex, or by getting herself raped,
when she seeks divorce and when she marries against her family's
wishes. And keeping our women pure is a big part of our honor. So
there's no point saying honor killing isn't really part of our
religion. Honor and Islam are inextricably bound; they are what give
our life meaning. A strong religion demands we choose to maintain
our honor.”
Bassam al-Hadid, (A Jordanian with an American doctorate who spent
12 years as a hospital administrator in the United States): “I
would do what I have to do,” said, when asked whether he would
kill a daughter who had sex outside marriage." Status of Women in Muslim society: According to Islamic tradition the woman is an object owned by the
man who assumes responsibility for her behavior and her life. The
social and religious traditions lead to the isolation of the woman
in her home. She is required to cover her entire body in order to
maintain the honor of the man. In Qur’an, prophetic tradition and
law, one finds a very strong presumption of women’s chastity along
with numerous safeguards to prevent any imputation of un-chastity A
Muslim feminist sexual ethics must help create the conditions for
the Qur’anic and traditional values of modesty and chastity to be
lived by Muslim women and men in ways that are faithfully chosen and
equitably maintained.
Social Status of Women in Muslim Society
A woman who is either raped or commits adultery becomes the
source of shame to her family. People will not marry her because she
has been spoiled; she and her family becomes the object of gossip of
everyone in the society; hence the entire family can lose prestige.
No one would give a daughter to the brothers of that girl in
marriage and no one would marry her sisters. The family and even the
extended family are maligned and become outcasts. This can only stop
if the family cleanses that stain with blood. The woman thus defiled
must be killed even if she is a victim of rape. Role of Misogynistic attitude in Islam:
Islam is dreadfully anti-women. This statement can be proven with
100% guarantee by the well known and established fact that—women
folks in every Muslim country in general, and in every Islamic
paradise (country where Islamic Shariaat is enforced) in particular,
are severely subjugated, oppressed, and considered less than second
class citizen. Women in Islam are considered half human and in the
Quran women have half the rights of men, sister has half the rights
of brother, and women are considered deficient in intelligence. Practically and Literally Islam consider women as the sources of
great shame. Prophet Muhammad said women are awrah which can be
translated as object of shame. What is awrah? The Encyclopedia of
Islam defines 'awrah’as pudendum, which is the external genitals,
especially of the female. The word Pudendum derives from the Latin
pudor which means sense of shame and modesty. Therefore, awrah
signify an object of shame that needs to be covered. Interestingly, in the Indian sub-continent
(Bangladesh-India-Pakistan)—women have another alternative name
calling, in spite of having their usual name for the English word
woman in the respective language. And this famous name calling is
“Auraat” and common in all the three countries of the Indian
sub-continent. Obviously this common word “Auraat” for women came
from the Arabic word Awrah. This common word “Auraat” is usually
used as the synonym for woman with empathy, hatred, mercy and shame. According to the following Hadiths, women not only have ten 'awrah,
but the woman herself is perceived as 'awrah: "The woman is 'awrah.
When she goes outside (the house), the devil welcomes her" (Ihy'a 'Uloum
ed-Din by Ghazali, Dar al-Kotob al-'Elmeyah, Beirut , Vol II, Kitab
Adab al-Nikah, p. 65. Reported by Tirmizi as a true and good Ahadith). Hazrat Ali (rightly guided Caliph) reported the Prophet saying: “Women have ten ('awrah). When she gets married, the husband
covers one, and when she dies the grave covers the ten." (
Kanz-el-'Ummal, Vol. 22, Hadith No. 858. See also Ihy'a). In most fanatical Islamic nations when a woman loses her awrah by
e.g. through rape, she becomes the object of shame for her entire
family, and also for the society. Only way to remove that shame and
restore the honor is to remove that defiled woman. It is practiced
in most Islamic countries with a regular pattern. The more religious
is a country, the more is widespread the honor killing. As for
example, Pakistan a Muslim majority nation did not have practice of
honor killing until the fanatic and despotic Military dictator
General Ziaul Hoq came to power. This despotic ruler by his decade
long dictatorship turned Pakistan into an Islamic Sharia country.
Along with intense acceleration of making Pakistan into a hub of
Talibans, and Islamic terrorist’s country, citizens of Pakistan also
started vigorous practicing of honor killing on a regular basis. Conclusion: Judging everything I have described in this essay, one can very
genuinely lead to the conclusion that ‘honor killing’ is indeed the
vice of
Islam. Islam has much to do with honor killing practices which only
do exist amongst the Muslims of the world. Had it been un-Islamic
practice, we would have seen some Muslim nations prohibiting such
cruel practice by Sharia law. We have not seen any Muslim country
did enact any such law to curve honor killing. We have seen
innumerable cases of fatwas by Mullahs to prohibit alcohol drinking,
pork eating or listening western music; but never ever heard any
such fatwa against honor killing. Rather, honor killing has silent
support from the devout Islamists of all kinds. Islamists condone
honor killing silently! No wonder that the Al Skudsi bin Hookah
(reported of Gazagejeera) so passionately said: “So there's no point
saying honor killing isn't really part of our religion. Honor and
Islam are inextricably bound; they are what give our life meaning. A
strong religion demands we choose to maintain our honor.” One may argue that Quran does not say clearly about honor killing!
Fact is there are plenty of things Muslims practice that are also
not mentioned in the Quran. Stoning death also not available in the
Quran. Yet Iranian Islamic government does practice stoning death by
the decree of Islamic court. Afghan Taliban government did routinely
practice stoning and flogging of adulterers. Most importantly, Quran
did not create any scriptural instruction to ban the so called Arab
tribal practice of “honor killing” either! Besides, if the honor
killing was simply a tribal practice—then it would have been
prevailed amongst the Arabs of all religions. There is no evidence
to support that a Christian or Jewish family of Jordan or Palestine
did practice honor killing. Muslims who are stunningly devout and laden with Islamic
superstitious beliefs do commit crime of Honor killing to fulfill
their obligation of preserving Islamic ethics, and women chastity.
The more a country gets fanatically religious the more frequent are
honor killings (Pakistan is a perfect example). Islam has
incorporated many pre-Islamic practices of Arab pagans (stoning
deaths, flogging the fornicators, slavery, war booty, beheading the
criminals, cutting hands and foots of thieves, many rituals of
animal sacrifice, annual pilgrimage to Mecca etc.) and readily
called them Islamic or Allah’s laws. Honor killing is one such
pre-Islamic practice of Arab pagans which has been practicing by
some devout Muslim families of many good Islamic nations of the
world. Because of the fact that the “honor killings” do have silent support
from Islam, the killers are given light sentences, sometimes with
little or no jail time at all. The killers are primarily influenced
by Islamic ethics, and mainly defend their act of murder by
referring to the Koran and Islam. They usually justify their evil
deeds by the directives set down in the Islamic ethical beliefs and
principles. Koran is very strict and belligerent regarding how to
control women's sexuality, and Islamic Law; Sharia, rules harsh
punishments including lashing and stoning to death for women's
voluntary sexual activities. And it is because of these Islamic
elements of support, no Islamic government dares to enact any
criminal law to ban this barbaric slaughtering of innocent family
girls. Even then some Islamists will still say that “honor killing”
has nothing to do with Islam; just the way they say “Islamic
terrorism” has nothing to do with the so called peaceful Islam.
Their hypocritical denial is utter nonsense and stupendously
deceptive. I urge those Islamists to tell us why this “honor
killing” never happens among the non-Muslim Arab families? They must
also tell us—why no Arab and non-Arab Muslim government dare to make
any strict law to ban honor killings in their land? Denying the truth is tantamount to committing this heinous crime to
humanity, and denying will never solve this chronic problem of
Islamic nations. Only way honor killing can be stopped is to admit
the truth (real cause), and stop controlling public lives by the
draconian laws (Sharia) of Islam. Let there be a strict separation
of ‘Mosque and State’ in every Muslim majority nation of the world.
Honor killing will definitely cease to exist.

of the Country as pertaining to Kutu minar premises which have been used for criminal intimidation of the Armed forces of India as well as illegal occupancy outside in Kutub Collonade ; to inflict terror and to be used later on by the Builder mafia who have an eye on the vast jungles behind the Kutub Collonade.
I have also submitted in the Honorable Supreme Court a letter petition on 15-5-2007 for legal rights of Hindus to pray [Garuda Puraan for mokhsha and punya] and rebuild the ancient demolished Vishnu Temple in the Kutub Minar premises and also submitted an appeal to the Birla Mandir Trust ,Mandir Marg on 13-5-2008 as they have built and maintained Birla temples on Mahatma Gandhi’s Liberal social justice views.

Gurkhas under fire
Last Updated:
12:01am BST
/09/2002 Today's report by David Blair, our South Asia Correspondent, on the far-Left affiliations of a leading Gurkha veterans' association and the intimidatory methods of its activists will shock admirers of those doughty servants of the British Crown.
The Gurkha Army Ex-Servicemen's Organisation (Gaeso) is suing the British Government for discrimination and has engaged a team of lawyers, including Cherie Booth, QC, the Prime Minister's wife, to argue its case before the High Court. The organisation claims that under the Human Rights Act and racial discrimination laws, Gurkhas should enjoy the same conditions of service and pensions as British soldiers, and that former Gurkhas captured by the Japanese during the war should receive the same compensation as that already paid to British PoWs.
Whatever the merits of the case - and there are serious doubts about its consequences for Gurkhas - Gaeso's fund-raising techniques are deplorable. A leaflet distributed to Gurkha veterans in Nepal, part of a campaign to send representatives to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in 2000, warns that failure to pay will result in blacklisting.
It adds that any relative wishing to visit a blacklisted ex-Serviceman must inform the organisation in writing, or face a "fine". A woman who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals was visited by Gaeso fund-raisers on three occasions while her veteran husband was in hospital, the last time by seven men armed with sticks. A retired major who spoke out against Gaeso's decision to sue the Government has received death threats over the telephone.
The organisation claims "solidarity" with 10 Left-wing parties, including the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist), which wants to stop recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Army. Hiranya Lal Shreshtha, a member of both the party's national council and Gaeso's international committee for justice, opposes such recruitment on the grounds that it contradicts Nepal's non-aligned status and is a vestige of colonialism. Narayan Singh Pun, head of a federation of nine veteran bodies, all of which oppose bringing a court case, believes that this is Gaeso's real, politically motivated agenda.
In August, The Daily Telegraph published the address in this country to which readers could contribute to Gaeso funds. In the light of David Blair's revelations, we owe them an apology. This newspaper remains a staunch supporter of both serving and retired Gurkhas but today's report shows that Gaeso's description of itself as a non-political body raising money on a voluntary basis is questionable, to say the least. For Cherie Booth to represent it before the High Court could prove acutely embarrassing for her husband.

Sikh regiment dumped over 'racism' fears
By Sean Rayment
Last Updated: 12:30AM BST 24/06/2007
Defence chiefs have abandoned plans to raise a regiment of British Sikhs amid fears that the move would be branded racist.
The Indian Army's Sikh Regiment, which was formed in 1846
The proposal to create the regiment, reminiscent of those that fought for Britain in the two world wars, was dropped by the Ministry of Defence after discussions with the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE).
Sikh leaders had informed Army recruitment officers that they could easily find enough volunteers to form a 700-strong regiment. However, despite the infantry being under strength by 3,000 soldiers, the offer was rejected.
Lieutenant General Sir Freddie Viggers, the Adjutant General with responsibility for recruitment, is understood to have accepted the argument put forward by race commissioners at the CRE that creating a Sikh regiment would be divisive and amounted to "segregation".
Leaders of Britain's 500,000 Sikhs were supportive of the idea of a new regiment, arguing that it would be no different from the Scots, Welsh and Irish Guards or the Royal Gurkha Rifles, which recruits exclusively from Nepal and which is regarded as a model infantry regiment.
The decision to shelve the plans was last night criticised by politicians, members of the Sikh community and soldiers, who claimed that the Army had fallen victim to political correctness.
Kuljit Singh Gulati, the general secretary of the Sikh Temple in Shepherd's Bush, west London, said: "The Sikhs have a long and distinguished heritage of serving with the British Army.
"I know there are many, many Sikhs who would join up and would serve wherever required. But if you want to get them in large numbers they need their own regiment, something they would take a huge amount of pride in.
"They would regard it as very prestigious. It is a shame that it now looks as though it will never happen."
A senior Army officer said: "The MoD has missed a golden opportunity in not tapping into the Sikh community's desire to form a regiment. It's nonsense to suggest this would amount to segregation and since when did the CRE dictate Britain's defence -policy?"
The decision will also dismay Prince Charles, who has expressed an interest in the creation of dedicated units to boost the number of people from ethnic minorities in the services and to harness the military tradition of the Sikh faith in particular.
Last year, the armed forces were ordered to meet tough targets to recruit more men and women from ethnic minorities.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: "The creation of a Sikh Regiment has been considered by the Army policy staff responsible for both equality and diversity issues, who went on to consult with the Commission for Racial Equality.
"Both agreed that grouping ethnic minorities runs counter to the Armed Forces philosophy that seeks to include, not exclude, and extend opportunities."
A CRE spokesman said: "We would not support any policy that seeks to isolate specific groups in the Armed Forces or wider society.
"The creation of a separate regiment according to ethnicity would be segregation, which amounts to discrimination under the Race Relations Act. Anything that creates separation between regiments can only have a detrimental effect upon our Armed Forces' operational effectiveness." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expatriate An
expatriate
(in abbreviated form,
expat ) is a person temporarily or permanently
residing
in a country and culture other than that of the person's upbringing or legal residence. The word comes from the
Latin
ex
(out of)
and
patria
(country, fatherland) , and is sometimes misspelled (either unintentionally or intentionally) as
ex- patriot
or short
ex-pat
(because of its pronunciation).

Background
The term is often used in the context of Westerners living in non-Western countries, although it is also used to describe Westerners living in other Western countries, such as Americans living in the United Kingdom, or Britons living in Spain. It may also reasonably refer to Japanese living, for example, in
New York City . The key determinant would seem to be cultural/socioeconomic and causation.
In the 19th century, Americans, numbering perhaps in the thousands, were drawn to Europe—especially to
Munich
and
Paris —to study the art of painting. Henry James was a famous expatriate American writer from the 1870s, who adopted England as his home.
A nickname in the UK for former expatriates who have returned to Britain is the "When I"s, or "When we"s, as they are accused of starting conversations by saying "When I was in
Rhodesia " or "When we were in
Singapore ".
http://ezinearticles.com/?The-British-Sikh-Army&id=34567 The British Sikh Army Britain has a proud tradition of valiant armed forces and a capable military which has managed to defend these isles effectively for hundreds of years. British Military achievement is well known throughout the world and the bravery and versatility of its soldiers, seamen and airmen is unquestioned and forever stamped in history. Today as we look at the VE Day Celebrations there is an abundance of information in the media that provides an insight into what life would have been like in those troubled times. It is right that we remember them, the fallen, and the living whose numbers dwindle with every passing year. To them we owe our freedom as they fought for this land and often lost their lives so that we might remain a free country. However, whilst each country has a right to blow its own trumpet and remember the heroic gestures, hardships and victories that made this nation what it is today, we should also remember the massive sacrifice given by others from nations further afield. The Sikhs sacrificed a great deal for this country. During the Anglo-Sikh wars of 1845 – 1849 the British had been so impressed by the Khalsa Army they decided to enlist many battalions of Sikh forces. The former Sikh enemy became so loyal that in 1857 when most of the Indian Army revolted, the Sikhs remained totally supportive and fought side by side with the British Army. Subsequently, the Punjab became the recruiting ground for the British. This staunch and loyal Sikh support was to show itself again during the great wars. During the First World War Sikhs joined the ranks of the British Army in great numbers. They fought in the trenches of Germany and at Gallipoli where thousands of Sikhs fought and died. The British Indian Army was made of nearly 20% Sikhs, despite the fact that Sikhs account for only 2% of the population in India. During the Second World War this action was repeated. Even though there was now a quest for Indian Independence the British Indian Army grew from 189,000 at the start of the war to over 2.5 million through voluntary recruitment and a large proportion of those were Sikh. At no other time in history has a foreign army this large been voluntarily mobilised to fight for a foreign land as if it were their own country. The significance of this should not be underestimated. In 1944, Sikh Soldiers halted the advance of the Japanese in Burma and prevented them from invading India. Four VC’s were awarded in this campaign. As the British Empire came to a close many Sikhs were encouraged to settle in the UK. Their loyalty, hard work ethics and historic connection with the British should be remembered. Many Sikh families in Birmingham are direct descendents of those who put so much into this country. Of course, there were also millions of Russians who died in the Second World War. One might argue that the Russians won the war and that without them things would have been significantly different. Then of course there are the 100,000 Gurkhas who fought in World War I and the 40 battalions of Gurkhas in the Second World War. What of the Polish who valiantly fought during the Battle of Britain and those from other nations who out of Patriotism and loyalty, came from oversees to enlist, and often die, in order that we might enjoy our freedom today.

First Tri-Service
Sikh
conference takes place
16 Nov 06
A tri-Service
Sikh
Conference and Training Day has taken place at Army Training Regiment
Lichfield .
Attended
by
25
Sikh
personnel
from the Army, Navy and RAF it was the first event of its kind in the
UK
Armed
Forces.

Sikh
servicemen [Picture: MOD]
The event gave
Sikh
servicemen and women the opportunity
to come together and meet with the first
Sikh
Chaplain, Mandeep Kaur, also the event organiser. The Director of Anglo
Sikh
Heritage, Harbinder
Singh, also
attended
the conference.
Mandeep who took up the post of
Sikh
Chaplain in October 2005 said:
"The idea behind the conference was to introduce the military
Sikh
community to the
Sikh
Civilian Chaplaincy within the Forces and to meet others from the
Sikh
community. I was delighted with the response and it was a brilliant day for all concerned."
Mandeep is based at Copthorne Barracks, Shrewsbury . With around 100 Sikhs serving across all three services, one of her biggest challenges is getting to meet them all. In fact Mandeep thinks some don't even know she exists:
"The main reason for the conference was to meet up with all the
Sikh
servicemen and servicewomen, for them to meet each other and also get familiar with the Chaplaincy services. It's not possible for me to see each and every one individually, they are so spread out and some are on operations."
The event took place during the
Sikh
festival which celebrates the birthday of the first Guru and founder of the religion, Gurunanak Devi Ji. The delegates talked about his teachings and what it means to be a
Sikh . Topical issues were also
discussed as well as matters affecting the Service
Sikh
community, such as being a member of such a small minority.
As the
Sikh
Chaplain, Mandeep is responsible for the moral, pastoral and spiritual care of both the
Sikh
servicemen and women and their families.
"The service
personnel
want me to bring the families together too, so that the families understand what their work involves and that there is someone in the forces looking after them. Some of the older family members don't speak English so it's important to have someone in the forces that will talk to them in their own language and who understands their culture."
Mandeep and the delegates at this first conference have now decided to hold two meetings annually:
"The people I have talked to are so happy," she said. "Before, there was no central person to look after them regarding their spiritual and cultural issues."
She concluded:
"Some of the longer serving members said they had waited
for this kind of
event for the last
25 -30 years! There are over 100 Sikhs serving across the three services and my aspiration is to meet all of them at one or more of these conferences." www.ispr.gov.pk/ Multimedia/skh-cadet.htm

Hagia Sophia
( Greek :
Ἁγία Σοφία ; " Holy Wisdom ",
Turkish :
Ayasofya ,
Latin :
Sancta Sophia
or
Sancta Sapientia ) is a former
patriarchal
basilica , later a
mosque , now a
museum , in
Istanbul ,
Turkey . Famous in particular for its massive
dome , it is considered the epitome of
Byzantine architecture . It was the largest cathedral in the world for nearly a thousand years, until the completion of the Medieval
Seville Cathedral
in 1520.
The current building was originally constructed as a church between 532 and 537
AD
on the orders of the
Byzantine Emperor
Justinian , and was in fact the third
Church of the Holy Wisdom
to occupy the site (the previous two had both been destroyed by riots). It was designed by two architects,
Isidore of Miletus
and
Anthemius of Tralles . The Church contained a large collection of
holy relics
and featured, among other things, a 50 foot (15 m) silver
iconostasis . It was the
patriarchal church
of the
Patriarch of Constantinople
and the religious focal point of the
Eastern Orthodox Church
for nearly 1000 years.
In 1453,
Constantinople was conquered
by the
Ottoman Turks
and
Sultan
Mehmed II
ordered the building to be converted into a mosque. The bells, altar, iconostasis, and sacrificial vessels were removed, and many of the
mosaics
were eventually plastered over. The
Islamic features
- such as the
mihrab , the
minbar , and the four
minarets
outside - were added over the course of its history under the Ottomans. It remained as a mosque until 1935, when it was converted into a museum by the Republic of Turkey.
For almost 500 years the principal mosque of Istanbul, Hagia Sophia served as a model for many of the Ottoman mosques such as the
Sultan Ahmed Mosque
(Blue Mosque of Istanbul), the
Şehzade Mosque , the
Süleymaniye Mosque , and the
Rüstem Pasha Mosque .
Although it is sometimes referred to as
Saint Sophia
(Greek for wisdom), the Greek name in full is
Ναός τῆς Ἁγίας τοῦ Θεοῦ Σοφίας ,
Church of the Holy Wisdom of God , and it was dedicated to the
Holy Wisdom of God
rather than a specific saint named Sophia. History
[ edit ]
First church
Stone remains of the basilica ordered by Theodosius II, showing the Lamb of God
Nothing remains of the first church that was built on this location, known as the
Μεγάλη Ἐκκλησία
( Megálē Ekklēsíā , "Great Church"), or in
Latin
"Magna Ecclesia". [1]
As often happened in those days, the site was selected because there had been a pagan temple there. [2]
The church was built next to the area where the imperial palace was being developed and next to the smaller church
Hagia Eirene , finished first and acting as cathedral until the Hagia Sophia was completed. The Hagia Sophia was inaugurated by
Constantius II
on 15 February 360. Both churches acted together as the principal churches of the Byzantine Empire.
This church was chronicled by
Socrates of Constantinople
(380-440), who claimed that it was built by
Constantine the Great . It was built as a traditional Latin colonnaded basilica with galleries and a wooden roof. It was preceded by an
atrium . This first church was then already claimed to be one of the world's most outstanding monuments.
The appellation "Megálē Ekklēsíā" continued to be used for a long time, only to be replaced by the name "Hagia Sophia" after the conquest of Byzantium in 1453.
Marble blocks from the second church
[ edit ]
Second church
The patriarch of
Constantinople ,
John Chrysostom , came into a conflict with Empress
Aelia Eudoxia , wife of the Emperor
Arcadius
and was sent into exile on
20 June
404 . During the subsequent riots, this first church was largely burned down. A second church was ordered by
Theodosius II , who inaugurated it on
10 October
405 . The fire that started during the tumult of the
Nika Revolt
resulted in the destruction of the (second) Hagia Sophia, which burned down to the ground on 13-14 January 532.
Several marble blocks from this second church have survived to the present day, and they are displayed in the garden of the current (third) church. The blocks were originally part of a monumental front entrance; they were excavated in the western courtyard by A.M. Schneider in 1935.
[ edit ]
Third church
Depiction of the Hagia Sophia's appearance during Byzantine times
On
February 23 ,
532 , only a few days after the destruction of the second basilica, Emperor
Justinian I
took the decision to build a third and entirely different basilica, larger and more majestic than its predecessors.
Justinian chose the physicist
Isidore of Miletus
and the mathematician
Anthemius of Tralles
as architects; Anthemius, however, died within the first year. The construction is described by the Byzantine historian
Procopius '
On Buildings
(De Aedificiis). The emperor had material brought over from all over the empire, such as
Hellenistic columns
from the temple of
Artemis
at
Ephesus . Large stones were brought from far-away quarries:
porphyry
from
Egypt , green marble from
Thessaly , black stone from the
Bosporus
region and yellow stone from
Syria . More than ten thousand people were employed during this construction. This new church was immediately recognized as a major work of architecture, demonstrating the creative insights of the architects. They may have used the theories of
Heron of Alexandria
to be able to construct a huge dome over such a large open space. The emperor, together with the patriarch Eutychius, inaugurated the new basilica on
December 27 ,
537
with much pomp and circumstance. The mosaics inside the church were, however, only completed under the reign of Emperor
Justin II
(565-578).
Earthquakes in August 553 and on
December 14 ,
557
caused cracks in the main dome and the eastern half-dome to appear. The main dome collapsed completely during an earthquake on
May 7 ,
558 , destroying the
ambon , the altar and the
ciborium
over it. The emperor ordered an immediate restoration. He entrusted it to Isodorus the Younger, nephew of Isidore of Miletus. This time he used lighter materials and elevated the dome by 6.25 metres (20.5 ft), thus giving the building its current interior height of 55.6 metres (182 ft).
[3] . This reconstruction, giving the church its present
6th century
form, was completed in 562. The Byzantine poet
Paul the Silentiary
composed an extant, long epic poem, known as
Ekphrasis , for the rededication of the basilica, presided over by
Patriarch Eutychius , on
23 December
562 .
Hagia Sophia was the seat of the
Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople
and a principal setting for Byzantine imperial ceremonies, such as coronations. The basilica also offered asylum to wrongdoers. Foreign visitors were deeply impressed.
In 726 the Emperor
Leo the Isaurian
issued a series of edicts against the worship of images ( iconoclasm ), ordering the army to destroy all icons. At that time, all religious pictures and statues were removed from the Hagia Sophia. After a brief reprieve under Empress
Irene
(797-802), the iconoclasts made a comeback. Emperor
Theophilus
(829-842) was strongly influenced by the Islamic art, forbidding graven images. He had a two-winged bronze door with his
monograms
installed at the southern entrance of the church.
The basilica suffered damage, first by a great fire in 859, and again by an earthquake on
January 8 ,
869
that made a half-dome collapse. Emperor
Basil I
ordered the church to be repaired.
After the great earthquake of
25 October
989 , which ruined the great dome of Hagia Sophia, the Byzantine emperor
Basil II
asked for the Armenian architect
Trdat , creator of the great churches of
Ani
and Agine, to repair the dome. [4] . His main repairs were to the western arch and a portion of the dome. The extent of the church's destruction meant that reconstruction lasted six years. The church was re-opened on
13 May
994 .
In his book
De Ceremoniis aulae Byzantinae
(Book of Ceremonies), emperor
Constantine VII
(913-919) wrote about all the details of the ceremonies held in the Hagia Sophia by the emperor and the patriarch.
Tomb of
Enrico Dandolo , the
Doge
of
Venice
who commanded the
Sack of Constantinople
in 1204, inside the Hagia Sophia
At the capture of Constantinople during the
Fourth Crusade , the church was ransacked and desecrated. The
Byzantine Greek
historian
Niketas Choniates
described the capture of Constantinople. Many relics from the church, such as a stone from the tomb of
Jesus , the
Virgin Mary 's milk, the shroud of Jesus, and bones of several saints, were sent to churches in the West and can be seen now in various museums in the West. During the
Latin occupation of Constantinople
(1204–1261) the church became a
Roman Catholic
cathedral.
Baldwin I of Constantinople
was crowned emperor on
16 May
1204
in the Hagia Sophia, at a ceremony which closely followed Byzantine practices.
Enrico Dandolo , the
Doge
of
Venice
who commanded the sack and invasion of the city by the Latin Crusaders in 1204, is buried inside the church. The tomb inscription carrying his name, which has become a part of the floor decoration, was spat upon by many of the angry Byzantines who recaptured Constantinople in 1261. However, restoration carried out during the period 1847-1849 cast doubt upon the authenticity of the doge's grave. It is more likely a symbolic burial site to keep alive his memory.
After the recapture in 1261 by the Byzantines, the church was in a dilapidated state. The four buttresses in the west were probably built during this time. In 1317, emperor
Andronicus II
ordered four new buttresses to be built in the eastern and northern parts of the church. After new cracks had developed in the dome after the earthquake of October 1344, several parts of the building collapsed on
19 May
1346 . After that, the church remained closed until 1354, when repairs were undertaken by the architects Astras and Peralta.

Fountain ( Şadirvan ) for ritual ablutions
The
mihrab
located in the apse where the altar used to stand, pointing towards Mecca
Immediately after the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453, the Hagia Sophia was converted to a mosque. At that time, the church was very dilapidated. Several of its doors had fallen off. This condition was described by several Western visitors, such as the
Córdoban
nobleman
Pero Tafur [5]
and the
Florentine
Cristoforo Buondelmonti . [6]
The
sultan
Mehmed II
ordered the immediate cleanup of the church and its conversion to a mosque. The next sultan
Bayezid II
built a new
minaret , replacing the one built by his father.
In the
16th century
the sultan
Suleiman the Magnificent
(1520-1566) brought back two colossal candles from his conquest of
Hungary . They were placed on both sides of the
mihrab . During the reign of
Selim II
(1566-1577), the building started showing signs of fatigue and was extensively strengthened with the addition of structural supports to its exterior by the great Ottoman architect
Sinan , who is also considered one of the world's first earthquake engineers. In addition to strengthening the historic Byzantine structure, Sinan built the two additional large minarets at the western end of the building, the original sultan's loge, and the mausoleum of Selim II to the southeast of the building (then a mosque) in 1577. The mausoleums of
Murad III
and
Mehmed III
were built next to it in the 1600s.
Later additions were the sultan's gallery, a
minbar
decorated with marble, a dais for a sermon and a
loggia
for a
muezzin .
The sultan Murad III (1574-1595) had two large
alabaster
Hellenistic urns transported from
Pergamon
and placed on two sides of the nave.
Sultan
Mahmud I
ordered the restoration of the building in 1739 and added a
medrese
(a Koranic school, now the library of the museum), a soup kitchen (for distribution to the poor) and a library, and in 1740 a fountain for ritual ablutions ( Şadirvan ), thus transforming it into a
külliye , i.e. a social complex. At the same time a new sultan's gallery and a new mihrab were built inside.
The most famous restoration of the Hagia Sophia was ordered by Sultan
Abdülmecid
and completed by eight hundred workers between 1847 and 1849, under the supervision of the Swiss-Italian architect brothers Gaspare and Giuseppe Fossati. The brothers consolidated the dome and vaults, straightened the columns, and revised the decoration of the exterior and the interior of the building. The mosaics in the upper gallery were cleaned. The old
chandeliers
were replaced by new pendant ones. New gigantic circular-framed disks were hung on columns. They were inscribed with the names of
Allah , the
prophet
Muhammad , the first four caliphs
Abu Bakr ,
Umar ,
Uthman
and
Ali , and the two grandchildren of Mohammed:
Hassan
and
Hussain , by the calligrapher Kazasker İzzed Effendi (1801-1877). In 1850 the architect Fossati built a new sultan's gallery in a
Neo-Byzantine style
connected to the royal pavilion behind the mosque. Outside the Hagia Sophia, a timekeeper's building and a new medrese were built. The minarets were altered so that they were of equal height. When the restoration was finished, the mosque was re-opened with ceremonial pomp on
13 July
1849 .
[ edit ]
Museum
In 1935, the
first Turkish President
and founder of the Republic of Turkey,
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk , transformed the building into a museum. The carpets were removed and the marble floor decorations appeared for the first time in centuries, while the white plaster covering the mosaics was painstakingly removed by expert restorers.

Architecture
A section of the original architecture of Hagia Sophia
Groundplan of the Hagia Sophia
Ottoman stone buttresses
Hagia Sophia is one of the greatest surviving examples of
Byzantine architecture . Of great artistic value was its decorated interior with
mosaics
and
marble
pillars and coverings. The temple itself was so richly and artistically decorated that Justinian proclaimed, " Solomon , I have surpassed thee!" (Νενίκηκά σε Σολομών). Justinian himself had overseen the completion of the greatest cathedral ever built up to that time, and it was to remain the largest cathedral for 1,000 years up until the completion of the
cathedral in Seville
in Spain.
Justinian's basilica was at once the culminating architectural achievement of
late antiquity
and the first masterpiece of Byzantine architecture. Its influence, both architecturally and liturgically, was widespread and enduring in the
Eastern Orthodox ,
Roman Catholic , and
Muslim
worlds alike. Under Justinian's orders, eight
Corinthian columns
were disassembled from
Baalbek ,
Lebanon
and shipped to Constantinople for the construction of Hagia Sophia. [7]
The vast interior has a complex structure. The vast
nave
is covered by a central dome which has a maximum diameter of 31.24 metres (102 ft 6 in) and a height from floor level of 55.6 metres (182 ft 5 in), about one fourth smaller than the dome of the
Pantheon . The dome seems rendered weightless by the unbroken arcade of 40 arched windows under it, which help flood the colourful interior with light. Due to consecutive repairs in the course of its history, the dome has lost its perfect circular base and has become somewhat elliptical with a diameter varying between 31.24 m (102 ft 6 in) and 30.86 m (101 ft 3 in).
The dome is carried on
pendentives
— four concave triangular sections of masonry which solve the problem of setting the circular base of a dome on a rectangular base. At Hagia Sophia the weight of the dome passes through the pendentives to four massive piers at the corners. Between them the dome seems to float upon four great arches. These were reinforced with buttresses during Ottoman times, under the guidance of the architect
Sinan .
At the western (entrance) and eastern (liturgical) ends, the arched openings are extended by half domes carried on smaller semi-domed
exedras . Thus a hierarchy of dome-headed elements builds up to create a vast oblong interior crowned by the main dome, a sequence unexampled in antiquity. Despite all these measures, the weight of the dome remained a problem, which was solved by adding buttresses from the outside.
All interior surfaces are sheathed with polychrome marbles, green and white with purple
porphyry
and gold mosaics, encrusted upon the brick. This sheathing camouflaged the large pillars, giving them, at the same time, a brighter aspect.
On the exterior, simple
stuccoed
walls reveal the clarity of massed vaults and domes. The yellow and red colour of the exterior was added by the architect Fossati during the restorations in the
19th century .
[ edit ]
Dome
The dome of Hagia Sophia has spurred particular interest for many art historians and architects because of the innovative way the original architects envisioned the dome. The dome is supported by pendentives which had never been used before the building of this structure. The pendentive enables the round dome to transition gracefully into the square shape of the piers below. The pendentives not only achieve a pleasing aesthetic quality, but they also restrain the lateral forces of the dome and allow the weight of the dome to flow downward.
Although this design stabilizes the dome and the surrounding walls and arches, the actual construction of the walls of Hagia Sophia weakened the overall structure. The
bricklayers
used more
mortar
than
brick , which weakened the walls. The structure would have been more stable if the builders at least let the mortar cure before they began the next layer; however, they did not do this. When the dome was placed atop the building, the weight of the dome caused the walls to lean outward because of the wet mortar underneath. When Isidorus the Younger rebuilt the original dome, he had to first build up the interior of the walls so that they were vertical in order to support the weight of the new dome. Another probable change in the design of the dome when it was rebuilt was the actual height of the dome. Isidore the Younger raised the height of the dome by approximately twenty feet so that the lateral forces would not be as strong and the weight of the dome would flow more easily down the walls.
A second interesting fact about the original structure of the dome was how the architects were able to place forty windows around the base of the dome. Hagia Sophia is famous for the mystical quality of light that reflects everywhere in the interior of the nave, which gives the dome the appearance of hovering above the nave. This design is possible because the dome is shaped like a
scalloped
shell or the inside of an umbrella with ribs that extend from the top of the dome down to the base. These ribs allow the weight of the dome to flow between the windows, down the pendentives, and ultimately to the foundation.
The anomalies in the design of Hagia Sophia show how this structure is one of the most advanced and ambitious monuments of late antiquity.

Marble jar
Marble jar from Pergamon
The marble jar was brought from
Pergamon
during the reign of Sultan
Murad III . Originally from the Hellenistic period, it was carved from a single block of marble.

Narthex and portals
Imperial Gate
The Imperial Gate was the main entrance between the exo- and esonarthex. It was reserved only for the emperor. The Byzantine mosaic above the portal depicts Christ and Emperor
Leo VI the Wise .
A long ramp from the northern part of the outer narthex leads up to the upper gallery.
[ edit ]
Upper Gallery
The upper gallery is laid out in a horseshoe shape that encloses the nave until the apse. Several mosaics are preserved in the upper gallery, an area traditionally reserved for the empress and her court. The best-preserved mosaics are located in the southern part of the gallery.

Loge of the Empress
The Loge of the Empress
The
Loge of the Empress
is located in the centre of the upper enclosure, or gallery, of the Hagia Sophia. From there the empress and the court-ladies would watch the proceedings down below. A round, green stone marks the spot where the
throne
of the empress stood.

Marble Door

The
Marble Door
inside the Hagia Sophia is located in the southern upper enclosure, or gallery. It was used by the participants in
synods , they entered and left the meeting chamber through this door.
[ edit ]
Decorations
Originally, under Justinian's reign, the interior decorations consisted of abstract designs of the marble slabs on the walls and mosaics on the curving vaults. Of these, one can still see the two
archangels
Gabriel
and
Michael
in the
spandrels
of the bema. There were already a few figurative decorations, as attested by the eulogy of
Paul the Silentiary . The spandrels of the gallery are revetted in
opus sectile , showing patterns and figures of flowers and birds in precisely cut pieces of white marble set against a background of black marble. In later stages figurative mosaics were added, which were destroyed during the
iconoclastic controversy
(726-843). Present mosaics are from the post-iconoclastic period. The number of treasures, relics and miracle-working, painted icons of the Hagia Sophia grew progressively richer into an amazing collection. Apart from the mosaics, a large number of figurative decorations were added during the second half of the ninth century: an image of Christ in the central dome; Orthodox saints, prophets and
Church Fathers
in the
tympana
below; historical figures connected with this church, such as
Patriarch Ignatius ; some scenes from the
gospel
in the galleries.
[ edit ]
Mosaics
Mosaics with geometric pattern decorate the upper imperial gallery
The church was richly decorated with mosaics throughout the centuries. They either depicted the Virgin Mother, Jesus, Saints, or emperors and empresses. Other parts were decorated in a purely decorative style with geometric patterns.
During the
Sack of Constantinople
in 1204, the Latin Crusaders vandalized the valuable items in every important Byzantine structure of the city, including the golden mosaics of the Hagia Sophia. Much of these valuable items were shipped to
Venice , whose
Doge ,
Enrico Dandolo , had organized the invasion and sack of Constantinople.
Following the building's conversion into a mosque in 1453, many of its mosaics were destroyed or covered with plaster, due to
Islam 's ban on representational imagery. This process was not completed at once, and reports exist from the
17th century
in which travellers note that they could still see Christian images in the former church. In 1847-49, the building was restored by two Swiss brothers, Gaspare and Giuseppe Fossati, and Sultan
Abdülmecid
allowed them to also document any mosaics they might discover during this process. This work did not include repairing the mosaics and after recording the details about an image, the Fossatis painted it over again. This work included covering the previously uncovered faces of two
seraphim
mosaics located in the centre of the building. The building currently features a total of four of these images and two of them are restorations in paint created by the Fossatis to replace two images of which they could find no surviving remains. In other cases, the Fossatis recreated damaged decorative mosaic patterns in paint, sometimes redesigning them in the process. The Fossati records are the primary sources about a number of mosaic images now believed to have been completely or partially destroyed in an earthquake in 1894. These include a great mosaic of
Christ Pantocrator
in the dome, a mosaic over a now unidentified
Door of the Poor , a large image of a jewel-encrusted
cross
and a large number of images of
angels ,
saints ,
patriarchs , and church fathers. Most of the missing images were located in the building's two tympana. The Fossatis also added a pulpit (minbar) and the four large medallions on the walls of the nave bearing the names of Muhammad and Islam's first caliphs.
Imperial gate mosaics
[ edit ]
Imperial Gate mosaic
Imperial Gate mosaics : located in the
tympanum
above the gate, used only by the emperors when entering the church. Based on style analysis, it has been dated to the late
9th
or early
10th century . The emperor with a
nimbus
could possibly represent emperor
Leo VI the Wise
or his son
Constantine VII Porphyrogenetos
bowing down before Christ Pantocrator, seated on a jeweled throne, giving His blessing and holding in His left hand an open book. [8]
The text on the book reads as follows : "Peace be with you. I am the light of the world". (John 20:19; 20:26; 8:12) On each side of Christ's shoulders is a circular medallion : on His left the Archangel Gabriel (founder of the church), holding a
staff , on His right His Mother Mary. These mosaics express the timeless power bestowed by Christ on the Byzantine emperors.
[ edit ]
Southwestern entrance mosaic
Virgin and Child flanked by Justinian I and Constantine I
Southwestern entrance mosaics , situated in the tympanum of the southwestern entrance, date from 944. They were rediscovered during the restorations of 1849 by Fossati. The Virgin sits on a throne without a back, her feet resting on a pedestal, embellished with precious stones. The
Child Christ
sits on her lap, giving His blessing and holding a scroll in His left hand. On her left side stands emperor Constantine in ceremonial attire, presenting a model of the city to Mary. The inscription next to him says : "Great emperor Constantine om the Saints". On her right side stands emperor
Justinian I , offering a model of the Hagia Sophia. The medallions on both sides of the Virgin's head carry the
monograms
MP and ΘY, an abbreviation of " Mater " and " Theou ", meaning "Mother of God".
[ edit ]
Apse mosaics
Mosaic of the Virgin and Child (in the apse)
Virgin and Child : this was the first of the post-iconoclastic mosaics. It was inaugurated on
29 March
867
by
Patriarch Photios
and the emperors
Michael III
and
Basil I . This mosaic is situated in a high location on the half dome of the apse. Mary is sitting on a throne without a back, holding the Child Jesus on her lap. Her feet rest on a pedestal. Both the pedestal and the throne are adorned with precious stones. These mosaics are believed to be a reconstruction of the mosaics of the sixth century that were previously destroyed during the iconoclastic era. The mosaics are set against the original golden background of the
6th century . The portraits of the archangels Gabriel and Michael (largely destroyed) in the
bema
of the arch also date from the 9th century.
[ edit ]
Emperor Alexander mosaic
The
Emperor Alexander mosaic
is not easy to find for the first-time visitor, located in the upper parts close to the ceiling. It depicts
Emperor Alexander
in full regalia, holding a skull in his left hand.
[ edit ]
Empress Zoe mosaics
Empress Zoe mosaics
The
Empress Zoe mosaics
on the eastern wall of the southern gallery date from the
11th century . Christ Pantocrator, clad in the dark blue robe (as always the custom in Byzantine art), is seated in the middle against a golden background, giving His blessing with the right hand and holding the
Bible
in His left hand. On either side of His head are the monograms
IC
and
XC , meaning
Iesous Christos . He is flanked by
Constantine IX Monomachos
and
Empress Zoe , both in ceremonial costumes. He is offering a purse, as symbol of the donation he made to the church, while she is holding a scroll, symbol of the donations she made. The inscription over the head of the emperor says : "Constantine Monomachos, the pious ruler of Romans and the servant of God's Jesus". The inscription over the head of the empress reads as follows : "Very pious Augusta Zoë". The previous heads have been scraped off and replaced by the three present ones. Perhaps the earlier mosaic showed her first husband
Romanos III Argyros
or her adopted son
Michael IV . Another theory is that these mosaics were made for an earlier emperor and empress, with their heads changed into the present ones.
[ edit ]
Comnenos mosaic
Comnenos mosaic
The
Mosaics of the Comnenos , equally located on the eastern wall of the southern gallery, date from 1122. The Virgin Mary is standing in the middle, depicted, as usual in Byzantine art, in a dark blue gown. She holds the Child Christ on her lap. He gives His blessing with His right hand while holding a scroll in His left hand. On her right side stands emperor
John II Komnenos , represented in a garb embellished with precious stones. He holds a purse, symbol of an imperial donation to the church. Empress
Eirene
stands on the left side of the Virgin, wearing ceremonial garments, offering a document. Their eldest son Alexius Comnenos is represented on an adjacent pilaster. His mournful features, reflect his death from
tuberculosis
in the same year. In this panel one can already see a difference with the Empress Zoe mosaics that is one century older. There is a more realistic expression in the portraits instead of an idealized representation. The empress is shown with plaited blond hair, rosy cheeks and grey eyes, revealing her Hungarian descent. The emperor is depicted in a dignified manner.
[ edit ]
Deësis mosaic
Deësis mosaics
The
Deësis (Entreaty) mosaic
probably dates from 1261. It was commissioned to mark the end of 57 years of Roman Catholic use and the return to the Orthodox faith. It is the third panel situated in the imperial enclosure of the upper galleries. It is widely considered the finest in Hagia Sophia, because of the softness of the features, the humane expressions and the tones of the mosaic. The style is close to that of the Italian painters of the late
13th
or early
14th century , such as
Duccio . In this panel the Virgin Mary and
John the Baptist
( Ioannes Prodromos ), both shown in three-quarters profile, are imploring the intercession of Christ Pantocrator for humanity on
Judgment Day . The bottom part of this mosaic is badly deteriorated, probably due to rain since the mosaic is next to the windows. This mosaic is considered as the beginning of the Renaissance in Byzantine pictorial art.
[ edit ]
Northern tympanon mosaics
Mosaic in the northern tympanon depicting Saint
John Chrysostom
The
northern tympanon mosaics
feature various saints. They have been able to survive due to the very high and unreachable location. They depict Saints
John Chrysostom
and
Ignatius the Younger
standing, clothed in white robes with crosses, and holding richly jewelled Holy Bibles. The names of each saint is given around the statues in Greek, in order to enable an identification for the visitor. The other mosaics in the other tympani have not survived probably due to the frequent earthquakes as opposed to any deliberate destruction by the Ottoman conquerors.
[ edit ]
20th-century restoration
The interior of the dome undergoing restoration
A large number of mosaics were uncovered in the 1930s by a team from the
American Byzantine Institute
led by
Thomas Whittemore . The team chose to let a number of simple cross images remain covered by plaster, but uncovered all major mosaics found.
Due to its long history as both a church and a mosque, a particular challenge arises in the restoration process. The Christian
iconographic
mosaics are being gradually uncovered. However, in order to do so, important, historic Islamic art would have to be destroyed. Restorers have attempted to maintain a balance between both Christian and Islamic cultures. In particular, much controversy rests upon whether the
Islamic calligraphy
on the dome of the cathedral should be removed, in order to permit the underlying Pantocrator mosaic of Christ as Master of the World, to be exhibited (assuming the mosaic still exists).
[ edit ]
Minarets
One of the minarets (at southwest) was built from red brick while the other three were built from white marble; of which the slender one at northeast was erected by Sultan
Bayezid II
while the two larger minarets at west were erected by Sultan
Selim II
and designed by the famous Ottoman architect
Sinan . The reason for the varying dimensions and mass of the minarets was to counterweight the main structure's mass and distribute the weight uniformly. This application by Mimar Sinan was one of the earliest seismic and geotechnical engineering efforts in the world. Latest research shows that without the
counterweight
of the minarets, the main structure would tend to collapse. [ citation needed ]

Investigation into the Kanishka Bombing
1985
The arrest of three Sikh terrorists in Vancouver, Canada for their
alleged role in the bombing of an Air India (AI) flight on June 23,
1985 marks a crucial stage in the 15-year investigation carried out
by the Canadian authorities in cooperation with the Indian government
into the incident. The AI flight 182
Kanishka
on June 23, 1985
from Toronto with a brief stopover at Montreal was
en route
to
New Delhi when it exploded off, the coast of Ireland while it was preparing
to land at the Heathrow airport. The mid-air explosion which killed
all the 329 people on board is widely considered to be one of the world's
deadliest acts of terrorism and civilian aviation sabotage. Investigations
reveal that it was one of two related bomb explosions allegedly carried
out by Sikh terrorists. The other explosion occurred at the Narita airport
in Tokyo killing two people.
The long drawn-out investigation, still in progress, into the AI flight
bombing has been carried out by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)
in conjunction with police authorities in India, North America, Europe
and Asia. After a 15-year probe, the RCMP on October 27, 2000 arrested
two Sikh terrorists based in Canada for their alleged role in the incident.
The RCMP arrested another unidentified suspect on October 29, 2000 and
released him on bail after interrogating him for nearly 24 hours. The
two terrorists arrested on October 27 identified as Ripudaman Singh
Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri have been remanded to judicial custody in
Vancouver. Two other terrorist, Talwinder Singh Parmar and Inderjit
Singh Reyat have been declared as co-conspirators in both the incidents.
Talwinder Singh Parmar, a Babbar Khalsa terrorist was killed by the
Punjab Police in 1992. Inderjit Singh Reyat was sentenced in 1991 to
serve a 10-year imprisonment for manufacturing the bomb intended to
blow-up the AI flight. Both Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri
been charged on eight counts including criminal conspiracy and fist-degree
murder.
Canadian authorities after protracted investigations have made a preliminary
ascertainment to the effect that the flight was destroyed through a
bomb that passed through the security-check at the Vancouver airport
onto a Canadian Pacific airline. The bomb then found its way to the
AI flight
Kanishka
in Toronto. Indications are that an unidentified
suspect brought air tickets in Vancouver that allowed the two bomb-laden
suitcases to pass through airport security. No passenger boarded the
flight with these tickets. One of the two suitcases was transferred
in Toronto to AI flight 182. The other suitcase was to have been transferred
to an AI flight from Japan to India. But, the bomb exploded prematurely
at the Narita airport in Tokyo killing two baggage handlers. The unidentified
suspect was arrested in Canada as early as November 1985 but was released
due to lack of evidence. Inderjit Singh Reyat was found guilty of manslaughter
and making explosive substances among other charges and received a 10-years
sentence and a firearm prohibition of 5 years for his role in the Narita
airport incident.
The Canadian authorities, in the aftermath of the bombing, suspected
Sikh terrorists of planting the bombs in revenge for 'Operation Blue
Star', the 1984 security forces raid aimed at flushing out terrorists
from the Golden temple in Amritsar. According to an RCMP spokesperson,
the bombings were planned and organised in Canada. The Canadian probe,
the longest and one of the costliest - the RCMP is reported to have
already incurred an expenditure of 30 million Canadian dollars - was
also a complex investigative process as it had too many people to interrogate
in various countries. Moreover, in the initial phase, the authorities
were unsure about the place or origin of the bombs - Canada, India or
elsewhere. In the light of the evidence gathered so far and the recent
arrests, the RCMP is in the process of planning arrests of at least
four other suspects. The RCMP also believes that the release of a third
suspect-although unidentified, sources claim that it was Hardiyal Singh
Johal, a 'prominent ' member of the Sikh community in British Columbia-
would not be a setback to the ongoing investigation process and the
formal charging of the suspects in the British Columbia Supreme Court.
Immediately after the 1985 bombing of the
Kanishka,
the Indian
government had instituted the Justice B.N Kirpal Commission of Inquiry.
The main agenda of the Kirpal Commission was to explore whether AI flight
182 had crashed due to an explosion, a machine failure, or human error.
It arrived at a clear conclusion that the AI flight had exploded in
mid-air and had fallen into the ocean because of a bomb which had planted
in Canada. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which had assisted
the RCMP in its probe also constituted a investigation process. The
CBI findings established that the bombing was the handiwork of Babbar
Khalsa International (BKI), a terrorist outfit in Punjab and the mastermind
was Talwinder Singh Parmar, a frontranking leader of the same outfit.
Since the main area of investigation is in Canada, the CBI was largely
associated in collecting information, documents and evidence sought
by the RCMP.
Official sources in India have reported that the while the Indian
government views the arrests of the terrorists as a positive development,
it would wait for the completion of the probe by the Canadian authorities
before deciding on any future course of action. Reports also indicate
that the government has so far not made any official request for the
extradition of the arrested suspects as the offence was committed in
Canada and the trial is also due to take place in the same country.
Moreover, there are no proceedings pending against the arrested terrorists
in India.

More could have died in Kanishka bombing: Witness November 05, 2003
20:08
IST
A key witness in the Air India trial has testified that one of the chief accused told her that there would have been far more deaths following the Kanishka bombing had there not been problems with the plot to blow up the plane.
He had also told her that any evidence of his involvement in the bombing went down with the aircraft that crashed off the Irish coast killing all 329 passengers on board on
June
23, 1985 .
Complete coverage of the Kanishka bombing The woman who shared a relationship with Vancouver-based business Ripudaman Singh Malik, one of the chief accused in the Kanishka bombing, testified on Tuesday that Malik had listed a series of problems which came in the way of his plans to destroy Air
India
planes in the campaign for a separate Sikh homeland.
"There would have been far more deaths. People would have known what we are all about. People would have known what we were fighting for (the Khalistan cause)," Malik had told the woman during one of their conversations.
She said Malik confessed his part in
Canada 's biggest mass murder in late March or April 1997 to her when she confronted him about a Punjabi newspaper article that implicated him without naming him, media reports said.
The woman, who is under police protection and cannot be identified and is the star prosecution witness at the trial of Malik, said when she pointed out to Malik that there were Sikhs aboard the flight, 'he said there weren't any Sikhs'.
The 43-year-old woman said Malik also assured her that any evidence linking him to the bombings went down with the airplane. When she asked him if he could me in trouble, he said, "There is nothing to worry about. If there is anything about me it's down in the ocean," she quoted him as saying, 'CBC News' reported.
The woman also testified that several people were involved in the Kanishka bombing plot, took suitcases filled with bombs to the Vancouver airport, but one of them Hardial Singh Johal even tried to warn passengers not to board the plane.
Johal was picked up twice in the investigation but was never charged with any offence. He died last year.
She testified that Malik was the financier of the project, paying for the airplane tickets.
On being asked by Canadian prosecutor Joe Bellows about Malik's role in a group of Sikhs involved in making the bombs, buying tickets for the flights and then checking the suitcases onto the planes, the woman, who worked in a Sikh school between 1992 and 1997 said, "Everyone had their own task to do and Malik was mostly overseeing them."
She said Malik had told her that Johal did a lot of running around and was part of the group that delivered the suitcases.
The woman's testimony marks for the first time in the 18-year-old international terrorism case that the inner circle allegedly involved in the scheme have been publicly identified,
The Globe and Mail
daily said.
Speaking in a crisp, accented voice, the woman testified that Malik told her that he booked two airline tickets in
Vancouver , arranged for someone to pick them up and provided money to pay for them.
"Malik oversaw everyone else involved in the scheme, which he referred to as the Project," she told the British Columbia Court hearing the Air India case.
Malik also told the woman that the tickets, booked in
Vancouver
ticket office, connected to Air
India
flights in
Toronto
and
Tokyo . She said
he told her he originally tried to get the tickets through
Montreal
but switched to
Toronto .
The woman said Malik had a hint of sadness in his voice as he talked about the bombing plot, but he also grinned and ended the conversation by warning her against repeating what he told her to anyone.
He had said, "I just want to you to remember that I can't always protect you," Canadian TV news network said.
Malik also told his confidante in 1997 that he was at his Kamloops home before the bombing with three other people
who were studying a drawing of the Boeing 747 that would be bombed, she testified.
The woman said Ajaib Singh Bagri, a
Kamloops
mill worker and co-accused in the Kanishka bombing case, was among the group of four people who took suitcases with bombs to the airport.
She said Malik sent a man named Daljit Singh Sandhu to the airport to pick up
the ticket. Sandhu did not have enough money and changed the return tickets to one-way, she testified.
Others in the group included a man called Balwant Singh Bhandher who drove the suitcases to the airport in a brown van. Neither Sandhu nor Bhandher have ever been arrested in the Air India case.
Malik had also told her that a man called Surjan Singh Gill worked very hard as part of the inner circle but backed out at the last minute, deciding he did not want to be part of it.
Inderjit Singh Reyat, the only person to have been convicted of murder so far in the Air India case, was also part of the group but had lots of other problems, she testified. She added that Malik had told her that Reyat was not very intelligent and had sent someone else to help him.
On the day of the bombings in 1985, Johal, Bagri, Sandhu, Bhandher and a man named Manmahon Singh went to the house of Talwinder Singh Parmar and waited at his house for confirmation that the planes had taken off,

Deadly blasts hit Indian capital
The area was full of shoppers Enlarge Image More
than 50 people are dead and scores wounded in a series of suspected bomb blasts
in India's capital, Delhi.
Two near-simultaneous blasts took place in markets in central and south
Delhi, crowded with people shopping ahead of religious festivals next week.
The third blast occurred in the area of Govindpuri which is in the southern
part of the city.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh blamed "terrorists" for the blasts and said he
would not tolerate militant violence.
No-one has yet admitted carrying out the explosions.
Pakistan condemnation
Officials say more than 50 people are confirmed dead. At least 80 more are
being treated in hospital, 10 of whom are in critical condition.
The blasts left a scene of widespread devastation
In pictures
Most of those killed died in the blast at the southern Sarojini Nagar market,
they say.
A number also reportedly died in the first explosion, minutes before, in the
crowded central neighbourhood of Paharganj, an area close to Delhi's main
railway station and popular with Western backpackers.
Some reports say the Govindpuri blast was a bus bomb and that three people
died, although this could not be confirmed.
Prime Minister Singh cut short his visit to the north-east to return to
Delhi, urging people to remain calm.
HAVE YOUR SAY
It is particularly tragic that this has happened just days before
Diwali

Chaos
and confusion
In a brief televised address, he said: "These are dastardly acts of
terrorism. We are resolute in our commitment to fighting terrorism in all
forms."
India's home ministry has convened an emergency meeting of security and
intelligence officials and all major markets in the city have been ordered to
close.
India's long-term rival Pakistan condemned the explosions.
Its foreign ministry said in a statement: "Pakistan strongly condemns the
terrorist attacks in Delhi, which have resulted in the loss of a number of
innocent lives.
"The attack in a crowded market place is a criminal act of terrorism."
'Ordinary shoppers'
Many shops were damaged in the market blasts.
"The blast was so powerful, my house shook," Kiran Mohan, a photo editor who
lives about 200m (650 ft) away from Sarojini market, told Associated Press.
Babu Lal Khandelwal, a shop owner in Paharganj, said: "There was black smoke
everywhere. When the smoke cleared and I could see, there were people bloody and
people lying in the street."
Sarojini Nagar shopkeeper, Bansi Lal, said: "There were two foreigners who
were on fire and they were begging me to help them. But I was in a daze. I could
not help them."
The BBC's Paul Danahar, who was at the site of the blast in Sarojini Nagar,
says the scene was one of carnage and confusion.
Most of the people affected were ordinary people out shopping in the festival
season, he says.
Both the Hindu festival of lights known as Diwali and the Muslim festival of
Eid fall next week.
In May one person died and 49 were wounded by bombs at two Delhi cinemas - an
attack blamed on Sikh militants.

Sanatan Dharma
Hinduism is the predominant religious tradition of the Indian Subcontinent. Hinduism is known to its followers as Sanātana Dharma (a Sanskrit phrase meaning "the eternal law", "the eternal law that sustains/upholds/surely preserves"
Mamta Dhody
Mamta Dhody daughter of late Shri Jagdish Chandra Dhody (UIIC -estd 18-2-1973)of Jabalpur who is son of Shri Nathu Shah Dhody of Army Ordnance corps(Military Accounts) ,Khamaria ,Jabalpur,and am a Forensic Psychology research student planning to make the Indian evidence Act -Clause 45 -Opinion of Experts credible and feasible under it,as also a social ,political and religious activist working against the massive conspiracy to overthrow the Indian Government in 2015 by Britain.If I am able to finish their evil intent ,it does not mean the conspiracy did not exist. Intelligence seeks to prevent crime. Public participation and research makes social dreams credible.I also want that Hinduism should be taught through the Gita Press of India -estd-1923 to Hindu Children identified by their Janam Patris and Ayodhya should be made a place for pilgrimage for all Hindus residing in the world.As Hinduism is the majority religion of the country called India ,any threat to Hindus on a mass scale translates into a threat to the very Independence and entity of the country. INDIAN INDEPENDENCE STANDS THREATENED IN 2015 BY BRITAIN DUE TO MASSIVE NPAS IN BANKS OF INDIA ESPECIALLY STATE BANK OF INDIA BY JAINS AND BANIYAS (jAGAT SETH RECREATED (WITH JAGAT BASMATI RICE SYMBOLISM) ,MASS GENOCIDE PLANNED FOR MIDDLE AGED HINDU WOMEN By Arya Samajh Act of 1937 made by Britain AND SO CALLED IVF ANDE KA FANDA CHILDREN SENT TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY BRITAIN TO STUDY-JALLIAN WALA BAGH RECREATED ,ILLEGAL MIGRATION OF FILTHY CRIMINALS OF ISLAM FROM BANGLADESH ,PUNJABI SIKHS OF PAKISTAN ,KHALISTAN MOVEMENT ,CHEAT EVIL COMPANIES LISTED ON THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE WHOSE ENTIRE MONEY DEALING STANDS TO PROFIT ENGLAND ,CREATING MASSIVE NPAS IN BANKS WITH CORRUPT FINANCE POLITICIANS -REASON FOR PARLIAMENT ATTACK OF 13-12-2001-WHEREIN THEY HAVE BEEN PROMISED A SEAT IN PARLIAMENT UNDER THE BRITISH FLAG IN 2015.
