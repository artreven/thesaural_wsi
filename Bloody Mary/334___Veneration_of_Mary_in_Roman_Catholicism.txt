Climbing the Grande Roche
Yes…I just figured out why in mountain climbing movies they never show the trek back down. …YIKES!!!!!!!!!They don’t tell you what you have to see on the return trip. Going up was not that hard when you could concentrate on your step and gate.
I loved the Eiffel tower …going to the top the view etc and the coming down was a breeze. But then you “knew/imagined” you were safe. And all the gorges,caves, mountain ventures for tourist is put under extreame safety features in the US .One assumes and gets used to this. Climbing this mount was at your own risk. No railings…. not sturdy rocks(some slipped and slide imbedded only in soil as steppes. And one step to the side could be a fast way down. Veronique was our guide. She ,her husband Christian and their son had dinner and apararatif with us first. I suggested that we do the climb before we had a large dinner and too much wine. But the dinner came first. So …full and tipsy we began the climb.With the confidence of a wild deer Veronique sprinted up the first steps leading to the trail. I already felt the effects of a sumptuous chicken marinated in olive oil, garlic, and local herbs,newpotatoes loaded with garlic and butter,salmon,cheese,stuffing.fresh bread and of course some of the most exquisite wine……..oh my Anyways In spite of a bronchitis I have been fighting off this week and way to much internal luggage we slowly trudged on. As I entered the first steep struggle a bee gets caught in my hair. And of course I am doing the bee dance long before they help me get it out without any of us getting stung.. I take pictures as we ascend each level , careful to make sure I have additional pic for when we get to the top. All I can say is that for this Florida woman, I had forgotton what climbing is all about. With much determination we followed Veronique to the summit.She encouraged us to walk to the edge but it took about 15 minutes before I could stand to take pictures. It was awesome. Once I got my feet to move I took some pics of the surrounding seascape. Veroniques husband was way over on the beach and he called her on his cell phone. She wave her scarf to motion where we were. He said yes he could see us. I was surprised because I could not see him that far. There is a deep cave on the side of the mountain that they do not permit anyone to enter.It seems that a small bat lives there that they say it is almost extinct. But according to Veronique ,they allow people to enter once a year. I asked her exactly where was it located. Well she made my heart jump. She leaned over the edge and said over here on the side but it is dangerous to get to. I took her word for it and did not have the courage to look over the side without handrails. Maybe after I climb this spot several times I may acquire a confidence to look. I had to chuckle to see a couple in suit and dress walking along the path as if on a Sunday stroll.Yes they must be a regular. Getting past the minor terror and relaxing into the awe took a bit of time. But once we relaxed into the view it really was awesome. And the thought of how many in the past must have stood in this spot long before the rocks have begun to fall and fold. I wonder what the shape of the structure was then. On top there is a huge stone with a square hole in it. I need to ask her about that After many pictures and musing over the beauty we decided it was time to return .Veronique told us the tale of how on the full moon the dragon comes out of the mountain .And that that is a good time to come to the summit. I cannot imagine climbing it in the dark but then maybe. Well coming back down was very scary . You could see the height and the edge but it was ok if one did not panic. And seeing children running up and down with no fear encouraged us to continue and not call for helicopters. I do have to admit that we slide down the first 22 feet er so…..on our butt. Then regained our courage and walked as if we had been there before. Oh and that darn bee found my hair again and got caught in it again. I tried not to do the bee dance and calmly freed him from the tangles.. I am posting the best of the pics. I am not posting the ones that we look like tourists from florida who have never climbed a little mount. Now to continue the pathworking “All my life I took this path But all along I walked alone What can I say To be here now What did I think What did I know When I am gone Don’t follow me Unless you seek This loneliness What can I say To be here now What did I think What did I know From “Prayers of St. Brendan the Journey Home” -----------
Faint and far The strains of music Siren's song The strength of tomorrow As seen through the eyes Of future forms Never imagined in mind Or present presence This faint distant sound: Startling strains of present past Movements swift past curious eyes Meant only to cast witness To the wave of a hand
The turn of a glance The urgency of lovers In furious passion Pivoting on the point Of said potential This form can only guess Speculate and ponder The deep held breath The long sought sigh The firm embrace Of long forgotten song The song That once created soul

At the party on Saturday evening I had made plans with Veronique to climb the Gran Roche the next day. But in typical Breton weather…it poured all day and into the next. So Our climb did not happen. Perhaps this week. Cheryl has been ill with sinus and fever and has slept most of the past two days. As for myself, I have been in a neutral zone. Reading French magazines and watching American movies on the computer. Neutral zone is just that. It’s as if the computer goes on standby, processing nothing, no upload or download, but suspended in the place between an inhale and exhale. All urgency, angst, joy or pain is absent, and mild ritual of necessary functions are all that is left:
eating, bathing, grooming, sleeping. All the while one is vaguely aware of an undertone, a mild vibration as if the current flows undetected, forever present even in the bland events of the everyday. And it’s only upon reflection of the past two days that I remember and witness this. Tonight we are going to a couple’s home for dinner. They have invited us over
to sample their hospitality. They own a restaurant here and have asked me to create some paintings of the Breton landscape, buildings, sea, etc for exhibit in their restaurant. This would be my pleasure. They saw the murals I painted on the walls, cupboards, and table in Cheryl’s home and suggested that it would be nice to show an American’s view of the area. I will have to return to America to complete other jobs but in the meantime I can produce some inventory while the experience is still fresh in me mind.. And in a few months return with the paintings for exhibition. __________________________________________________-- : the weathered cool of passing rain inspires my heart to rise to float and stretch and tease a cloud to shift and clear the skies the night of sound and floral
scent descends upon the sea and in response the tide advances seeking destiny suspending breath I pause to feel the presence of the breathing land inhaling once I know the worth inhaling twice I feel the birth .... you may find it sweet surprise where portions of the soul resides ….in sleep from out of that deep secret place from out of where i see his face generous portions meant to quench this mounting thirst generous gifts but what use….what care what choice is in and of the earth i remain the child…show me…tell me in discipline i remain in silence in nature i pace the restless knowingof the soul’s potential Fae: “come sleep in silence
never turning restless in the night come sleep with me
in one embrace away from all that’s light in all your wild imaginings you never had a clue that all your dreams and fantasies are from the dream that’s you come bring your need to rest and sigh bring memories and names come sleep with me in one embrace we’ll make them all the same” …… in the night awakewithout the expectation of desire his voice is mine and mine his a means for silence stillness emptiness surrender all those things that was thought to prepare……… yet gravity prevails and sends this solid subtle form toward distant stars of even graver solid form .....matter holds me here ....a fact i know this well as well as life is certain as well as dreams and visions as well as all illusion one only needs to turn....that's all a simple gesture sought by master mage
and hu man that fiercely gentle gesture that permits the longing's greatest blessing.........nothing as much as I may coax thee from the silence knowing that if you should then descend …your sound would soon destroy the fair frail grasp one holds on the eternal now a child once touched the All in unison three times retracing all the steps but then your words fell blindly there before my eyes as if by choice the mathematics of desire under those sweet hands of God’s enfoldment you
too would have worshiped that mere essence of a truth revealed It’s only by Creation’s will that past and future are no longer in the now and that still part of me now prays (as spoken and instructed in the dream) that you would never fall to darkness if the promise was fulfilled… love keeps a promise without judgment responsibility has been assigned to redesign the impulse of destruction into an act of creation the vision is clear the formula: two sparks of creation must relinquish all given gifts(faint fare again…perfected by intent) eyes down an offering by dual placement both as knights upon the land and each will standin center facing hand to hand twins upon the mare knights upon Giea creating sacred spirals towering to the heavens to echo all the source designs…………now reassign creation’s ebb
and flow soft breeze from feathered wing pass close and find my timid heart to beat
again the rhythm changing as i look into the eyes of Ra spiral magic from the sea turn my fair flesh gray form sleek sides raise the tide carry me away my breath will raise the waning moon toward the stars I sigh the vision I have left behind reflects within these eyes the gifts have all been laid and spent the love both grand and fine what’s left for me is of the sea reclaiming what is mine taste of the earth salt of the sea only these things will remember me lv pi

Partying with friends
We started out inviting a few friends that helped with the work and ended up with many who helped with the play:). It was a great time to have them all over and thank them for being there lending a hand or encouragement in the making of a house to a home. There is no reason to think one would have to be alone if one was to visit the area. Everyone was friendly and helpful the whole time we were here.We both were extended invitations to others homes if visiting again. One couple that runs a restaurant here has asked me to create some inventory of paintings of the area to display in their restaurant. i will work on them while I am home and bring the when I return. It's been an incredable journey and I am going to miss them all
and
the house when I leave.

The time here is passing. We are already preparing to finish up the best we can, jobs not yet tended to. All the wallpapers has been removed and walls painted with light pastels. That is except one room that we painted a burgundy. The floors have been stripped and sanded and varnished. We found that most rooms had originally had fireplaces. So we opened up one for the living room. Moved gardens , mowed lawns ,planted trees, painted ceilings, painted murals of Bertagne village up the staircase, gardens at the upstairs, Bretagne people on kitchen cupboards and gardens in the toilette room. A lot accomplished in just six week. We have had a chance to learn a great deal about the area and have met new friends. They have helped us find what we need and get our bearings. The difficulties with language is never a real hindrance . The lovely woman across the street visits us daily and we sit with our French /English dictionary and converse freely. Yes much is lost in the translation, but it is amazing how much is understood with gestures, a little imagination, and a dictionary. It’s been great fun. I did not get to do some of the thing I had expected to do. But then I have seen and found things I did not expect. Living by the sea has been so healing and restful. I just walk out the door, across the highway and the mists of Avalon settle in over the cliffs and sea scape. I never really got used to the cold though. And the sun has seldom shown its face. They promise a sunny day tomorrow. If it happens I will be at the beach. Even if it is 50 degrees F. Last night I took out my map and sure enough….we are as far north as Canada. No wonder this Florida girl shivers…chuckle. Before we leave we are going to visit Mont St Michel …on the border of Normandy and Brittany. I posted a bit about that earlier. I also want to visit Gingamp.The only black Madonna in Brittany is there. It will be our last couple day trips before returning by train to Paris for our flight back to the USA. I have some work waiting for me when I return, and plans to make if I want to return to France in a few months. I had originally planned to visit some friends here in France but the circumstances did not work out this time. But that gives me more reasons for a return trip. There was an article in the local newspaper that someone was bit by a viper and died in the next town. We have been warned to be careful walking in the woods. But I have not seen any snakes….or squirrels or foxes or any animal. I have been told that there are wild boars in the wood. I am beginning to think there are no animals left. And the variety of birds is still so few. Perhaps their return is just later here. Alchemical gardens Curious gestures Mudras of the seed Upon the rock Mustering some tiny sprout Encased / cacooned Given and received Knowing that each step upon the water Leaves an imprint Fog and veil Condensation for the mass of Hungry ghosts Dismissing memory of place Upon the wheel in ages past And how the hand of giants Bless or smash Forgetting all the gods have gods Turtles on turtles on turtles Give me the “Cup of wine and Thou”!!! I leave the structure of all created realms for later dreams …..For now lets water Watch And hold The Marigolds in high esteem While setting on the edge of Giea’s dream

Comte de Razes
Vivian's house and Merlin's tomb All these stones are the only real and historical relics of the "Forêt de Brocéliande".Vivian's house is a chest made od schist of the neolithic era surrounded by a double facing of stones.Merlin's tomb is the last relic that remains of a stonecovered path. It became through the times a real place of worship ___________________________________________ a glass of wine, new century’s eye stares back at me with cold indifference letters beneath these hands waiting for the coaxing of a tale of ancient wills and course comings in such a space of time that one might not achieve significant slumber my heart in wonder found its best desire a means to hold the dream of ancient myth that haunts a spirit dream perhaps someday i’ll truly understand the makings of a heart but at this time it’s death throws falls to silence as i write these words the long trek has but ended with the pilgrimages set to fore there’s so much more than meets the single eye repentance in the ways of man finds no relief incessant prayers becomes a burden for the gods they oft complain receive your love and find the one who knows your name your promises of 2 have yet to be why can’t you find and hold the sacred see and in response within this incarnation speak i this to claim in hours of same each day the thirteen gate I pass alone and there in arms of stone with hope to crystallize such forces of destiny one cannot tell him of the fate to be it ‘s viewed as vain pursuit and mocked as longing of a child if spoken in the words concordance came and went with time so lovely spent with passion and consent a knowing for a momentthere ….i saw the spark of knowing in his eyebut with a smile and gestured wavedismissed the vision as illusiononce againand turned awayall matter was transformedthe senses all had in one truth revealed :the lifting veil but looking past persona was the key and now i muse and wonder of these things that come and go this i know that i stood here and there as uther on the edge of Camelot wanting what was not mine to have willing to trade at any cost but knowing that no Merlin present to create my longing its completion. she reprimands me for the wanting but if there never was this desire how would creation find the first step toward completion with confidence, i gaze in dreams on that sweet face that hides behind the masks the face that holds the promise of all future forms he knows me more intimately than any form of matter on this earth he knows my cause and why i came to be what made him think i would not bring all times before in all the words i formed our present past to open once again remind him of the task at hand one promise left a promise to the earth one rose to fast return the plates unto the place of source design the river, ancient flow, floats just above this earth awaiting for the touch to break the surface tension so that waters of creation can descend to fill the underground streams pi

In
Breton
folklore , a Korrigan is a female
fairy
or
dwarf -like spirit. Korr means
dwarf
and ig is a
diminutive
and the
suffix
an is an
hypocoristic . Korrigans have beautiful
hair
and red flashing
eyes . They are sometimes described as important princesses or
druidesses
who were opposed to
Christianity
when the
Apostles
came to convert
Brittany . They hate priests, churches, and especially the
Virgin Mary . They can predict the future, change shape, and move at lightning speed. Like
sirens
and
mermaids , they sing and comb their long hair, and they haunt
fountains
and
wells . They have the power of making men fall in love with them, but they then kill the ones who do. In many popular tales, they are eager to deceive the imprudent mortals who see them dancing or looking after a treasure, and fond of stealing human children, substituting them with
changelings . On the night of
31st October
( All Souls' Night ), they are said to be lurking near
dolmens , waiting for victims. ____________________________________ Been have bazaar dreams . last night was a night of the Korrigan. Found a way to softly breath smoke into crevices of trees and rock and their outline would appear and solidify.They are fierce little buggers and will take on giants if they have no respect for the earth and its creatures. They are not the cute little Tinker Bells nor are they sweet with pixie dust. In this dream a friend had squashed a little bu on the table and this little korrigan went after her with a tiny knife. Gesturing that it wanted to cut off her hand for the offense. The strange thing though was ..as I was examining all the different kinds of korrigan …some appeared as geometric shapes or spirals like in sea shells. All very interesting. I will walk / tread softly as I wander the forests. Things are often misplaced around here and I tell Cheryl that the korrigan are playing. And if all they do is hide your items she is lucky. I took yesterday off. And spent the day reading the book Wicked. Harry Potter fans wil enjoy . Just wanted to share this little bit from the story. Really worth the read. __________________________________________ “Wicked The attack on the Vinkis student provoked gossip and speculation. In sorcery the next day Glinda asked Miss Greyling to explain something. How could Doctor Nikidiks Extract of Biological Intention or whatever it was, how could it fall under the heading of life sciences when it behaved like a master spell? What really is the difference between science and sorcery? Ah, said Miss Greylin, choosing the moment to apply herself to the care of her hair. Science , my dears, is the systematic dissection of nature, to reduce it to working parts that more or less obey universal laws. Sorcery moves in the opposite direction. It doesnt rend, it repairs. It is synthesis rather than analysis. It builds anew rather than revealing the old.In the hands of someone truly skilled.it is Art. One,in fact, may call it the Superior , or the Finest Art. It bypasses the Fine Arts of painting and drama and recitation. It doesnt pose to represent the world. It becomes. A very noble calling She began to weep softly with the force of her own rhetoric. Can there be a higher desire than to change the world? Not to draw Utopian blueprints, but really to order change. To revise the misshapen, reshape the mistaken, to justify the margins of this ragged error of the universe? Through sorcery to survive? At teatime, still awed and amused, Glinda reported Miss Greylings little heartfelt speech to the two Thropp sisters. Nessarose said, Only the Unnamed God creates, Glinda. If Miss Greyling confuses sorcery with creation she is in grave danger of corrupting your morals. From Wicked by Gregory Maguire

Sunrise at The Cave of Treasures
SUN TODAY!!!!!!!!!!1Hope it stays. I am going to work for a while this morn then venture to the sands at low tide. Me thinks I heard a whisper in the early mist ... a breeze across the edge of light something passing with the night a breath a call to venture on the traveled sands a thousand times the spoken name of source design was echoed now is whispered in the faint of rising suns korrigan and sprite hold stance and watch the east amazed at all the changing of the waves they scatter at the scent of coming winds and rain and wonder what slight tremor brings the birds to flight perhaps the poles are shifting in the light or inner worlds are lifting veils or continents dividing loafs and fishes for the children of the muse nay merely waves against the tide a lifting from the see a shadow follows paths of former dragons in the night (held under foot to treasure's cave and depth... St Michel at his best) if not for all the foam and stir one never would have seen the silki on the stone or heard the puff of air between the waves to synchrnize the veil hidden shades of pale a venture toward the Grand Roche a rock a cave and while the veil falls fast away beneath the foam and sands the bearly light of sunrise lifts a woman in her round to cave and dark the path of steps ascends a place where tide and wave can blend with cries of birthing breathing one more generation of the see an imitation of androgeny the virgin birthing both the you and me -------------------------------------------------------

The green is beginning to look very lush. But I am still amazed at the lack of animals for all the wood that is here. We have left bags of garbage in the garage waiting on our trip to the Deshedderie(phonetic spelling) and they are never disturbed, except by an occasional dog. And the variety of birds is minimal. I do hear doves and owls in the evening. And loads of finch and Ravens. Some blackbirds with white markings. And a few hawks. Oh yes, of course, lots of sea gulls. Perhaps as the spring becomes more in bloom. The tulips are sprouting. Daffodils are waning. And roses are promising. Am I missing something?

The one thing they don't tell you is that Rosanbo is built in a deep recess. One goes down steep hills to approach the chateau. Not like most that sit up on high hills overlooking the countryside. Curious. Rosenbo reveals the history of one of the most spacious and splendid estates in Brittany. Although it sounds as if it might have something to do with a rose, the name Rosenbo is actually derived from Bo, a local stream,Rosanbo meaning"rock above the Bo"in the Breton language. Dating from the 15th century.The library contains over 8000 books that belonged to Claude Le Peletier. We attempted to visit this chateau but it was closed for the holiday. So we will return soon. One of the inner structures I am interested in seeing is the elaborate organ in gold that was built by Robert Dallam in 1653, in the Rosanbo chapel. Every chateau had their own chapel. ------------------------------ We had a peak of sunshine today. Just long enough to venture outside for our dinner at the picnic table and a marvelous sunset. We watch carefully for the sun to come out and try to take advantage of every morsel. I think I am sun starved. Comes with being a floridian. Working feverisly on art work so as to finish as much as possible before leaving. And in between examining all the sites in the area. I have three more places I want to see before I leave . Carnac(whick may wait for another visit), Mont St Michel and Ginggamp ,where the only Black Modanna in Brittany is held.

long waiting in the desert of the mind
hard derma full encapsulating steady sleep the fragile point of all beginnings waiting on the moisture breech a liquid reach that feeds a timed response within expands n stretches first the life-ped
stable held to place position for receiving grace expansion reaching slow minute meanderings away from all geometries of earth reach reaching toward the sun …..though futile in the reaching still one thrives within the warmth relentless until death and more than often turn to follow face and worship with the rainbow colors programmed for the
blooming of
life’s banner for the real talasa Another cloudy day. Last Sunday was such a treat ...having sun all day. Guess I have been spoiled with all the Florida sunshine. But then there is such a thing as too much of a good thing too. Being Saturday may inspires me to do something different for a change. I have been waiting on a day with sun to walk the low tide. I am beginning to think that if I wait for sun it may not happen. There is a standing stone cross emerging out of the sand a ways down the road. I am told that the Sea used to be 30 feet lower in the past. And that many old stone monuments and homes are now under sand. We picked up a book on the local legends but I am finding that most of the english books are translated by French speaking individuals, and the flow of sentances may not always make sense. When I read them I always feel as if part of the story is missing. And travel folders are even worse. Guess one should just use their imagination. I have also been working on a novel....chuckle...with me own take on the modern day Merovingians . Perhaps I will spend a bit o time on that too. After all, The powers that bee say that we all have a story to tell.:) I finished the Berton Pictures on the kitchen cupboards. And I have been trying to get pics. Every time i take them some foggy etherial foam wanders into the pic. So i am going to recgarge me batteries and try again later. Then i will post them. With all the wonder of the Korrigan and Fae I reposted a Fae Queen poem i wrote a few years back. If anyone is interested it is posted on http://blog.myspace.com/teaandpi Just a little something for Easter. Going to try to find a place to attend services. Funny...I was told they celebrate Easter on Monday. I need to clarify that and find out why. Interesting.

I was surprised how the legend and art work portraying St. Brendan is so alive here in Bertange. ________________________
The Story of Saint Brendan the Navigator
The story of St. Brendan's "Journey to the Promised Land" was one of the most famous and enduring stories of western Europe for almost a thousand years - a multi-language 'best seller'. it may be that in his voyages in the Atlantic Ocean he reached the shores of America long before Columbus. There is a renewed interest internationally in this sixth-century Irish saint whose name appeared on ocean maps through the centuries, and whose story has been written in countless versions in many languages. St Patrick is now the best known abroad of the saints of Ireland; but for perhaps seven centuries, up to the 16th century, that place was held by St. Brendan the Navigator. This was mainly because so many countries were fascinated for so long by the Navigatio, the ninth century account of his travels in the Atlantic Ocean. Part of this fascination was caused by the way the story seemed to penetrate the vast mysteries of the Atlantic and part because the charm and literary skill with which events of the voyage and the personality of the saint are depicted. In recent years the interest in the saint has revived as it becomes more likely that the Navigatio may be the earliest account of Voyaging to America. This likelihood has been increased by the success of Tim Severin in 1977 in reaching Newfoundland by way of the Faeroes, Iceland and Greenland in a boat built according to the specifications laid down in the Navigatio, an adventure described in his book, The Brendan Voyage. We know a fair amount about Brendan, thanks to the Navigatio and to several related, but occasionally conflicting, biographies. He was notable not only as a voyager, but also as a prominent leader of Irish Christianity in one of its great creative periods. He was born probably in A-D. 484 at a place now called Church Hill on a narrow ridge on the north shore of Tralee Bay, Co. Kerry, between Fenit Harbour, to the south, and Barrow Harbour. At the age of one he was, in accordance with custom, sent in fosterage to St. Ita, the mystic; this was the source of a famous and lifelong friendship between the two saints. After a life of activity, exceptional even by the standards of the sixth century, Brendan died, aged 93, in 577-8 at Annaghdown, Co. Galway. Brendan belonged to what was called the Second Order of Irish saints, also known as the Twelve Apostles of Ireland. These included another Brendan (of Birr) hence the distinguishing title of' 'Navigator' given to our Brendan. These' Apostles' gave Irish Christianity its distinctive monastic character which it was to retain for some six centuries. In the monasteries, religion, learning and the arts were fostered and developed until, Ireland having been largely Christianized, there spilled over into Britain and continental Europe that great missionary, cultural and intellectual movement that up to the 11th century was to contribute so much to the slow recovery of European civilization after the collapse of the Roman Empire. Brendan's Irish foundations were Ardfert, near his birthplace; Inisdadroum (now Coney island) in the River Shannon close to Ennis, Co. Clare; another foundation on an island, Inchiquin in Lough Corrib in Co. Galway; Annaghdown by the Corrib in Co. Galway - a foundation for nuns of which his sister Briga became abbess; and his main foundation at Clonfert by the Shannon in Co. Galway. He also had foundations in Scotland (near St. Colm Cille's iona), Wales, Brittany and, most likely, the Faeroe islands. We read in the Navigatio that in all his foundations he had nearly 3,000 monks. His influence was widespread, not only in his native county and in other parts of Ireland, but also in Scotland, England and Wales and in continental Europe - Brittany, the Low Countries, Germany and along the Baltic coast to the Gulf of Finland. He was an indefatigable traveler, as the spread of his foundations shows. There is a reliable account of his visiting Colm Cille in Scotland after 563. At that time Brendan was eighty. If we are to accept literally the account in the Navigatio, he was already in his mid-eighties when he set out on the great voyage that was to last seven years. As the young man he met in the Promised land at the end of the seven- year search said to him of that Land, 'You could not find it immediately because God wanted to show you his varied secrets in the great ocean .' THE VOYAGE There is no doubt about the impact of the tale, but was there really a voyage, and did it reach America? Let us look at the story in outline. It opens with an account of an abbot on an island monastery in Donegal Bay who often paid visits to the Promised Land of the saints by sailing some apparently short way out into the Atlantic. Brendan is fired with ambition to find this Land and, with fourteen picked monks, he goes to Brandon Creek, west of Mount Brandon in Kerry where, 'as is usual in those parts' (and still is !) they constructed a light, wooden-framed and ribbed boat. This they covered with skins. With three late-comers - who were to add drama to the voyage - they sailed west to find the Promised Land of the saints. They had no practical idea of where this island was but great confidence that God would, sooner or later, reveal it to them. Why did they not go north (instead of west) to consult with the abbot in Donegal Bay who clearly knew how to get to the Promised Land and back again? If they had, perhaps there would have been no tale! Certainly, if that Promised Land was to be America we can, with hindsight, see that even in a keel-less boat - always at the mercy of changing winds - the conditions for success were there, as Tim Severin was to demonstrate in 1977. Some nine months later Brendan and his companions had clearly, by way of the island of St. Kilda, reached the Faroe Islands ('The Island of sheep') where each year they were to spend the period from Easter to Pentecost. There they met two important characters of the story, the mysterious steward who proved so helpful, and the amiable whale, Jasconius, who was content to pose as an island each Easter Sunday so that Mass could be offered on his back. The relationship began in an unfortunate manner when, at the first meeting, the voyagers - Sinbad-like - lit a fire on his back. He bore them no grudge and, on their last visit, showed some graceful emotion in taking them for a short farewell cruise! During the following autumn they reached an island which had the monastery of the Community of Ailbe, the Irish followers of a pre- Patrician Irish missionary, who had set out to seek their Promised Land many years before. Here, according to the Navigatio, Brendan's party were to spend each Christmas for five years. We get a charming if somewhat idealized picture of life in a monastery of contemplative Irish monks. it is not clear where this island was. There are references to a warm muddy pool and crystal which might suggest Iceland and Icelandic spar: but the general ambience is one of a very temperate climate, and the later context suggests a tropical latitude, perhaps the Azores, or indeed the Canaries, both also volcanic. We meet a 'soporific island' (possibly one of the Azores) and, some distance further on, what may be the Sargasso sea. in the following year we reach an island that is described as 'extraordinarily flat so much so that it seemed to them to be level with the sea. It had no trees or anything that would move with the wind, it was very spacious and covered with white and purple fruit'. This may have been one of the Bahamas, some of which do not rise more than 10 feet above the sea. (it was at one of the Bahamas - which he named San Salvador, now Watlings island - that Columbus, sailing from the Canaries in the wake of Brendan, but nine centuries later, was to make his first American landfall). some six days sail away was a very fertile island (Jamaica?) with 'grapes as big as apples' and 'a perfume like that of a house filled with pomegranate.' Then back to the Ailbe community for Christmas. By now they had been two and a half years on the voyage. The narrative skips the adventures of the next four years, except to say that they spent Easter and Christmas in the usual places. The narrative resumes on what we can take from the description to be clearly the return voyage by way of the Bahamas-Bermuda (countless fish in crystal water), the Labrador- Greenland iceberg belt ('The Crystal Pillar') and two Icelandic volcanoes (the 'Island of Smiths' and the 'Fiery Mountain'), then by Rockall to Donegal Bay. There is a sharp break in the Southward thrust of the narrative after Rockall so as to retrace tracks to repeat the Easter visit to the Faeroes, and to pick up the 'steward' to act as pilot to the spiritual, as distinct from the material, Promised Land; but this is plainly a literary artifice. For one thing, the implication seems clear that the fog-enshrouded island (Newfoundland?) is here placed fairly close to Ireland, not where it belongs at the other side of the Atlantic. it is typical of the balanced composition of the tale that it should be made to begin and end with a visit to the Promised Land, however this may upset the orderly narration of the voyage. Close reading of the Navigatio shows it to be a masterly balance between precisely observed facts, vivid embroidery, and skilful story telling. Weaving through the topographical details are accounts of the perils and hardships of the sea, vivid writing - as of the submarine volcano off Iceland, or the Dantesque account of the weekend leave of Judas from Hell spent on a wave- drenched, but cooling rock - and accounts of unfamiliar monsters. Saint Brendans Prayer Shall I put myself wholly at your mercy, without silver, witout a horse, without fame, without honor?Shall I throw myself wholly upon You,without sword and shield, without food and drink,without a bed to lie on? Shall I say farewell to my beautiful land, placing myself under Your yoke? Shall I pour out my heart to You, confessing my manifold sins and begging forgiveness,tears streaming down my cheeks?Shall I leave the prints of my knees on the sandy beach,a record of my final prayer in my native land? Shall I then suffer every kind of wound that the sea can inflict?Shall I take my tiny boat across the wide sparkling ocean? O King of the Glorious Heaven, shall I go of my own choice upon the sea?O Christ, will You help me on the wild waves?

trembling walls n structures deep the deep emerging growl n groan from deep far deep earth trembles ocean tides recede elements together immovable forces in motion destined to struggle awesome laws of change no text contains someone spoke and woke the deep ....sentinels all i say tremble! http://www.castles.org/castles/Europe/Western_Europe/France/france2.htm When I was growing up I placed a lot of worth on dreams. It was a time of meeting with several in a group. And we traveled to several places in this world and others. Each time taking on different group persona. One time around a campfire, in desert like robes...another as native american or at least the flavor of what it seems to be....then in mountains high on cliff echoing chants before dawn...and sometimes stepping into matalic like structures and zapping off to who knows where.
Then one day while brushing me teeth a sudden silence came and I paused to look around. Sadly i knew they had left. And the dreams became just memory.* I had this dream last night. Two of the many places in Brittany I have wanted to see are Carnac and MOnt St Michel. Last night in the dream I was shown a dolmin with marks carved in the stone from top to bottom. I tried so hard to memorize the symbols but could only bring back the first 2. I knew it was directions to the entrance of an underground city beneath Mont St Michel. If I get a chance to draw them and scan them I will post them. ___________________________ The little old woman across the street that visits here regularly ,invited Cheryl ,me and Christian to apertief at 6. What a delightful woman.She knows we do not speak french very well, but she chatted non stop while we were there at her home. ..About her husband that she kicked out. ..About her children and how the first child is always born at home.We had champange and almonds. And a little strawberry liquor (made locally) to flavor the champange. On entry to her home there is a life size statue of Isis holding a lamp in the shape of a flame. She said she got it a a local store like home depot. The company was delightful and the conversation difficult but fun. We laughed a lot. She would not let us take her picture because she said she needed to see the hairdresser first. It was a nice end to the day, good compay,laughter, and being a bit tipsy.
As for my art...I am now painting pictures of Berton life on the cupboards. I will post them tomorrow.

a curious find
The best part of getting lost in the country side is finding treasures of curiosity. We have yet to find the name of this church. It was way out in the hills of this area and all boarded up. We asked someone walking who was across the dirt road how to see the inside and she told us we had to go to the town hall to get permission. Its on our list ,that is, if we can find our way back there. The curious thing was the pagan images on the tower and the cross with christ on one side and a mother and child on the other. I have since seen this in several other places so the 2 sided cross does not seem to be an oddity. The endless assortment of churches is
incredable. One could never see them all or what treasures they may hold. And the number of churches that are name "Notre Dame" must be in the thousands. Each has a history and folklore about their origins. I am trying my best to see if there is a map of churches in this area and others. I suspect it is not just RLC that can grip the imagination or have stories to tell. .....t

http://www.equinoxe-lagrandescene.com/plus_ou_moins_linfini.html This is the "Circus" we attended. It was one of the most stunning visuals I have ever seen. If you have an opportunity to go to this webpage....click translate. And if there is anyway you might be in the vacinity to see them in person...... The creativity is near perfection in me little opinion. Not just eye candy but an eye gasm. Lighting...music....weaving of magic. Yes my sunday was complete.

What a perfect Sunday. We got up late. Enjoyed the morning with a cup o coffee and decided to go to the market. At the market we found fresh fruit ,vegtables,fomage, and bacon. All the meat her is extreamly lean. So don't expect to cook your eggs in bacon drippings:). Bought a couple pastries and settled at a little cafe with cafe latte to compliment our pastry. As we basked in the warm sun in what was still 50 degree weather we heard our names called out. Veronic and her fanily were across the street with friends. They invited us over for champange and olives. In spite of our very bad french we communicated well with the new acquaintances that they introduced us to.They also had children who were all playing and giggling as we sat and chated. Veronic told us that there was a circus today and would we like to see. Now...I am thinking jugglers,clowns...etc. ok So we make plans to meet as the exposition building as it is called. So we head home,and decide to sit in the yard and have our pizza that we found at the market. That "sorta" pizza that i mentioned before. Kinda getting used to it. We sat in the sun eating our pizza and watched the fishermen walking up the strem. I am told the salmon are beginning to run . In the meantime Madam Fred the resident mouse catcher decides to join us and beg for pizza.(pic) The day is so warm and by now it is almost 3. Chertl decides she wants a nap before we attend the circus and I decide to wander in the woods. Beautiful> The mud is drying out so there is not too much concern about getting my sneakers dirty. So I don'y put on boots. Paths are beginning to be overgrown with violets and vines. Then I crossed over the highway and walked the beach . Low tide...and the beach was occupied by several scarfed and jacketed brave souls enjoying the sunshine. Opon returning i remembered I left my last piece of pizza on the table in the yard. Yes...long gone to Madam Fred. Lovely sinple day. No thoughts but to enjoy and breath.

The cross shaped hole was created for the crossbows to fit through in defense. Our friends,Veronic and Christian live here with their little boy .(an aspiring rock star) and they raise their own chickens and sheep. Veronic is the real estate person who found Cheryl her home. Since then they have been wonderful friends and have helped Cheryl adjust to her new environment.
