Worcester sauce
Worcestershire
sauce
also known as
Worcester sauce
) is a widely used
fermented
liquid
condiment . It
is currently made with
vinegar ,
molasses ,
corn syrup , water,
chilli
peppers ,
soy sauce ,
pepper ,
tamarinds ,
anchovies ,
onions ,
shallots ,
cloves
and
garlic . It is a flavouring used
in many dishes, both cooked and uncooked, and particularly with
beef . Filipino cooking uses it frequently
as a marinade, especially with pork. It is an important ingredient in
Caesar
salad
and in a
Bloody Mary . Lea
& Perrins ships it in concentrate form to be re-bottled abroad. Though
a fermented anchovy
sauce
called
garum
was a staple of Greco-Roman
cuisine and of the Mediterranean economy of the Roman Empire, "Worcester sauce"
is one of the many legacies of
British
contact with
India . While some sources
trace comparable fermented anchovy sauces in
Europe
to the
17th century ,
this one became popular in the 1830s. History Though
the widely-reported
legend
has it that "Lord Marcus
Sandys, ex-Governor of
Bengal " (a figure unknown to history
outside this tale) encountered it while in India in the 1830s, missed it on his
return, and commissioned the local apothecaries to recreate it, a privately published
history of the Lea & Perrin's firm by a former employee, records that "No
Lord Sandys was ever governor of Bengal, or as far as any records show, ever in
India." The Lord
in question, whose identity was being discreetly veiled by Messrs. Lea and Perrins
(who used to aver on the bottle's paper wrapping that the sauce came "from the
recipe of a nobleman in the country") was
Arthur Moyses William Sandys,
2nd Baron Sandys
(1792-1860) of Ombersley Court, Worcestershire, Lieutenant-General
and politician, a member of the house of Commons at the time of the legend, whose
given name is being confused in the tale with that of his heir, Arthur
Marcus
Cecil Sandys, 3rd Baron Sandys (1798-1863), who didn't succeed to the title, however,
until 1860. The barony in the Sandys family ( IPA
[sændz] )
was revived in 1802 for the 2nd baron's mother, Mary Sandys Hill, so at the date
of the legend, "Lord" Sandys was actually a Lady. No identifiable reference to
her could possibly appear on a commercial bottled sauce without a serious breach
of decorum. It is likely her heir who agreed to sell the recipe. To
abandon the unrevised legend and substitute a more accurate version that was published
by Thomas Smith,
Successful Advertising,
(7th edition, 1885):
we quote the following
history of the well-known Worcester Sauce, as given in the
World . The label
shows it is prepared "from the recipe of a nobleman in the country." The nobleman
is Lord Sandys. Many years ago, Mrs. Grey, author of
The Gambler's Wife
and
other novels, was on a visit at Ombersley Court, when Lady Sandys chanced to remark
that she wished she could get some very good curry-powder, which elicited from
Mrs. Grey that she had in her desk an excellent recipe, which her uncle, Sir Charles,
Chief Justice of India, had brought thence, and given her. Lady Sandys said that
there were some clever chemists in Worcester, who perhaps might be able to make
up the powder. Messrs. Lea and Perrins looked at the recipe, doubted if they could
procure all the ingredients, but said they would do their best, and in due time
forwarded a packet of the powder. Subsequently the happy thought struck someone
in the business that the powder might, in solution, make a good sauce. The profits
now amount to thousands of pounds a year.
(Mrs E. C. Grey's most popular novel,
The Gambler's Wife
published in 1845—and attributed to
Poe
in America—still
had enough contemporary appeal to be reprinted in 1875.) Upon
completing the necessary steps, however, the resulting product was found to be
so strong that it was considered inedible, and a barrel of the stuff was exiled
to the basement of Lea & Perrins' premises. Looking to make space in the storage
area a few years later, the chemists decided to try it once again (possibly to
see if it was as bad as they remembered), only to discover that the sauce had
fermented and mellowed and was now quite palatable. In 1838, the first bottles
of "Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce" were released to the general public.
It was a considerable success, and both the condiment and
Lea
& Perrins
are going concerns to this day. Sudan
I contamination In
February
2005
the potentially
cancer -causing
dye
Sudan I
was discovered in
Premier
Foods ' Worcester sauce by the
Food Standards Agency ,
and subsequently traced back to an adulterated
chili powder .
This prompted the largest food product recall ever seen by the
United
Kingdom , over 400 different items, as the product is itself used in the flavouring
of various other foods. The " Crosse and Blackwell 's"
brand of Worcester sauce, also affected, is the brand commonly used by manufacturers
of prepared foods. Lea
and Perrins, the manufacturer of the brand best known to the public, had no contamination
problem. However, they received over 5000 calls from worried customers, causing
the local Member of Parliament for Worcester to table a motion in support of his
city's most famous product. Dishes

of the simplest recipes to use Worcestershire sauce is a variation of
cheese
