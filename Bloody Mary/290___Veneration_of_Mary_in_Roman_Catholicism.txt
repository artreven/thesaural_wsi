The Fens - Isle of Ely -  Early (Outlawe) History  -
Wulf is on one island I on another .
That island, surrounded by fens, is secure.
The Fens
-
also known as the
Fenland(s) , are a naturally
marshy
region in eastern
England .
Most of the fens were drained several centuries ago, resulting in a flat, damp,
low-lying agricultural region.
A
fen
is the local
name for an individual area of marshland or former marshland and also designates
the type of marsh typical of the area.
Most of the Fenland lies within a few metres of sea-level. As with similar
areas in the
Netherlands ,
much of the Fenland originally consisted of fresh or saltwater wetlands which
have been artificially drained and continue to be protected from floods by
drainage banks and pumps. With the support of this drainage system, the Fenland
has become a major arable agricultural region in Britain for grains and
vegetables. The Fens are particularly fertile, containing around half of the
grade
1 agricultural land
in England.
After the end of Roman Britain, there is a break in written records. It is
thought some of the Iceni may have moved west in to the Fens to avoid the
Angles
who were migrating across the
North
Sea
from
Angeln
(modern
Schleswig )
and settling what would become
East
Anglia .
The
Fens
formed a comparative 'safe zone', surrounded by water and marshes, and were
easily defended, as well as being not particularly desirable to invading
Anglo-Saxons
with more important places to control
In the early Christian period of Anglo-Saxon England, a number of Christian
individuals sought the isolation that could be found among the wilderness that
the Fens had become. These saints, often with close royal links, include
Guthlac ,
Etheldreda ,
Pega , and Wendreda.
Hermitages on the islands became centres of communities which later became
monasteries with massive estates.

Norfolk
-
is a low-lying
county
in the
East of England .
It has borders with
Lincolnshire
to the west,
Cambridgeshire
to the west and  southwest and
Suffolk
to the south. Its northern and eastern boundaries are the
North
Sea
coast and to the north-west the county is bordered by
The
Wash . The
county town
is
Norwich ....Norfolk has
about one-thirtieth the
population
density
of
Central
London , the tenth lowest density county in the country, with 38% of the
countys population living in the three major built up areas of
Norwich
(259,100),
Great Yarmouth
(71,700) and
King's Lynn
(43,100). [ 2 ]
The Broads , a well known
network of rivers and lakes, is located towards the county's east coast,
bordering Suffolk
Norfolk was settled in pre-Roman times , with camps along the higher
land in the west where
flints
could be quarried. [ 4 ]
A
Brythonic
tribe, the
Iceni , inhabited the
county from the first century
BC ,
to the end of the first century (AD). The Iceni revolted against the
Roman
invasion
in 47 AD, and again in 60 AD led by
Boudica .
The crushing of the second rebellion opened the county to the Romans. During the
Roman
era in Norfolk
roads and ports were constructed throughout the county and
farming took place.
Situated on the east coast,
Norfolk was vulnerable to invasions from
Scandinavia
and northern Europe , and forts were built to defend against the
Angles
and
Saxons .
By the 5th
century the Angles, after whom
East
Anglia
and
England
itself
are named, had established control of the region and later became the
"north folk" and the "south folk" , hence,
"Norfolk" and " Suffolk ".
Norfolk, and several adjacent areas, became the kingdom of East Anglia, later
merging with
Mercia
and then
Wessex .
East Anglia
-
is a traditional name for
a region of eastern
England ,
named after
an ancient
Anglo-Saxon
kingdom ,
the
Kingdom
of the East Angles .
The Angles took their name from their homeland
Angeln ,
in northern
Germany .
East Anglia initially consisted of
Norfolk
and
Suffolk ,
but
upon the marriage of the East Anglian princess
Etheldreda ,
the
Isle
of Ely
also became part of the kingdom
....
The
Kingdom
of the East Angles , formed about the year 520
by the merging of
the
North and the South Folk (Angles who had settled in the former lands of the
Iceni
during the previous century)
...
On
20 November 869 the
Danes
killed
King
Edmund
and took the kingdom, which they named East Anglia
(see
Ivar
the Boneless ). The
Anglo-Saxons retook the area in 920, only to lose it
again in 10151017 , when it was conquered by
Canute
the Great
and given as a
fiefdom
to
Thorkell
the Tall , who was made
Jarl
of East Anglia
in 1017. ... Much of East Anglia (including parts of
Lincolnshire )
consisted of
marshland
and
bogs
until the 17th century , despite the construction of early sea barriers by
the
Roman
Empire .
Norfolk and East Anglia are the earliest and most likely origin of
the
Outlawe family . They're origins maybe
Brythonic
,
Angle
,
Wuffing
,
Scandinavian
,
Danish
Vikings   or
Saxon.
Other than the ~950AD family legend there are no pre-conquest records of the
family.
The earliest records of the Outlaw's - "Utlage's" are 1170-1210
AD in East Anglia (King Lynn) , North Norfolk, Kent (a Saxon stronghold) and
Bristol (Saxon and involved with the Irish invasion in 1169)
Along the way, let's look at some of the post conquest rebels and "Outlaw's"
of the area in history and show that
the "Outlaw family" ARE NOT
related to them , but maybe "connected" to them.
(i.e. Hereward "the Outlaw", Edgar Atheling "the Outlaw" and
Geoffrey
de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex
Outlaw and a bandit in the
fen -country
)
Note:
"The Utlage's" are directly connected to the
Glanville's later  in 1169 with Bromholm Priory.
Now it seems that a first name
used by native pre-conquest Danish/Saxon people in England  was "Utlag"
and the most likely scenario is that soon after the conquest and surnames came
into fashion, the children were "christened" with Christian names like
"Walter" and referred to themselves as "Walter son of (fil fitz
de) Utlag" and then "Walter the Utlag" etc...
It is interesting to speculate that "The Utlage story" and the
returning crusader `Robin (Ralph/Roger/Robert) "The Outlaw" Hood
legend' may very well be one in the same or at least very similar...
To review - who were the
Saxons
?
The Saxons
are made up of three peoples from different parts of Germany .
Saxons
are people from north west Germany or Old Saxony
as it is sometimes known.
Some of the other ancestors of the land of England:
Angles
are people from the Germany/Denmark border .
Jutes
are believed to
originate from areas of
Jutland
and
Frisian coast . -
they finally settled in
Kent
Breton's
-
are
an
ethnic
group
located in the region of
Brittany
in
France . They
trace much of their heritage to groups of
Brythonic
speakers who emigrated from southwestern
Great
Britain
in waves from the 3rd to 6th century into the
Armorican
peninsula, subsequently named
Brittany
after them. ... Brittany
and its people are included as one of the six
Celtic
nations . Ethnically, along with the
Cornish
and
Welsh , the
Bretons
are the last vestiges of the ancient
British .
Danes
-
ethnic
group
that is native to
Denmark ,
and who speak
Danish .
Picts
-
Early
Mediaeval
people living in what is now eastern and northern
Scotland
" Normans " derives from " Northmen "
or " Norsemen ",
after the Vikings from
Scandinavia
who founded Normandy.
Isle of Ely -
Cambridgeshire
Note: I am trying to put this together chronologically and geographically,
where I can...
Also refer to the timeline:
Outlawe Timeline
The
Isle of Ely
(pronounced
/ˈiːli/ )
is an historic region around the city of
Ely
now in
Cambridgeshire ,
England
but
previously a county in its own right.
Its name is said to mean
"island of
eels " ,
a reference to the creatures that were often caught in the local rivers for
food. This etymology was first recorded by the
Venerable
Bede . [ 1 ]
History -
Until the 17th Century, the area was literally an island surrounded by a
large area of
Fen
land, a type of swamp . The Fens were ultimately drained using a network of
canals designed by Dutch experts.
The area's natural defences led to it playing a role in the military history
of England. Following the
Norman
Conquest ,
the Isle became a refuge for Saxon forces
under Earl
Morcar ,
Bishop
Aethelwine of Durham
and
Hereward
the Wake
in 1071. [ 2 ]
The area was taken by
William
only after a prolonged struggle.
[ 3 ]
In 1139
civil
war
broke between the forces of
King
Stephen
and the
Empress
Matilda .
Bishop
Nigel of Ely , a supporter of Matilda, unsuccessfully tried to hold the Isle.
In 1143
Geoffrey
de Mandeville
rebelled against Stephen , and made his base in the Isle.
Geoffrey was mortally wounded at
Burwell
in 1144.
[ 4 ]
1143-1144 -
Geoffrey
de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex
-
Geoffrey maintained himself as an
Outlaw and a bandit in the
fen -country ,
using the
Isle
of Ely
and
Ramsey
Abbey
as his headquarters.
He was besieged by King Stephen and
met
his death in September 1144 in consequence of an arrow wound received in a
skirmish .
Denied burial because he died excommunicate,
his body was
wrapped in lead.
Eventually it was taken to the
Templar
community in London. He was buried in the
Temple
Church
in London . His son arranged for an effigy to be placed on the
floor, where it still can be seen today.
In 1216, during the
First
Barons' War , the Isle was unsuccessfully defended against the army of
King
John . Ely took part in the
Peasants'
Revolt
of 1381.
Administration :
From 1107 until 1837 the Isle was under the jurisdiction of the
Bishop
of Ely , who appointed a Chief Justice of Ely and exercised temporal powers
within the Liberty of Ely.
This temporal jurisdiction originated in a charter granted by King
Edgar
in 970 , and confirmed by
Edward
the Confessor
and
Henry
I
to the abbot of Ely.
The latter monarch established Ely as the seat of a bishop in 1107, creating
the Isle of Ely a
county
palatine
under the bishop. An
act
of parliament
in 1535/6 ended the palatine status of the Isle, with all
justices of the peace to be appointed by
letters
patent
issued under the great seal and warrants to be issued in the king's
name. However, the bishop retained exclusive jurisdiction in civil and criminal
matters, and was
custos
rotulorum . A chief bailiff was appointed for life by the bishop, and
performed the functions of
high
sheriff
within the liberty, who also headed the government of the city of
Ely [ 5 ] .

The Exile
Hereward the Wake
-  (c. 1035  1072),
known in his own times as Hereward the Outlaw
or
Hereward the Exile , was an 11th-century
Anglo-Danish leader
(cited by
author
Peter Rex - hence the rebel leader's ability to call upon Scandinavian aid
in 1069) involved in resistance to the
Norman
conquest of England . ...
It is thought that he had already rebelled against
Edward
the Confessor
before 1066, whom he saw as already aligning England with the
Normans, and that he was declared an outlaw as a result.
It has been
suggested that, at the time of the Norman invasion of England, he was in exile
in Europe, working as a successful mercenary for the
Count
of Flanders ,
Baldwin
V , and that he then returned to England.
The name
Hereward
is composed of
Old
English
roots
here
= army, and
weard
= guard [ 1 ] ,
and is cognate with
Old
High German
Heriwart
and
modern
German
Heerwart . The title "the Wake" (meaning
"watcher") was popularly assigned to him many years after his death.
Hereward the
Outlaw (Wake )
...
Herward the Wake was a Saxon Thegn. A thegn was a Saxon nobleman . In
service to the King they were indispensable to law and order. Until the Norman
conquest of 1066, of course.
Hereward came back from exile in around 1070 to
stand up to William.
For nearly a year he held the isles. To the victor comes
the writing of history. Little is known of this man,
Hereward. Centuries
before 'Robin Hood' he stood up to oppression.
The Wake
1070
-71
Anglo-Saxon rebel against William the Conqueror
and the hero of many Norman and
English legends.
He is associated with a region in present-day
Huntingdonshire
and Northamptonshire .
Hereward is said
to have escaped with some of his followers into the wild fenland,
and to
have continued his resistance.
The 12th century
chronicle ,
Gesta Herewardi ,
(of unknown authorship: first published by Thomas Wright
in 1839 and translated by W. Sweeting for the 1895 edition), says
Hereward was
eventually pardoned by William and lived the rest of his life in relative peace .
The other possibility is Hereward received no such pardon and
went into exile
never to be heard from again. As this was the fate of a lot of prominent English
men after the Conquest
it is a distinct possibility.
The Golden
Falcon -
Hereward the Wake
Hereward was described as short, stout but agile with long golden hair and light eyes which did not quite
match .
His first wife was Torfrida, a Fleming and reputedly a witch who took the veil when he later abandoned her for Dolfin's daughter.

Hereward
English
-  he was driven forth by his father and country ; whence
he was surnamed The Outlaw". ...
For he was a boy remarkable for his
figure, and comely in aspect, very
beautiful from his yellow hair, and with
large grey eyes, the right eye slightly different in colour to the
left
;
but he was stern of feature, and somewhat stout, from the great
sturdiness of his limbs, but very active for his moderate stature, and in all
his limbs was found a complete vigour...
his father begged King Edward that
he might be banished, making known everything he had done against his father and
parents, and against the country people. And this was done.
Whence
forthwith
he acquired the surname of the Outlaw , being driven from his father
and country in the 18th year of his age.
The
rebellion of Ely which occurred in 1072 - Hereward's revolt took place in 1071
( Differing dates as to the rebellion) - Flanders was the traditional refuge for the Saxon royalty of England .
The Flemings were Saxons who fled to the Netherlands (called
Fleanderland or the "land of those who fled" ) and its Counts were descended from King Alfred the Great.
1072 -
William
attacked Scotland and reached the Tay. King Malcolm had to submit, and in the
process agreed to dismiss Edgar Atheling from his court.
Edgar fled to
Flanders and contacted king Philip of France .

Utlamhe
The Exile
Cum quibus nec non et alii in militia probatissimi adhus computati sunt, Lefricus Diaconus et Villicus de Draitone, atque
Turkillus et Utlamhe, id est Exhulis , cocus Herewardii, Hogor cognatus Herwardi, Winter et Liueret duo praecleri et Rapenaldus dapifer de Ramesis."
Turkillus was Thorkill of Ardern, sheriff of Warwickshire , a pre-Conquest Norman. Thorkill possessed vast lands in Warwickshire in
1086 , part of which had been seized from other Englishmen.
The property was valued at more than £120 (increased by a third between 1066 and 1086), assessed at over 35 hides for the geld and consisting of nearly 220 ploughs.
The major part of Thorkill's lands passed to Roger of Beaumont, Earl of Warwick and Leicester
[
Torquil
-
The boy's name
Torquil
is of
Scottish
and
Gaelic
origin,
and the meaning of Torquil is " Thor's
helmet ".
From
Torcall ,
which is derived from an
Old
Norse
name that also
is the source form of the
Swedish
name
Torkel .
Also possibly ( Old
Norse )
"Thor's kettle" , referring to a
cauldron
used in
sacrifice .
In
Norse
mythology ,
Thor is the
god
of
thunder .

-
Alwin
(Æthelwine), nephew of
Leofric,
Earl of Mercia , was Sheriff of Warwickshire
at the time of the
Norman
Conquest . He was succeeded by
his son, Thorkell of Arden (variously spelt
Thorkill, Turchil etc.) ]
Medieval
outlaws - twelve tales in modern English translation
-
Hereward, now eminent in all military matters, returned to England
together
with his two nephews and
his loving wife Turfrida ....
And in addition to these must be numbered
others also very experienced in warfare:
Leofric the Deacon, the Bailiff of
Drayton;
Thurcytel AND Utlamhe
-- that is to say, "the Outlaw";
So here we have "The Outlaw" with Hereward
in the fens!
One Hundred years later we have a reconnection of Outlaw
and Ketel back at the Fens :

History of the County of Norfolk: Tunstede ... By Francis Blomefield, Charles Parkin
(All the people highlighted in this Charter were involved with the Crusades
or their relatives were - except for Walter Utlage , for which there is no
information available to document  )
[ So we see that "de Utlage" "the/of/from Outlaw" could be
connected with Hereward "the Outlaw"  "the Utlamhe".
Notice that the Vtlage's are directly connected to the Glanville's later
in 1169 with Bromholm Priory.
It is very interesting that these "Rebel's and Outlaw's" ,  Robin Hood
legend
and others ,  come from the same area as the first Utlage's surface in records 1170-1210 AD.
]
[ One of the goals is to show connections between England and Ireland with
the Outlawe family. It seems the men from Ely were involved with the
invasion/Norman conquest of Ireland.  So we want to find the connecitons
they might have of lands and family both in Ireland and England.
Dublin becomes a colony of Bristol early on and Ely appears to  have
connections to Kilkenny and Wexford Ireland via the Norman Conquest (and
Templars?) and the church.
Later they return to
England and begin buying into more influential properties in Herfordshire, Essex and the
like. It is interesting that many Templar knights "retire" to
Ireland and were cared for by the Hospitaller's, and that later Sir Roger Outlawe
appears as the head of of Hospitaller's in Ireland (after the 1308 dissolution
of the Templars) with his brother
William
who was a "banker" and his son later, mayor of Kilkenny . ]
Lives of the Lord Chancellors
-
The
early Irish Records are very defective. Many were burned in the
Castle of Trim and in St. Mary's Abbey; others were carried out of the country ,
and are met with in the State Paper Office, the Rolls' Chapel, Record Office,
and British Museum, in London; others are at Oxford. Several cities on the
Continent possess valuable Irish documents, while many are stored in private
houses,
All
the places in Hichin which were not in Harold's hands in 1066 were
held BY HIS 'MEN'
[ Speculation: What we see is a possible history of two families, one
Wuffing/Anglo-Danish "le
Utlagh" family , in Norfolk, few in number, powerful early after the conquest and
other "Outlawe" families, many in number, displaced by the
conquest,  These would be Saxons who
had lost everything ( see Temple Dinlsey -
Earl Harold's home ) with no home to go back to, their choice manors and
strongholds
had been taken by the Normans. Another term for Outlaw is simply a
landless noble without position. These men would probably have simply stayed
where they lost, in Ely.  ]
I have yet to find a Norman connection to the name
Utlagh. The name/word itself is Saxon / Wuffing / Danish in origin.
This writ issues upon the
judgment of outlawry being returned by the sheriff upon the exigent, and it
takes its name from the words of the mandatory part of the writ which states
the
defendant being outlawed utlagatum, which word comes from the Saxon utlagh ,
Latinized
utlagatus , and signifies bannitus, extra legem.
The other origin of
Utlagh is from the Old Norse Utlagi
:
the
Old Norse word
UTLAGI
which became the Middle English OUTLAWE
-
Utlac
- Utlach - Uthlach - Uthlac - It would seem to be connected with the
Old
Norse Utlagi, an outlaw , which appears as
Ulage
or hulague in Wace
-
Which sort of goes back to the connection to the (?Saxon?) Wuffings - Wulfings
(Goths) of Geats (Sweden)
They would call themselves the Outlaw's and find positions
in the church or work for the Normans with the invasion in Ireland or the
crusades (Templars? or Hospitaller's).  Also, for the time period oral history is very strong.
No one would want to be confused with "an
outlaw" without good reason, unless the people around them understood and
admired the significance.  A hundred years after the conquest there seems
to be many "Outlawe's" all around Norfolk and early after the
conquest. This may simply be due to the
records left to us, but it seems to be an indication that the origin of a whole
clan of people were based there.
There is an interesting description of the famous
Howard family:
Howard Family
Genealogy
:
The Howard family
can definitely trace their ancestry back to
Sir William
Howard
living under the first of two Edwards from 1297 to 1308. It was in
the stirring days of Edward I that the first Howard made his home at
East
Wynch (Near King's Lynn ). This was
Master William Howard , afterwards
to become
Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and a knight . Of his parentage we
know nothing, although the probabilities are that
he belonged either to a
burgess family of Lynn, or else to some substantial yeoman stock of the
neighborhood.
He may have been either of Danish or of English descent. Northwest
Norfolk was as much a district of the Danes as it was of the Angles ; "and
both races sought refuge in its marshy fastnesses after the Norman conquest,
gradually emerging from their hiding places as the laws of the invader grew less
rigorous .
...
" For his support of Richard III's claim to the throne,
John
Howard , the son of Thomas Mowbray's elder daughter Margaret, was created 1st
Duke of Norfolk in 1483 , in the title's third creation. From this point to
the present, the title has remained in the hands of
the descendants of John
Howard ."
This bringss us back to where the Outlaw's and the
Howard's paths cross
(Oh and the Mowbray's were big in Ireland too!) :

and
Essex .
The other,

England

and some other towns ... Durham; parts of the north east of England were covered

and read more about
Domesday book
Twenty years after the conquest we have no
records of any Utlage's in Domesday.  All the Utlage men of note may have died
at
Battle of Hastings
or
Battle of Stamford Bridge
, more likely since surnames were not in use, they were just  "men
of" Harold Godwin or Edward Atheling or ?.
So we have a legend of  ? Utlage's ?
people "banished for political offences" in 950 AD by King Edwy and
returned with King Edgar, but we really don't know if they were
"his" men or someone else's. Just that they as a clan, from now on,
would be known as "THE Outlaws" .
We just have no reliable or
sufficient targets to investigate further. The one thread is the Utlag
connection to the Ulf or Wolves , which seems to point towards an early wolf
cult - "East Anglia"- Geatish Wuffing - "Beowolf" Swedish origins.
Also, why would a family in 1613 tell a Saxon
legend if they were originally Norman's? How or why would they "make
up" such a story?

or their relatives were - except for Walter Utlage , for which there is no
information available to document  )

Norfolk and BUYING where? Ireland now?
[ So between 950AD - 1086 AD and 1169-1207 AD something happens to change the
fortunes of these Utlage men.  That seems to be the Norman invasion of
Ireland in 1167-1175 and it seems to follow that's where  William Outlawe
and Roger Outlawe come from and explains the many connections to the powerful
Norman families of the Irish invasion, like the De Burgh's and De Clare's and
the Howard's. Gilbert de Clare Earl Gloucester and Hertford (and Hereford)
giving the later 15th century Simon Outlawe a connection to Bristol (Gloucester)
and Baas Manor Broxborne. That is to say, after the suppression on the Templar's
in 1308, and by the 1330's there seems to have been a migration back to England
to Norfolk, Bristol, London and Essex of these "elite" Outlawe's.
This opens up the slight possibility that this elite group (from the Bromholm
Priory) were late comers of the Norman Conquest "Outlaw" Normans or
Breton's without land or title. ]

left from

in England , consisting of
Flemish ,
Frisian ,
Norman ,
English ,

Scottish
crusaders, and some from

Fall of Lisbon
-
The siege began on
July 1 . The Christians soon captured the
surrounding territories and besieged the walls of Lisbon itself. After four
months, the
Moorish
rulers agreed to
surrender (October 21 ), because the Crusaders' siege
tower reached their wall (thus causing a one day standstill) and because of
hunger within the city, which was sheltering populations displaced from
Santarém
as well as "the leading citizens of
Sintra ,
Almada , and
Palmela ." [ 11 ]

Some of the crusaders set sail and continued to the Holy Land. [ 6 ]

Robert de Utlagh is associated with.
This is

charter are the de Burgs and other notables. This creates a link between before
the Norman invasion of Ireland and post ) - BENEFACTORS TO BROMHOLM PRIORY. King Henry I., after
1113 ; Stephen, Earl of Morton afterwards King;
Bartholomew de Glanville, Baron de Bromholm, son of the founder, 1169
( so his father the founder in 1113 - William, Earl Glanville)
Note : It seems every benefactor in the
charter of this priory is associated with, or relatives of, those that went on
the English Crusades.
1169 - By this deed Bartholomew grants the Monks of Acra [Castle Acre], at
Baketon [Bacton],
where his father William de Glanville lies buried , the land of Stanard the
priest, and the Church of Casewic, and all the appurtenances in Bromholm, the
Church of Delham with its appurtenances, the whole of his Lordship of Baketon,
and two parts of the tithe of Stringes of Horham and Alreton, of Langho and Brug,
belonging to his Lordships; also of Sneseling, with all the tithe of his mills
in Baketon and Wileford; two parts of the tithe of the mill of Honing, and one
mill at Munisle in demesne, with the land of Herfrid the priest, and part of his
wood in the mill-way to Takesgate,
two parts of the tithe of the men or
tenants of Roger de Beketon[Bacton ?], Geffrey the priest of Honing, Walter Utlage ,
etc.,
all the tithe of Richard, son of Ketel , and the whole tithe of the
paunage of Baketon and Horham and of the turbage of Swathefield two parts, and
at his death he bequeaths to this Priory, Geishorm, and all that he possessed in
the fields there, with his villians, to be free and quit from all customs,
except the King's Dane-gelt.
Sir Robert de Glanville
was succeeded in these Lordships by
William de Glanville, who in the reigns of William Rufus and Henry I. held a high position among the Norfolk and Suffolk Barons.
His possessions in lands were extensive, as
he not only founded a Priory but left his eldest son to inherit considerable
property .
In the year 1113 A.D. he founded Bromholm Priory, in the county of Norfolk , and made it
subordinate to the Cluniac Monastery of Castle-Acre , and dedicated it to
St. Andrew . He endowed it with lands here, and in his Lordships of Bacton and Ceswick. At the same place, says Weever, was also a priory of Black Monks (Cluniacs), dedicated , to St. Sepulchre, founded by
G. de Glanville , and value, at [pound sterling]149 19s. 0 1/2d. per annum
In 1171, when King Henry II. went over to Ireland ,
Bartholomew de
Glanville , Wimar the chaplain, and William Bardul
render their account
for 320 hogs sent to the army in Ireland
£26 16s. 5d., 15 days' pay to
36 masters and 468 equippers £33 13s. 0d., making bridges, hurdles, and other
ship's apparel £6 5s. 5d., 6 handmills and their appendages 14s. 4d. This
account was paid to them by the King's Writ. (Pipe, 17 H. II., Bot. 1.)
Baldwin, so long as he carried this crosse with him to battle, had ever
the upper hand of his enemies, but forgetting it he was forthwith slain ,
upon which his chaplaine
Hugh stole secretly away with the said box and
crosse - came to this Monastery of Bromholm, and bestowed them both here upon
the monks , for which so inestimable a gift he, with his two sons (which he
had by his wife before he entered into Holy Orders) were kept of the monks with
all things necessary untilI the death of Hugh the father, and the preferment of
both his sonnes
Little appears to have been known of this place previous to the Norman
Conquest . It seems, however, to have been in a state of cultivation during
the period of the Saxons, and came early into the possession of Edric, a noted
Dane, who, in the reign of Edward the Confessor, invaded and seized on this and
other lands in the neighbourhood. At the Conquest, Edric was deprived of them by
William I. This Edric was a Thane of the first rank; after the custom of the
Normans, he assumed the name of Edrio de Laxfield, from a town of that name in
Suffolk.
In the time of Edward the Confessor, William, Earl Warren, held
sixteen acres in Bacton, valued at 2s.
William the Conquero r, on his accession to the English Throne,
granted, amongst other divers lands, the Village and Manor of Bacton to Robert
Mallet, Lord of the Honor of Eye in Suffolk, who held it as a tenant of the
Crown ( We see the name Robert Malle come up again with Sir Adam Outlawe Priest
)
Bromholm Priory
- was a
Cluniac
priory ,
situated in a coastal location near the village of
Bacton ,
Norfolk ,
England
. Bromholm Priory, also known as
Bacton Abbey [ 1 ] ,
was
founded in
1113
by
William
de Glanville , Lord of Bacton,
and was originally subordinate to
Castle
Acre Priory . The priory was
suppressed
in
1536 . All that
now remains are the ruins of the gatehouse, Chapter House, and the northern
transept of the Priory Church. [1]
It was an important object of pilgrimage as
it claimed to possess a piece of
the True Cross, mentioned as the 'holy cross of Bromeholme'
[ 2 ]
in Chaucer's
The
Reeve's Tale
and
William
Langland 's
Vision of
Piers
Plowman . It was a benefice of
the Paston family
and is featured
in their
letters .

Fourth
Crusade
-
Crusaders sack Constantinople   (so we soon see
the appearance of the Holy Rood at Bronholm)
The
True Cross was said to be a part of the Cross of which Jesus Christ was
crucified , ...
the True Cross came from the Court of Baldwin 1 in Constantinople
to a small village priory in Norfolk.
Bromholm
Priory  a venerated simple Rood from Constantinople in 1204  the Bromholm
cross had two transverse pieces  (Rood removed in 1537)
Bromholm
Priory
On the village boundary, through the ruined gatehouse on Abbey
Street, stand the remains of
Bromholm Priory, once one of the most holy
places in Europe . The priory was destitute until its
Cluniac monks
purchased what they believed to be a piece of the original crucifix from a
priest who had, wandered Europe trying to find a buyer for this valuable piece
of merchandise.
Once in their hands, the monks promptly used It to cure all kinds of diseases
- even to raise people from the dead! Its fame attracted pilgrims from all over
Europe, including Henry III, and its name was immortalised in Chaucer's
'Canterbury Tales."

-
The Holy Rood of Bromholm apparently arrive in England  before 1223 (
1204 - see above)
from Constantinople by an English chaplain of the
Latin emperor  Baldwin I.  ...
it is clearly a double-armed cross ,
an image of the True Cross as the crusaders  had celebrated it in the Twelfth
century prior to the battle at Hattin. 1226 Henry III made his first pilgrimage
to Bromholm.

It is interesting that the Domesday of 1086 it mentions many times "Ketel the Dane"
(and various other ketel's Ulfketel )  example:
KETERINGHAM
-
The chief manor of this town, belonged to
Olf the
Dane
in the
Confessor's time... The other manor belonged to
Ketel the
Dane , at
the Confessor's survey, a nd was held of
Ralf Peverell
by
Warine ,
at the Conqueror's had a
faldcourse ,
or
Carleton
-
Under the parish of
"Carleton,"
it is there stated
the
manor belonged in 1011 to one Ketel,* a Dane, subsequently to Edward the
Confessor, who gave it to Harold, and that then it was seized by William the
Conqueror - Query,
Turkel
or Turketel, who in
1011 took possession of all Norfolk, and held it till Swejne's death in 1014.
or
Beeston
Priory Manor
- William
de Scohies
or
Escois
(who also held Wichingham),
had a lordship which Ingulf held under him at
the survey, of which Turkel, lord in the Confessor's time, had been deprived ...
So it is likely that "Richard son of Ketel" is Danish and
possibly of the original Ketel's of Norfolk....
By association Walter de Utlage is possibly an Norfolk Danish/Saxon?
native.

The Glanvill - Ketel - Kendal connection:
Kendal
-  is a
market
town
and
civil
parish
within the
South
Lakeland District
of
Cumbria ,
England . It
is 40 miles (64 km) south of
Carlisle ,
on the
River
Kent , and has a total resident population of 27,505, [ 1 ]
making it the third largest settlement in Cumbria (behind Carlisle and
Barrow ).
...
Historically
a part of
Westmorland ,
The
Barony of Kendal
- The
Kendal region of Westmorland
was only
conquered in 1092, by William Rufus, and at the time of the Domesday survey was
in crown hands.
The first Norman baron was Ivo de Tailbois. Upon his death
the barony went to Eldred and his successors,
Ketel
and Gilbert. William,
the fifth Baron took the surname of de Lancaster, probably from his chief
residence at Lancaster castle.
Eldred married Adgitha [Aldgytha]. Alternately he married Beatrice [Beatrix],
the daughter and heir of Ivo de Taillebois. This was her second marriage. She
had earlier been married to Ribald. Eldred had a son,
(2)

(c1050)
Ketel died after 1120

Rogeri de
Bertuna may be Roger de Burton and this maybe related the the land of KENDAL and
the Glanvill connection :
Burton in Kendale
-
There appears to be no record as to the means whereby the manor of Burton came into the possession of Roger de
Burton , younger son of
Roger de Aston of Ashton under Lyne, co.
Lancaster . Some indication may be derived from
the arms of Burton , which differ entirely from those of Assheton; they were Argent, a chief indented azure.
These arms were borne by the family of Glanville, and the same charge on a field Or was the arms of the Butlers of Ireland and the lords of Middleham.
The adoption of these
arms of affection by the Burtons
points to
some feudal connexion with the house of Glanvill . This connexion
may be traced to the Northern Rebellion of 1174
when Hugh de Morevill lost Westmorland and Roger de Mowbray probably lost his feudal lordship over Kendale and some part of Lonsdale.
In 1177 Ranulf de Glanvill accounted at the Exchequer for three years' farm and issues of
Westmorland , that is of the barony of Appleby  ...
Ranulf de Glanvill died in the autumn of 1190 in Palestin e, but on the accession of Richard
I the lands of Westmorland and those in Kendal had been taken into the king's hands. At Easter, 1190, the lands in Kendal were delivered to Gilbert Fitz-Reinfrid, in accordance with the grant made to him, to which frequent reference will be
made .
The parish of
Burton in Kendal
- The
parish of Burton lies entirely within Westmorland
with the exception of Dalton, which belongs historically to
Lancashire.

Geoffrey, priest of Honinges :
and Turstan -
Honinges -
Honing, Norfolk
Honing has an entry in the
Domesday
Book
of 1085 where its, its population, land ownership and productive
resources were extensively detailed [ 4 ]
In the survey
Honing is recorded by the name of
Haninga . The main
tenants being the
Robert
Malet
from the
abbot
of Holme
who had held the land before and after 1066,
Robert de
Glanville from Robert Malet, and Ranulf brother of Ilger.
St Benet's Abbey
- It is also known as
St Benet's at Holme
or Hulme. situated on the
River
Bure
within
The
Broads
in
Norfolk
England
- St
Benet's, according to
abbey
tradition, was founded on the site of a ninth-century
monastery
where the
hermit
Suneman was martyred by the Danes. About the end of the tenth century it was
rebuilt by one Wulfric. A generation later, c. 1022, its estates of Horning,
Ludham and Neatishead were confirmed by King
Canute .
Other early benefactors included
Edith
Swannesha , concubine to
Harold
Godwinson , and
Earl
Ralf
II of
East Anglia .
At the time of the
Norman
Conquest
Harold Godwinson put the
abbot
of St Benet's, Aelfwold, in charge of defending the coast against invasion.
After the Conquest,
Aelfwold fled to Denmark , and the
abbey 's
estates suffered encroachments by neighbouring landowners. The site was enclosed
by a wall with
battlements
in 1327. ... St Benet's is the only religious house not closed down by
Henry
VIII
during the
Dissolution
of the Monasteries .
Earl of East Anglia
-
The earldom of East Anglia was then assigned to
Gyrth ,
one of Harold's younger brothers , who held it until his death at the
Battle
of Hastings
in 1066. Following the
Norman
Conquest of England ,
William
the Conqueror
appointed
Ralph
the Staller ,
an aristocrat of
Breton
ancestry born in Norfolk , to the earldom.
On his death in 1069 he was
replaced by his son
Ralph
Guader , who was one of the leaders of a rebellion against William, known as
the
Revolt
of the Earls , in 1075.
With the failure of this uprising
Ralph fled to
his lands in
Britanny
and no successor was appointed.
Notice here how we have a Outlaw - Thurkill - Ketel  and St. Bennet

Here in this document it is made known how I,
Thurketel,
grant my possessions after my day. First, I grant that land at Caister and at
Thorpe
with meadow and with marsh, with ingress and with egress, to God and
St
Benedict
and
St Edmund at Bury
and at
Holme , for the
redemption of my soul. And my wife's portion is to be for ever uncontested, for
her to hold or to give where she pleases. And to my lord his due heriot.
And my daughter Ælgwyn is to have the estate at Ormesby witht the proviso that
she may not forfeit it; and after her time
the estate is to goto Holme for my
soul and for hers , except that land which Omund had; that
my nephew Ketel
is to have. And my nephew's children, the sons of Swegn and of Ealhmund, are to
have the estate at Scratby.
And the Abbot of Holme
is to have a pound and the
Abbot of Bury
another. And my men are to be free, those who will work for it (?). And
whosoever wishes to despoil this will, may God deprive him of the kingdom of
heaven, unless he repent it here.

Records of the Anglo-Norman house
of Glanville
from A.D. 1050 to 1880 ... By William Urmston Searle Glanville Richards
At
Orford, twenty miles from Ipswich ,
there was a royal castle in the time of Henry
III ., who granted a charter to the town, which was previously a borough by prescription; it is now a mere village. Only the keep of the castle remains; it is a polygon of eighteen sides, with walls ninety feet high, and has square towers in its circuit, which overtop the rest of the building; the architecture is Norman, and it was erected by
Glanville ; [fn 14]
and
in the year 1167, when he was residing there, the fishermen took in their nets a wild man, having the human shape complete, with hair on his head and a long and sharp beard and a large amount of shaggy hair on his breasts. The fishermen were not able to keep him long, as he stole away to sea privately, and was never seen
afterwards . [fn 15]

(There is no direct Outlaw connection. The Preceptory was originally the
home of the Benedictine Monks of Ely then taken over by the Knights Templar in
1169.  (Speculation: Saxon "Outlawe" knight joins the Knights
Templar  or a monk like "John de Bernewelle - Outlawe" joins the Hospitaller's
) Very much in the
neighborhood...)
There has been a religious house of sorts on this spot since eight
hundred years ago, and most of the remains are of the Norman period, when a
settlement of 232 THE CAMBRIDGE ROAD
Black Monks from Ely settled here. In
succession to them came the Knights Templars, who made it a Preceptory, and when
their Order was suppressed and ceased out of the land, in consequence of its
corruption and viciousness, the nuns of St. Clare were given a home in these
deserted halls . Close upon four hundred years have gone since they, too, were
thrust forth, and it has for centuries past been a farmhouse.
Denny Abbey
is
a former
abbey
near
Waterbeach ,
six miles (10 km) north of
Cambridge
in
Cambridgeshire ,
England . The
site,
on an ancient road between Cambridge and
Ely ,
was settled by farmers as early as the
Roman
period. The
Domesday
Book
said that it was owned by
Eddeva
in 1066, and subsequently by
Alan,
1st Earl of Richmond . [ 1 ]
A group of Benedictine monks, governed from
Ely ,
moved here from their waterlogged monastery at Elmeney (a vanished settlement
about a mile to the northeast) in the 1150s, at the suggestion of Duke
Conan
IV
of Britanny. They built a church, Denny Priory, which opened in 1159. The
crossing
and
transepts
are the only parts of the original Priory that remain today.
In 1169 the monks
returned to Ely and the site was handed to the
Knights
Templar . The Templars built a number of additions, including a large
Norman-style
arched doorway and a
Refectory .
By the 1290s the Knights had lost their power, and in 1308
King
Edward II
had the entire order arrested and imprisoned, confiscating their
property.
Denny was given to the
Knights
Hospitallers , who took no active interest in the property.
In 1324 it was
taken over by the Crown. [ Same year as the war in Aquitaine ]

History of Eastbridge Hospital
St. Thomas Becket was murdered on December 29, 1170 in Canterbury Cathedral . Almost immediately,
pilgrims came to visit his tomb
and the city had to provide accommodation for them.
In 1190, Edward FitzOdbold founded a hospital on the bridge in the High Street and Becket's nephew Ralph was probably the first Master.
The hospital initially prospered but declined after 150 years .
It was refounded in 1342 by Archbishop Stratford , and was probably at its peak in the 1380s when Chaucer was writing his Canterbury Tales. In Chaucer's words pilgrims 'from every shire end of England to Canterbury they wend, the holy blissful martyr for to seek'.

The hospital of St. Mary Magdalen was founded on the causeway leading to Gaywood, in the year 1145, by one Peter the chaplain.
It consisted of a prior and twelve brethren and sisters; of these ten, the prior or chaplain being one, were to be sound, and the other three infirm or leprous.
From the foundation deed it appears that this was a reconstruction of a yet older hospital,
for the opening clause provides that the brethren were to dress after a decent fashion, like their predecessors (' secundum morem fratrum antecessorum domus ').

1207
The earliest records of Outlaw (Utlage/Utlagh) after the conquest where we
see Robert de Utlagh trading with the influential Hubert de Burgh and shows the
Ireland connection after the conquest since de Burgh's brother was the Governor of
Limerick, Ireland We also see the early connection to the "White Canon's" with
Robert Fitz Ralph. Then there is William de Noirs, a Norman who basically owned
Norfolk after the conquest.
So who was Robert de/le Utlagh/Utlage ?  Clearly he was a man
with land and position. He may have been a non-Norman that retained some situation
after the conquest. Most importantly, I have yet to find a Norman
connection to the name Utlagh. This also may relate to Saxons that assisted the Norman's with
the invasion and conquest of Ireland (1167 - 1175) See Bromholm Abbey and
Glanvill's above.  This also fits later
with Roger Outlawe as the head of Ireland 1311-1340.
I haven't found anything on Roger de Burnham but there is
Burnham
Market   on the coast near King's Lynn, so he may have been another
Saxon vassel that retained some authority after the conquest.
Speculation: The white canons may have been intended to replace Saxon
priests with Normans. They are associated with Hubert Walter, the crusades and
the order is of Norman origin (France). Normans would not wish to give
confession to Saxon priests, for example.

The Honor of Wormegay :
Wormegay
- is a
civil
parish
in the
English
county
of
Norfolk .
The village is situated some
9 kilometres (5.6 mi) south of
King's
Lynn
and 60 km (37 mi) west of
Norwich .
For the purposes of local government, it falls within the
district
of
King's
Lynn and West Norfolk .
The place-name ' Wormegay'
is first attested in the
Domesday
Book
of 1086, and means ' the island of Wyrm's people '. [ 3 ]
Just to the west of the village centre lies
Wormegay
Castle , a
motte
and bailey
earthwork .
Wormegay
Castle
was originally a late
Saxon manorial complex , which was
fortified in the 11th century, by
Hermer de Ferrers . In the 12th century,
Reginald de Warenne
modified the fortification and founded the earthwork
motte and bailey castle. ... Wormegay Castle is located in the village
centre, off Front Street.
7 miles south of King's Lynn ,
Wormegay Castle
is a
motte

- The
castle was probably built by
Hermer
de Ferrers
after the
Norman
Conquest , and remained in the de Ferrers family until 1166 . [ 1 ]
Wormegay Castle is located in the village centre, off Front Street.
7 miles south of King's Lynn , on the A10-A134.
The motte is 5 metres high and 77 metres by 62 metres wide at the base. [ 2 ]
The motte is surrounded on three sides by a ditch up to 15 metres wide and 2
metres deep. [ 2 ]
The bailey is 150 metres by 88 metres across, and raised about 1 metre from the
ground. [ 2 ]
The castle would have been highly visible in early medieval times, more so than
in the 21st century, and would have
formed a local landmark as well as
controlling the local causeway across the Fens . [ 3 ]
Wormegay formed the centre, or the

Sir Gilbert de Ilketeshale was lord of this manor, with that of Hedenham in Norfolk, and of Ilketeshale in Suffolk, from whence they assumed their name; and Sir Thomas was his son and heir, as appears from the register of Holm abbey, and a fine levied in the 7th of Henry III. Gilbert was son and heir of Sir Thomas, and had a charter for freewarren in Kelling, Salthouse and Hedingham, and Ilketeshale, in the 32d of that
King.
Hubert
de Burgh   -
Hubert de Burgh (before 1180  before 5 May
1243) was
Earl
of Kent ,
Justiciar
of England and
Ireland,
and
one of the most influential men in
England
during the reigns of
John
and
Henry
III . ...
De
Burgh
came from a minor gentry family about which little is known . He
was a brother of
William
de Burgh , Governor of
Limerick .
... 1202 de Burgh was appointed Constable of
Dover
Castle ,...
Chinon was besieged for a year, and finally fell in
June, 1205, Hubert being badly wounded while trying to evade capture. During the
year he was trapped in Chinon, and the two following years when he was a
prisoner of the French, de Burgh lost most of his estates and posts. The reasons
are much debated.
After his return to England in 1207, he acquired new and
different lands and offices.
These included the castles of
Lafford
and
Sleaford ,
and the shrievalty of
Lincolnshire .
Probably, however, de Burgh spent most of his time in the English holdings in
France, where he was seneschal of
Poitou .
Not the William de Noirs of 1207 but an earlier William de Noiers at the
time of the conquest 1066, the assumption is that they are related :
William de
Noiers
- he was
the Steward of King William . This position was
the sixth highest-ranking position in the English kingdom, after the King
himself.
William de Noers received 33 manors from William the Conqueror ,
King of England, probably as a result of his service during the Battle of
Hastings.. William de Noers also held a manor in Suffolk County (where his name
was spelled Willielmus de Noers) and in Cambridge County (spelled Willielmus de
Nouueres). ... As
much of
William de Noers holdings were in Norfolk , it
is possible, although almost
impossible to prove, that the Nurses found
in the Kings Lynn area are descendants of William de Noers.
Robert Fitz Ralph -

Abbey
-
This
Abbey was built by Radulphus, son of
Robert Fitz
Ralph , for
white Canons of the Praemonstrantensian order , about the
year
1213 , who endowed it with several lands and tenements. He died in
1251, and was buried here.

Wensleydale ,
in the county of
North
Yorkshire , was built by
Robert
Fitzrandolph , 3rd
Lord
of
Middleham
and
Spennithorne ,
commencing in 1190.
The Premonstratensian order was founded in 1121 by St.Norbert at Prémontré
near Laon in Northern France.
Premonstratensians followed a strict
version of the rule of St.Augustine
and were
closely related to the
Cistercians
in their lifestyle and
choice of isolated sites for their
monasteries .
Their first English abbey was founded at Newsham in Lincolnshire (near Grimsby),
in 1143.
The canons (as  Premonstratensian monks were known)
wore a white
habit and cap and were often called 'the white canons'.
Unlike ordinary
monks,
they did not always stay within the cloisters of the abbey, but served as
village priests and missionaries in the local community.
West Runton
- West Runton
is a village in
North
Norfolk , [ 1 ]
England ,
approximately ¼ of a mile from the
North
Sea
coast. Evidence of early antiquity [ 1 ]
in West Runton is scant. However, evidence of
Roman
habitation were found just south of the village up on
Beeston
Regis
Heath in 1859, when a complete set of
quern-stones
were found dating from Roman times. Quern-stones were used to grind materials,
the most important of which was usually
grain
to make
flour
for
bread -making. Up
on
Beeston
Regis
Heath there can be found circular pits called "Hills and
Holes" (from the 1st edition of the
Ordnance
Survey
map of the area), which are thought to date from prehistoric times.
During
the
Saxon - Norman
to
Medieval
periods these pits were dug to obtain
iron
ore , which was then smelted in a
furnace
to produce
iron .
In the
Domesday
book , the settlement of Runton is given the name of
Rugutune
and
Runetune .
Beeston Regis
-
Beeston Regis
is a village and

Norfolk and near the coast. Evidence of early antiquity in Beeston Regis are
few. However, evidence of
Roman
habitation was found on Beeston Regis Heath in 1859 when a complete set of

Up on Beeston Regis Heath there can be found
circular pits called 'Hills
and Holes'
(from the first edition of the
Ordnance
Survey
map of the area). They are thought to date from prehistoric times.
During
the
Saxon - Norman
to
Medieval
periods these pits were dug to obtain
iron
ore , which was then
smelted
in a furnace to produce iron [ 5 ] .

Domesday Book
-
Beeston Regis is mentioned in the
Domesday
Book
of 1086 , and within this survey it is called Besetune and Besetuna/tune. [ 6 ] .
The main landholders of the parish were
William
dEcouis
and Hugh de Montfort. The main tenant was Ingulf, The survey also
lists ½ a mill. In the Domesday survey fractions [ 7 ]
were used to indicate that the entry, in this case a mill, was on an estate that
lay within more than one parish.
Beeston Regis has the remains of an
Augustinian
priory
known as
Beeston Regis Priory [ 8 ]
(St. Mary's).
Founded in 1216 , in 1535 it had only a
prior
and four
canons ,
who served as parish priests for nearby churches, six boys and seven servants.
The boys were in effect the boarders at the canons' school, and their number was
increased by day boys.
Hindringham
- Hindringham
is a village and a civil parish in the

hills".Hindringham is mentioned in the
Domesday

Dover Castle
-
Dover Castle is a medieval castle in
Dover ,
Kent , England. It
was founded in the 12th century and has been described as the "Key to
England" due to its defensive significance throughout history. [
In 1216, the French laid siege to the Castle with a large army and great
siege engines that could hurl rocks against the walls.
Hubert
de Burgh
only had 150 men to defend the castle with. Part of the
outer
curtain wall
of the castle was undermined by the French and collapsed. But
Hubert and his heroic defenders were able to plug the breach and fight off the
attackers. With the death of King John, and the accession of his infant son
Henry III, the French withdrew. In 1221 he married, as his third wife, Margaret,
sister of King Alexander II of Scotland, and four years later was created Earl
of Kent
Beeston Regis
-
Hugh de Montfort, a Norman , (assistant justiciary of England, with Odo Bishop of
Baieux, the Conqueror's brother, and William Fitz-Osborn Earl of Hereford,)
was lord of a
manor , out of which
Bund, a freeman, was ejected ; there belonged to it one carucate of land, with 8 borderers, one carucate in demean, half a one amongst the tenants, pannage for 5 swine, one acre of meadow, one
runcus, 2 cows, &c. 20 goats; and 3 socmen held 12 acres of land, and the moiety of a borderer, with half a
carucate, then valued at 20s. at the survey at 30s. (fn. 1)
In the 9th of King John,
Robert de Utlaghe granted by fine, to Hubert de Burgh, the 3d part of a knight's fee, in this town and
Runton, and the 3d part of 2 carucates of land in Hindringham ; and in the 11th of that King, Hubert purchased of Robert
Fitz-Hugh, the 3d part of a fee in Beeston, and Runton, and the land in
Hindringham, that is his right in them; this Hubert was after created Earl of Norfolk, and held them in capite of the castle of
Dover.

It
is interesting that
Lewin is a another name for Leofwine
and  that later the Outlaw's
donates "Lewin's Mead " in Bristol to Margam Abbey.
It was from Bristol in 1051 that Leofwine and Harold Godwinson left for Dublin
Ireland during their Banishment. What is also significant is that often lands were "donated" when men
went on crusade in return to taking care of their affairs at home.
Lewin's Mead is named after the original holder Lewinus Lari
and
the Land was initially
given to Robert fitz Swein  from Earl of
Gloucester who died 1183 ,

Margam Abbey
-
was a
Cistercian
monastery ,
located in the
village
of
Margam , a
suburb
of modern
Port
Talbot
in
Wales .
The
abbey
was
founded in 1147 as a daughter house of
Clairvaux
by
Robert,
Earl of Gloucester
and was dedicated to
the
Blessed Virgin Mary
A
history of Margam Abbey - Possessions of the Abbey in the towns of Bristol and
Cardiff
IN addition to the early gifts of
house property in Bristol
which
were, as we have already observed, granted by several owners, and confirmed by
Pope and King, to the Abbey, it will be convenient in this place to group
together
a small collection of charters which relate to that town , and
must be
dated in the early years of the thirteenth century .
A confirmation (T. 290 .16; C. DCCLXXI ) by
W , prior of St. James,
Bristol , by assent of Alan, Abbot of Tewkesbury (
A.D.
1186-1293,) , to
John, son of Ralph Utlage, of the land in the meadow
of Leowine, which the said Ralph purchased of Ailward Textor, or the Weaver ;
at the yearly rent of twelve pence, and the heriot of one pound of pepper.
The land is now known as Lewin's-mead, near to St. James' Church, Bristol.
To this deed belongs the confirmation (T. 290. 15 ; C. DCCLX), by the same
prior, to
Margam Abbey , of the above land, which
John, son of Ralph de
Utlage , held of the Priory, and which the Priory held of the gift of Henry
Cumin.
Rent as before stated. In the Abbey Rolls is the record of an undertaking
closely connected with the above (T. 290.32 ; C. MLXV), by William de Bellomonte,
to pay six shillings yearly to the Abbey for tenements which he holds in
fee-farm in the town of Bristol, viz. : four shillings in
the meadow of Lewin ,
which
the Abbey has of the gift of John Utlage
; and two shillings for
land between St. Peter's Church and the Castle
; and to pay twelve pence
yearly to the Prior of St. James, and sixpence to Walter Cumin, for the said
land in the meadow of Leuuin. He is not to give, sell, or exchange the land
without consent of the abbot.

Normans
and King
Henry
I of England
appointed himself her protector. Nest is thought to have borne
him a son,
Henry
FitzRoy
(1103-1158). -Around 1095 King Henry decided to marry Nest to one of
his followers,
Gerald

Second
Crusade
1147
-
On
May 19, 1147, the first contingents of crusaders
left from
Dartmouth
in England , consisting of
Flemish ,
Frisian ,
Norman ,
English ,
and
Scottish
crusaders, and some from
Cologne , [ 4 ]
who collectively considered themselves "Franks". [ 5 ]
No prince or king led this part of the crusade, England at the time being in the
midst of
The
Anarchy .
The fleet was commanded by
"Hervey"
Henry
Glanville , Constable of Suffolk . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
Other crusader captains included
Arnold
III of Aerschot , Christian of Ghistelles,
"the
men of Kent under"
Simon of Dover , Andrew of London, and
Saher of Archelle. [ 8 ]
-
Fall of Lisbon
-
The siege began on
July 1 . The Christians soon captured the
surrounding territories and besieged the walls of Lisbon itself. After four
months, the
Moorish
rulers agreed to
surrender (October 21 ), because the Crusaders' siege
tower reached their wall (thus causing a one day standstill) and because of
hunger within the city, which was sheltering populations displaced from
Santarém
as well as "the leading citizens of
Sintra ,
Almada , and
Palmela ." [ 11 ]
-
Some of the crusaders set sail and continued to the Holy Land. [ 6 ]

held. After this, Hereford Hall was held by the Ferrours, in King Edward's

Hereford or Hertford's Manor
- Thomas de Harford held, in the 4th of Henry IV. the sixth part of a fee of the Lord Morley, which
John de Hoo

held.   - By this it appears to be a large and valuable manor:
the town seems to take its name, as seated near the joining of two streams or rivulets, called probably Suan, Swin, or
Swan ;
The name
"Hereford" is said to come from the
Anglo
Saxon
"here", an army or formation of soldiers, and the
"ford", a place for crossing a river.

Crown Pleas: 19 Henry III - 21 Henry III - 27 Dec. 1236
On the feast of St. John the Apostle [27 Dec. 1236],
a man named Roger [sic] was found by night in Candlewick Street so badly beaten and ill-treated that he could not speak.
Richard Tyllebrigge, Elias son of William Goday,
William Utlaghe , Richard son of Richard Nog', and Robert of Berkhampstead, watchmen,
found him thus in the street and carried him to the house of Thomas le Pipere, where he died very early next morning of that beating.
Afterwards the watchmen went from their ward to that of Roger Blund, then alderman, because they believed the dead man to belong to that ward, to see if they could learn the truth about how the affair had happened. The watchmen of that ward, asked if they knew anything about the above-named John [sic] said that he was their companion in keeping watch that night, and as they were all going together to keep watch, they chanced to meet a man carrying an unlighted lantern, whom they pursued as far as opposite Consel's shop.
There they found a number of unknown men standing in the street, armed with swords and other weapons, who, when they attempted to arrest them, assaulted them, and so beat Roger [sic] that he died.
The other members of the watch they badly wounded, and then fled. Asked then whether they recognized any of the malefactors or suspected anyone,
the watch said that they suspected William le Large , 'coureur', who fled for the deed and could never afterwards be found. Gerard of St. Edmunds, one of the watchmen who was wounded by the malefactors, comes, and asked if he suspects anyone, says that he knows nothing more than has been said above. The mayor and aldermen, asked whom they suspect of the said death and wounds, say that they suspect the same Walter [sic] le Large and no one else, because the others were unknown. Therefore he is to be put in exigent and outlawed according etc.
His chattels are worth 2s., for which the sheriffs are to answer. He was in frankpledge. Therefore [his pledges] are in
mercy.

History of Norfolk-Volume
1- Diss
- This hundred hath its name from the capital town, which is so called from the mere situate on its south side;
dice in the Saxon language signifying a standing water, lake, or ditch. It is bounded on the south by the river Waveny, which now divides Norfolk and Suffolk,
on the west by the hundred of Giltcross, on the north by Depwade, and on the east by the half hundred of Earsham, which joined with the half hundred of Diss, makes up a whole hundred, or, according to the old division, two whole hundreds, and completes the deanery of Redenhall, in the archdeaconry of Norfolk, and diocese of Norwich; the fee of it wholly belonged to Edward the Confessor, as demean of the Crown, till he granted to Ulfiet and Stigand the soc of their own lands,[1] and to the Abbot of St. Edmund's Bury[2] the half part of the soc and sac of his lands, and of all his freemen.
But by the way, it will be necessary to observe, that what we now call Diss Hundred, in the Confessor's time was a hundred and half; the hundred was called Wineferthinc Hundred which Earl Ralph held, upon whose forfeiture it came to the Crown, and was added to the King's half hundred of Dice, and continued ever after as part of it, and this is the reason that the title in Domesday is, the hundred and half hundred of Dice; the fee of which, with all the jurisdiction thereof (except what belonged to the Abbot, to Ulfiet, and Stigand) came into the Conqueror's hands, and the soc and sac of all his freemen in the hundred, that held less than thirty acres, belonged to his manor of Fersfield, but of those that held thirty acres or more, the soc and sac belonged to the hundred of Wineferthinc, which Earl Ralph forfeited
...
[
A Peche Connection : ]
In 1179, as Stow in his Annals tells us, Richard de Lucy, Chief Justice of England, deceased, and was buried in the quire of the abbey church at Lesnes in Kent, which he had founded, and where he had taken upon him the habit of a canon regular the year before. From this Richard the manor came to
Sir Walter Fitz-Robert, son of Robert de Tonnebrigge , the fifth son of Richard Fitz-Gilbert,
surnamed de Tonebrigge, the first
Earl of Clare, who came in with the Conqueror, of whose gift he had the castle and town of Clare in Suffolk, with Tunbridge in Kent, and divers other great lordships in
England . This Earl was son of Gilbert, sirnamed Crispin, Earl of Brion in Normandy, and son of Jeffery, natural son to Richard I. of that name, Duke of Normandy: he bare, as the Fitz-Walters ever after did, the Earl of Clare's shield varied, which is or, three chevrons gul. The Fitz-Walters being or, a fess between two chevrons gul. He had two wives, Maud de Bocham, (as Mr. Weaver,) or rather Margaret de Bohun, (as Mr. Dugdale,) and Maud, daughter of Sir Richard de Lucy, as aforesaid, in whose right he had this manor, to which he first obtained a charter for a fair, on the eve, day, and morrow after the feast of St. Simon and Jude, and three days following. He was Justice itinerant in Norfolk and Suffolk, and died in 1198, being buried in the midst of the quire of the priory church of Little Dunmow in Essex, of which Robert de Tonebrigge, his father, was first founder; he was sometimes called
Walter of Clare, sometimes Robert Fitz-Walter, but mostly Walter Fitz-Robert; he left Robert the Valiant his heir.
Sir Robert Fitz-Walter, Knt. son of Sir Walter Fitz-Robert , commonly called Robert the Valiant, had two wives, Gunnora, daughter and heiress of Philip de Valoines, and Rohesia or Rose, who survived him, and had the manor of Diss, Hemenhale, (which always went with Diss,) Theye, and Diss hundred in dower. He it was that first divided this manor, by
giving a moiety of the two parts which he possessed to Sir Gilbert Pecche, Knt. with his daughter Alice (some say sister) in free marriage, with the third part of the hundred and market, and so there branched a third manor, which was called Pecche's Fee.
This Robert was leader of those barons that rose against King John, the beginning of which was on this occasion, as the book of Dunmow informs us.
...
Pecche's Manor, now called Heywood Hall
Had its rise out of the capital manor;
Sir Robert Fitz-Walter, who held two thirds of the hundred and town of Diss, granted one third thereof with his daughter (some say sister) Alice, in marriage, to
Sir Gilbert Pecche, Knt. lord of Brunne, in Cambridgeshire , upon whose death it descended to
Sir Hammond Pecche, Knt. his son, who died in 1240, leaving, by Eva his wife, several children; Gilbert was his eldest son and
heir , but this was given to
Robert Pecche, his fourth son, who held it in 1286, in which year he claimed view of frankpledge, and assize of bread and ale of all his tenants.
It was this Gilbert, and Agnes his wife, that
in 1292 conveyed two third parts of this manor to Sir Robert Fitz-Walter,
so that it was again joined to the great manor, all but
one third part , which they
in 1285 had conveyed by fine to Sir Richard de Boyland, and Maud his
wife , together with a third part of the demeans, and 28s. per annum quitrent; and
this part constituted that manor here, which is now called Heywood-Hall
Of which I find a fine levied
in 1289, by Sir Richard de Boyland, and Maud his wife, to Stephen Fitz-Walter, lord (in trust) of the great
manor , who designed to join this, as his predecessor had done the other parts to that manor, in order to make it more complete, but it proved of no force, for in 1314
Richard, son of Richard de Boyland, sued Robert Fitz-Walter for it, and recovered it, it having been settled on his mother before the fine was sued, to which he was not a party; and soon after he settled it upon John de Mortimer, in trust for himself and his heirs, which John is said to hold it in 1327.

The name Holt is thought to derive from the
Anglo-Saxon
word for
woodland [ 2 ]
and
Holt is located on wooded high ground of the
Cromer -Holt
ridge
at the crossing point of two ancient
by-ways
and as such was a natural point for a settlement to grow. The town has a mention
in the great survey of 1086 known as the

Book . In the survey it is described as a market town and a port with
the
nearby port of

- At the survey
Hugh de Montfort had the capital lordship, which Bund, a Saxon thane, was lord of, in the reign of the
Confessor
...
Ralph held it under his lord Hugh. ...The descendants of this Ralph, according to the custom of that age, assumed the name De Bodham, and De Bosco de Bodham,
from some wood near their
seat.
HUGH DE MONTFORT
- second of that name, and son of Hugh "with the Beard," Lord of
Montfort-sur-RisIe, near Brionne, was the companion of the Conqueror at
Hastings....
For his services he received (before the completion of Domesday) sixteen manors in Essex, fifty-one in Suffolk, nineteen in Norfolk, and twenty-eight in
Kent , in addition to a large proportion of Romney Marsh, and was one of the barons
entrusted by the Conqueror withi the administration of justice throughout England, under Bishop Odo and William Fitz Osbern in 1067; and by the Bishop himself,
Hugh de Montfort was made Governor of the Castle of Dover , the chief fortress in Odo's own earldom, and the key of the kingdom.
His absence on other duties with the Bishop south of the Thames was taken advantage of by the Kentish malcontents, and led to the assault of the castle by the Count of
Boulogne , the failure of which has been already related.

Simon
IV de l'Amaury
was created
5th Earl of Leicester by King John in 1206. He
died in 1218
during the siege of Toulouse the capital of Haute-Garonne, on the
river Garonne, SE of Bordeaux.  The city has a fine 12th-13th-century
Romanesque church (St Sernin), the church of the Jacobins (belonging to a
monastery founded 1216). Toulouse was the cultural centre of medieval France in
the 12th-13th centuries and was captured by Simon during the infamous
Albigensian wars (1209-29). When a papal legate was assassinated in the
territory of Count Raymond of Toulouse, Pope INNOCENT III called for a crusade
against these heretics.
Simon de Montfort's massacre (1209) of the inhabitants
of Beziers stands out as an example of the crusaders' cruel conduct.
Asked
how to separate Christians from heretics, one leader is said to have replied:
"Slay them all.  God will know his own."
Simon de Montfort (Jnr), 6th Earl of Leicester c1208-1265
English
politician and soldier. Born of an Anglo-French family in Normandy, France. In
1229 he came to England, where two years later Henry III, King of England,
confirmed his title and estates. He married Princess
Eleanor,
the
youngest sister of the king, on 7th January 1239. Princess Eleanor was a widow
having been previously married to William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke who died in
1231. Eleanor and Simon had five sons,

Jersey
-  Formerly
under the control of
Brittany
and named
Angia
(also spelled
Agna  ), [ 16 ]
Jersey was invaded by
Vikings
in the ninth century. The name of Jersey is believed to be derived from Viking
heritage: the
Norse
suffix
-ey
for
island
can be found in many places around the
Northern
European
coasts. The source of the first part of the
toponym
is unclear. Scholars surmise it derives from
jarth
( Old
Norse
for "earth") or
jarl
(earl), or perhaps a personal name,
Geirr
("Geirr's Island"). [ 17 ]
Alternatively
Celtic
origin may relate to the
Gaulish
gar-
(oak), or
ceton
(forest). Some believe "Jersey" is
a corruption of the
Latin
Caesarea , the Roman name for the island, influenced by
Old
English
suffix
-ey
for "island"; [ 18 ] [ 19 ]
this is plausible if, in the regional
pronunciation
of
Latin ,
Caesarea
was not
IPA:  [kaisarea]
but
[tʃeːsarea] .
The island was eventually annexed to the
Duchy
of Normandy
by
William
Longsword ,
Duke
of Normandy
in 933 and it became one of the Norman Islands. When William's
descendant,
William
the Conqueror ,
conquered
England
in 1066, the
Duchy
of Normandy
and the kingdom of
England
were governed under one monarch. [ 20 ]
The Dukes of Normandy owned considerable estates on the island, and Norman
families living on their estates founded many of the historical Norman-French
Jersey family names.
King
John
lost all his territories in mainland Normandy in 1204 to
King
Philip II Augustus , but retained possession of Jersey, along with Guernsey
and the other Channel Islands. The islands have been internally self-governing
since.  ... Until the
19th
century , indigenous
Jèrriais
 a
variety
of
Norman
 was the language of the island, though
French
was used for official business.
Société Jersiaise
- Genealogy Research
- Genealogical records in Jersey differ somewhat from those in the U.K. because
the island retains many Norman laws and institutions. Whilst always owing
allegiance to the British Crown, many records are in French and you will need to
become familiar with the commonly used words and terms.

Sir Roger Outlawe and his brother William Outlawe are among the earliest

Alosts, holding a share in the property, are mentioned in Yorkshire during the thirteenth century.

It is interesting that this official seal ( a signature ) for William Utlage and
would use this symbol for his seal
How is it and Why was Robert of Durham using Utlage's seal?
Is this
the William Outlaw Jr. from Ireland ? Is this a Hospitallar connection?
A
"lion rampant"
is depicted in profile standing erect with forepaws
raised . [ 2 ]
The position of the hind legs varies according to local custom: the lion may
stand on both hind legs, braced wide apart, or on only one, with the other also
raised to strike; the word
rampant
is often omitted, especially in early
blazon, as this is the most usual position of a carnivorous quadruped;
What is interesting is that this is also the
Seal of Scotland. :
The earliest recorded use of the
Lion
rampant
as a royal emblem in Scotland is by
Alexander
II
in 1222

The
hospital of Burton Lazars was founded by Roger de Mowbray , who granted to
the
lepers of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem
2 carucates of land at
Burton
-
The Knights Templar, had
the policy for knights contracting leprosy to join the Order of Saint Lazarus
with the Templars paying a pension for each affected knights admission.
The
"Master of Burton"
originally was
Roger de Mowbray
:
Roger de Mowbray was the son of Nigel dAubigny, one of Henry Is leading
men , and Gundreda de Gournay. Roger took his surname from
Robert de
Mowbray, earl of Northumberland ..Robert had been married to Rogers
stepmother, Maud de Laigle, and
Roberts Norman estate of Montbray had been
passed to Roger through this connection .....
Roger gained and sustained a
high reputation for his prowess on the battlefield, attaining great honour on
the
Second
Crusade , when he successfully defeated a Muslim in one-to-one combat... Roger
was one of the few great men of the kingdom to join the king of France on the
Second Crusade in 1147 ... Roger left for the Holy Land again in 1186, when
he was in his sixties . According to contemporary accounts he was never to
return to England, for
he was captured at the Battle of Hattin in 1187 and
died soon after in Palestine, where he was buried...
The Preceptory of
Choseley,
Norfolk , besides many others, were annexed to it, as cells containing
fratres
leprosos de Sancto Lazaro de Jerusalem ...The masters of all the smaller
Lazar-houses in England, were in some sort subject to the Master of Burton
Lazars, as he himself was, to the Master of the Lazars in Jerusalem.
Raymond
du Puy (1157-1159)
He followed
Gerard de Martigues
as
head of the Order of Saint John of
Jerusalem . He allegedly contracted leprosy and became Master of Saint
Lazarus
Adam
de Veau (... 1314 ...)
He bore: Or, a Lion rampant Azure
The
Royal
Standard of Scotland , also known as the
Banner of the King of Scots , [ 1 ]
or more commonly the
Lion Rampant of Scotland , [ 2 ]
is the Scottish Royal Banner of Arms. [ 3 ]
Used historically by the
King
of Scots , the Royal Standard of Scotland differs from Scotland's
national
flag ,
the
Saltire , in that its correct use is restricted by an
Act
of the
Parliament
of Scotland
to only a few
Great
Officers of State
who officially represent
the
Sovereign
in
Scotland
Richard I
(Richard
the Lionhearted) -- In
1198, his great seal bore a single rampant lion
Alisaundre de
Welles, Preceptor of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem Seal : A lion rampant
We are interested in any links between the
Licolnshire Welles and
Alexander de Welles ,
Master/Prior of
Torphichen
and the Knights Hospitaller
of the
Order of St John of Jerusalem
in Scotland.
Alexander de Welles died
in 1298 at the Battle of Falkirk
where he
fought with
Adam de Welle(s )
of Lincolnshire
and
Philip de Welle(s)
(probably
of Essex) against
William Wallace .
1215
-
Geoffrey
de Marisco
founded a
Commandery of the Knights Hospitallers at Hospital
- parish of
Aney
Ireland
-
Hospital,
County Limerick
Their
[ Marisco ] coat of arms were "gules, a lion rampant, argent" and that
of William de Marisco "gules, a lion rampant sable, langued gules"
which may mean they were royal bastards (or alternatively descended from
Charlemagne).
[ An interesting idea but as shown the arms show a relationship with the
Templars and Hospitaller order. ]

Durham
- is a
city
in the
North
East
of
England .
It is within the
County
Durham
- Durham is well known for its
Norman
Cathedral
and
11th-century
castle ,
Durhams geographical position has always given it an important position in
the defence of England against the
Scots . [ 8 ]
The city has played an important part in the defence of the north and Durham
Castle is the only
Norman
castle
keep
never
to have suffered a breach. [ 9 ]
The
Battle
of Neville's Cross
which took place near the city on 17 October 1346 between
the English and Scots is the most famous battle of the age . [ 1 ]
Owing to
divine
providence
of the citys founding, the
Bishop
of Durham
has always enjoyed the title Bishop by
Divine
Providence  [ 10 ]
opposed to all other bishops who are Bishop by
Divine
Right . [ 1 ]
However, as the north east was so far from
Westminster
the bishops of Durham enjoyed extraordinary powers such as the ability to hold
their own
parliament , [ 1 ]
raise their own armies, [ 2 ]
appoint their own
sheriffs
and
Justices ,
administer their own laws, levy
taxes
and
customs
duties , create fairs and markets, issue
charters , [ 3 ]
salvage shipwrecks, collect revenue from mines, administer the forests and mint
their own coins. [ 1 ]
So far reaching were the bishops powers that the
steward
of Bishop
Anthony
Bek
commented in 1299 AD: There are two kings in England, namely the Lord
King of England, wearing a crown in sign of his regality and the Lord Bishop of
Durham wearing a
mitre
in place of a crown, in sign of his regality in the
diocese
of Durham.

About Gloves
in Medieval times:
The custom of presenting a pair of white gloves
to the neophyte at
the conclusion of an initiation ceremony
has a long historical tradition , and it is recorded already in the 10th century. A chronicle
relates that in the year 960, the monks of Saint Albans Monastery in Mainz (Germany),
presented a pair of gloves to the bishop at his investiture. The prayer pronounced during the investiture ceremony
included a phrase beseeching God to cloth with purity the hands of His servant.
...
Similarly,
the kings of France received a pair of gloves at their
coronation .
The consecrated hands of the king, like those of the bishop, should not be soiled by contact with impure things.
After the
ceremony, the
Hospitaller's burned the gloves, to prevent their later use for profane
purposes .

being appointed, with others, to

Notice that Robert Malle is also on this list and that a Robert Malle is
listed later as a benefactor for Sir Adam Outlawe in his will in 1501! So were
these two a father's and son's of Robert Malle's and Adam Outlawe's?  And
who was this Robert Outlawe?  Also in this time period no reference to Adam Outlawe.
Only this
regarding a
Robert Outlawe
( Did Adam go to Danzig?
) We see these
references to Robert (and the younger) at Barton and Berton:

leaving their

Sir ADAM OUTLAWE, of West Lynn,
St. Peters, priest, died 1501, leaving a Will,
by which he bequeathed
his chantry, lands and tenements thereto belonging, to Thomas Tyard, and after
his decease to remain to
the Chantry of "Our Lady" in the Church at
St. Peters , the priest of it to pray for the good state of the aldermen,
brethren, etc., and for the souls of the same, namely:
Thomas of Acre
and
Muriel, his wife, and for the
benefactors, namely: Robert Malle and Agnes his
wife , and for his (Outlaw's) own soul, the second Sunday of Lent. To the parish
clerk he gave three acres of land in North Lynn and to the bellman of the town
he gave the tenement called Bunchesham, at Cowgate, and an acre
called
Vestyll's Acre,
that he pray for the
souls mentioned. Thomas of Acre and
Muriel his wife, were the founders of this chantry, and he died, as it seems,
patron of it, and left the patronage in the gift of the parishioners, the rector
or curate not to be feoffee of it. He served it as chantry priest.
Sir Adam
Outlawe, priest, is buried in the church . (Blomefield's History of Norfolk).

from her past can spread and stretch and live out their stories. Events in the

take place; they occur in a town called N, which we eventually discover to be
Kempe's
home town of
Lynn ,
an important
seaport on England's North Sea , or in
Norwich ,
or in
York
or London; even more specifically, they occur within churches in these cities,
so that
the
Book
offers a detailed map of East Anglian and Yorkshsire
parishes and cathedrals in the 15th century . Even within parishes, cathedrals,
and priories, Kempe locates her memories according to place, often telling us
with great precision where particular visions or conversations occur: she is
within the Prior's Chapel, she is praying in the chancel at
St.
Stephen's Church in Norwich , she is in a chapel of St. James; she prays in
St. Margaret's Church in a chapel of the Gesine.

About 1250 Dominus Henry de Bathonia or de Bathe,
knight and judge, owned nearly all the Broxbourne lands
other than the
demesne and church lands. No record of the grant of these has come to light, but
down to the time of the dissolution'
20s. per annum was paid to the Prior of
the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem for the lands of Baas ," as of his
manor of Broxbourne ". ...
Baa's manor is the original of the name
'Baas', pronounced 'Base' ,... three other (sub) manors contained in these
and held by Bathonia, namely Gerkyns, Maryons, and Halle,
the last two rented
from the Knights of St. John . ...the site of

A History of Brickendon
The Broxbourne Bits
In 1066
the manor of Broxbourne
was held by Stigand, Archbishop of
Canterbury. By 1086 it was in the possession of Adelaide, wife of Hugh de
Grandmesnil; later Ivo, the son and heir of Hugh, gave the manor to the monks of
Bermondsey Abbey, Surrey, about a mile south of the present Tower Bridge in
London. However, Ivo had previously mortgaged his lands to
Robert, Count of
Meulan and first Earl of Leicester , and so with the agreement of the monks
of Bermondsey, Robert took possession of Broxbourne.
In 1198 the manor was in
the possession of the Knights Hospitallers of St John of Jerusalem, the only
military-religious order of the Catholic Church that still survives to this day.
In about 1544, following the confiscation of the properties of the Hospitallers ,
Henry VIII granted the manor to John Cock of Tewin, former
bailiff of
the estate for the Knights Hospitallers .

The papers of the Coke family of Weasenham Hall
(Norfolk) were
acquired by the University Library in 1998. It includes a series of fourteenth
century court rolls with accounts for the two manors of Kipton and Northall,
which were acquired in 1592 by
Sir Edward Coke (1552-1634), Attorney General
under Elizabeth I.
Sir
Edward Coke
- ( pronounced "Cook" ) (1 February 1552  3
September 1634) was a seventeenth-century
English
jurist
and
Member
of Parliament
whose writings on the
common
law
were the definitive legal texts for nearly 150 years.
Born into a
family of minor
Norfolk
gentry , Coke traveled to
London
as a young man to make his living as a
barrister .
There he rapidly gained prominence as one of the leading attorneys of his time,
eventually being appointed
Solicitor
General
and then
Attorney
General
by
Queen
Elizabeth .
As Attorney General,
Coke famously prosecuted
Sir
Walter Raleigh
and the
Gunpowder
Plot conspirators
for treason.
In 1606, Coke was made
Chief
Justice of the Court of Common Pleas , later being elevated, in 1613, to
Lord
Chief Justice of England . During this period, Coke became fabulously
wealthy, eventually coming to own 105 properties. [ 5 ]
Sir Edward Coke was born at

the
son of a barrister from a Norfolk family.

Walsingham's history as a pilgrimage centre stretches back to Saxon times.
In 1061, during the reign of
Edward the Confessor ,
Richeldis, the widow of the
lord of the manor of Walsingham Parva , had
a vision in which Our Lady appeared
to her and took her in spirit to Nazareth.
Here
she was shown the the place
where the Angel Gabriel had appeared to her at the Annunciation.
She was told to
take note of the measurements of the Holy House and to build a reproduction of
it in Walsingham, to be a place of pilgrimage; England's Nazareth. Richeldis had the vision three times, and then hastened to carry out the
instructions she had received. The matter was put in the hands of skilled
carpenters, but the question arose, where should the house be built? There seem
to be two traditions:
The first tradition states that a spring of water erupted at the location
where the house was to be built.
This holy well became part of the great
Augustinian Priory
in which the Holy House built by Richeldis was later
enshrined. The second tradition states that during the night there was a heavy
fall of dew, but in a certain meadow two spaces of about equal size remained
quite dry. Richeldis took this as a sign that the house was to be set up on one
of these plots, and chose the one that was close to a well (the Holy Well?).
Pilgrims came in huge numbers. They stopped a mile outside Walsingham at the
Slipper Chapel
to remove their shoes. Kings, nobles, and ordinary folk entered
England's Nazareth as equals to worship Jesus, the Son of God and child of Mary.
Destruction -
The upheavals of
the Reformation , as a result of King Henry VIII's dispute
with Rome brought about the
suppression of the Shrine in 1538 . The statue
of Our Lady of Walsingham (Mary holding Jesus on her knee) was taken to London
to be burnt.
The Priory was dismantled and left in ruins . This could have
been the end of the story, however late in the 19th Century interest in the
antiquities of Walsingham began to revive...
Norfolk
Churches -
Little Walsingham   -  In the Middle Ages, the shrine of
Our Lady at Walsingham was second only to the Shrine of St Thomas of Canterbury in its significance to English
pilgrims . By the 12th century,
a Priory had grown up here at Walsingham ,
and pilgrims, unable to visit the real Nazareth in the Holy Land because of its
conversion to Islam, came to England's Nazareth instead.
Shrine Of Our Lady Of Walsingham, Norfolk, UK Ancient Christian Pilgrimage
Holy Site in Eastern England
Saxon noblewoman Richeldis de Faverches had a vision of recreating the
house where Jesus's birth was announced by Gabriel.
Thus was the legend of
Walsingham born.
The story starts with
Richeldis' vision of creating a shrine at
Walsingham .
According to one legend ghostly workers assembled the materials gifted by
Richeldis into the Holy House. Succeeding generations built on the shrine,
erecting the Priory around it, which became the
Augustinian Walsingham Abbey
helped by royal patronage over the years, until the reign of
Henry VIII, who
had it destroyed in 1538 .
Our Lady of Walsingham
-
Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Our Lady of Walsingham
is a title used for
Mary ,
the mother of
Jesus .
The title derives from the belief that Mary appeared in a
vision
to Richeldis de Faverches, a devout
Saxon
noblewoman, in 1061 in the village of
Walsingham
in
Norfolk ,
England .
Lady Richeldis had a Holy House built in Walsingham which became a shrine and
place of pilgrimage.
In passing on his guardianship of the Holy House, Richeldis's son Geoffrey
left instructions for the building of a priory in
Walsingham .
The priory passed into the care of
Canons
Regular
sometime between 1146 and 1174.
Walsingham
is a
village
(actually two conjoined villages:
Little Walsingham
and
Great
Walsingham ) in the
English
county of
Norfolk .
The village is famed for its religious
shrines
in honour of the
Virgin
Mary
and as a major pilgrimage centre. It also contains the ruins of two
medieval
monastic
houses. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Walsingham became a major centre of
pilgrimage
in the eleventh century . In 1061, according to the Walsingham legend, an
Anglo-Saxon
noblewoman, Richeldis de Faverches , had a
vision
of the Virgin Mary in which she was instructed to build a replica of the house
of the Holy Family in
Nazareth
in honour of the
Annunciation .
Her family name does not appear in the
Domesday
Book .
When it was built the Holy House in Walsingham was paneled with wood and
contained a wooden statue of an enthroned Virgin Mary with the child Jesus
seated on her lap. Among its relics was a phial of the Virgin's milk.
Walsingham
became one of Northern Europe's great places of pilgrimage
and remained so
through most of the Middle Ages. ...
Many were the gifts of lands, rents and churches to the canons of
Walsingham
and many were the miracles sought and claimed at the shrine.
Several English kings visited the shrine, including
Henry
III
(1231 or 1241),
Edward
I
(1289 and 1296),
Edward
II
in 1315,
Edward
III
in 1361,
Henry
VI
in
1455 ,
Henry
VII
in 1487 and finally Henry VIII, who was later responsible for its
destruction when the shrine and abbey perished in the
Dissolution
of the Monasteries .
Erasmus ,
in fulfilment of a vow, made a pilgrimage from
Cambridge
in 1511 and left as his offering a set of Greek verses expressive of his piety.
Thirteen years later he wrote his colloquy on pilgrimages, wherein the wealth
and magnificence of Walsingham are set forth and some of the reputed miracles
rationalised. Two of Henry VIII's wives 
Catherine
of Aragon
and
Anne
Boleyn
 made pilgrimages to the shrine .

King William seized on this, which was one of King Harold's lordships , and a beruite belonging to
the royal manor of Fakenham , containing 3 carucates of land, 13 villains, 7 borderers, with one carucate in demean, 2 carucates among the tenants, paunage for 10 swine, and acre and half of meadow, 2 mills, 2 horses, 5 cows, and 24 sheep; and there were 8 socmen, with one carucate of land; 2 borderers also belonged to it, half an acre of meadow, the moiety of a mill, and 3 carucates: all this was valued in
Fakenham.
...
The Earl of Clares Lordship s.
Rainald, son of Ivo, obtained two of the principal manors in these towns, on the Conquest:

The same Rainald had also the
grant of a lordship in Walsingham Parva, on the deprivation of the aforesaid
Ketel,
...
Walsingham Priory.
The widow lady of
Ricoldie de Faverches,
dwelling in
Walsingham Parva, founded there, in or about
1061 ,
a chapel in honour of the Virgin Mary, in all respects like to the Sancta Casa at Nazareth, where the Virgin was saluted by the angel Gabriel on a vision of the Virgin enjoining her
thereto ; (fn. 6) a pretence generally made use of in like foundations.
Sir Geffrey de Faveraches, her son, soon after the conquest, endowed it, granting to Edwin, his clerk or chaplain, this chapel of St. Mary, with the church of All-Saints in the said
town , with its appertenances in lands, tithes, rents, services, &c. which the said
Edwin possessed the day he went to
Jerusalem ; viz. 20s. per ann. out of his demean, for two parts of the tithe of his land, the land at Snaring, which Hawis gave to God, and the said chapel, 8 acres in the field of the said town, with part of a
meadow. ...
The said knight seems to be the first founder of the priory ,
built the priory church, and gave the chapel of our Lady all the ground within the site of the
church , 8 acres of land, with 20s. rent per ann. out of his manor, if the yearly value of the offerings of our Lady did not exceed 5
marks
...
But the greatest beauty and glory of this priory was the chapel (fn. 10) of the blessed Virgin, which is said to have been
about 8 yards long and 4 yards and 10 inches wide.
...
So great was
the fame of this idol or image of the Lady of Walsingham , that
foreigners of all nations came on a pilgrimage to her , insomuch that the number of her devotees and worshippers seemed to equal those of the Lady of Loretto in Italy, and the town of Walsingham Parva owed its chief support and maintenance
thereto.
...
But
this so famous image of the Lady was, in the 30th of Henry VIII. brought to Chelsea by London, and there publickly
burnt.
....
In this town of
Walsingham Parva was also an house or priory of Grey Friars or Friars Minors, founded by the Lady Elizabeth de Burgh Countess of Clare, who had a patent for it in the 21st of Edward
III .
Houses of Austin canons -
The priory of Walsingham
Bishop Latimer wrote a jocular letter to Cromwell in June, 1538, suggesting the burning of the image of the virgin of Walsingham
and others: 'they would make a joly mustere in Smythfeld.' (fn. 56) John Husee, writing to Lord Lisle, on 18 June, also attempted to be witty on the same
subject.
An Elizabethan ballad entitled ' A Lament for Walsingham ,' thus concludes:
Levell, levell with the ground The Towres doe lye,
Which with their golden glitt'ring tops Pearsed oute to the skeye.
Where weare gates noe gates are new, The waies unknown,
Where the presse of freares did passe, While her fame far was blowen.
Oules doe scrike where the sweetest himenes Lately wear songe,
Toades and serpents hold their dennes Where the palmers did throng.
Weepe, weepe, O Walsingham, Whose dayes are nightes,
Blessings turned to blasphemies, Holy deeds to dispites.
Sinne is where our Lady sate, Heaven turned is to helle;
Sathan sitte where our Lord did swaye, Walsingham, oh, farewell!

Sir Thomas Walgrave may perhaps have been the
person designated in this letter as the Master of Carbrooke . At all events,
the date is clearly about this time.  At
Carbrooke, in Norfolk, was a
commandry formerly belonging to the Knights Templars , which, like most of
the possessions of the order,
when it was suppressed in Edward II's time, was
given to the Knights of St. John.

On another occasion the son, Sir John, writes to his father : ' Please you to
wit that
I am at Lynn and am informed by divers persons that the Master
of Carbrooke (a Master of Knights Templars) would take rule in the Mary Talbot
as for captain , and give jackets of his livery to divers persons which he
waged (paid) by other men, in the said ship.
Fenland notes &
queries . A quarterly antiquarian journal for the fenland, in the counties of Huntingdon, Cambridge, Lincoln, Northampton, Norfolk, and Suffolk
" To my right worshipful father, John Paston. " Please you to weet
that I am at Lynn, and understand by divers persons, as
I am informed, that
the master of Carbrooke* would take a rule in the Mary Talbot as for captain,
and to give jackets of livery to divers persons which he waged by other men, and
not by him, being in the said ship ; wherefore insomuch as I have but few
soldiers in mine livery here, to strengthen me in that which is the king's
commandment, I keep with me your two men Dawbeny and Calle, which I suppose
shall sail with me to Yarmouth, for I have purveyed harness for them, and
ye
shall well understand by the grace of God that the said master of Carbrooke*
shall have none rule in the ships , as I had proposed he should have had,
because of his business ; and for this is one of the special causes I keep your
said men with me, beseeching you ye take it to none displeasure with me,
notwithstanding their herdenj at Wygenhall shall be done this day, by the grace
of God, who have you in his keeping.
* Carbrooke is in Norfolk, about midway between Castle Acre and Lynn.
There was a society of Knight Templars at that place , and it would be
interesting to know if there is any local trace of them now.
The master of
Carbrooke would mean the head of this society, who (f) was a busy-body and not
fitted to act as subordinate under John Paston.
John Paston, the writer of the letter, was brought up in the family of the
Duke of Norfolk
; was a soldier, and engaged in French wars ; became heir to
his brother in 1479 ;
High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1485
; was made a Knight
bannaret at the battle of Stoke in 1487 by Henry VII. ; and died in 1503.

In May and June
both John III and
John II were involved in the
preparations for repelling any sea-borne invasion . Any royal fleet was
usually gathered by 'arresting' merchant vessels for use in war, and
John II
went to King's Lynn
to carry out a warrant for the arrest of a ship called
the
Mary Talbot , about this time: he wrote to his father:
' This is to let you know I am at Lynn, and gather from various people that
the master of Carbrooke
wants to take command of the
Mary
Talbot
as captain, or so I am told, and to give jackets of his livery to
various people who have been hired by other men, and not by him, who are in the
ship.... by the grace of God, the master of
Carbrooke
will have no
command in the ships as I intended he should, because of his plots.

John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk
-
12th Baron Segrave, 11th
Baron Mowbray,
Earl
Marshal
(1421  22 August 1485) was an
English
nobleman, soldier, and the first
Howard
duke
of Norfolk . He was a close friend and loyal supporter of King
Richard
III of England [ 1 ]
with whom he died in combat at the
Battle
of Bosworth .... The Howards were staunch adherents of the
House
of York
during the
Wars
of the Roses , and John Howard, backed by his powerful Mowbray relations,
upheld
the Yorkist cause in Norfolk . John Howard died at the
Battle
of Bosworth Field
on 22 August 1485 along with his friend and patron King
Richard.
Howard was the great-grandfather of
Anne
Boleyn
and
Catherine
Howard , the second and fifth
Queens
consort , respectively, of
King
Henry VIII . Thus, through Anne Boleyn,
he was the great-great-grandfather
of Elizabeth I.
Memorials of the ancient of Ipswich ,

-
Sir John Howard
was now
engaged in assisting the king both by sea
and land . Afterwards it will be seen he busied himself greatly in fitting
out of ships. His ability and knowledge of the sea caused
the king eventually
to appoint him to arm and command of the fleet,
and defend the coast, namely
in 1470.
In 1463 ,
Sir John Howard
furnishes forth the ship
Mary
Talbot for the wars , the crew and men which she carried being collected from
Ipswitch, Harwich, Lynn , and other places.*
The Mary Talbot carried upwards
of eighty persons , who appear to have been paid 2s. each upon entering
service. Among them we find John Colpho of Wolverstone, John Dykeman of Erwarton,
John Browne of Dovercourt, Nicholas Reed of Nacton, and John Bullen of
Chelmondiston, with many others from near neighborhoods.
Many of the men on board the Mary Talbot were impressed into service ...
Thomas Lynnot was paid 48 s. for  impressed 29 men...

Sir John Howard had large possessions at Lynn , When Edward fled the
kingdom, Sir J. Howard conveyed him to Lynn, and found him security until he
quitted England.
In
1466
Sir John
was still busy in building the " new
kervelle ,"
which he seems to have christened the "
Mary Grase "'
he
bought " an ashe of ij. yerdes longe, for to make a lanteme and a stok for
an image of our lady. In the same year he commanded the vessel which conveyed to
Calais the English Commissioners accredited to the Courts of Burgundy and
France." His steward notes that he was at Calais from the 15th of May to
the 17th of September
Although
not documented here, I have found elsewhere that
The
"Mary Grase" was built in
Dunwich
Formerly the early medieval capital of East Anglia , Dunwich is now a small village that over the past eight centuries has been suffering from coastal erosion. Today it is no larger than a few streets, a pub, and a few houses. And, famously, the Flora Tea Rooms, an excellent fish-and-chip shop.
Most of the former town lies underneath the waves , as the local museum demonstrates, and the town has made an industry out of its lost heritage (which included around a dozen churches, a market square, and a guildhall). Walking along the shingle beach it is frequently possible to pick up small artefacts and bits of archaeology (including bones from an eroding cemetery) from the crumbling cliffs overhead. Once a prosperous seaport with a population of 3000 and listed in the Domesday book, the town was largely destroyed by storms in 1286 and 1347, then fell further victim to the eroding coastline.
Today, almost the entire town has disappeared, leaving only the remains of a couple of buildings.

- ,,, The

Talbot..."Richard Outlaw
is a good man, in truth, but he did indeed win
Fortunata in a game."
It is 1461: Edward, son of Richard of York, ascends to the throne, and his
willful sister, Margaret, immediately becomes a pawn in European politics as
Edward negotiates her marriage. The young Margaret falls deeply in love with
Anthony Woodville, the married brother of Edward's queen, Elizabeth.
Richard Felaw was an Ipswitch man
- Ipswich School
A merchant and
Alderman of Ipswich called Richard Felaw
bequeathed his house in what is now Foundation Street to the School, endowing it
with lands so that children of needy parents could attend without paying fees.
One of the first pupils to benefit from Felaws endowment was
Thomas Wolsey
who never forgot that it was largely
thanks to Felaw that he became what he
became
Lord
Chancellor
of England
1465 - "Eard" - Crayford - London - Thomas Outlawe - John Outlawe
So is this Thomas the same as the Pewterer Warden in 1501, below? There
have been very few London records for the Outlaw's and I suspect the they are
not readily available on the web.  More records are being found as more out
of print books have been scanned. We know that at least a couple of groups of
Outlawe's were active in the naval shipping , owned there own ships were
involved with the Hanse Trading Guild and were active in Lynn and in London.
So where are the record's?  Possibly the 1666 London fire is the
reason.

CRAYFORD
-
LIES the next parish south-eastward from Erith, having the river Thames and that parish for its northern boundary.
It appears to have been called, soon after the arrival of the Saxons in this island, by the name of Creccan ford; that is, the ford or passage over the water, then called Crecca. now Cray.
(fn. 1)
In the time of archbishop Saint Dunstan, who came to the see of Canterbury, in 960, it was known by the name of Erbede, or Eard, and at the conquest by that of Eard, alias Crayford;
by which it continued to be described in all antient deeds and writings to the time of king Henry
VIII.
The high London road crosses the southern part of this parish, in which is the village, commonly called
Crayfordstreet
.
There are now to be seen, as well on the heaths near Crayford, as in the fields hereabout, many artificial caves or holes in the earth, some being ten, fifteen, and others twenty fathoms deep.
At the mouth, and thence downward, they are narrow, like the tunnel of a chimney, or passage of a well, but at the bottom they are large and of great compass, insomuch that some of them have several rooms or partitions, one within another, strongly vaulted, and supported with pillars of chalk. In the opinion of the neighbouring inhabitants, they were formerly dug, as well for the use of the chalk, towards building, as for the mending of their lands; but it is
most probable that some of them were made for a farther use by the Saxons, our ancestors, who used them as secret hiding places for their wives, children, and goods, as well in times of civil wars as of foreign
invasions.
THIS PLACE, in the time of the Saxons, was possessed by one Elfege, a powerful man, who by his will, made in the presence of archbishop Dunstan, about the year 970, gave a third part of his estates in Erhede, and elsewhere, to Christ church, in
Canterbury ;
Charities.
JOHN MARSHALL ,
owner of a tenement and 13 acres of marsh ground in this
parish , built an isle adjoining to the church of Crayford, and afterwards by his will devised 6s. 8d. part of the rent, for the repair of it, (fn. 32) and 10s. yearly to the poor to the distributed in the bread and cheese, and the remainder for an obit for ever in the church; other lands in this parish were
likewise given by divers persons for obits, and for the relief of the poor of it. But most probably these donations were seized on by the king's commissioners in king Henry VIIIth or king Edward the VIth's reigns, as having been given to superstitious uses, and the parish by that means has been deprived of any benefit from
them. From: ' Parishes: Crayford', The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 2
(1797) , pp. 263-285.

Company History,
The Worshipful Company of Pewterers
Ideal venue for functions in the heart of
the City of London
The Worshipful
Company of Pewterers is one of the older Livery Companies in the City of London .
It is number 16 in the order of civic precedence among over a hundred companies.
The earliest documented reference to it is in the records of the Corporation
dated 1348 when the "goodfolk, makers of vessels of pewter" came
before the Mayor and Aldermen asking for approval of the Articles which they had
drawn up for the regulation of the trade.
CHARTERS
Edward IV granted the first Charter of the Company on 20th
January 1474
(1473 in the calendar of the day). In addition to licensing the
Freemen of the Mistery of Pewterers to found a Fraternity, it allowed the Guild
to regulate the standard of workmanship, the training of craftsmen and the wages
and prices to be set. This Charter granted the Guild the right of search
throughout England to ensure the quality of pewter was maintained.
The first Hall, completed in 1496 ,
was destroyed in
the
Great Fire of London. (1666)
THE FIRST HALL: The Company's earliest records show that
its members attended every year at the Austin Friars Monastery on the Feast of
the Blessed Virgin; after doing business in the Offices, a feast was held in
the Hall of the Monastery. Very soon after receiving its first Charter
the
Company looked for suitable premises for its own Hall and in 1484 acquired a
site in Lime Street, which it still owns today. A Hall was completed in 1496
and provided a centre for business and recreation, having both a garden and a
vinery. It was a source of pride to its owners, being the centre of their
trade government and of their social life.
The Hall, as much other Company
property, was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666.

THE PRIORY OF WEYBRIDGE
(fn. 1)
Hugh Bigod , earl of Norfolk, founded a small house for
Austin Canons , dedicated to the honour of
St. Mary , at
Weybridge, in the parish of Acle , towards the close of the reign of Henry III. Robert was the first warden or keeper of this humble foundation, and, by an undated deed, the earl granted to Robert and his brethren of the church of St. Mary all his marsh in Acle, with all appurtenances, in free alms.
Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk, son of Hugh, the patron and founder, granted to Robert the chaplain, the first warden of the house and the brethren of the same, power to elect, after the death of the said warden, one of the brethren in his place, provided that two or three be nominated by them from themselves, or from elsewhere if sufficient be not there found, to be presented to the earl and his heirs, by whom the one that should seem most fitting should be presented to the bishop.

Acle Village History
In Saxon times, Acle was on the Norfolk shoreline and grew as a fishing village .
Great Yarmouth did not exist, the area it occupies being a sand bank, and all
the marshes between Great Yarmouth and Acle were under sea. Gradually land was
reclaimed from the estuaries of the Rivers Bure, Waveney and Yare leaving large
expanses of flat land stretching towards the sea. There are two theories about
the
origin of the name Acle; one is that it means 'a place that overflowed'
or that it means 'in the lea of the oaks', that is, a clearing in an oak forest
(to
the south of the village at that time was a large oak woodland ).
In Tudor
times, hundreds of oaks were felled here for timber to construct Elizabeth I's
war ships .
The village stands beside a vast marshland area which in Roman times was a
great estuary called Gariensis. Trading ports were located on high ground and
Acle was one of those important ports. Evidence of the Romans was found in the
late 1980s when quantities of coins were unearthed in The Street during
construction of the A47 bypass. Some properties in the village, built on the
line of the beach, have front gardens of sand while the back gardens are on a
thick bed of flints. Records show that Acle was a fishing port as far back as
Saxon times; the Church tower could possibly have served as a lookout point.
Tradition has it that there is a Viking burial site 1 mile north of the village.
It is said that Acle, unlike many Norfolk villages, did not suffer any
loss of life during the Black Death ; villages which suffered badly were
often abandoned afterwards, apart from the Church, and new villages were built a
short distance away. Two good examples of this can be seen at Reedham and
Horning.
In 1086 when the new Norman masters compiled the Domesday Book it was noted
there were 23 villagers, 38 smallholders and three slaves. In 1101 Acle Bridge
was opened and by the 12th century the village had a manor. The estuary which
gave Acle its raison detre gradually silted up and rivers were formed after
embankments were created by man during the 13th and 14th centuries. In the
coming centuries Acle would continue to be an important trade centre for the
surrounding area. There has been a market since the 13th century, but livestock,
which was once central to it, has ceased in recent years. When the old
saleground was closed, a 12th century rubbish dump was unearthed. Hundreds of
pieces of medieval pottery and other artefacts were recovered including oyster
shells, whelks and even a boars tusk. They were put on display in Norwich Castle
Museum.
The Church, in common with many in East Anglia, is dedicated to St Edmund;
the oldest part is the round part of the tower, Saxon or Norman in origin. Other
fragments of Norman work have been found, but the nave dates from the 13th
century and the north porch, showing good flintwork , and the octagonal part of
the tower are 15th century.
Acle was at one time owned by the Crown then by the Earl of Norfolk, and
subsequently, by Lord Calthorpe (who became Lord of the Manor). It is only
comparatively recently that this estate has been broken up. The survey of 1838
lists several other interesting names connected with Acle; it is recorded that
the Dean and Chapter of Norwich owned 331 acres, the Earl of Plymouth 8 acres
and Magdalen College Oxford 2 acres.
...
Near Acle Bridge are the remains of an old priory (Weybridge Priory) founded
in the reign of Edward I (1272-1307)
and occupied by
Augustinian canons . Its
position in the midst of the marshes did not save the abbey from serious damage
in the rebellion, headed by Robert, Earl of Leicester and Hugh Bigod, Earl of
Norfolk, in the reign of Henry II. From 1168 until 1175 the abbey was in the
king's hand, Prior Adam being in charge of ecclesiastical matters and Wimar the
Chaplain, accounting to the king for the revenue. Owing to the state of
disrepair,
the abbey applied in 1327 and was subsequently granted a license
to enclose the abbey with a battlemented wall.
At the Dissolution, the abbey
was valued at £7.13.4 and was granted to the Duke of Norfolk.
There is
little to see now
apart from hummocky areas in a field beside the Acle
Bridge Inn, but
the name is preserved in Priory Close near the Church in Acle .
Acle
-
The church of
St
Edmund
is one of 124 existing
round-tower
churches
in
Norfolk .
The round stage of the tower is the oldest part of the church, thought to be
Saxon
in origin and of a date between 850 and 950 AD . The
octagonal
stage was added in the 13th century, probably when the roof was raised. The
battlements
are from 1472. The tower houses six bells, five of which were cast in
Norwich
and date back to 1623. The tower is reinforced with a metal frame to enable the
bells to be rung safely.
Entry to the church is by a
porch
on the north side, built in 1495. The dressed
flints
are in contrast with most of the walls which appear to be made of
rubble .
The main body of the church, the
nave ,
is thought on the evidence of the measurements and wall thickness to be
Norman
in origin. This is not immediately obvious as no Norman doorways or aches
remain. In 1927, when
ivy
was being strapped from the outside walls, one of the
buttresses
collapsed revealing a find of Norman-worked stones, which were later reassembled
for safekeeping in the rood stair space.
Nowhere, Norfolk

Nowhere

to produce salt for food preservation, etc. Originally an
extra-parochial
liberty
it was formally incorporated into Acle
parish
in 1862 and the name no longer appears in maps and gazetteers. In 1861 there
were four inhabited houses and 16 people.

Report by Sir Francis Bryan :
1543 -
Westminster .,
19 Feb .
Bryan
^ ' that
the King is advertised of the troubles we
were in upon the seas and the danger and ruin of his ships, and that I was
determined according to your commandment to send four ships to
the Downes . The
said
ships were ready in
Humber
before the receipt of your letters, whereupon I
sent a boat which has spoken with
Mr. Clere and Mr. Carye , commanding them to
lie off and on upon
the coast between Humber and Newcastle , and as
Mr.
Nedygate and Adam Owtlawe
were ready victualled I thought it more convenient
that
they should accompany Mr. Clere and Mr. Carye , than lie in harbour.
As
Clere
and
Carye
went forth of
Humber
they met a Scot of 30 tons laden with
salmon, herring and barrelled fish
with the lord Admiral's safe-conduct for
George Browne and Ant. Papeworth, of Barwike, to bring, in Scottish ships or
boats, certain fish to Berwike, Holy Hand, Aylmouth or Stakton at price therein
limited (given). As the Scot had passed the places appointed and said he was
going to Boston,
Sir John [Clere] and Mr. Carye
sent him to Hull,
and I have
stayed him and certified my lord Admiral.
Clere also took a French boat, as I
reported, which is at Newcastle, and the men, 31 and 3 Dutchmen, brought in the
ships to Hull, and I have, by advice of
Mr.
Stanhop , delivered all 34 to the
mayor to keep them and see them gently handled.
Begs to know how their
charges shall be paid. Here awaits the coming of
Mr. Osborn
with the King's
further pleasure. The French have delivered an inventory of their goods, valued
at 500 mks., which is sent to the lord Admiral.

Tynemouth
were given on 28 April . All the ships were to be ready to weigh anchor at a
favourable wind.
The Lord Admiral, Viscount Lisle's flagship would fly the
St George Cross on the fore-top mast and two top-lights at night . The ships
of the
'vaward',
the vanguard , would follow and anchor as near as possible. Hertford and the
treasure-ship ( Ralph
Sadler
was treasurer) would follow with his ensign on the
main-top
mast
of the
Rose Lion
with two night lights on the
shrouds .
The
Earl
of Shrewsbury , captain of the rear-ward would fly the ensign on his mizzen
mast, with a cresset light in the
poop
deck
at night. The other ships were not to show flags or lights. Any ship
that was transporting base or double base guns was to mount them on the
fore-deck for the landing

an Account of the E xpedition
of
1544
A manuscript in the Cambridge University Library, Dd. 14. 30 (3), contains an account of
the expedition of 1544 , written by a steward who lived iat
Lydingstone . The writer gives more detail than will be found in the diary printed in
Rymer's `Feodera,' xv. 52 , but
his narrative breaks off abruptly at a very early stage.

July 3, 1544 :
The
3rd day of July 1544   the Noble
Prince Charles ,
Duke of Suffolk ,
Henry lorde
marquis of Dorset
and
Sir Anthony Browen Knight
[Mr] Master of the
Kings majesty horses,
and of his graces Privy Chamber
with
diverse other
gentlemen set forth from Douer
[Dover]
to Callys in a ship
called [
blank
] and
the said Duke of Suffolk caused the Master of the same ship or the
Captain
thereof called Adam Owtlaw
to set in the top of the same,
a flag of
Saint George
where unto came
the
Lord Admiral of England
and the
Admiral of Flanders
with 30 gallant Ships of war , well manned and also well furnished with guns and artillery
and welcomed and saluted the Dukes grace not only with pleasant and loving words
but also with trumpets shames and shooting of great pieces of ordinances that it was
great wonder to hear the great noise of the same gun's and so conducted
the Dukes ship
to
[ the Ryce Banke
by Calles , whereas
they of
The Castle   and also
The Ryce Banke
saluted and shot great pieces of ordinance and so
welcomed the Dukes Grace likewise
to Callys,  whereas
he lay off
Thursday
at night and
Friday
all day, and of
Friday at night caused a trumpet to be sounded and proclamation to be made every
man to dislodge and to attend upon the Dukes Grace where as he camped iij English
miles off
on Callys in a place called
Cakewell by Peplyng
within
the English
Pale
and there camped Saturday all night and of
Sunday the 6th day of
July ,  we removed from
thence to a town called
Whitsonby
on the seaside within the french king's dominion,
where  we camped till Friday.
[ blank in manuscript ] (
English Pale - Invaded Land controlled by English
forces )
( It's really irritating that the name of Adam Outlawe's "The Duke's
Flag Ship" is blank! .. but it is interesting the guy writing the diary
knew exactly who Adam Outlawe was!  )
We may be able to determine the name of the ship since it was the ship
that carried the Duke of Suffolk, Sir Anthony Brown and the other lords and
wanted to signal to Lord Admiral (probably John Dudley ) and the Admiral of Flanders
which ship they were on i.e. the "flag ship".  So the possible flag
ship would have been most likely The
Mary
Rose ,
Peter Pomegranate
or the
Henry Grace à Dieu
This ship may have been
The Mary Rose -
The Mary Rose and the Cowdray Engravings
The Sister ship was
Peter Pomegranate
- It had a
tonnage
of 450 when first built, but in 1536 it was rebuilt and enlarged to a tonnage of
600; at that date the name was shortened to
Peter
(Catharine had fallen
out of grace; she died in 1536).
The other great shipp was
Henry Grace à Dieu
- ("Henry Grace of God"), also known as
Great Harry , was an
English
carrack
or
" great
ship " of the 16th century. ...
Very early on it became apparent
that she was top heavy. She was plagued with heavy rolling in rough seas and her
poor stability impacted gun accuracy and general performance as a fighting
platform. To correct this,
she underwent a substantial remodeling in 1536
(the same year as
Mary Rose )
where height of the hull was reduced. In
this new form she was 1000 tons burthen and carried 151 guns of varying size,
including 21 of bronze, and her full crew was reduced to between 700 and 800.
Furthermore, she got an improved and innovative sailing arrangement with four
masts each divided into three sections; the forward two
square
rigged
with mainsail, topsail and topgallants and the aft two carrying five
lateen
sails
between them. This allowed for easier handling of the sails and spread
wind forces more evenly on the ship, resulting in better speed and
maneuverability and allowed better use of the heavy broadside. The only
surviving depiction of the craft (from the
Anthony
Roll ) shows this rebuilt version [ 2 ] .
Henry Grace à Dieu
saw little action . She was present at the
Battle
of the Solent
against French forces
in 1545, in which the
Mary
Rose
sank , but appears to have been more of a diplomatic vessel,
The Cowdray engravings are a set of images recording Henry VIIIs campaign in France during the summer of 1544 and the events of 19th July 1545 in
Portsmouth , the Solent and the Isle of Wight, showing the attempt by the forces of the French King, Francis 1st, to invade England and wrest the crown from Henry.
One of the most notable events that occurred during the
Battle of the Solent was the loss of
King Henry VIIIs vice flagship, the Mary Rose,
and her sinking is clearly shown in this picture.
Detail from the departure of King Henry VIII from
Calais in July 1544 with English ships in the harbour and Calais Castle
above .
The image shows the departure of King Henry VIII from Calais in July 1544. There are identifiable features in the landscape and high on the hill to the south of Calais, in the top right-hand section of the image, is
Sir Anthony Browne greeting King Henry VIII with these events being witnessed by many of their troops.
Importantly, in the foreground of this image as there is also a four masted ship, which is equipped with nine guns on its main gundeck, each fitted with lidded gunports.
The fifth gun on the port side is being fired, probably in announcement of the ships arrival at Calais.
It is not unreasonable to suppose that because the loss of the Mary Rose was an important event shown in the Portsmouth painting,
Sir Anthony Browne would have required an image within the set of paintings which depicted the Mary Rose as she had been before she sank.
This is therefore most probably the last Tudor image made of the Mary Rose afloat.
King Henry VIII followed by Sir Anthony Browne and Sir Charles Brandon 1st Duke of Suffolk
Mary Rose
-
...
Very little is known of the
identity of the men who served on the Mary Rose, even when it comes to the names
of the officers , who would have belonged to the gentry. Two admirals and
four captains (including Edward and Thomas Howard, who served both positions)
are
known through records, as well as a few ship masters ,
pursers ,
master gunners and other specialists. Of the vast majority of the crewmen,
soldiers, sailors and gunners alike, nothing has been recorded....
The
Mary Rose
would have carried a captain, a master responsible for
navigation, and deck crew.
The fact that Adam Outlawe was the master of this ship must
have been a highlight of his career in the Navy.

Suffolk and Browne to Henry VIII .
R. O. Winchester reports that he has letters from Mr. Halle declaring that the wagons, lymoners and mares out of Flanders will be at Calais tomorrow, as by Halle's letters to the Privy Council will appear.
Have with their whole number departed from Calais this Saturday
because of the scarcity of horsemeat (of which they wrote yesterday) and to leave the town clear against Henry's coming, which they think should now be "the rather the better," and they trust he will here find nothing lacking.
Are tonight encamped at Cawkewell
and will tomorrow night lodge in the enemy's ground between Marguison and the sea, 10 miles from Calais, as they wrote yesterday.

Have presently received letters from my lord of Norfolk, my lord Privy Seal and Mr. Treasurer, and (being very sorry to see them in that need)
have concluded to
send 400 or 500 tun of beer , to be conveyed by Flemings, under conduct of the writers' soldiers, to St.
Omer's , and thence to their camp under conduct of theirs. For this, Gage departs tomorrow early, to Calais. Will also send them such money as can here be spared, and will rather strain folks here than see them lack, "considering their journey importeth a great matter, and their return without anything doing should not sound all to your Majesty's honor." Enclose their letters.

Suffolk, Gage and Browne to Henry VIII. -
Yesterday, received [letters] from the Privy Council [showing] that
Henry intends to set forth hitherwards on Friday next. (fn. 14) Expect he will reach Calais in seven or eight days.
All victuals are in good order, and of carriage there shall be no lack. The ordnance is arrived and nearly unshipped, but the great pieces will require time to mount. All men are come except those out of Suffolk, Essex and those parts, and such as are appointed to attend the King from Dover.
Departed from Calais so soon in order to spare the English Pale against his coming,
seeing that there is no hay left, old or new, and, if the grass were spoiled, great lack would ensue at the coming home. Departed when their number was still very small and they had only 14 small pieces and one barrel of powder; but now their number is increased and they have, as instructed, laid 1,000 men at
Guisnes, and 600 to defend the East Pale, and now they must send horsemen to St. Omer's to conduct the money appointed to be sent to Norfolk and the lord Privy Seal. By the Council's said letter they are directed to march to Boleigne and begin the siege, leaving the King's own band to tarry for him at
Calais.

Suffolk, Gage and Browne to [Norfolk] -
Have considered his Lordship's letters and despatched them to the Council. Understand by his trumpet that he marvels that he has received no letters from them since their arrival on this side the sea. If it had been so they could not much blame him; but they have written to him once or twice every day.
As to his relief with victuals they despatched
80 tun of beer ,
and trust that it is received . Have written divers times to know what he wants, so that they may make a staple at Sainct Omer's for him. Albeit he never wrote that he lacked bread, or anything but drink, so that no great store of wheat was sent,
they sent 500 qr. of malt, with brewers . After speaking with Jeronimus on Sunday last,* despatched him within one hour to his Lordship, thinking that at the approach to Monsterell he should be there to effect what he had devised. Marvel that he is not yet arrived. "We also understand by your trumpet that the Great Master keepeth no promise with you, which seemeth to us to mean somewhat more than we can now divine. For the situation of
Monstrell, the strength of the same and the power that is in it we understand, as well by your letters as by your said trumpet, that the same is nothing so easy to be besieged nor to be had as the King's Majesty hath been informed, and can for our parts say nothing to it, but beseech God to send you as good speed as we would wish ourselves.

...
The news that a French fleet had put to sea,
in the autumn of 1544 , in order to cut off communication between
Boulogne and England, brought
a new honour for Sir Thomas Seymour. He was appointed Admiral of the
King's Navy with instructions to convey a great quantity of provisions to Boulogne.
This accomplished, he was ordered to station the warships in mid-channel, and at the
same time, if possible, to ' appoint a convenient numbre of the small shallopps and other small vessels to passe in the
River Estaples, and there burne and bring away suche vessells of thenmies as may be there found, or do such
other annoyaunce to thenmies as the tyme will serve.'
On the
6th of November 1544 Seymour
wrote to the Council advising that he should attack the coasts of Brittany
... A violent storm spoilt an intended attack
on some of the enemy's ships which were
lying at Dieppe and in the Seine, and, being obliged to take recourse to the open sea,
his ships were so battered that the next day he reached the Isle of Wight with only part of the fleet,
all the boats having been lost during the night .
The king, being quick to anger, evidently conveyed his dissatisfaction at the failure of the enterprise to the
admiral through the Privy Council. Thus, on
the 13th of November, Seymour wrote to the Council that he had
received their letters and 'perseve be the same that I am thought neglegent in the accomplechement of the Kynges
Heynes plesur.
This action appears to be the cause of Adam Owtlawe's
death in 1544....

It is interesting in inspection of the ship
Great Nicholas of Bristol
John
Tebowrow   "Teborow"
appears to be John Husee
and Lord Lisle's man .  John Husee, was a solicitor and servant of the
Lisles' . It is interesting who
Lord
Lisle was then : (Vice Admiral of the Navy and Illegitimate son of Edward IV ).
So John Tebowrow  served as witness to the inspection of the
ship for Lord Lisle
Interestingly Adam Outlawe lived in the Tower Ward  along with
Lord
Admiral John
Dudley
,
Lord
Lisle Plantagenet 's
stepson by his first wife and
William Gonson the Paymaster of the
Navy   , much Later the Trinity Navy House would move to Tower
Street Ward (1793-6)
Book 2,
Ch. 27 -
Tower Ward
A New History of London (pp. 668-671)
Trinity House .
About the middle of Water-lane, on the west side, stands the Trinity house,
belonging to the fraternity of the Holy Trinity in the parish of Deptford Strond.
This society was founded in the year 1515, by Sir Thomas Spert, knt.
comptroller of the navy to Henry VIII.
for the regulation of seamen and the
convenience of ships and mariners on our coasts. ...
I've
checked and the records of the Trinity Mariners Guild were destroyed in the
great London fire of 1666 so that might have told us where Adam Outlawe was in
the Mariner hierarchy , But it is clear that he was very high up if he was
inspecting a ship with Thomas Spert the comptroller and lived in the same ward
as William Gonson he must have been important.

( Sir Francis Bryan
was
a distinguished
diplomat ,
soldier ,
sailor ,
cipherer ,
man
of letters , and
poet .)
(Henry VIII)
England Under The Tudors
Sir Francis Bryan
(d. 1550)
(early-fifties in 1543)
SIR FRANCIS BRYAN*
(b. 1490 - d. 1550), poet,
translator, soldier, and diplomatist, was the son of Sir Thomas Bryan, and
grandson of Sir Thomas Bryan, chief justice of the
common
pleas
from 1471 till his death in 1500. His father was knighted by
Henry
VII
in 1497, was 'knight of the body' at the opening of
Henry
VIII 's reign, and repeatedly served on the commission of the peace for
Buckinghamshire, where the family property was settled. Francis Bryan's mother
was Margaret, daughter of Humphry Bourchier, and sister of John Bourchier, lord
Berners. Lady Bryan was for a time governess to the princesses
Mary
and
Elizabeth , and died
in 1551-2.
Anne Boleyn is stated to have been his cousin ; but we have
been unable to discover the exact genealogical connection. 1
In 1526  he lost an eye
in a
tournament
at
Greenwich ,
and had to wear an eye-patch from then on. Bryan was a second cousin of both
Anne
Boleyn
and
Jane
Seymour . No portrait of Sir Francis survives.
Catherine
Howard
married
Sir Francis's mother's brother, so was a cousin also .
Sir
Francis returned to favour
following Cromwell's demise, becoming
vice-admiral
of the fleet .
In 1543 , on the appointment of
John
Dudley, Lord Lisle
as admiral,
Bryan
was made vice-admiral
because of  his experience in sea matters  .
As a member of the privy council Bryan took part in public affairs until the
close of
Henry VIII 's
reign, and at the beginning of
Edward
VI 's reign
he was given a large share of the lands which
the
dissolution of the monasteries
had handed over to the crown . He fought, as a
captain of light horse, under the
Duke
of Somerset
at Musselburgh 27 Sept. 1547, when he was created a knight
banneret.
Mr
Clere is likey Sir John Clere
(b. 1511 - d. 1557)   - The Cleres inherited
Blickling
Hall
and estate in the late 1500s.
The previous owners were the Boleyn
family ,
relatives of Anne Boleyn
the second wife of Henry VIII.
Edward
Clere had been knighted by Elizabeth I in 1580 and the family was extremely

1611.
His widow was forced to sell the house.

(age 36 in 1544)
4th son of Sir John Seymour
and
brother of Jane Seymour & Edward Seymour . His connections ensured his promotion, and he quickly won the favour of the King, who gave him many grants of land and employed him in the royal household and on diplomatic missions abroad. From 1540 to 1542 he was at Vienna, and in 1543 in the Netherlands, where he served with distinction in the war against France, holding for a short time the supreme command of the English army.
In 1544 he was rewarded with the post of master of the ordnance for life, becoming admiral of the fleet a few months later, in which capacity he was charged with guarding the Channel against French invasion.
Thomas
Seymour , 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley
- ...
Thomas also bribed a man
called John Fowler, one of
King
Edward VI 's closest servants, from whom he received information that the
King frequently complained about the lack of pocket money he received. Thomas
smuggled money to the King
and began to voice open disapproval of his
brother's administrative skills.
As Lord High Admiral, he was able to control
the English navy , and he openly asked people for support in case of a coup.
As
admiral, he also encouraged piracy , after bidding to capture the pirate
Thomas
Walton (Pirate) , Thomas Walton instead made an agreement for a share of all
booty seized by him. He was completely and thoroughly indiscreet in his bid for
power.
Then there's Mary Seymour who for a time was held at Wexford Ireland:

Mary was also believed to have been removed to
Wexford ,
Ireland
and
raised under the care of a Protestant family there,
the Harts,
who had been engaged in piracy off the Irish coast under the protection of a
profit sharing arrangement with Thomas Seymour . A lozenge-shaped ring
inscribed "What I have I hold" reputed to have been an early gift to
Thomas by his brother Edward passed down through her descendants the
Seymour-Harts up to at least 1927.
Edward
Seymou r was the senior political figure in the reign of

John Martyred at St. Thomas Waterings, Southwark, 12th July, 1541.
- David
Gunston was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1540 and was condemned to death
by an Act of Parliament in 1541 for denying the authority of the King in
spiritual matters.
He was hanged, drawn and quartered at St. Thomas'
Waterings, Southwark on 12 July 1541 .
July 7, 1539 ,
Henry VIII had unsuccessfully required the English
knights in Malta to disavow the authority of the Pope .
David
Gonson
was received into the English Auberge at Malta - on 20th October,
1533, and submitted his "proofs of nobility"; for each applicant for
admission as a Knight of justice must produce proofs of gentle birth, of
legitimacy, of good health, and of good character. David could prove his right
to bear the arms of Gonson quartering Tussell, Walter, Beckett, Young and
Colfax. He was the fourth son of
William
Gonson
by his marriage with Bennet Walter, sister and heiress of John
Walter.
William Gonson was a Gentleman Usher of the King's Chamber and later
became responsible for the naval administration of this country. In one
contemporary record he is called Vice-Admiral and Paymaster of the Navy.
He
did at one time command ships but his principal work was covered by the later
title "
Treasurer of Marine Causes ," and he is so described in the
Gonson pedigree.
David's eldest brother Benjamin was "Surveyor of all
our Shippes" in 1546
and "
Treasurer of Marine Causes " in
1549 .
Benjamin Gonson
- was born Abt. 1506 in Deptford, Kent, England,   (he would have
been 37 in 1543)
Benjamin's Daughter Katherine married Sir John Hawkins , the famous sea captain.
The name Gonson was pronounced as if Goonson, and was sometimes written Gunston.
It is as
Sir David Gunston that the knight is found in the list of English
Martyrs .
He was hanged, drawn and quartered at Southwark (London) on 12 July
1541
under the English Act of Supremacy. Blessed
David was one of the older
sons of Admiral William Gunson , sometime
Treasurer of the Navy and
Esquire of the Body to King Henry VIII.
The martyr's father, in fact, was
William Gonson,
captain of the 'Mary Grace' in 1513
and subsequently
Paymaster of the
Royal Navy . William Gonson's correspondence is plentifully scattered up and
down among the state papers of the reign of Henry VIII.
A letter to Cromwell
mentions his wife in 1536. She died in 1544 . Apart from this and his friendship
with Cromwell 10 , Lord Lisle and other important officials, there is
nothing personal that can be gathered from these letters.
The death of his son did not affect William Gonson's
position.
He obtained a grant of arms 11
under Henry VIII. His
profession is portrayed by the symbolism of a gun between two anchors.
A brass was erected in the church of
Melton
Mowbray , Leics., to the memory of Christopher Gonson and his wife Elizabeth
in 1543 by Bartholomew, Rector of the same church, his son. The inscription
states that they had another son William, who was Esquire of the Body to King
Henry VIII 12 . He was, of course, the father of the subject of our
enquiry. He named one of the King's ships the 'Christopher Gonson' - doubtless
after his own father. Elizabeth Gonson of this brass was the daughter and heir
of Roger Trussell of Essex.
William
Gonson, Treasurer of the Navy , was the father of Benjamin Gonson , also
Treasurer of the Navy and the Grandfather of Dame
Katherine Gonson who married
Sir John Hawkins,
who held the office of Treasurer from 1573, when
Benjamin Gonson resigned in favor of his son-in-law, until his death in 1595.
Admiral
Sir John Hawkins
(also spelled as
John Hawkyns ) ( Plymouth
1532  12 November 1595) was an English shipbuilder, naval administrator and
commander,
merchant ,
navigator ,
and
slave
trader . As treasurer (1577) and controller (1589) of the
Royal
Navy , he rebuilt older ships and helped design the faster ships that
withstood the
Spanish
Armada
in 1588. ... The first Englishman recorded to have taken slaves from
Africa was
John
Lok , a London trader who, in 1555, brought to England five slaves from
Guinea .
A second London trader taking slaves at that time was William Towerson whose
fleet sailed into Plymouth following his 1556 voyage to Africa and from Plymouth
on his 1557 voyage. Despite the exploits of Lok and Towerson, John Hawkins of
Plymouth is widely acknowledged to be
the pioneer of the English
slave
trade , because he was the first to run the
Triangular
trade ,
making a profit at every stop. ... John Hawkins formed a
syndicate of wealthy merchants to invest in the slave trade.
In 1595 he accompanied his second cousin
Sir
Francis
Drake , on a
treasure -hunting
voyage to the
West
Indies , involving two unsuccessful attacks on
San
Juan . During the voyage they both fell sick. Hawkins died at sea off
Puerto
Rico . Drake succumbed to disease, most likely dysentery, on January 27, and
was buried at sea somewhere off the coast of Porto Belo.

Sebastian
Newdigate  (Nedygate) dies in the Tower for denying the King's supremacy
-
Arrested on 25 May, 1535, for denying the king's supremacy, he was thrown
into the Marshalsea prison, where
he was kept for fourteen days bound to a
pillar, standing upright, with iron rings round his neck, hands, and feet .
There
he was visited by the king
who offered to load him with riches and
honours if he would conform.
He was then brought before the Council, and sent
to the Tower, where Henry visited him again . His trial took place, 11 June,
and after condemnation he was sent back to the Tower. With him suffered Blessed
William Exmew and Blessed Humphrey Middlemore.
Sebastian
Newdigate
He was a younger son of
John Newdigate
of Harefield
Place, Middlesex,
king's sergeant , and Amphelys, daughter and heiress of
John Nevill of Sutton, Lincolnshire. He was educated at Cambridge, and on going
to Court became and
intimate friend of Henry VIII and a privy councillor
Sebastian Newdigate (died c. 1535) was a Roman Catholic priest and
Carthusian monk, of England
The
Carthusian Order, also called the Order of St. Bruno ,
is a Roman
Catholic religious order of enclosed monastics. The order was founded by Saint
Bruno of Cologne in 1084 and includes both monks and nuns. The order has its own
Rule, called the Statutes, rather than the Rule of St Benedict, and combines
eremitical and cenobitic life.

So What's a Shallop?
The Shallop

Captain John Smith
Chesapeake National Historic Trail - National Park Service
In the 1600s, the word shallop referred to an open wooden workboat
such as a barge, dory, or rowboat. Shallops were small enough to row but also
had one or two sails.
Captain John Smiths shallop could carry 15 men.  It was probably
about 30 feet long and 8 feet wide. It drew less than 2 feet of water, which was
important for navigating the shallow waters of the Chesapeake Bay and many of
the tributaries. Like most English boats of the period, the shallop was built of
oak planks fastened together with wooden pegs. It had at least one mast and one
or two sails made of hemp canvas.
Like a barge,
a shallop could carry heavy cargos in shallow water .
John Smith described his boat as open barge neare three tuns
burthenwhich meant it could carry up to three tons of cargo. Its exact
shape and style remain a mystery.  - 
it could be powered by oars or
sails, travel in deep or shallow waters, and was light enough to pull ashore .
In calms, its mast could be lowered and stowed inside the boat.

France
Henry's reign marked the birth of English naval power and was a key factor in
England's later victory over the Spanish Armada
Henry VIII and Scotland
-
In 1543 Henry wrote A declaration of the cause of war with Scotland
in which he justified why war against James V was just and why England had a
right to subdue the Scots.
In December 1543 the Scottish Parliament abrogated the treaties it had signed
with England but reaffirmed those Scotland had signed with France. Henry sent
the Earl of Hertford and an army to the Scottish borders. Tthey destroyed
whatever they could so that the region could not support a landing by the French
if one took place in 1544.
The show of force was sufficient for some nobles
to swear allegiance to Henry. In September 1545, another attack by the English
on the Borders also destroyed crops and farms.

Queen Elizabeth I in Norfolk 1578 - Star Chamber -
Woodhouse vs. Outlawe
Here, Evidently there was some trouble between the Woodhouse's and King's
Lynn and The Outlawe's - a star chamber was a serious situation and notice this
is happens when QEI makes her trip thru Norfolk in 1578 and stays with the
WoodHouse family at Kimberley and Henry's the Vice Admiral and he and brother
Roger are Knighted and all - don't mess with the Queen's favorites! : I love the
bit for their "Stubborn answers" a 100 pound fine!
While this was going on, in 1578 the reason for the journey from London,
QEI was avoiding an epidemic....
1578 -
The
epidemic of 1578 at Norwich
was a far more serious one than that of the
capital, and
was traced to the visit of the Queen: " the trains of her
majesty's carriage, being many of them infected, left the plague behind, which
afterwards increased so and continued as it raged above and three-quarter years
after."

their Lordships advice [they had]
made choice of one that had lately been noted before them in the Sterre (Star)
Chamber , for some

THE QUEEN IN NORFOLK .
The Queen made several provincial tours. She visited Suffolk (July 1561) and
Norfolk (August
1578) , when her "progresses" were
unusually extended.
At the end of July 1578 she stayed at Long Melford and Hawsted; on the 7th of August her Majesty entered
Bury St. Edmunds, and Euston on the 10th . Great preparations were made at Norwich for her reception, and workmen were brought
from Lynn and Yarmouth to assist. Thomas Churchyard, in the service of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, was for three weeks busily
engaged arranging the masques, ceremonies, and festivities. ...
Richard Outlaw  -
Pursuivant for Queen Elizabeth I
,and  he had a son, William
Outlaw.
Although "priest hunters" were considered a surly bunch,
however, Richard Outlaw along with Colyer and
Anthony Atkinson
were "noted"
Pursuivant's, or the manager's of the other "surly ones". Also Richard
attends the Elizabeth's Council at York, so he must have been respected and
presentable. York was the center of the catholic problem and plots of the time.
See Lord Sheffield's note.
This was a time of Transition, QEI would pass away along with William
Cecil, Francis Walsingham and Richard Topcliffe, to be replaced by his son
Robert Cecil. James I Stuart son of Mary Qeen of Scots, would take power.

Sir Francis Walsingham dies... .
Sir
Francis Walsingham
-  (c. 1532  6 April 1590)
is
usually
remembered as the " spymaster "
of
Queen
Elizabeth
I of England .
Walsingham is frequently cited as one of
the earliest
practitioners of modern intelligence both for
espionage
and for domestic security.
He oversaw operations which penetrated the heart
of
Spanish
military preparation, gathered intelligence from across
Europe ,
and disrupted a range of plots against the queen, securing the execution of
Mary,
Queen of Scots . Walsingham was one of the small coterie who directed the
Elizabethan
state, overseeing foreign, domestic and religious policy, and the subjugation of
Ireland . He
worked to bring
Scotland
and England together. Overall, his foreign policy demonstrated a new
understanding of the role of England as a maritime,
Protestant
power in an increasingly global economy. He was an innovator in exploration,
colonization and the use of England's potential maritime power. He is also a
convincing prototype of the modern bureaucrat. ... In the realm of
counter-espionage ,
Walsingham was behind the discovery of the
Throckmorton
and
Babington
plots
to overthrow Elizabeth I,
return England to Catholicism and place
Mary,
Queen of Scots , on the throne.
One of the people Richard Outlawe would have known and worked with early
on was Sir Francis Walsingham but all the records for Richard Outlawe are after
Walsingham's death in 1590 ,  after that he would have worked for spymaster
Robert Cecil :
1590 -
Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury
- was made
Secretary
of State
following the death of
Sir
Francis Walsingham
in 1590, and he became the leading minister after the
death of his father in 1598, serving both
Queen
Elizabeth
and
King
James
as Secretary of State. ... He a protégé of
Sir
Francis Walsingham
(Elizabeth's principal spymaster), he was trained by them
in matters of spycraft as a matter of course.  For most of his working life
he served as spymaster for King James.
1592-
William Cecil,
1st Baron Burghley
-
He collapsed (possibly from a stroke or heart attack) in 1592 . Before
he died,
Robert, his only surviving son by his second wife , was ready to
step
into his shoes as the Queen's principal adviser . Having survived all his
children except Robert and Thomas,
Burghley died at his
London
residence
on 4 August 1598
1593 -
Christopher Marlowe
- the foremost
Elizabethan
tragedian [ 2 ] ,
next to
William
Shakespeare , he is known for his
blank
verse , his overreaching
protagonists ,
and
his mysterious death . -
A warrant was issued for Marlowe's arrest on 18
May 1593 . No reason for it was given, though it was thought to be connected
to allegations of blasphemya manuscript believed to have been written by
Marlowe was said to contain "vile heretical conceipts."
He was
brought before the
Privy
Council
for questioning on 20 May, after which he had to report to them
daily. Ten days later, he was stabbed to death by
Ingram
Frizer . Whether the stabbing was connected to his arrest has never been
resolved. [ 3 ]

Father Henry
Walpole ,
... He was asked to return to England in 1593.
The
Jesuit, his brother and an English soldier sailed together
on
a French
ship headed for Scotland because the southern ports of England were closed
because of the plague . On
Dec. 4, 1593 , the three passengers were put ashore
at
Flamborough Head, Yorkshire , after 10 days of stormy sailing, but
separated on land.
Father Walpole was resting at an inn 10 miles inland when
he was arrested for being a priest ; he had been betrayed by a fellow
passenger who was earning money to buy his way out of prison.
One night of freedom in England was followed by 16 months of imprisonment.
Walpole admitted during his first interrogation that he was a Jesuit and had
come to England to convert people.
He was transferred to York Castle for
three months , and was permitted to leave the prison to discuss theology with
Protestant visitors.
Then he was transferred to the Tower of London at the end
of February, 1594, so that the notorious priest-torturer Richard Topcliffe
could wrest information from him . Walpole was tortured brutally on the rack and
was suspended by his wrists for hours, but Topcliffe stretched the tortures out
over the course of a year to prevent an accidental death.
Walpole endured torture 14 different times before being
returned in 1595
to York to stand trial under the law that made it high treason for an Englishman
simply to return home after receiving Holy Orders
abroad. The man who had
once aspired to be a lawyer defended himself ably, pointing out that the law
only applied to priests who had not given themselves up to officials within
three days of arrival. He himself had been arrested less than a day after
landing in England, so he had not violated that law. The judges responded by
demanding
that he take the Oath of Supremacy, acknowledging the queen's complete authority
in religion . He refused to do so and was convicted of high treason.
On April 7, Walpole was dragged out of York to be executed along with another
priest who was killed first. Then the Jesuit climbed the ladder to the gallows
and asked the onlookers to pray with him. After he finished the Our Father but
before he could say the Hail Mary, the executioner pushed him away from the
ladder; then he was taken down and dismembered. The Jesuits in England lost a
promising young priest whom they had hoped would take the place of Father
Southwell; they received another example of fidelity and courage.
Richard Topcliffe
- (14 November 1531 
1604 [ 1 ] )
was a landowner and
Member
of Parliament
during the reign of
Elizabeth
I of England . He became notorious as a
priest-hunter and torturer
and was
often
referred to as the Queen's principal
"interrogator" .
Topcliffe entered the service of the Queen's secretary,
William
Cecil
in the 1570s, and worked for
Sir
Francis Walsingham
and the
Privy
Council .
Topcliffe was a fanatical persecutor of Catholics and the
Catholic
Church , and was involved in the
interrogation
and
torture
of many priests and laity, at a time when all Catholics were accused of actively
seeking to overthrow the ruling
Anglican
establishment of England in order to return England to Catholicism.
Topcliffe gained a reputation as a
sadistic
torturer who frequently played mind games with prisoners under interrogation. [ 2 ]
He claimed that his own instruments and methods were better than the official
ones, and was authorized to create a
torture
chamber
in his home in
London .
He also involved himself directly in the execution of sentences of death upon
Catholic
recusants ,
which involved
hanging,
drawing and quartering .

Sir
Thomas Grosvenor
1594/5, Jan. 17 -
Signifies the
death of Gravener the very same Monday after the pursuivant went from
Northampton , and therefore
before Topcliffe's arrival
on Friday to view his state of body,
etc . He died like a dumb dog, never showing by utter show one to name God or to think upon God. As well when there was no likelihood of death as when there appeared danger, he would turn his face from the sound of God, and being wished to pray to himself in his own prayers, shunned both the advice and the act himself, so as
no appearance of anything but treason to God and to the Queen was discerned to lurk in
him . He was buried immediately by the Mayor, and
a Coroner's quest did sit upon
him , but I being somewhat acquainted with the malice of his church, presume to wish that his body may be taken up again and opened and his stomach examined, thinking some proof will fall out in that act to
show that he took poison at Berwick, when he did perceive that he did lie in the net
there . It is a resolution taught in the Church to such as to whom they commit these desperate acts and practices, I have found often.
Now, if I may be bold to say it, there remaineth only to know this Gravener's whole heart to enforce his familiar to utter all the secrets that Gravener or the
Earl of Tyrone
did impart to him ( Hailes , the elder, I mean)a man less savouring of loyalty, obedience, honest religion and humanity than ever I did see, even very red fire itself, and worth seeing and also worth hearing to discern the fury of the Catholic opinion. And it will prove no lost labour, for assuredly by hearsay you cannot believe that disloyalty we simple commissioners do see by their fury expressed, being put to trial. And
that is our grief, and mine especially, that we are often taken to be cruel.

God is the witness of all . Northampton, 17 Jan. 1594 . From: ' Cecil

at midnight,
Outlaw, another pursuivant , was sent to search a house in or about
Winsley Wood , and there he met
Anthony Atkinson ,
the searcher of
Hull , who had brought with him thirty men.
They entered the house, and after breaking down walls and otherwise damaging the place,
arrested Mr Warcop, Jno. Sadler, two menservants, and Father Alexander
Rawlings , who were all afterwards imprisoned. - THE BLOCKHOUSES OF

Anthony

Catholic
nobleman from
Derbyshire .
The plot grew out of two originally separate plans.
The first involved a
Spanish
invasion of England with the purpose of deposing Elizabeth and replacing her
with Mary; the second was a plot by English Catholics to assassinate Elizabeth.
However, both plots were under the guidance of two of Mary's chief agents in

Elizabeth I dies - 24 March - The Queen's health remained fair
until the autumn of 1602, when a series of deaths among her friends plunged her
into a severe depression. In February 1603, the death of
Catherine
Howard, Countess of Nottingham , the niece of her cousin and close friend
Catherine,
Lady Knollys , came as a particular blow. In March, Elizabeth fell sick and
remained in a "settled and unremovable melancholy". [ 192 ]
She died on 24 March 1603 at
Richmond
Palace , between two and three in the morning. A few hours later, Cecil and
the council set their plans in motion and proclaimed
James
VI of Scotland
as king of England

James I of England

James survived
two conspiracies in the first year of his reign, the

Lord
Lieutenant of Yorkshire

Vice-Admiral
of Yorkshire
from 1604 to 1646.
He was created
Earl
of Mulgrave
in 1626.
In
1588 he commanded the White Bear, one of the queen's ships, in the defeat of the
Spanish Armada . Suspicions of his religion caused by the fact that
he had
married a catholic
were said to be the cause of his ill-success. Yet he seems to
have been suspected very unjustly, and a letter from the north in 1599 praises
his zeal in apprehending priests. He will undertake any service against the
papists, for God hath called him to a very zealous profession of religion.
He
also interested himself in colonization, and was a member of the councils of
the Virginia Company (23 May 1609) , and of
the New England Company
(3
Nov. 1620). In the latter capacity
he was one of the signers of the first
Plymouth patent on 1 June 1621

Blackfriars Playhouse
... Shakespeare and the Blackfriars Theatre - The Elizabethan Playhouse
In 1600, Richard Burbage leased the Blackfriars to Henry Evans for 21 years for £40 per annum, but
in August 1608, Richard Burbage took back the lease from Evans, and William Shakespeare and other King's men players became part owners of what was to become the Blackfriars Playhouse.
William Shakespeare bought a house a short walk away from Blackfriars theatre in Ireland Yard.
The acting troupe performed at Blackfriars during the winter months while continuing to spend the summers at the Globe.
In 1619 the local residents again tried to close the theatre but due failed due to the intervention of the Privy Council.

Blackfriars Playhouse - originally a Dominican Monastery
The Blackfriars Playhouse Theatre was located in the City of London on the site of a dissolved 13th-century Dominican monastery.
The original Dominican monastery was built in 1275 and was located between the River Thames and Ludgate Hill.
...
The First Blackfriars Theatre
In 1538 the Dominican monastery of Blackfriars was closed due to the dissolution of the monasteries by King Henry
VIII . The monastery estates, which consisted of many different buildings on a vast area of land, were divided up and sold or leased.
In 1576, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, some of the buildings were leased to Richard Farrant who was Master of the boy choristers called the Children of the Chapel Royal.
During the Elizabethan era the young boy members of the choirs were also encouraged to participate in drama. These troupes were called Children's companies. These children doubled as child actors and the buildings were used for play rehearsals and private performances prior to the 'Chapel Children' acting troupe performing at court. This was, therefore, the first Blackfriars theatre. The whole district retained the name and when the old refectory was turned into the theatre, the name was used to define its location.
Plays were staged there until 1584 when the first 'Blackfriars Theatre' was closed due to various objections from City
officials .

Blackfriars
Theatre , was considered the greatest of the Elizabethan actors. At The
Globe Theatre he was the principal player in many of Shakespeares plays.

The Blackfriars Theatre.
...
In 1596, another part of the old Blackfriars was bought by James Burbage,
owner of the Theatre and father of famed actor Richard Burbage , for £600
from the estate of Cawarden, late Master of Revels. This set of rooms, cellars,
and yards was near the Pipe office, next to the house of Sir George Cary.
Burbage
spent an enormous sum to convert these rooms into a private indoor playhouse.
The residents of Blackfriars got an injunction against the theatre being used by
an adult troupe and
Burbage had to lease the playhouse to children's
companiesaround 1597, the Chapel Children are found in residence .
Richard Burbage, the principal actor with the
Chamberlain's
Men , Shakespeare's company, inherited the second Blackfriars Theatre in 1597 .
In 1600, he leased it to Henry Evans at an annual rate of £40, for a term of
21 years, and the children's performances continued. The Children of the Chapel
were renamed Children of Queen Annes Revels after the accession of
James
I
in 1603.
After the performance of
Eastward Ho
(1605), a collaboration between
Jonson, Marston, and Chapman,
the Children lost their royal patronage,
because of a passage about Scots in Act III which offended King James so much
that he had the authors briefly imprisoned.
The playhouse ceased to be productive, and Burbage took back the lease from
Evans .
In 1608, Burbage, along with actors from his company, formed a company of
housekeepers, or owners, and began to use the playhouse. The King's Men, as the
Chamberlain's
Men
were now known, played at the Blackfriars during the winters . Later
works by Shakespeare, as well as works by
Beaumont
and
Fletcher , were
performed there.
In 1619, Blackfriars residents again tried to close the theatre, citing it as a
public playhouse, but the Privy Council intervened and confirmed its use. The
King's Men performed there without interruption until the closing of the
theatres with the English Civil War in 1642.

' the Guild of Merchants of the blessed Virgin of Cambridge ', and it augmented its funds by small-scale trading, (fn. 41) but it cannot be regarded as a Guild Merchant of the chartered type. By 1337 it had five chaplains. (fn. 42) In 1352 by royal grant it was allowed to coalesce with the Guild of Corpus Christi to found a college, (fn. 43) and Henry of Lancaster, the cousin of Edward III, was chosen alderman of the joint
guild.
THE GUILD OF CORPUS
CHRISTI , in St. Bene't's Church, was in a thriving condition in 1349 when it is first mentioned. Its minutes for 135061 are preserved, (fn. 45) but give no details of the union with St. Mary's Guild, or of the foundation of the college. They allude to the performance of a play, The Children of Israel, in 1353. (fn. 46) There is no evidence of its existence later than 1371 and it is not named in the Chancery certificates of 1389. Miss Bateson suggested that its extinction might be associated with the rising of

Gonville and Caius is the fourth-oldest college at the University of
Cambridge and the third-wealthiest.   The College was first founded,
as
Gonville Hall , by
Edmund
Gonville , Rector of
Terrington
St Clement
in
Norfolk
in 1348, making it the fourth-oldest surviving college. When Gonville died three
years later, he left a struggling institution with almost no money. The executor
of his will,
William
Bateman ,
Bishop
of Norwich , stepped in, transferring the college to the land close to the
college he had just founded,
Trinity
Hall , and renamed it
The Hall of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin
Mary , endowing it with its first buildings.
By the sixteenth century, the
college had fallen into disrepair, and in 1557 it was refounded by Royal Charter
as Gonville and Caius College by the physician
John
Caius .

Emmanuel College, Cambridge
-
The college was founded in 1584
by Sir
Walter
Mildmay
on the site of a
Dominican
friary. Mildmay, a
Puritan ,
originally intended Emmanuel to be a college of training for
Protestant
preachers to rival the successful
Catholic
theological schools that had trained
Dominican
friars for years.
Emmanuel graduates had a large involvement in the settling of North America. Of
the first 100
university
graduates in New England, one-third were graduates of Emmanuel College.
Harvard
University , the first college in
The
United States , was named after
John
Harvard
(B.A., 1632), who was an Emmanuel graduate. Early Emmanuel men
included several translators of the 1611 Authorised Version.

Jesus College, Cambridge
- The College was founded in 1496 on the site of a
Benedictine
nunnery by
John
Alcock , then
Bishop
of Ely . It has been traditionally believed that the nunnery was turned into
a college because the nunnery had gained a reputation for
licentiousness .
St Radegund
- She is the patron saint of Jesus College Cambridge, which was founded on the
site of the twelfth-century nunnery of Saint Mary and Saint Radegund.  John Alcock
is chiefly remembered as the founder of Jesus College (1496). He provided for
this by suppressing the nunnery of St Radegund and appropriating the buildings
and revenues of the nunnery to the use of the new college.

Bewitched
- The churches of the Witchinghams
It is to Little Witchingham that you go to
find
one of the finest sets of wall-paintings in
Norfolk.
They appear to
date from the first half of the 14th century ,
during that great flowering of artistic endeavour that would be cruelly brought
to an end by the Black Death, which killed perhaps a half of the population of
East Anglia. Indeed, in a fascinating aside, the guide book theorises that the
south nave wall has been prepared for painting, but that this never happened.
Perhaps the pestilence intervened, and as at
Kersey
in Suffolk left in evidence the Dog That Didn't Bark.
On the south wall, the wall paintings depict the
Passion of Christ, and what is probably a panoply of the Apostles. On the west
wall, too indistinct to make out now, were doctrinal paintings; the Three Living
and the Three Dead, illustrative of the transitoriness of earthly wealth, and
what may have been Christ in Majesty. Looking at them, I couldn't help thinking
that they are assertive of orthodox Catholicism, and perhaps they were evidence
of an even earlier date for my proto-reformation?
The south aisle is more curious; on the outer
wall are fragments of figures and scenes that could be anything, but as one
appears to show a ram caught in a thicket, and another a
King and Priest side
by side , perhaps they are episodes from the Old Testament.
These are
unusual subjects for a 14th century painting,
but even stranger are the huge
roundels set above the pillars on the south side of the arcade. They depict the
symbols of the Evangelists, and quite frankly they look so Victorian that they
might easily have come from high in the roof of some 19th century Brighton
Anglo-catholic citadel.
But the Victorians did not know
about any of these paintings. We know this because this church was little-used
even then, and by the start of the 20th century it was abandoned. In 1967, the
enthusiastic art historian Eve Baker found it ruinous, roofless, and full of
elder trees and ivy. The story goes that she climbed in through one of the empty
windows, began stripping away ivy and found that the whitewash came off with it,
revealing marvellous things. Thanks to the Norfolk Churches Trust, a plan of
repairs was put in place, and the wall-paintings properly excavated in the early
1970s. This perfect little church is now in the care of the Churches
Conservation Trust. I told my companion, Tom Muckley, that
I thought Little
Witchingham church a magical place.
Tom wondered if I would have found it so
magical if it had just been another struggling Anglican church, and I guess he
is probably right.

Photos of Saint Dunstan, Stepney, Middlesex
Saint
Dunstan is the parish church of Stepney
and the mother church of the
East End. Its ancient dedication of Saint Dunstan and All Saints was revived in
1896. The bells in the tower feature in the nursery rhyme
Oranges and Lemons
- "... when will that be, say the bells of Stepney."
In the 16th century the riverside hamlets of Stepney became London's 'Sailortown'
and
St Dunstan's became known as the Church of the High Seas.
It was here
that seafarers gathered for blessings of their voyages.
Until the 1950s all
UK births, marriages and deaths at sea were registered in this parish.
Registers from 1586 are housed at the
London
Metropolitan Archives
and post July 1837 at The Family Records Centre.
The
Red Ensign, flag of the Merchant Navy, still flies from the tower and the church
contains several memorials to Admirals and men of the Merchant and Royal Navy
Fleets. The unusually spacious and leafy churchyard was enlarged in the 1600s
for the burials of Plague victims. In a period of 18 months 6583 died in the
parish and in September 1665, 154 were buried in one day. Only a few tabletop
tombs from the 18th century remain but the churchyard was once crowded with the
graves of seaman, captains, merchants of the East India Company and clergy.

Spain's Hall - Essex
Spains Hall
is an
Elizabethan
country
house
near
Finchingfield
in
Essex .
Spains Hall has been a family home for nearly ten centuries.
Named after Hervey de Ispania who held the Estate after the Norman Conquest,
Spains Hall has been in continuous occupation by only three families ever since.
The present house dates from the early 15th century when the
Estate passed to the Kempe family on the marriage of Margery de Ispania to
Nicholas Kempe. The front you see today was built in 1585 and in 1637 the house
was beautified by Robert Kempe with Dutch gables and silver leaded drainpipes,
the restoration of which won a Heritage award in 1977. Allegedly,
Robert
Kempe was knighted by Cromwell in front of the house in 1641 .
The last of the Kempe male line is said to have been killed
by robbers and in 1760 the Estate was purchased by Samuel Ruggles, a clothier
from the nearby town of Bocking. His descendents, the Ruggles-Brise family,
still live in the house today.

A visitors guide to the inland village of
Salle in Norfolk . Blink
and you could well miss the itzy-bitzy village of Salle, which is as
neat as a
button; It has a truly huge church for such a small
place, which echoes with the cries of rooks, who erupt from its tower
like a plume of smoke.
Inside is a brass for Geoffrey and Alice Boleyn
(1440)
anncestors of the Boleyns
or Bullens who
lived in the
village as early as 1318, before acquiring Blickling
Hall . Anne Boleyn
was of course the ill fated wife of Henry VIII who was executed by her
husband after having been found guilty of adultery and incest with her
brother George Boleyn.
It has been rumoured that Anne Boleyn is buried at
this church ...

St Michael, Great Cressingham
The church of
Cressingham-Magna
is an uniform building of flint, boulder, &c. and copings of free-stone, consisting of a nave, north and south isles, and a chancel all covered with lead, and is dedicated to St. Michael;
the nave is about 48 feet long, and, together with the isles, about 42 feet wide, the vault of the nave is supported by pillars, each formed of 4 pilasters joined together, which bear up 8 neat arches, four on each side, and as many windows over them; the roof is of oak, having principals whereon are carved the effigies of bishops, priests, &c. At the west end of the nave stands the tower, of the same materials as the church, with a wooden cap covered with lead, and a weathercock thereon; in this tower hang four modern bells: in this tower (fn. 20) is a bell-sollar, or place for the ringers; such places were in ancient time frequently erected by the gifts of
well disposed persons, for the greater convenience and decency of their processions, that the priest and people coming in at the western door might not be any way incommoded by the ropes and
ringers.
While the glass at Great Cressingham is not well-known, even more of a secret is the fact that this church has no fewer than five figure brasses, with the inlays for a couple more. They are all late medieval. The two best are probably those for Thomasina and Richard Rysle, who died in 1497. These 45cm figures are perfect miniatures. Twice as tall is William Eyre, who wears a colar with IHC on it. His wife's figure is now missing, as is another figure which must have been a mourning son. Very curiously, the inscription underneath has been trimmed at both ends, probably as a result of the two figures being removed, but also possibly to remove the Catholic prayer clauses. The best of the figures, though, is the Priest John Aborfeld, in full eucharistic vestments of the early years of the 16th century, when time was running out for the English Catholic Church

as closely as possible to how it would have been in Victorian times and now run
free historical school days. [ 5 ]

It
must be said that I already knew that
Ringland church
was the most important
church in Norfolk
which still had to make its way onto the pages of this
website. There may be bigger churches, there may be more famous ones, but none
so artistically and historically significant as St Peter.
The Church has 3 isles and a chancel, a square tower and 5 bells.

THE ABBEY OF WEST DEREHAM
Hubert Walter , dean of York, who afterwards became successively bishop of
Salisbury and
archbishop of Canterbury , founded at
his birthplace of
West Dereham , in the year
1188 , an
abbey for
Premonstratensian canons , which was
colonized from Welbeck. The canons were to pray for the souls of the founder and
his parents, his brothers and sisters and all his relatives and friends, as well
as for the souls of Ralph de Glanville, justiciary of England, and Bertha his
wife. (fn. 1)
King John, on 7 September, 1199, confirmed all the grants made to the abbey by
the founder and by other early benefactors; at the same time, at the request of
the
founder, who was then
archbishop of Canterbury , he conferred on the abbey
and its tenants exemption from all kinds of service, tolls and dues. (fn. 2) In
the same year John granted to the abbey a weekly Wednesday market, and an annual
fair of four days, namely on the festival of St. Matthew and the three following
days, (fn. 3) and
in 1201, the
king confirmed to them the grants of
half the
church of Holkham and of the
church of Ringland .
