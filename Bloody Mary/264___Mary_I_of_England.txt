Lost and Found heroes II

Lost and Found heroes
Today my Aunty Sarah and Uncle Richard went into Manhattan to collect our camera we lost in the
Museum
of Natural History. We can't believe our luck that it was found and handed in. The people at the Museum lost and found have been
lovely , and whoever handed the camera in is wonderful. Christopher (on the right) emailed my Daddy to tell us that it had been found, thank you all very much. Uncle Richard is going to post it to us and I can start blogging with photos again!

Dexter
This week Mummy's friend Connie has been visiting. She is
Dexter 's Mummy.
He is a bit older than me and knows how to sit up and crawl and eat his own food so I've been learning alot. Dexter has also been learning alot from Stan, mainly how to through tamtrums, scream and say no repeatedly. Because I am quite a
big
baby I am about as big as Dexter and we look like twins! I am the baby on the left. Oh and this picture is of me breastfeeding and not Dexter.

We're back
Well, we're back from America. The flight was slightly shorter and Stanley slept all the way! I preferred not to so my Mummy and Daddy didn't really get any sleep. When we got to Grandma and Grandad's in
Sandbach
they slept for ages while Stan and I entertained the Grandparents. A slightly fraught car trip back to Glasgow and we were home! Even though the aeroplane trips were a little troublesome it was great to see Uncle Richard , Aunty Sarah and Cousin Lucy. Since we've been back we have been talking to them on the
computer
which is almost like being in their house, without the extra cuddles, Easter chocolate and 6 o'clock gin and tonics. We haven't had chance to blog until now because Daddy has been away in
Bristol
and we haven't had a camera to take pictures.

Non-white food
For the last few days my Mummy has been feeding me
food
that isn't white. It's a bit thicker as well so I can't just slurp it I have to use my tongue. It's much harder to
eat
but there are a variety of tastes with non-white food. I also seem to sleep lots more. Instead of needing food every two hours in the night I slept last night from 11pm to 6:30am. The flight back home will of course completely change this new
sleeping
pattern.

(Possibly) our last day
Today is possibly our last day here. We are supposed to be flying later tonight but there is a big
storm
off the coast and it's been raining now for about 10 hours so the plane might not take off! We will miss Lucy and Uncle Richard and Aunty Sarah lots when we go and I am not looking forward to saying goodbye. I guess my trains back home will be pleased to see me and Butch and Buster will be able to come out of the
cattery /concentration camp they are in at the moment. At least we should be able to say hello on the web camera when we get back home.

Brunch party
After breakfast Lucy's friends,
Evie
and
Jude , came around to play. Their respective Mummies and Daddies came along as well. Jude brought his trains and cars which I immediately decided were for me to play with. A bit of bartering (with parental
mediation ) meant that he could play with my trains and cars. The parents mostly drank
Bloody Mary
and
Bucks Fizz
and ate
pie .

Breakfast bar
Today I ate breakfast with Lucy at the
breakfast
bar. The stools were a little too high so we opted for under-the-stool seating.

Uncle Richard
Staying in America is lots of fun, especially as I have had lots of cuddles with my Uncle Richard. He is very good at holding me whilst Mummy eats yet more
ice cream . (I think Auntie Sarah is a bad influence! but she is 35 weeks pregnant and ice cream is very good for babies aparantly.) I think Uncle Richard is practising his cuddles on me for when his new baby arrives next month, so far I would give him 10 out of 10!

Fire!
I am very upset. On
Friday night
four fire engines came and parked outside my bedroom window and my Mummy and Daddy didn't wake me up. They did mutter something about waking at 5am at the slightest sound but not when sirens blared.

Run!
Yesterday we went to the
Museum of Natural History
in Manhattan. We all loved it, Lucy ran around lots,
Freddie was awestruck as he looked out from his baby carrier and I was mainly sulky. Well I did enjoy some of it, like the cafe and the steps outside the museum and the
shop
where I bought a dinosaur. I did really enjoyed the slide and play area in Central Park. I didn't want to go in the end. Unfortunately Daddy "misplaced" the camera in the museum so we don't have any photos. We have to borrow
Lucy 's photos for our blog.

Scream!
On Friday we went to Jocky Hollow (see Lucy's
blog
for more photos) to have a walk in the woods. I have been here before but as I was only four months old at that time I don't really remember it. I won't show any photos of the walk because all us children had a round of tag-screaming. Freddie started with a full hour of screaming in the car on the way, then I took over for another hour after I was woken up too early. Then Lucy followed our lead and carried on until we got back to the car.
But then we went to a local pub and everyone had chips so we were all happy. The Mummies were happy because they got deserts with enough calories for a week and the Daddies were happy because they got to colour in with crayons.

Webcam
Yesterday Lucy got a
webcam . This will mean that we can still see each other when we go back to Scotland. I will need to see how she is going with the
tantruming
I have taught her while I've been here.

Playing
It was very
rainy
yesterday so we couldn't go for a walk to the park so we went in the cars to meet Lucy's Daddy for lunch in a Mexican restaurant. I had chips...mexican style.
Then we went to a wonderful play area yesterday called
Funtime Junction
there were lots of toys and a huge climbing frame and soft play area and ball pit and cars and trucks and....every toy you could imagine.
I did have to wait my turn to get on the fire engine but it was certainly worth it. Lucy and I played on the bouncy trampoline a lot and I also played with the cars.
But best of all was
hitching
a ride on the back of this fire truck while a little girl did all the work pulling me along. P.S.
Lucy's blog
has lots of photos of our visit as well.

Dada
Today we went to the
Art Museum
in nearby Montclair.
We had a look around the gallery where we found some funny hats and some paintings of
cars
and a
house
and what looked like the
inside of a train
and a
lady
with not many clothes on. Aunty Sarah's favourite was
this
but I couldn't see a laughing boy in there.
This
was Daddy's favourite painting because he can't wait till he is old and has time to read the newspaper again. After we looked at the paintings we made our own picture. It consisted of drawings of trains together with glue covered purple paper.
I was mainly influenced by the work of
Stuart Davis . To add surrealism to cubism we made it into a hat. Lucy has been influenced more by the
Dada
movement (and the related Mama movement) so she sat at the art table, picked up pieces of paper, moved them around and then left. It was very inspiration to watch. PS The Star Wars fans among you might be able to spot the
Jawa
in the background.

Five today
Hello everyone, sorry I haven't been blogging much from America but Stan has been
hogging
the computer. Anyway I thought I'd put up a quick post to say that I am
five months
old today. I also ate
banana
for the first time as well, it's been quite a day. This is another photo of me, in the bath, with Cousin Lucy helping to show me how to play with her
bath toys .

Cappuccilli
After a run around the gardens we went for brunch at
Raymond's Diner
in Montclair. the Mummies and Daddy (Lucy's Daddy has to go to
work
today) thought we might all be asleep by now so they could have a coffee in peace but we were all too excited to sleep. My Mummy wanted a cappuccino but the waiter had trouble understanding her
accent
so he brought her a cup of chilli! I thought Freddie might like to chew
Murdoch , my new train, but the paint started coming off so Mummy thought it wasn't such a good idea. Lucy and Freddie were very interested in each other and spent most of the time just staring at one another.

Van Vleck Gardens
Today we went for a wee walk to a nearby
house and garden . Lucy and I ran around a lot on the lawn. There weren't many flowers yet but it was still very nice and there were lots of different trees.
Our parents thought it would be good to have a nice photo of us on a little bench. After a few
near misses
we just about got a photo which was worth keeping.

Reading with Aunty Sarah
This morning Aunty Sarah read one of my favourite stories to me and Cousin Lucy,
Hairy Maclary . She was very good at reading and had lots of
funny voices .

Foxy
Look how big my ears are! I'm pretending to be a
fennec fox
who was asleep in the hole behind us. He normally lives in a desert but is visiting the Bronx on holiday. Mummy and Aunty Sarah also want to be foxy ladies.

Skyfari
At the zoo today we went on a Skyfari. This is a tiny little tin can attached to a wire, way way up in the air. Somehow it stayed up there. I think Daddy was a bit
nervous
but I wasn't. The
white knuckles
you can see are just because it was cold.

Zoo II
For the second time in a week we went to a zoo. This time it was the
Bronx Zoo
which is quite a long way from Chester Zoo. Lucy drove us there which was nice because her Mummy was a bit tired. Lucy is better at driving on the interstate anyway. The first thing we saw was a huge Tiger. I tried to stroke it but then realised that there was a pane of glass in the way. It was quite similar to our cat Buster but Mummy said that it probably didn't leave hairs all over the sofa and bring dead mice into the house. Next we saw a whole flock of
flamingos
but we had to move on quickly because Aunty Sarah's coat was getting them very excited.
Lucy liked the goats a lot even if they were a bit tall for her. We both liked the peacocks except when they spoke which was a bit like Freddie crying very loudly.
Lucy also found herself in the middle of the prairie dog field. She kept popping up out of nowhere. Here's a picture of us all at the zoo on the way home, a little bit tired and emotional but very happy.
