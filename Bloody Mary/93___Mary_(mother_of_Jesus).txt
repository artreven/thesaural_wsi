Archeologists discover a branch of the Lascaux cave complex hidden behind a pile of rubble and are suprised to find a wall painting that unambiguously depicts an alien visitor waiting for his partner to sit on a pose ball. The painting is thought to prove that not only did aliens walk amongst us more than 17,000 years ago, but that they fought off boredom by dancing in virtual worlds. The irony that humans survived and aliens did not is completely lost on the scientific community.
