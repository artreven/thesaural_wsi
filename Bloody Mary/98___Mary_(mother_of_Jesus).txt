Does Christmas Stocking Size Matter? Christmas (IPA: /krɪsməs/) is an annual holiday that
celebrates the birth of Jesus. It refers to both the
day commemorating the birth, and also the
Christmastide season which that day inaugurates,
concluding with the Feast of the Epiphany. The date
of the celebration is traditional, and is not
considered to be Jesus' actual date of birth.
Christmas festivities often combine the observation
of the Nativity with various cultural customs, many
of which have been influenced by earlier winter
festivals. Although nominally a Christian holiday,
it is also observed as a cultural holiday by many
non-Christians. On the other hand, there are some
Christian denominations, like Jehovah's Witnesses,
certain Seventh Day Adventist churches, and the
Living Church of God, whose members do not, as a
rule, celebrate Christmas.
In most places around
the world, Christmas Day is celebrated on December
25. Christmas Eve begins at the evening of the
preceding date, December 24. In Germany and some
other countries, the main Christmas celebrations
commence on Christmas' Eve. The day following
Christmas Day, December 26, is called Boxing Day in
the United Kingdom and many countries of the
Commonwealth, and called St. Stephen's Day or the
Feast of Saint Stephen in Catholic countries. The
Armenian Apostolic Church observes Christmas on
January 6. Eastern Orthodox Churches that still use
the Julian Calendar celebrate Christmas on the
Julian version of 25 December, which is January 7 on
the more widely used Gregorian calendar, because the
two calendars are now 13 days apart.
The prominence of Christmas Day increased
gradually after Charlemagne was crowned on Christmas
Day in 800. Around the 12th century, the remnants of
the former Saturnalian traditions of the Romans were
transferred to the Twelve Days of Christmas (25
December – 5 January). Christmas during the Middle
Ages was a public festival, incorporating ivy,
holly, and other evergreens, as well as gift-giving.
Modern traditions have come to include the
display of Nativity scenes, holly and Christmas
trees, the exchange of gifts and cards, and the
arrival of Father Christmas or Santa Claus on
Christmas Eve or Christmas morning. Popular
Christmas themes include the promotion of goodwill
and peace.
Etymology
The word
Christmas
originated as a
contraction of "Christ's mass". It is derived from
the Middle English
Christemasse
and Old
English
Cristes mæsse,
a phrase first
recorded in 1038, compounded from Old English
derivatives of the Greek
christos
and the
Latin
missa . [1]
In early Greek versions of the New Testament, the
letter
Χ
(chi), is the first letter of
Christ. Since the mid-16th century
Χ , or the
similar Roman letter
X , has been used as an
abbreviation for Christ. [2]
Hence,
Xmas
is often used as an abbreviation for
Christmas.
After the conversion of
Anglo-Saxon
Britain in the very early 7th
century, Christmas was referred to as
geol , [1]
the name of the pre-Christian winter festival from
which the current English word ' Yule '
is derived. [3]
The Nativity
German painting, 1457
The
Nativity of Jesus
refers to the Christian belief
that the
Messiah
was born to the
Virgin Mary . The story of Christmas is based on
the
biblical accounts
given in the
Gospel of Matthew , namely
Matthew 1:18 - Matthew
2:12
and the
Gospel of Luke , specifically
Luke 1:26 - Luke
2:40 . According to these accounts, Jesus was
born to Mary, assisted by her husband
Joseph , in the city of
Bethlehem . According to popular tradition, the
birth took place in a "stable", surrounded by farm
animals, though neither the “stable” nor the animals
are mentioned in the Biblical accounts. However, a
"manger" is mentioned in Luke 2:7 where it states
"She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a
manger, because there was no room for them in the
inn." Early iconographic representations of the
nativity confirm that the stable and manger were
located within a cave (which still exists under the
Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem) [4] .
Shepherds from the fields surrounding Bethlehem were
told of the birth by an
angel , and were the first to see the child. [5]
Christians believe that the birth of Jesus fulfilled
many prophecies made hundreds of years before his
birth. Two major studies are J Gresham Machen "The
Virgin Birth of Christ" and Peter Sammons "The Birth
of Christ" (latter published 2006).
Remembering is a central way that Christians
celebrate Christmas. There is a very long tradition
of the
Nativity of Jesus in art . The Eastern Orthodox
Church practices the
Nativity Fast
in anticipation of the birth of
Jesus, while much of the
Western Church
celebrates
Advent . In some
Christian denominations , children perform plays
re-telling the events of the Nativity, or sing
carols that reference the event. Some Christians
also display a small re-creation of the Nativity,
known as a
Nativity scene , in their homes, using figurines
to portray the key characters of the event. Live
Nativity scenes, and
tableaux vivants
are also performed, using
actors and live animals to portray the event with
more realism. [6]
Nativity scenes traditionally include
the Three Wise Men , Balthazar, Melchior, and
Caspar, although their names and number are not
referred to in the Biblical narrative, who are said
to have followed a star, known as the
Star of Bethlehem , found Jesus, and presented
gifts of
gold ,
frankincense , and
myrrh . [7]
In the U.S., Christmas decorations at
public buildings
once commonly included Nativity
scenes. This practice has led to many lawsuits, as
groups such as the
American Civil Liberties Union
believe it
amounts to the government endorsing a religion,
which is prohibited by the
United States Constitution . In 1984, the
U.S. Supreme Court
ruled in
Lynch vs. Donnelly
that a Christmas display
(which included a Nativity scene) owned and
displayed by the city of
Pawtucket, Rhode Island
did not violate the
First Amendment. [8]
History
Pre-Christian origins
Main article:
List of winter festivals
A winter festival was traditionally the most
popular festival of the year in many cultures.
Reasons included less agricultural work needing to
be done during the winter, as well as people
expecting longer days and shorter nights after the
winter solstice
in the
Northern Hemisphere . [9]
In part, the Christmas celebration was created by
the early Church in order to entice pagan Romans to
convert to
Christianity
without losing their own winter
celebrations. [10] [9]
Certain prominent gods and goddesses of other
religions in the region had their birthdays
celebrated on
December 25 , including
Ishtar , Babylonian goddess of fertility, love,
and war,
Sol Invictus
and
Mithras . Modern Christmas with pagan customs
include: gift-giving and merrymaking from Roman
Saturnalia ; greenery, lights, and charity from
the
Roman New Year ; and Yule logs and various foods
from
Teutonic
feasts. [11]
Such traditions are considered to have been
syncretised
from winter festivals including the
following:
Natalis Solis Invicti
Main article:
Sol Invictus
Mosaic of Jesus Christ depicted as Sol
(the Sun god) in Mausoleum M in the
pre-fourth-century necropolis
under
St Peter's Basilica
in
Rome . It is named
Christo Sole
(Christ the Sun) and is dated to the
late 3rd century by the Italian
archaeologists. [12]
The Romans held a festival on
December 25
called
Dies Natalis Solis Invicti , "the birthday of
the undefeated sun." The use of the title
Sol Invictus
allowed several
solar deities
to be worshipped collectively,
including
Elah-Gabal , a Syrian sun god;
Sol , the god of Emperor
Aurelian
(AD 270–274); and
Mithras , a soldiers' god of
Persian
origin. [13]
Emperor
Elagabalus
(218–222) introduced the festival,
and it reached the height of its popularity under
Aurelian, who promoted it as an empire-wide holiday. [14]
December 25 was considered the day upon which the
winter solstice , which the Romans called
bruma , fell. [15]
(When
Julius Caesar
introduced the
Julian Calendar
in 45 BC,
December 25
was approximately the date of the
solstice. In modern times, the solstice falls on
December 21 or 22.) It is the day the Sun proves
itself to be "unconquered" and begins its movement
toward the north on the horizon. The Sol Invictus
festival has a "strong claim on the responsibility"
for the date of Christmas, according to the
Catholic Encyclopedia. [1]
Several early Christian writers connected the
rebirth of the sun to the birth of Jesus [16]
"O, how wonderfully acted Providence that on that
day on which that Sun was born . . . Christ should
be born",
Cyprian
wrote. [1]
Yule
Main article:
Yule
Pagan
Scandinavia
celebrated a winter festival called
Yule, held in the late December to early January
period.
Yule logs
were lit to honor
Thor , the god of thunder, with the belief that
each spark from the fire represented a new pig or
calf that would be born during the coming year.
Feasting would continue until the log burned out,
which could take as many as twelve days. [9]
In pagan
Germania
(not to be confused with
Germany ), the equivalent holiday was the
mid-winter night
which was followed by 12 " wild
nights ", filled with eating, drinking and
partying. [17]
As
Northern Europe
was the last part to
Christianize, its pagan celebrations had a major
influence on Christmas. Scandinavians still call
Christmas
Jul . In English, the Germanic word
Yule is synonymous with Christmas, [18]
a usage first recorded in 900.
Christian origins
Origen , a father of the Christian
church, argued against the celebration
of birthdays, including the birth of
Christ .
It is unknown exactly when or why
December 25
became associated with Christ's
birth. The
New Testament
does not give a specific date. [19]
Sextus Julius Africanus
popularized the idea
that Christ was born on December 25 in his
Chronographiai , a
reference book
for Christians written in AD 221. [16]
This date is nine months after the traditional date
of the
Incarnation
( March
25 ), now celebrated as the
Feast of the Annunciation .
March 25
was considered to be the date of the
vernal equinox
and early Christians believed
this was also the date Christ was
crucified . The Christian idea that Christ was
conceived on the same date that he died on the cross
is consistent with a Jewish belief that a prophet
lived an integral number of years. [20]
The celebration of Christmas as a feast did not
arise for some time after
Chronographai
was
published.
Tertullian
does not mention it as a major
feast day
in the
Church of Roman Africa . In 245, the theologian
Origen
denounced the idea of celebrating
Christ's birthday "as if he were a king
pharaoh ". He contended that only
sinners , not
saints , celebrated their birthdays. [21]
The earliest reference to the celebration of the
nativity on December 25 is found in the
Chronography of 354 , an
illuminated manuscript
compiled in Rome in 354. [1] [22]
In the East, early Christians celebrated the birth
of Christ as part of
Epiphany
(January 6), although this festival
focused on the
baptism of Jesus . [23]
Christmas was promoted in the Christian East as
part of the revival of
Catholicism
following the death of the pro- Arian
Emperor
Valens
at the
Battle of Adrianople
in 378. The feast was
introduced to
Constantinople
in 379, and to
Antioch
in about 380. The feast disappeared
after
Gregory of Nazianzus
resigned as
bishop
in 381, although it was reintroduced by
John Chrysostom
in about 400. [1]
The
Twelve Days of Christmas
are the twelve days
from the day after Christmas Day, December 26, which
is
St. Stephen's Day , to the
Feast of Epiphany
on
January 6
that encompass the major feasts
surrounding the birth of Christ. In the Latin Rite,
one week after Christmas Day,
January 1 , has traditionally been the
celebration the
Feast of the Naming and Circumcision of Christ ,
but since
Vatican II , this feast has been celebrated as
the Solemnity of
Mary, Mother of God .
In some traditions the 12 days of Christmas start
on Christmas Day (25 December) and the 12th day is
therefore 5 January.
Middle Ages
Adoration of the
Magi
by
Don Lorenzo Monaco
(1422).
In the
Early Middle Ages , Christmas Day was
overshadowed by Epiphany, which in the west focused
on the visit of the
magi . But the Medieval calendar was dominated by
Christmas-related holidays. The forty days before
Christmas became the "forty days of St. Martin"
(which began on
November 11 , the feast of
St. Martin of Tours ), now known as
Advent . [24]
In Italy, former Saturnalian traditions were
attached to Advent. [24]
Around the 12th century, these traditions
transferred again to the
Twelve Days of Christmas
( December
26
–
January 6 ); a time that appears in the
liturgical calendars as
Christmastide
or
Twelve Holy Days . [24]
The prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually
after
Charlemagne
was crowned Emperor on Christmas Day
in 800. King
Edmund the Martyr
was anointed on Christmas in
855 and King
William I of England
was crowned on Christmas
Day 1066. By the
High Middle Ages , the holiday had become so
prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where
various magnates celebrated Christmas.
King Richard II
of England hosted a Christmas
feast in 1377 at which twenty-eight oxen and three
hundred sheep were eaten. [24]
The
Yule boar
was a common feature of
medieval Christmas feasts.
Caroling
also became popular, and was originally
a group of dancers who sang. The group was composed
of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided
the chorus. Various writers of the time condemned
caroling as lewd, indicating that the unruly
traditions of Saturnalia and Yule may have continued
in this form. [24]
"Misrule" — drunkenness, promiscuity, gambling — was
also an important aspect of the festival. In
England, gifts were exchanged on
New Year's Day , and there was special Christmas
ale. [24]
Christmas during the Middle Ages was a public
festival that incorporating
ivy ,
holly , and other evergreens. [25]
Christmas gift-giving during the Middle Ages was
usually between people with legal relationships,
such as tenant and landlord. [25]
Excerpt from
Josiah King 's
The Examination and
Trial of Father Christmas
(1686),
published shortly after Christmas was
reinstated as a holy day in
England .
From the Reformation
into the 1800s
During the
Reformation , some
Protestants [ who? ]
condemned Christmas celebration as "trappings of
popery " and the "rags of the Beast." [26]
The
Roman Catholic Church
responded by promoting the
festival in a more religiously oriented form.
Following the
Parliamentarian
victory over
King Charles I
during the
English Civil War , England's
Puritan
rulers banned Christmas, in 1647. [26]
Pro-Christmas rioting broke out in several cities,
and for weeks
Canterbury
was controlled by the rioters, who
decorated doorways with holly and shouted royalist
slogans. [26]
The
Restoration
of Charles II in 1660 ended the ban,
but many clergymen still disapproved of Christmas
celebration.
In Colonial America, the
Puritans
of New England disapproved of
Christmas. Celebration was outlawed in
Boston
from 1659 to 1681. At the same time,
Christian residents of
Virginia
and
New York
observed the holiday freely. Christmas
fell out of favor in the United States after the
American Revolution , when it was considered an
English custom. [27]
George Washington
attacked
Hessian
mercenaries on Christmas during the
Battle of Trenton
in 1777. (Christmas being much
more popular in Germany than in America at this
time.) By the 1820s,
sectarian
tension had eased and British writers,
including
William Winstanly
began to worry that Christmas
was dying out. These writers imagined
Tudor
Christmas as a time of heartfelt
celebration, and efforts were made to revive the
holiday.
Charles Dickens 's book
A Christmas Carol , published in 1843, played
a major role in reinventing Christmas as a holiday
emphasizing
family , goodwill, and compassion as opposed to
communal celebration and hedonistic excess. [28]
In America, interest in Christmas was revived in the
1820s by several
short stories
by
Washington Irving
which appear in his
The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon
and "Old
Christmas", and by
Clement Clarke Moore 's 1822 poem
A Visit From St. Nicholas
(popularly known
by its first line:
Twas the Night Before
Christmas ). [29]
Irving's stories depicted harmonious warm-hearted
holiday traditions he claimed to have observed in
England. Although some argue that Irving invented
the traditions he describes, they were widely
imitated by his American readers. The poem
A
Visit from Saint Nicholas
popularized the
tradition of exchanging gifts and seasonal Christmas
shopping began to assume economic importance. [30]
In her 1850 book "The First Christmas in New
England",
Harriet Beecher Stowe
includes a character who
complains that the true meaning of Christmas was
lost in a shopping spree. [31]
Christmas was declared a United States Federal
holiday in 1870, signed into law by President
Ulysses S. Grant .

bringers of gifts

Main article:
Santa Claus
Originating from Western culture, where the
holiday
is characterized by the exchange of
gifts
among friends and family members, some of
the gifts are attributed to a character called
Santa Claus
(also known as
Father Christmas ,
Saint Nicholas
or St. Nikolaus,
Sinterklaas , Kris Kringle, Père Noël,
Joulupukki ,
Babbo Natale ,
Weihnachtsmann ,
Saint Basil
and
Father Frost ).
The popular image of
Santa Claus
was created by the German-American
cartoonist Thomas Nast (1840–1902), who drew a new
image annually, beginning in 1863. By the 1880s,
Nast's Santa had evolved into the form we now
recognize. The image was standardized by advertisers
in the 1920s. [32]
Father Christmas, who predates the Santa Claus
character, was first recorded in the 15th century,
but was associated with holiday
merrymaking
and
drunkenness . [33]
In Victorian Britain, his image was remade to match
that of Santa. The French
Père Noël
evolved along similar lines,
eventually adopting the Santa image. In Italy, Babbo
Natale acts as Santa Claus, while
La Befana
is the bringer of gifts and arrives on
the eve of the
Epiphany . It is said that La Befana set out to
bring the baby
Jesus
gifts, but got lost along the way. Now,
she brings gifts to all
children . In some cultures Santa Claus is
accompanied by
Knecht Ruprecht , or
Black Peter . In other versions,
elves
make the
toys . His wife is referred to as
Mrs. Claus .
The current
tradition
in several
Latin American
countries (such as
Venezuela ) holds that while Santa makes the
toys , he then gives them to the
Baby Jesus , who is the one who actually delivers
them to the children's homes. This story is meant to
be a reconciliation between traditional
religious beliefs
and modern day
globalization , most notably the
iconography
of Santa Claus imported from the
United States .

and
Switzerland , the
Christkind
( Ježíšek
in Czech, Jézuska in Hungarian and Ježiško in
Slovak) brings the presents. The German St. Nikolaus
is not identical with the Weihnachtsman (who is the
German version of Santa Claus). St. Nikolaus wears a
bishop 's dress and still brings small gifts
(usually candies, nuts and fruits) on
December 6
and is accompanied by
Knecht Ruprecht . Although many
parents
around the
world
routinely teach their
children
about
Santa Claus
and other gift bringers, some have
come to reject this practice, considering it
deceptive. [34]
Christmas tree and
other decorations
Main article:
Christmas tree
A toy bear christmas decoration.
The Christmas tree is often explained as a
Christianization of
pagan
tradition and ritual surrounding the
Winter Solstice, which included the use of
evergreen
boughs, and an adaptation of pagan
tree worship . [35]
The English language
phrase "Christmas tree" is
first recorded in 1835 [33]
and represents an importation from the
German language . The modern Christmas tree
tradition is believed to have begun in Germany in
the 18th century [35]
though many argue that
Martin Luther
began the tradition in the 16th
century. [36] [37]
From Germany the custom was introduced to England,
first via
Queen Charlotte , wife of
George III , and then more successfully by
Prince Albert
during the reign of
Queen Victoria . Around the same time, German
immigrants introduced the custom into the United
States. [38]
Christmas trees may be decorated with
lights
and
ornaments .
Since the 19th century, the
poinsettia
has been associated with Christmas.
Other popular holiday plants include
holly ,
mistletoe , red
amaryllis , and
Christmas cactus . Along with a Christmas tree,
the interior of a home may be decorated with these
plants, along with
garlands
and
evergreen
foliage.
In
Australia ,
North
and
South America , and to a lesser extent
Europe , it is traditional to decorate the
outside of houses with lights and sometimes with
illuminated
sleighs ,
snowmen , and other Christmas figures.
Municipalities often sponsor decorations as well.
Christmas banners may be hung from
street lights
and Christmas trees placed in the
town square. [39]
In the
Western world , rolls of brightly-colored paper
with secular or religious Christmas motifs are
manufactured for the purpose of wrapping gifts. The
display of
Christmas villages
has also become a tradition
in many homes during this season. Other traditional
decorations include
bells ,
candles ,
candy canes ,
stockings ,
wreaths , and
angels .
Christmas decorations are traditionally taken
down on
Twelfth Night , the evening of
January 5 .
Christmas stamps

Christmas stamp
A number of nations have issued
commemorative stamps
at Christmastime. Postal
customers will often use these stamps for the
mailing of
Christmas cards , and they are popular with
philatelists . These stamps are regular
postage stamps , unlike
Christmas seals , and are valid for postage
year-round. They usually go on sale some time
between early October and early December, and are
printed in considerable quantities.
In 1898 a
Canadian
stamp was issued to mark the
inauguration of the Imperial Penny Postage rate. The
stamp features a map of the globe and bears an
inscription "XMAS 1898" at the bottom. In
1937 ,
Austria
issued two "Christmas greeting stamps"
featuring a
rose
and the signs of the
zodiac . In 1939,
Brazil
issued four
semi-postal
stamps with designs featuring the
three kings
and a
star of Bethlehem , an
angel
and child, the
Southern Cross
and a child, and a mother and
child.
The
US Postal Service
regularly issues both a
religious-themed and a secular-themed stamp each
year.
Economics of Christmas

Christmas Price Index
Christmas is typically the largest annual
economic stimulus for many nations. Sales increase
dramatically in almost all retail areas and shops
introduce new products as people purchase gifts,
decorations, and supplies. In the U.S., the
"Christmas shopping season" generally begins on
Black Friday , the day after
Thanksgiving , though many American stores begin
selling Christmas items as early as October. [40]
In most areas, Christmas Day is the least active
day of the year for business and commerce; almost
all retail, commercial and institutional businesses
are closed, and almost all industries cease activity
(more than any other day of the year). In
England and Wales , the
Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004
prevents all
large shops from trading on Christmas Day. Scotland
is currently planning similar legislation.
Film studios
release many high-budget movies in
the holiday season, including Christmas films,
fantasy
movies or high-tone dramas with high
production
values.
An
economists
analysis calculates that Christmas is
a
deadweight loss
under orthodox
microeconomic theory , due to the surge in
gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the
difference between what the gift giver spent on the
item and what the gift receiver would have paid for
the item. It is estimated that in 2001 Christmas
resulted in a $4 billion deadweight loss in the U.S.
alone. [41] [42]
Because of complicating factors, this analysis is
sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current
microeconomic theory. Other deadweight losses
include the effects of Christmas on the environment
and the fact that material gifts are often perceived
as
white elephants , imposing cost for upkeep and
storage and contributing to clutter. [43]
Alternative names
There are several alternative terms for
Christmas.
Crimbo
is a slang term which first appeared in
print in 1928; the variant form Crimble was first
used by
John Lennon
in a 1963
Beatles ' Fan Club Christmas single.
Xmas
is a long established abbreviation, though
it is involved in the
secularization of Christmas
debate.
Yule
is used in Northern Europe. In the USA, the
term(s) " holiday "
or "season" may be used, as addressed at
Christmas controversy .
U.S. Christmas
controversy
Main article:
Christmas controversy
Throughout the 20th century, the United States
experienced what became known as the
Christmas controversies , despite it being
declared a federal holiday on June 26, 1870 by then-U.S.
President
Ulysses S. Grant . The importance of the economic
impact of the secular Christmas holiday was
reinforced in the 1930s when President
Franklin D. Roosevelt
proposed moving the
Thanksgiving
holiday date to extend the
Christmas shopping season and boost the economy
during the
Great Depression . [44]
Religious leaders protested this move, with a
New York Times
roundup of Christmas sermons
showing the most common theme as the dangers of an
increasingly commercial Christmas. [45]
"Now it is Christmas again" (1907) by
Carl Larsson.
Some considered the U.S. government's recognition
of Christmas as a federal holiday to be a violation
of the
separation of church and state . This was brought
to trial several times, recently including in
Lynch v. Donnelly (1984) [8]
and
Ganulin v. United States (1999) . [46]
On
December 6 ,
1999 , the verdict for
Ganulin v. United
States (1999)
declared that "the establishment
of Christmas Day as a legal public holiday does not
violate the Establishment Clause because it has a
valid secular purpose." This decision was upheld by
the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals on
December 19 ,
2000 .
[47]
At the
same time, many devout Christians objected to what
they saw as the vulgarization and co-optation of one
of their sacred observances by secular commercial
society and calls to a return to "the true meaning
of Christmas" are common.
Debates about Christmas in America continued into
the 21st century. In 2005, some Christians, along
with American political commentators such as
Bill O'Reilly , protested what they perceived to
be the
secularization of Christmas . They felt that the
holiday was threatened by a general
secular trend , or by persons and organizations
with an anti-Christian agenda. The perceived trend
was also blamed on
political correctness . [48]
