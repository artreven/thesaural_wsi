Virgin of the Annunciation - The Louvre, Paris, France

This was taken inside The Louvre Museum in Paris, France. Or as they call it;
Musée du Louvre .
Everyone should visit the Louvre when in Paris, regardless of their level of  interest  in art. The building itself is  incredible , and huge. They say it would take about six days to fully explore the Louvre and all it's  exhibits. I  purposely  focused on the room because I felt it was just as  interesting  as the  sculpture. Most of my pictures while at the Louvre are of the building itself. Sadly my camera battery died shortly after entering so most of said pictures were taken by my old iPhone 3G, not the best quality . I  tried  the camera once more and was able to snap a few more pics while in this room before it shut down again.
This statue is the " Virgin of the Annunciation " . It is a wood
carving (originally polychromed), by  Nino Pisano .
The "Annunciation" refers
to the  Christian  celebration of the announcement by
the  angel   Gabriel  to
the  Virgin Mary  that she would  conceive  and
become the mother of  Jesus , the  Son of God ,
marking his  Incarnation .
Nino Pisano  ( fl.  1349 –
1368) was an Italian sculptor, the son of  Andrea
Pisano .
He collaborated with his father in
sculptures for the churches of  San
Zanipolo  at  Venice  and in  Santa Caterina  at  Pisa , and provided some
panels for the  bell tower  of  Santa Maria del Fiore .
Nino succeeded his father in the works
of the  Orvieto Cathedral  in 1349.
Works he made alone include a  Madonna
with Child  in  Santa Maria Novella , Florence, a  Saint
Bishop  in the Cathedral of  Oristano and
a  Monument to Bishop  Scherlatti  now in the
Museum of  Pisa Cathedral . His other attributed works include
a  Madonna of the Rose  in  Santa Maria della Spina  and a  Madonna
del Latte  in the Museum of St. Matthew, both in Pisa. An  Annunciation,  once
in Santa Caterina, is now in the  National Gallery of Art  in  Washington,
D.C. .
