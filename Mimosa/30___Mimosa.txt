About Becrux
This is a blog by Robert Vose of Melbourne, Australia.
I have lived in Melbourne since 2004 while writing the blogs Pharoz and Becrux.
My tertiary qualifications include a Bachelor of Science from Macquarie University with a major in computing and a Bachelor of Applied Science from Murdoch University in mathematics and statistics. I have recently completed a Graduate Certificate in Systems Engineering from RMIT.
I have lived in Melbourne since 2004 where I started writing these blogs.
Topics of interest in my blogs include understanding liberal democracies and finding a suitable and safe model for an Australian Republic, science and its relationship with religion, and finding out how to make large scale renewable energy systems sustainable. Becrux is a continuation of my previous blog
Pharoz . There are many new and novel ideas in these blogs.
By considering alternatives we open up possibilities for constructive action. These ideas are a positive contribution to public debate. All up, these posts build a vision of a positive future that is achievable.
These blogs have been selected by the
National Library of Australia
