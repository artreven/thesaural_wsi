My Experience:
Champagne.
In short, Champagne is a sparkling white wine (chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier), but the term Champagne is only to be used from wines coming from the Champagne region in France.
So other wines that are made in the same method are often marketed by descriptors like Brut, or Cuvée.
Brut is referring to how dry, or unsweet, the wine is, as explained
here .
Cuvée means that it is made from a mix of vintages, rather than single year.
Cuvée is relatively common for Champagne, but particularly good vintage are sometimes separated and made into a vintage Champagne, or millesimé.
Smells a lot like other still Chardonnays I've had, it's cold though so it's hard to pick up the scent.
Very fizzy, very dry, somewhat bitter, the liquid flutters away quickly due to being well carbonated.
It has small sparkling bubbles that rise in a gentle steady stream.
This brut is carbonated using the
Charmat method. It's not fruity at all, and has more acid than previous Chardonnays I've tried.
The taste or flavor itself is mild, and it isn't complex, it's rather one-note.
It finishes a touch more sweetly, but just a touch. I usually like sweet foods, so it's surprising that I like this so much, I think it pairs well with sweeter foods because of the contrast it provides.
Cammy Blackstone, the host of Munchcast
has a different opinion
about pairing wines with sweet/junkfood, though one of her guests agrees with me on
Episode 64 "Junk Food and Wine Pairings" While I like this, I'd love to try a Sec or Demi-Sec instead of a Brut, and compare. On it's own it's probably not something I'd drink often, but with the food (we had 4 cheese lasagna macaroni that night) it was fantastic. My wife says the water tastes sweet compared to the Brut.
She gave up on it quickly, and doesn't like its bitterness at all.
Not surprising from a juice lover. I only have one problem.
The taste kinda reminds of that one time I tried some plain club soda when I was a kid.
I hope all the effort put into this Brut makes it significantly better than plain 'ol sparkling water or tonic water.
Look for a club soda / tonic water / Fre Brut comparison in the future. We later made a
Mimosa
with this and it was fantastic! My wife actually drank it.
I'd buy again just for that.
I've always liked 7up and orange juice, but I prefer this.
I'm also interested in mixing this with a very sweet drink like Martinelli's. Works as a wine Alternative:
Absolutely.
Did I like it:
I liked it a lot, and my wife hated it absolutely.
7 out of 10. Would I Recommend it:
Yes.
You have to find out if you like this or not. It's very different from any juice you've tried Who Might Like it:
If you like it dry, this is it.
