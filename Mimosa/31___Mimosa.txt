Spring is all around me.
Date: 15 Mar 2012 By: Henya Tag: Uncategorized Comment: 5 It is becoming warmer and less rainy around here. This past Winter was very cold and wet (for Israel, of course). DS #1 even got to play with snowballs since his yeshiva is located near Yerushalayim (Jerusalem).
Still all things end and the weather is beginning to shout “Spring!” One of the most wonderful things about living in the north of Israel is that something is blooming all year around. But Spring is of course richer in all the beautiful flowers that are practically everywhere.
Here are just a few images I captured on the way to the bus stop. I always loved
Mimosa
This tiny yellow flowers were the first to show up at the Kiev market in late February. My Dad usually brought home a bunch for my Mom despite the outrageous expense. Here, in Israel, Mimosa flowers are huge and feathery, much prettier than I remembered.
This beautiful
Hibiscus
flower is the first one to bloom on it’s bush.
I love the refreshing smell of
Rosemary
and there is plenty of it growing around here. The pretty purple flowers are favorites with bees too.
And belive it or not I got yarn that almost exactly matches the colors of Rosemary in bloom. I know this yarn wants to become a vest for me. The only question is will it be knit or crochet…
And there are of course fruit too! I was able to take this photo of the top of the Fig tree.
Next to the figs oranges and lemons become practically common.
And
our Lemon tree is beginning to bloom again.
Even the rain has become more spring-like and friendly, I find that I no longer resent the rainy days.
