People Kibble: Review: Wilson Creek Almond Champagne
People Kibble
Diets seem boring, like eating Kibble constantly. I want to shake that up. Follow me on my journey to be more conscious of what I eat while still having variety in my diet. If you're searching for a specific recipe I have labeled all posts with the ingredients listed in them. To spice things up, whenever I splurge on something, or eat somewhere new I shall post a review for all to see.

Review: Wilson Creek Almond Champagne
My mum drinks champagne quite a bit. I've had some of it. It's usually the cheapest stuff you can get at the grocer's. Don't get me wrong, more expensive does not mean better (see my previous review of
Andre Cold Duck ). However, I've always found that her champagne needs to be tempered with orange juice (hello
Mimosa !). Not sure how to describe why I feel it needs to be that way, but it seems like it's too... tarte? bitter? dry? Hmm... I still haven't hit quite the right word, but you get my meaning.
Now, I love almond. Add it to anything and it makes it 100% better! So when I went to the store and saw this beautiful champagne bottle enticing me with the promise of almond I began anticipating the moment I had something to celebrate so I could uncork this beauty.
A few weeks after I noticed that such a thing as Almond Champagne existed, my father came home with a bottle of the stuff out of the blue!
After a night's worth of chilling I uncorked the bottle and poured myself and my father a glass. "Oh My Gosh"!!! The people at Wilson Creek pride themselves on the fact that people upon their first sip ever of this champagne say that phrase every time.
It is truly delicious. It is sweet with a hint of almond. Thank goodness it's not a slap of Almond to the face (even I know you can go overboard when adding almond). Most certainly not a mixer, meant to be drunk alone.
Wilson Creek Almond Champagne is a sweet (but not too sweet) and very refreshing champagne that I look forward to drinking again.

About Me
R. A. Murphy
Eclectic. Old fashioned. I want to live life, not just dodder through it afraid of my own shadow... wait, was that my shadow sneaking around behind me?
I like to write, as can be seen by my many assortments of blogs. I write in spurts, usually with long dry spells in between. There is something refreshing in the written word that captivates me. As a student of mathematics, writing is a way of my releasing my creative side.
