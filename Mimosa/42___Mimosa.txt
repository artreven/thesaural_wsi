Becrux
This is a backup site for the blog
http://becrux.net
by Robert Vose of Melbourne, Australia.
Topics of interest include Australian politics, especially the issue of finding a suitable and safe model for an Australian Republic, science and religion, as well as renewable energy systems. This blog is a continuation of my previous blog
Pharoz . There are many new and novel ideas in these blogs.
Becrux is the name of the second brightest star,
Beta Crucis , in the constellation of the
Southern Cross . It is a spectroscopic binary star.
Becrux appears on the Australian Flag as the left most star of the Southern Cross.
Another name for the star is
Mimosa . A plant endemic to eastern Australia and that is now in the Acacia genus called
Silver wattle
is also known as ‘Mimosa’. The star was apparently given this name due to its colour. One of the more curious plants of the Mimosa genus will
rapidly fold
its pinnate leaves when touched.
