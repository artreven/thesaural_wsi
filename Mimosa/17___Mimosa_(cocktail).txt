Mimosa - False Idol MIx, & Mimosa and Sleepyhead - Sexytime Mix
MiM0SA'S FALSE iD0l MiXxx
So one place where Chris and I differ in our tastes (a bit) is Chris' addiction to Glitch Hop. While I like it, generally I can take it or leave it, although it has its moments and can be great at the right time... but hey that's what's good about hanging out and listening to other people's music on long drawn out chill out sessions where time drips slowly by. However this mix
False Idol
by Tigran
Mimosa
posted on sound cloud ( download here ) in March 2010 is an exception. I absolutely love it and think its got a really powerful drive all the way through. Here's what it says on his
MySpace
page: Mimosa takes the listener on a space age psychedelic journey of
bittersweet ecstasy. Only a two year veteren of the west coast sound
movement, Mimosa is quickly making a name for himself as one of the top
west coast exports. This young producer's energy while performing is
magnetic; the word has spread fast and Mimosa has recently shared the
stage with the likes Benga, Skream, Rusko, Datsik, Glitch Mob,
ill.gates, Bassnectar and Flying Lotus, playing shows across the US and
festivals like Coachella, Symbiosis Gathering, Burning Man and Decibel
Festival.
Fans know Mimosa as someone who brings a ‘good-time’ energy that is as
fierce as it is friendly, taking them on journeys through urban chaos
and ethereal euphoria. Sexytime Mix When Mimosa is collaborating with Sleepyhead they release as Sexytime and here is another mix you can
download here
from them at
MK2 programme 38
( meme kast)- which is less up my street (more broken up and vocals) but I think Chris likes it and was going to post it up before he got relegated to the dark ages with no intra-web connection. So I'm posting it instead. Enjoy! Track List - False Idol: 1)
