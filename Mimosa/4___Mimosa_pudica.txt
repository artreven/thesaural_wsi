... cloud cupcakes for mom
Whether you make the cake from a mix, or from
scratch , this Italian meringue frosting is sure to make Mom float up to the clouds on Mother's Day! It's very easy for little ones to work with, just add two scoops with a spatula and they are done! It's like air. Like most cupcakes eating them is the fun part... just be warned... it's a mustache for all and a lot of giggles!
Italian Meringue:
1 cup granulated sugar, organic works great
1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp water
6 egg whites
1/4 tsp cream of tartar
In the mixer add 6 egg whites and 1/4 tsp cream of tartar whip till peaks stand when you form them.
Adults should do this part of the frosting: In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil, do not stir. Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature.
It is done when it reads 245 F. At this point slowly drizzle the syrup into the egg whites while mixing.
Continue to whip for about 5 minutes and then frost your cupcakes and eat right away!

giveaway forum: fairy garden kit winner!
There's nothing like a few lush blooming branches to help announce the winner of the Fairy Garden Kit Giveaway!
Thank you to everyone who participated, your comments were beautiful and inspiring... a wonderful collection of the amazing joys of motherhood.  If you haven't read over all of them,
take a peek ... especially if you are having one of those days where everything seems upside-down, you can't find your car keys and you just realized you have a stain on your shirt and a little peanut butter in your hair from making the kid's lunches in the morning... and it's now 6pm.  After you read these comments, you'll look at that stain lovingly and forget about the car keys... because really, who needs to go anywhere when you already live with the most amazing people in the world?
Now without further ado,
THE WINNER
for last week’s giveaway (chosen by random number) is:
Jeane
who wrote:
“ Moms are natural givers. They nurture, applaud, encourage, accept and love. I would love to win this fairy garden so my Mom and I can do it together. She lives with us and can no longer do a lot of things for herself, but I think she would enjoy tending a tiny garden. ”
Thanks again to everyone for participating!

... barn stories: through the rabbit hole
This baby rabbit shared it's
first moments
out of the nest several weeks ago.
Now it is time to discover the world outside the barn!
The little one has such fun darting in and out of the
hole under the barn door, each time going further out into the world then just as quickly back to safety.
Many adventures await... green grass for one.
Mom is still watching over... although perhaps a little frazzled at this point from all the back and forth...
Happy Mother's Day to all who provide this act and gift of watching over while their little ones venture out into the world!!

... garden update
Here are a  few new arrivals that have made their way into the native garden!  And while we are so enjoying this space, we've also begun to think about our vegetable plot.
Within the next couple weeks the temperatures at night will be above 50 degrees and the time for planting outdoors will be perfect.  There are so many wonderful veggies and flowers and herbs to choose from, it will definitely be a hard decision.  This list of the "Top 20 Plants for Kids" from our beloved copy of
Roots Shoots Buckets and Boots
is helping us to narrow it down:
Pumpkins ,
Sunflowers ,
Gourds ,
Corn ,
Berries ,
Hollyhocks ,
Carrots ,
Mimosa ,
Poppies ,
Tomatoes ,
Trees ,
Alliums ,
Potatoes ,
Woolly Lambs Ear ,
Four-o-Clocks ,
Evening Primroses ,
Radishes ,
Nasturtium ,
Moon Plant
(also known as Silver Dollars) and
Lemon Verbena .
Besides providing such a great list, the book also has wonderful explanations for why these plants made the cut as well as about a million gardening activities that we can't wait to try!
If you don't have outdoor space of your own but you've been dreaming about tomatoes and zucchini all spring,
this great site
lets you input your zip code to find the community garden closest to where you live!  And what' s better than a community garden?  Friends, food, sun and dirt... you just can't go wrong with that!
