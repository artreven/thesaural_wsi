NYT Friday 6/4/10 - Puzzle Taming
My result for this Friday
New York Times
crossword has to set a new end-of-week record for me: I haven't exactly been keeping a close eye on this, but my times for all such puzzles recently have seemingly been around the 25 minute mark. Today's 16 minuter is more typical for a Thursday.
I didn't sense I was getting off to a good start for the first couple of minutes, making few dents in the first dozen or so downs. But then I noticed 14-Across {Dangerous thing, supposedly}. I knew the referenced
Pope quotation
of old, as
Evelyn Waugh
borrowed from it for the title of his first (and only, it turned out) volume of autobiography
A Little Learning . As a proverb, Pope's sentiment is often rendered "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing", but I wasn't to be fooled.
Having this 15-letter answer made a huge difference and I generally feel there's more advantage in getting traction at the top of a grid than the bottom. I couldn't complete 17-Across immediately, but could see how it would end and so moved along to the NE corner in order to get the next pair of 15s going down.
From here I proceeded in a clockwise direction, never really pausing for a moment. The
Scotia Sea
at 60-Across was unfamiliar, so I was very glad to have done the work on
Alphabet
Soup
recently:
FCC
(55-Down) locked in the second letter of
Scotia , making me more comfortable with guessing
Bret Boone
for 51-Down.
Towards the end, I tackled the center and center-left more-or-less simultaneously, to deal with a smattering of answers I had to make educated guesses at: I'm not much of a
Mimosa
drinker and couldn't immediately think who the
Moran
was that gunned for Capone ... my best guess was law enforcement personnel - far from it!
One clue that I completely failed to understand was {Chair person?} at 15-Down. I was very careful to check every crossing, and was sure
tamer
had to be the answer, but still couldn't fathom why and had to just cross fingers on it. Googling "tamer" with "chair" reminded me that lion tamers are often caricatured as wielding chairs, but is this a common enough image to be referenced in a clue for just
tamer
(as opposed to
lion tamer )? From my point of view no, as the clue fell flat for me; but maybe I'm the odd one out here? Solving time: 16 mins ( solo, no solving aids )

39a
Sing a
{"I Can ___ Rainbow" (classic kids' tune)}.
I Can Sing a Rainbow
is a popular children's classic song written by Arthur
Hamilton. The song has been used to teach children names of colours. However, despite the name of the song, not all the colors mentioned
are actually colors of the
rainbow . Above is a clip of the song in a medley with
Love is Blue
by
the
Dells , which reached number 22 in the US pop charts in 1969.
The Doctor is
IN
14a
a little learning
{Dangerous thing, supposedly}. Reference to "A little learning is a dang'rous thing" - an oft-misquoted line from
Alexander Pope 's
Essay on Criticism .

Orel
{Oblast between Kursk and Tula}.
Orel
is an alternative spelling of
Oryol , a city and
oblast
(administrative district) in Russia.
42a
booze-up
{Brit's bender}. Americans don't have
booze-ups ? A booze-up is a
drinking spree , equivalent to a bender.
59a
EEE
{Oxford letters}.
EEE
= a wide
shoe size ,
Oxford
being a type of shoe.
15d
tamer
{Chair person?}. The image of a
lion tamer
using a chair for protection may have begun with
Clyde
Beatty
(1903-1965).
21d
mimosa
{It may create a buzz in the morning}. Referencing the
Mimosa cocktail , a brunch favorite.
28d
Lange
{"Tootsie" Oscar winner}. Not
Teri
Garr
for a change:
Jessica Lange
won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for playing the role of Julie Nichols in
Tootsie
(1982).

{It's superior to bohea}.
Pekoe
and
bohea

black
tea .

Image of the Day
34a
sumo
{Mawashi wearer's activity}. In
sumo , a
mawashi
( Japanese :
廻し )
is the belt that the
rikishi
(or sumo wrestler)
wears during training or in competition. For top,
sekitori , ranked professional
rikishi
it
is made of
silk
and comes in a variety of colors. It is approximately 30 feet (9.1 m)
in length when unwrapped, about two feet wide and weighs between eight
and eleven pounds. It is wrapped several times around the
rikishi
and fastened in the back by a large knot. A series of matching color,
stiffened silk fronds, called
sagari
are inserted into the front
of the
mawashi . Their number varies from 13 to 25, and is always an odd
number. If these fall out during competition the
gyoji
(or referee) will throw them from the
ring at the first opportunity.
Upper ranked professional
wrestlers wear a
keshō-mawashi
(see below) as part of the
ring entry ceremony or
dohyo-iri . This silk 'belt' opens out at one end into a large apron which is usually
heavily embroidered and with thick tassels at the bottom. The
keshō-mawashi
may advertise the produce of a sponsor of the
rikishi
(For example
Bulgarian
Ozeki
Kotooshu
is sponsored by a Japanese brand of
yogurt, "Bulgaria", which is prominently displayed on the front of his
keshō-mawashi )
or be a gift from one of the
rikishi 's support groups. Popular
rikishi
may be given many of these
keshō-mawashi .
