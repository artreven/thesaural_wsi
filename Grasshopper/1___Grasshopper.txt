Well maybe the creations are not truly cuddlesome, but they are cute and taxonometric fashion statements . Slightly more
enigmatic , the
Chameleon
does exhibit a flair for color. Ready to spring into action, the
Grasshopper
is more muted earthtones. These are from Monsuier
Vuitton’s
2011 press animal ( a.k.a.
“slick free advertising“) campaign. But I obviously browse backwater Vuitton Boutiques which were never visited by these window-worthy creations. CLICK the thumbnail to get close to the Grasshopper. Link back to the
originating post
for more details.
