THE END! … or is it?!
Thus concludes ARCH380! But there is still much to learn from all these different modeling programs, so I may be back from time to time to share what I have been playing with! You see a lot of amazing work done by people using the same software, it is my goal to one day be among those pros.
I’ve had fun in this class, and learned more than I had expected I would, I just wish I had taken this class earlier so I’d still have the chance to continue through the next computer courses available.
Architecture is my minor, to see some of my projects in Industrial Design check out our show!

W5: Grasshopper Parametric Truss (progress update)
Grasshopper
is a generative modeling plug-in for Rhino. There are many great
guides online
to help familiarize yourself with its interface and functions.
Here are my screenshots of progress as I followed our Parametric Truss tutorial:
first error occurred while trying to reparameterize the bottom curve,
I created 4 pipe components because I couldn’t remember how to attach multiple threads to the same input
what I have so far:

W4: Freeform Surfaces and Advanced Wireframes (progress update)
I was inspired by Colico Design’s Diva Chairs:
here’s a start on the seat of the chair, setting up the background and lighting angles,
three is better than one! testing different materials for rendering,

Getting ready for Rhino!
Rhinoceros 3D  (Rhino) is a stand-alone, commercial  NURBS -based 3D modeling tool, developed by Robert McNeel & Associates. The software is commonly used for industrial design, architecture, marine design, jewelry design, automotive design, CAD/ CAM, rapid prototyping, reverse engineering as well as the multimedia and graphic design industries.
Rhino specializes in free-form non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) modeling. There are several rendering plug-ins developed by McNeel:  Flamingo  ( raytrace ), Penguin (non-photorealistic), Bongo and Brazil (advanced). Over 100 third-party plug-ins are also available.
Like many modeling applications, Rhino also features a  scripting language , based on the  Visual Basic  language. Rhinoceros 3D gained its popularity in architectural design in part because of the  Grasshopper
plug-in (parametric modeling tool) for computational design.
Rhino’s increasing popularity is based on its diversity, multi-disciplinary functions, low learning-curve, relatively low cost, and its ability to import and export over 30 file formats, which allows Rhino to act also as a ‘converter’ tool between programs in a design workflow.

The Mac version of Rhino is in Beta stages but free to download! Keep an eye out because it’s being updated quite frequently:

W2: LayOut (Integrating 3D modeling, 2D drawing & diagramming)
SketchUp’s LayOut strikes me as an Architecture based InDesign program.
You can quickly import the models you’ve made in SketchUp and make dynamic changes, directly in LayOut, such as: the view (perspective, section, plan, zoom, pan) and rendering style (raster, vector, hybrid), to create a series of custom images for documentation. You can also apply drafting annotations, and many other useful features! LayOut is a huge time saver and overall a very good program for creating Architectural reports/documents.
Here are 3 screenshots of the LayOut document I made showing the results of Workshop1 :
