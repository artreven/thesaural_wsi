Chocolate Mint Cheesecake

I’d tell you what…
I am such a child of TV!!
On two different occasions, I heard/seen Mint Chocolate and now I have it in my head!
One was a
Wal-Mart
commerical talking about some mint chocolate ice cream. And the other was on an episode of “ The West Wing ” when CJ was in the bar ordering a
Grasshopper
(drink).
And not soon after that, I saw this recipe that I got for Chocolate Mint Cheesecake from Daily Inbox Newsletter!
So now I have to go to the store and buy the ingreditents to make these, get some ice cream and go somewhere to have a Grasshopper!! Damn you TV!!
