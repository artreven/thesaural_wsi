Serco Group – “the biggest company you’ve never heard of”
I’ve had long standing issues with Serco ever since I was a teenager (long and not particularly interesting story!) and, as I’ve got older, I’ve found the extent of their activity and its general opaqueness rather troubling. However until I happened to check the
Wikipedia
page I didn’t realise quite how much stuff they do:
