Boomerang Cocktail
Boomerang
Cocktail : The Impossible Drink I know, I know - the Boomerang is out of place alphabetically. With all of our
Bacio Punch Baby Shower
excitement over the weekend, I didn't get it posted on time. But better late than never! And without the Boomerang, I wouldn't have a cocktail to post today. In place of a cocktail last night, we worked our way through a pitcher of
Highland Gaelic Ale
at
Cinebarre
while
listening
to
Bobby Bland
(well, while watching the
Lincoln Lawyer ; six of one, half dozen of the other). Gin, Dry Vermouth, Angostura Bitters, Maraschino, Maraschino Cherry
Another reason to take my time with the Boomerang? It's impossible to make by using the recipe in the
Guide : Boomerang: 1 1/2 oz dry vermouth 1 dash Angostura bitters Stir with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass Variation: substitute rye whiskey for gin Wait, what? You know there's no way I'm going to drink a glass of vermouth and bitters, and where did the gin come from? According to the internet, the correct recipe should be something like: Boomerang: 2 oz gin 1/2 oz dry vermouth 2 dashes bitters 1/2 tsp maraschino liqueur 1 maraschino cherry ( www.1001cocktails.com ) That's a recipe I can work with! I mixed up our drinks (stirred, not shaken) and we enjoyed them out on the porch (remember back when we had sunshine?) Actually, 'enjoyed' is a stretch. The Boomerang pushed the limits of my vermouth tolerance and, while I was really looking forward to another cocktail in which I could use our
maraschino , I think the liqueur just deepened what I was reading as the musty vermouthy-ness of the drink. Maybe if I make it with with rye whiskey instead of gin? This is a cocktail that we might have to revisit as a Curtain Call.

Bourbon Cocktail
Bourbon
Cocktail : Bourbon, Curaçao, Benedictine, Lemon Juice, Angostura Bitters Bourbon, Orange Curaçao, Benedictine, Lime Juice So the Bourbon Cocktail is basically a
whiskey sour , with some curaçao and Benedictine added to the mix. And it's good! DP was reminded of the
Algonquin Cocktail , and I agree that the curaçao that brought out a tropical fruitiness just as the pineapple juice did in that drink. We're out of lemons, so I decided that lime juice would be an acceptable substitute. It's all citrus, right? (and I was too lazy to run out to the store - and it looked like it was about to rain). Lime juice always leaves me with a pulpy drink, but I think it worked well. The cocktail probably ended up more 'tart' than 'bright', but the citrus kept the Benedictine and curaçao from making things too sweet. All in all, a good choice for a semi-wintry evening at home!

Boston Bullet
Boston
Bullet : Gin, Dry Vermouth, Almond Stuffed Olive Gin, Dry Vermouth, Garlic Stuffed Olive The Boston Bullet is the first of the martini variations in the
Guide , and the recipe includes a history of the martini (e.g. people use less vermouth in martinis than they used to) and helpful hints (e.g. an open bottle of vermouth does not get better as it ages). The Guide uses a 10 to 1 ratio for martinis, so each of our drinks contained 2 1/2 ounces of gin and 1/4 ounce of dry vermouth. We used
Tanqueray
gin and our
Noilly Prat
dry vermouth. Make sure you like the gin that you use to make your martinis! When we ran out of our
Bombay Sapphire
a few days ago we started using Tanqueray, thinking that it would be a
little less junipery and a little better as a mixing gin. And it's true - I think that the juniper isn't as prominent in the Tanqueray. The downside? I think I kind of like juniper. Still, gin makes everything all right.
By the time I took my second sip, I was starting to enjoy this cocktail, and by the time we finished our drinks we were enjoying them so much that we failed to notice that the olives I'd plunked into them were stuffed with garlic instead of almonds. Surprise! DP thinks this means that we had
North End
Bullets instead of the more generic Boston Bullets, and I'll go along with that.

Boston Cocktail
Boston
Cocktail : Gin, Apricot Brandy, Grenadine, Lemon Juice, Twist of Lemon Peel
Gin, Apricot Brandy, Grenadine, Lemon Juice, Twist of Lemon Peel
Winter has returned, but not before DP brought some azaleas inside to remind us of spring. While this cold rain sticks around we'll be staying off the porch, but we do have our cocktails to keep us warm!
Ingredients:
1.5 oz Gin
1.5 oz Apricot Brandy
2 dashes Grenadine
1 tsp Lemon Juice
Directions:
Shake with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with a lemon twist.
The Boston Cocktail is a version of a drink we've had before...
It's basically a
Bermuda Cocktail , with lemon juice instead of lime. And, as with the Bermuda, it is an inoffensive drink. The gin is nicely tempered with the tropical flavor of the apricot brandy, and the grenadine sweetens things up - maybe too much? Maybe I should be looking for grenadines other than the
Rose's
off the shelf at Harris Teeter?
Doug Winship
says
homemade grenadine
is the way to go, and maybe he's right. Sounds like a great project!

Bacio Punch
Punch Party! And our first portable punch party, at that. We had skipped over the
Bacio
Punch
when it first appeared in the
Guide , but Fancypants let us bring punch to the baby shower she and Quintus Arrius were hosting, and we jumped at the chance. Gin, grapefruit juice, and champagne all seemed like perfect morning ingredients. Gin, Grapefruit Juice, Anisette, Club Soda, Champagne I had been looking forward to what I thought would a layered drink with some of my favorite flavors, but the anisette overwhelmed the grapefruit, and the gin didn't really add anything at all. I squeezed ruby-red grapefruits to make the juice, and they may have been too sweet. More acid would have helped to brighten the drink, and might have been a good foil for the champagne. I love love love Fancypants' Grandmother's punchbowl, not least because it made possible a second punch. DP had done some research on
EANABS (Equally Attractive Non Alcoholic Beverages)
and came across an outstanding
recipe
on
Epicurious
for a
Ginger Pineapple Sparkling Punch . Not too sweet, and not too pineapple-y, the ginger syrup provides a nice bite and the addition of a bit of leftover champagne in your glass elevates it even further. Such a good punch! It did the whole
EANAB
concept proud, and was definitely the most popular punch at the party. And speaking of parties, why hadn't anyone told me how awesome baby showers are? This was the first one I'd ever attended, but if I'd known that they were the sort of parties that end with people asking where their pants are, I would have insisted on getting invited a long time ago.

Charleston Photo in Place of a Cocktail
It feels a little bit chilly out there after the early-summer weather we've been having, but the roses don't seem to mind: Photo in Place of a Cocktail - The
Noisette
Rose Garden
at the
Gaillard Big weekend plans around these parts! Our friend Fancypants is hosting a baby shower, and we'll be bringing Bacio Punch (gin, anisette, grapefruit juice, club soda, champagne) and an EANAB. Can't wait! Other cocktails coming up in the
Guide
include the Boomerang (I'm going with gin, dry vermouth, and maraschino), the Boston Cocktail (gin, apricot brandy, grenadine, lemon juice), the Boston Cooler (light rum, lemon juice, club soda) and the Boston Sidecar (brandy,
light rum, Cointreau, lime juice).

Bosom Caresser Cocktail
Bosom
Caresser
Cocktail : Brandy, Madeira, Curaçao, Grenadine, Egg Yolk Brandy, Madeira, White Curaçao, Grenadine, Egg Yolk Great name. Terrible drink. I took my first sip thinking that this would be sort of an egg-noggy experience, but the combination of flavors pulled it in an unappetizing direction. I think it was the heavy sweetness from the madeira and the grenadine, combined with the thick mouthfeel from the egg yolk, that put this cocktail in the 'undrinkable' category for me. DP agreed; neither of us could finish the drink. Fortunately, we can always do a Curtain Call! The
Blanche
seemed like a good bet for a warm evening on the porch, and the icy-orangey-anisette soon erased the memory of the Bosom Caresser. Thank goodness!

Bossa Nova
Bossa
Nova : Dark Rum, Galliano, Apricot Brandy, Passionfruit Juice It's another outrageously gorgeous day out there! I don't know if it will get up to 90 degrees the way it did yesterday, but - if it does - you can't go wrong with a blender drink.
Monday night we had cocktails at
FIG
with friends visiting from out of town (love the ' Make Your Own Manhattan ' concept), but we're back on the porch now and I'm so glad that the
Guide
is in sync with the season. Dark Rum, Galliano, Apricot Brandy,
Bossa
Nova Organic Açaí with Passionfruit
The internet thinks that the Bossa Nova should be made with pineapple juice, but according to the Guide that's just a variation...
The true Bossa Nova should use passionfruit. We still had our "açaí juice with passionfruit" from Whole Foods on hand (and the brand is Bossa Nova; coincidence?) with enough available to make this juice-heavy cocktail. The
Galliano
(decidedly sweet) and a little bit of apricot brandy (always tropical) makes this a much less bitter drink than our other passionfruit concoction. I think that's a good thing; DP reads 'bitter' as 'refreshing', so he still prefers the
Borinquen . In any case, with all of that juice in the cocktail,you can convince yourself that you're having a health drink. And with early summer in the air, you'll definitely appreciate a glass of icy refreshment on the porch!

Bombay Cocktail
Bombay
Cocktail : Brandy, Sweet Vermouth, Dry Vermouth, Pernod, Orange Curaçao Brandy, Sweet Vermouth, Dry Vermouth, Pernod, Orange Curaçao It's been awhile since I've labeled a cocktail 'undrinkable'. DP and I had some disagreement about the Bombay Cocktail but, whatever our debate about the flavors in the glass, in the end it came down to the fact that I just couldn't finish the drink. And if that doesn't make it undrinkable, what does? The problem stemmed from the vermouth. I used the
Noilly Prat
for both the sweet and the dry, and normally the spicy notes from the sweet would overcome what I taste as the musty notes from the dry, but this time the vermouth just overpowered everything else. The recipe in the
Guide
makes a cocktail that is half vermouth, and that's just too much. DP could taste the anise from the Pernod with every sip he took, and felt that the orange curaçao enhanced the flavors of the sweet vermouth, but the licorice and orange were completely lost to me. I know, that just shows that I need to work on refining my palate, but the fact remains: the Bombay was a vermouth bomb in my mouth, and I'm not yet a fan of straight vermouth.

Borinquen Cocktail
Borinquen
Cocktail : Light Rum, Passionfruit Syrup, Lime Juice, Orange Juice, 151-Proof Rum Why 'Borinquen'? I'm guessing because of Puerto Rican rum - as we all know, Borinquen is what Puerto Ricans call their island, no doubt connecting back to the ancient Taino name* * thanks, DP and
wikipedia Light Rum,
Bossa Nova Organic Açaí with Passionfruit , Simple Syrup, Lime Juice, Orange Juice, Myers Dark Rum
Yes, I had to use some substitutes for this one. DP thought that Whole Foods might have the Passionfruit Syrup required for this drink, so we stopped off to look around yesterday on our way home from the beach (it was 80 degrees and gorgeous on the
Isle of Palms , but a little bit freaky; there was an end-of-the-world sort of low tide, and a beach-mime was running around). They didn't have any passionfruit syrup, so we went with the next best thing - açaí juice with passionfruit (fun fact: everything at Whole Foods contains Açaí). OK, I don't know if it was really the next best thing, but it was the only thing, and I decided it was an allowable substitution. Another allowable substitution? I decided that the teaspoon of 151-rum called for in the
Guide
could be replaced by a couple of teaspoons of Myers Dark Rum. If that ruined the integrity of the Borinquen, so be it. While I was busy with the blender, whipping up everything with a cup of ice, DP was busy putting together some snacks. Our dinner at
Cypress
was outstanding (the Crispy Pork Shoulder was out of this world) and the
Artisan Meat Share
we picked up in the morning is looking good. Pork Butter! I know the lamb bacon had some doubters last time around, but you have to love Pork Butter! And believe me, it's the perfect accompaniment for the Borinquen cocktail. The creamy mouth feel plays off the astringent (DP says 'refreshing') notes of the drink, and the passionfruit really comes through. If it weren't such a hassle to make, I would have blended a second batch when DP asked for it!

Such a beautiful day! It's 80 degrees; everything is in bloom; it's time to switch back from the regular to the iced coffee
at
Kudu . Hurrah! Photo in Place of a Cocktail -
Dogwood at the Joseph Manigault House I plan to try out the cocktails at
Cypress
with dinner tonight (and we'll be headed back tomorrow to pick up our March
Artisan Meat Share
- thanks again,
Cousin Lizzie !), and the cocktails that we'll be making soon at home include the Bombay (brandy, sweet vermouth, dry vermouth, pernod, orange curaçao), the Boomerang (I'm going to wing this one - the
Guide
has a typo, and doesn't include a complete recipe), the Borinquen (light rum, passionfruit syrup, lime juice, orange juice, 151-proof rum), the Bosom Caresser (ha!) (brandy, madeira, curaçao, grenadine, egg yolk), and the Bossa Nova (dark rum, Galliano, apricot brandy, passionfruit juice). Anybody know where I can find passionfruit syrup in Charleston?

Bolo Cocktail
Bolo
Cocktail : Light Rum, Orange Juice, Lemon Juice, Sugar Light Rum, Orange Juice, Lemon Juice, Simple Syrup This one is so good! And so simple - just 3 oz of rum (I know!) and the juice of half an orange and half a lemon. With a teaspoon of sugar to make sure things aren't too bitter. Unlike the Bolero, the rum in the Bolo never overpowers the drink. It's a refreshing, citrusy, ready-for-summer cocktail, and I loved it. I had squeezed a lot of juice out of the orange and the lemon, so we ended up with more than enough for seconds. And did we have seconds? Of course!

Boilermaker
Boilermaker : Whiskey, Beer Rye Whiskey, Beer It's a Boilermaker. What is there to say? You drink your shot of whiskey; you drink your beer. When the
Guide
talks about whiskey, it's talking about rye, and I've really come to like the taste. DP agrees - I think he would have been happy with the shot alone. And I think that would have been acceptable. I'm not convinced that it's a cocktail if there is no mixing involved; why not just focus on whichever ingredient you prefer? The beer ( Stone IPA ; San Diego, represent!)
worked well with the sushi we picked up for dinner. With the
excellent
sushi, I should say. Thanks,
ShiKi !

Bolero Cocktail
Bolero
Cocktail : Light Rum, Apple Brandy, Sweet Vermouth I hate to lose that hour of sleep, but I do like the way that we get more porch time once Daylight Savings Time begins! Light Rum, Applejack, Sweet Vermouth The Bolero Cocktail is stirred instead of shaken, and I think you can see it in the clarity of the drink. Things don't get all muddled up, and the glass just glows. It's a strong drink - mostly rum, with some smoky sweetness from the applejack and the sweet vermouth, and DP thought it tasted something like scotch. As soon as he said it, that's all I could taste as well - and that was OK. I like scotch. The odd thing was the way the Bolero finished. Unless a cocktail is truly undrinkable, it tends to grow on me; I may not always like the flavor in the beginning, but I usually come to appreciate it as the level in the glass gets lower. Not this time. There seemed to be a harsh, thin taste from the rum that came to take over the cocktail, and by the time I was done, I was really done. Seconds? No, thank you!

Bobby Burns Cocktail
Bobby
Burns
Cocktail : Scotch, Sweet Vermouth, Benedictine, Lemon Peel Scotch, Sweet Vermouth, Benedictine, Lemon Peel Equal parts scotch and sweet vermouth, with a dash or two of Benedictine to provide an herbal undertone (DP said he could taste it; I think that the flavors of the vermouth overwhelmed any Benedictine-ness for me). The most
controversial thing
about this cocktail seems to be the name; it's
Robert Burns , or Rabbie if you must, but never Bobby! In the words of a grandson of the original James Jacks, " it was my good fortune to be one of the younger members of a family where the genius and poetry of Burns were greatly appreciated ," and I felt very wicked drinking a Bobby Burns. That feeling turned out to be the most exciting thing about this cocktail. We won't be having it again.

Blue Lady
Blue
Lady : Blue Curaçao, Light Rum, Lemon Juice, Egg White
We're back! We snuck off to Savannah for a quick getaway, and it was great. I love Savannah. It always makes me realize how wonderful things are in Charleston.
And, speaking of travel, I was just out on the porch and saw the
first Southwest Airlines
plane in Charleston fly overhead. I'm expecting rock bottom prices to Las Vegas any day now!
Blue Curaçao, Light Rum, Lemon Juice, Egg White
As soon as we got home, we made the Blue Lady (well, after a trip to Publix to pick up some
Davidson’s Safest
Choice
egg). After shaking vigorously (five minutes!) I poured out the last of our Blue drinks. DP took a taste and nailed it in one: the Blue Lady is an
Acapulco Cocktail
with the orange flavor coming from curaçao instead of from triple sec.
Ingredients (Serves Two)
3 oz Blue Curaçao
1.5 oz Light Rum
1.5 oz Lemon Juice
1 Egg White
Directions:
Shake vigorously with ice and strain into chilled cocktail glasses.
It's a good drink - I like the bite from the lemon juice mixing it up with the sweet orange and the fumes from the rum, and I like the way that the egg white softens and sustains everything (without giving the drink too eggy a nose). The downside? Probably the sheer blue-ness of the cocktail. It may not come through in the photo, but the amount of blue curaçao really makes you wonder about the toxicity of the drink.
I don't think we'll have it again, but the Blue Lady really was a good way to finish up our blue drink saga!

Blue Moon Cocktail
Blue
Moon
Cocktail : Gin, Blue Curaçao
Gin, Blue Curaçao
This is a strong drink! The combination of piney gin and orangey curaçao really works for me - the two liquors play off of each other and enhance the overall experience. And I'm still loving that blue color.
Ingredients:
2 parts Gin
1 part Blue Curaçao
Directions:
Shake with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.
I guess that the original Blue Moon used
Creme Yvette
or
Creme de Violette ?
I think we have a bottle of Creme de Violette that we picked up at at
Total Wine &
More . A curtain call may be in order!

Blue Devil
Blue
Devil
Cocktail : Gin, Blue Curaçao, Lemon Juice, Maraschino
Gin, Blue Curaçao, Lemon Juice, Maraschino
So this is basically an
Aviation
cocktail , right? With the addition of some blue curaçao.
The
Aviation
is a drink that is more than having it's moment in the sun right now, but - for some reason - it was not included in the
Guide . The Blue Devil gave us our chance to give it (well, something like it) a try, and I have to say - it was amazing!
DP agreed 100% - and I swear we're not pushing this drink just because of Duke.
Ingredients:
1.5 oz Gin
3/4 tsp Blue Curaçao
3/4 oz Lemon Juice
1/2 oz Maraschino
Directions:
Shake with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.
The Blue Devil recipe in the Guide has a heavier hand with the gin than
most recipes online , but you know I'm OK with that. The lemon juice brightens and tarts everything up, and the maraschino liqueur has those complex notes that bind it all together. The blue curaçao adds some sweet orange to the citrus from the lemon, and taken as a whole this cocktail rings all the right bells.
So good!

Blue Angel
Blue
Angel
Cocktail : Blue Curaçao, Brandy, Parfait d'Amour, Cream, Lemon Juice
Blue Curaçao, Brandy, Parfait d'Amour, Cream, Lemon Juice
Sure, it's a little frou-frou, but the Blue Angel is worth whatever mockery you may have to endure.
The
Parfait d'Amour
came to us from
DrinkUpNY , although I'm pretty sure I've seen it in stores around Charleston. Apparently it's a liqueur with a
curaçao base , and you can definitely taste the orange. It's very delicate, though, and sweet - not something that will overwhelm the tastebuds
(or knock you onto the floor).
Ingredients:
1 part Blue Curaçao
1 part Brandy
1 part Parfait d'Amour
1 part Cream
1 dash Lemon Juice
Directions:
Shake with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.
Mixed with the Blue Curaçao, the orange becomes more prominent, and when you add in the cream and the lemon juice you have what is probably my favorite dessert flavor profile. The brandy just enriches the experience.
I love this drink! And, yes, I plan to have it again.

Blue Hawaiian Cocktail
Blue
Hawaiian
Cocktail : Light Rum, Blue Curaçao, Cointreau or Triple Sec, Cream, Coconut Cream
Monday night had been all about blue flames and volatile mixtures, and Tuesday night turned out to be all about liquids that are solid at room temperature.
The
Guide
is making me feel very science-y these days, and Snappy and
Grey stopped by last night to watch me at work in the lab.
Getting the coconut cream just right was the most complicated part of the Blue Hawaiian cocktail.
We purchased our can at
Harris Teeter
(in the cocktail condiment section;
coconut cream
is not the same as the
coconut milk ; less water), and when I opened it up it was absolutely solid. The label said to place the can in warm water if the contents had solidified (I thought I'd microwave it, but Snappy thought I should follow directions) and, after ten minutes or so of sitting in a saucepan that was slowly coming to a boil, things started to liquefy. Science! Grey rightly pointed out that I should get the can out of the water if I didn't want to end up with a hot cocktail, and I snatched it out in the nick of time.
Really, a lot of trouble to produce the 4 teaspoons of coconut cream that I needed to make drinks for everybody.
Ingredients:
2 oz Light Rum
1/2 oz Blue Curaçao
1/2 oz Cointreau
3/4 oz Cream
1 tsp Coconut Cream
Directions:
Shake with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.
Grey approved of the Guide's use of such a small quantity of coconut cream; he distrusts oils that are solid when they should be liquid. But according to
yesterday's New York Times , it's time to
rethink coconut oil . Bring it on, I say!
Two cocktail shakers were called into service, and I used Cointreau in one and Triple Sec in the other. DP and I each took a shaker and shook shook shook, and in both cases the drink looked the same. The taste? Very different!
The Triple Sec cocktail had a dairy taste from the (regular) cream - the citrus and coconut flavors were there, but the primary alcohol note was from the rum. The Cointreau cocktail, on the other hand, had a really nice orange depth. "Burnt and orange" was how Snappy described it. The Cointreau cocktail was the clear winner, and when I made a second batch (the coconut cream was still liquid!) it was Cointreau all the way.

Blue Blazer
Blue
Blazer
Cocktail : Rye Whiskey, Boiling Water, Honey, Lemon Peel I knew what ingredients would go into this drink; I just hadn't read the details that would have shown what goes into making it. Helpful hint: don't make this cocktail right before going to bed. Fire! Boiling Water! Metal mugs! The Blue Blazer seems to have been designed to create a disaster in the kitchen on a Monday night. After the Fire: Rye Whiskey, Water, Honey, Lemon Peel According to the
Guide :
Using 2 metal mugs, pour whiskey into one mug and dissolve sugar or honey in boiling water in the second mug. Ignite whiskey and while it blazes mix ingredients by pouring back and forth several times from one mug to the other... Garnish with a lemon peel. It just so happens that we were fresh out of metal mugs, so I put two cocktail shakers into service, filling one with honey and boiling water, and one with whiskey. I thought the whiskey was warm - it was room temperature! - but apparently it has to be
really
warm in order to get those fumes to ignite. DP knew this - he's had experience with plum pudding - and per his instructions I got things going by pouring boiling water into a saucepan and putting the cocktail shaker in there until the whiskey (I used rye) seemed volatile. Then came the excitement... Blue flames rose into the air! Cocktail shakers were juggled frantically from hand to hand! (those 'metal mugs' get really hot when you add boiling water). Hot liquid sloshed back and forth from shaker to shaker, across the counter and onto the floor! Somehow I managed to avoid burning myself, or lighting the house on fire, or spilling all of the drink, and we ended up with a really strong nightcap (rest assured - when you light six ounces of rye whiskey on fire, you get a lot of flame but not enough to burn off all of the alcohol). It's just as well that I didn't know how complicated (dangerous?) it would be to make Blue Blazer, and I can't believe that I didn't know the backstory...
It was the signature drink of
Jerry Thomas , the " father of American mixology ", and
it's all about the flame . Believe me, if I ever make this again, there will be pictures of the fire.
