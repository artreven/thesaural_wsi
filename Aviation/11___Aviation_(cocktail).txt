It's only a matter of time ...
... before I end up on this page -
SuperWiki 's gallery of
fan tattoos
inspired by
Supernatural.
Normally, my impulse for new ink is controlled by geography, since "my guy" is in Houston at
Shaw's .
Then I happened to notice that this piece was done by an artist in
Richmond .

It's a Stampede! Link Roundup - 2/14
I feel like they've been
teasing
us with this forever, but according to Variety ( via io9 ) its official.
We're getting a third Riddick movie.
As I've said before, line forms behind me.
Andrew Dansby considers
The Allman Brothers Band (Album Odyssey Part 18) , and the judicious application of 45 minute jams.
I don't need to pay my student loan this month, right?  Sallie Mae will understand that I needed this
Castiel Pony
instead.
So many
ponies
...
Although I might need this more.  I do love a spinner ring.

Herbert and Zelmyra Fisher were married on May 13, 1924.  That's 85 years.  Today they're answering relationship questions via twitter

I say if anyone is qualified to dispense advice, it would be these lovely people.
I think I have something in my eye ...

#Supernatural 5.14: My Bloody Valentine
It's a cross over event, as Sam and Dean must stop
Jeremy Piven
- made murderous by
mercury poisoning
- from
terrorizing
a small Pennsylvania mining town.  In 3D!!  Written by the always twisted and entertaining Ben Edlund.
This is the last new episode until March 25.  Yes, it's another Hellatus.  At least this will give me a chance to finally get caught up on
Dollhouse
recaps.
Promos and clips, after the jump, but first!
Season 5 debuts this week in the UK, and Living TV is
knocking it out
with the viral marketing campaign.  Tip o'the hat to
@SuperWik i for the heads up.  To wit:
image: Ivan Sazykin
The network has also positioned
emergency holy water and rock salt stations
throughout London.  In case of demons, break glass.  In theory.  Please do not take that as an endorsement for anarchy.  I'm hoping my friend
Candy Buffet
will be able to send me an eye witness report on these bits of awesomeness.
photo by nyaubaby
UPDATE!
Not content to sit back while all Hell breaks lose, Living TV has also sent teams out into the streets to protect an unsuspecting populace.
Take a page CW.   THIS
is how you do a marketing campaign.
Supernatural
airs Thursday at 9:00 pm EST on the CW.

It's just snowverkill
During the brief respite between the snowmageddon and the current snowfecta, the United States Park Police made an aerial assessment of the snow's impact on the DC area.
United States Park Police Rescue Technician/Paramedic Sergeant Klebaner (Aviation Section) photographed some of the patrol areas when United States Park Police Helicopter Eagle 1 made these flights on Sunday February 7, 2010. Some of the scenes you will see are the Potomac River Gorge and Great Falls, Georgetown in Washington, DC, Washington’s Reagan National Airport, the Jefferson Memorial, Arlington Cemetery, Mount Vernon, the Lincoln Memorial, the World War II Memorial, the Korean War Memorial, the approach to the United States Park Police Aviation hanger in Anacostia Park, United States Park Police Eagle 1 at the hanger, and a beautiful red fox running across the snow on Haines Point. Visit the
Park Police's web site
to check out the views.  Tip o'the hat to
Snowpocalypse
on FB.

The game's out there, and it's play or get played. That simple.
New Orleans is getting the David "The Wire" Simon treatment.  That being said:
Simon cautions that Treme will not be The Wire: New Orleans. Its seasons will not be loosely divided by subject, and the show will provide a smaller, more intimate focus on people picking up the pieces without much help. Simon went to one of the first post-Katrina second-line parades, and witnessed unbridled resiliency and a longing for home; many attendees drove in for the day from wherever they sought refuge from the storm. “The band started up and people were crying. It was like they realized, ‘Oh shit, this is what I’ve been away from,’“ he says. “They had come to do a four-hour second line, and then they got back in their cars to drive back to Baton Rouge or Atlanta or Houston.” The chronological series will explore life in New Orleans starting three months after Katrina devastated the city.   Treme is named after, but not based in, the city’s most historically significant and musically influential neighborhood.  Through the eyes of the people that live within its signature milieu of parades, jazz funerals, brass bands, Mardi Gras Indian tribes, bars and restaurants, the show will trace the city’s collective efforts to get back on its feet. “You’re going to watch the city being rebuilt, or not being rebuilt, year by year,” Simon says. “The whole thing is thematic to what New Orleans is, to what it represents in the American psyche. It’s an affirmation of why cities matter.”

Raise a glass to the #snowmageddon
If you're anywhere on the East Coast right now, the only color you see is white.
Blinding white.
If your local liquor store is still open -
mine is ! - any one of these
colorful cocktails
is well worth the trek through the tundra for ingredients.
Personally, I've been enjoying the pale lavender deliciousness of the
Aviation cocktail .  The creme de violette might be difficult to source - again, big ups to Pearson's - but it is essential.  It adds a floral hint that's a perfect balance to the nuttiness of the maraschino and the brightness of the lemon and gin.
tip o'the hat to punky and @bobbyhank!

#LOST Chat: LA X
After all the anticipation, last night's LOST premiere did not disappoint.  "It worked"!  Smokey!  Where's Christian! That actor returned!  And that one!  Juliet lives!  Oh, wait ... The Island is at the bottom of the ocean!  Alternate reality?  Lots of questions.
And how excited was I to finally see
Doug the Extra's
scene?  "Do you have anything to declare?  Only a murderer."  SQUEE!
We may not have answers yet, but the idle speculation and theory spinning is all part of the fun.  Come dive in with the first
Tubular live chat
of the season, today at 1:00 pm EST.
T has missed you too.
I know Benry, right?

#musicmonday: The Muppets two-fer
Therese at Tubular passed on the
exciting news
that
Flight of the Conchords
co-creator James Bobin
has signed on to direct a new Muppets movie, from a script by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller.
This actually sounds like it has the potential to be a winner.  Inspired lunacy and crazed whimsy are both a hallmark of the original Muppet Movies and FotC.  I wonder if he'll tap Brett and Jemaine to write the music?
You can either tip your hat, or blame T when these get stuck in your head for the rest of the day.

36 hours!
36 hours!
It's been a long brutal hiatus, and it's easy to get ... well, you know.  Fortunately, Therese at Tubular has compiled all of the significant episodes and moments from Seasons 1 - 5 in the  LOST Rewatch Lite .
And if you still have questions,  she has answers.   Who's Christian?
Would a
visual aid
help explain things?
John Cabrera
is the awesome.
Maybe a nice interactive chart to help keep track of all the characters off-island connections?
