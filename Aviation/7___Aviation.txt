Where is Jimmy" Hoffa ?
James Riddle "Jimmy" Hoffa
(born February 14, 1913 – disappeared July 30, 1975,
declared legally dead
July 30, 1982 [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) was an
American
labor union
leader and author.
Hoffa was involved with the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters
union, as an
organizer
from 1932 to 1975. He served as the union's General President from 1958
to 1971. He secured the first national agreement for teamsters' rates
in 1964, and played a major role in the growth and development of the
union, which eventually became the largest single union in the United
States, with over 1.5 million members during his terms as its leader.
Hoffa, who had been convicted of
jury tampering , attempted
bribery , and
fraud
in 1964, was imprisoned in 1967, sentenced to 13 years, after
exhausting the appeal process. However, he did not officially resign the
Teamsters' presidency until mid-1971. This was part of a
pardon
agreement with U.S. president
Richard Nixon ,
in order to facilitate Hoffa's release from prison in late 1971. Nixon
blocked Hoffa from union activities until 1980; Hoffa was attempting to
overturn this order and to regain support. He was last seen in late July
1975, outside a suburban
Detroit
restaurant called the Machus Red Fox. [ 3 ]

Vista or Windows 7 .... they both stink
My wife has a vista laptop, I just bought a Windows 7 net book and neither will connect properly to my XP printer on the network. I am not a smart guy and there may be a way to do it, but for the common person it will be a nightmare to figure it out. I would just like to tell Bill Gates "thanks for nothing Bill". If its not broke don't fix it !

Wiley
Post
Post was born in
Grand Saline, Texas
(Van Zandt County), to farmer parents William Francis and Mae Quinlan
Post, but his family moved to Oklahoma when he was five. His aviation
career began at age 26 as a parachutist for a flying circus,
Burrell Tibbs and His Texas Topnotch Fliers,
and he became well known on the
barnstorming
circuit. On October 1, 1926, an oil field accident cost him his left
eye, but he used the settlement money to buy his first aircraft. Around
this time, he met fellow Oklahoman Will Rogers when he flew Rogers to a
rodeo, and the two eventually became close friends. Post was the
personal pilot of wealthy Oklahoma oilmen Powell Briscoe and F.C. Hall
in 1930 when Hall bought a high-wing, single-engine Lockheed Vega, one
of the most famous record-breaking aircraft of the early 1930s. The
oilman nicknamed it, the
Winnie Mae,
after his daughter, and Post achieved his first national prominence in it by winning the National Air Race Derby, from
Los Angeles
to
Chicago .
The fuselage was inscribed, "Los Angeles to Chicago 9 hrs. 8 min. 2
sec. August 27, 1930." Adam Charles Williams finished second with a time
of 9 hrs. 9 min. 4 sec. Read more

Jason Coleman
I just received an email from Floyd Cramer's Son-in-law and I wanted to pass the information he included on to you. It seems that some of the ivory that was so much
imbedded
into Floyd's fingers has been passed down to his Grandson, Jason Coleman. Jason has a
Web Page
that is promoting
The Legacy of Floyd Cramer Concert Tour
starting in September. Please visit Jason's page for more information www.jasoncolemanmusic.com While there please play the video to see/hear a sample of Jason's talent.

Floyd Cramer
While I'm thinking about old performers, Here is another one of my favorites: Floyd Cramer
(October 27, 1933 – December 31, 1997) was an
American
Hall of Fame
pianist
who was one of the architects of the " Nashville Sound ." He popularized the
'slip note' piano style where one note slides effortlessly into the
next. This was a major departure from the percussive piano style which
was popular in the late 1950s.
Born in
Shreveport ,
Louisiana ,
Cramer grew up in the small town of
Huttig ,
Arkansas , teaching himself to play the
piano . After
finishing high school, he returned to Shreveport, where he worked as a
pianist
for the
Louisiana Hayride radio show . After Cramer relocated permanently
to
Nashville ,
Allen "Puddler" Harris , a
native of
Franklin Parish
in
northeastern Louisiana, replaced him as the pianist for the Hayride.

The Late Great Patsy Cline
It started with a 5 tube A M radio with a dark brown wood case. This radio belonged to my brother and when he was away I tuned across the dial to hear the sounds of WSM, WLW, WOWO, and others. One of my favorite singers was Patsy Cline. I loved her songs and do till this day, but I didn't really know of her life. With a few clicks at Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, told all. Below is the first few paragraphs. Read the full article at
Wikipedia . There are most of her hit songs placed on
YouTube , just do a search to find them. Here is one of her best: Patsy Cline (September 8, 1932 – March 5, 1963), born Virginia Patterson Hensley, was an American
country music singer who enjoyed pop music crossover success during the era of the Nashville sound in the early 1960s. Since her death at age 30 in a 1963 private airplane crash at the height of her career, she has been considered one of the most influential, successful and acclaimed female vocalists of the 20th century. Cline was best known for her rich tone and emotionally expressive bold contralto voice,[1] which, along with her role as a mover and shaker in the country music industry, has been cited as an inspiration by many vocalists of various music genres. Her life and career have been the subject of numerous books, movies, documentaries, articles and stage plays. Her hits included "Walkin' After Midnight", "I Fall to Pieces", "She's Got You", "Crazy" and "Sweet Dreams". Posthumously, millions of her albums have sold over the past 50 years and she has been given numerous awards, which have given her an iconic status with some fans similar to that of legends Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley. Ten years after her death, she became the first female solo artist inducted to the Country Music Hall of Fame.
