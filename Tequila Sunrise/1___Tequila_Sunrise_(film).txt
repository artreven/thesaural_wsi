AT THE BEGINNING OF GIBSON'S FANTASTIC APOCOLYTICA FILM
Already discredited for their theatrics, Jewish anti-Semitic
screamers attack Mel Gibson, hoping to destroy his Hollywood film career.
Outrageous predictions that Americans would begin terrorizing Jews were shouted
loudly by Semitic loud-mouths like Abe Foxman, the over-paid leader of the
anti-Free Speech ADL which is attempting to destroy first amendment rights for
non-Jews and is lobbying American law-makers to make certain statements covered
by the Constitution as illegal hate speech.
The question has been asked, who is really expressing hate
speech here, the Jews themselves or honest Americans who don't care one hoot
about the ADL's views but are just trying to honestly communicate their personal
views?
The winner so far in this has been Mel Gibson whose films
continue to be successful despite the hate spewed against him by Jewish
propaganda machine leaders.

Crusade Against Mel
Gibson Stamped, Sealed and Delivered by the New World Order
Jurriaan Maessen, Infowars.com, July 10, 2010,
ORIGINAL SOURCE:
http://iquestionauthority.wordpress.com/2010/07/11/whats-really-behind-the-mel-gibson-witchhunt/
Actor and director Mel Gibson, currently under fire by the entire
mainstream media for alleged misdoings, just happens to be the very best
man in Hollywood fighting tyranny with such outstanding works as
Braveheart, The Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto — all of them
examples of how storytelling at its core signifies both the story itself
and an allegory of the age-old, everlasting struggle of freedom-loving
people against the darkening clouds of tyranny.
The mainstream media meanwhile is abuzz with voices denouncing Mel
Gibson. Self-declared “voice of the left” Arianna Huffington today even  argued
for a revival of non-existent “Hollywood values” and for Gibson to be
burned at the stake:
“(…) Now is the time”, screams Huffington, “for Hollywood to show
what those values really are by making Gibson pay the price for his
bigotry and intolerance.”
Just like in the days of J. Edgar Hoover, when every important person
both inside and outside Hollywood had the dubious honor of reserved
blackmail-space in the FBI-director’s desk, the arrows have now been
directed at Gibson, not for anything he might have done mind you, but
rather with the aim of stopping the man from capturing audiences around
the world with any more influential films about freedom versus tyranny.
In other words: the current “controversy” serves to hinder the filmmaker
from doing his job. In an age where many filmmakers, sniffing it up in
the bathroom, are instruments for the New World Order by producing
predictive programming to audiences everywhere, the crusade launched
against Gibson should raise all thinking people’s eyebrows.
Remember the  Playboy-interview
from July of 1995 , where Gibson identified the power behind
the throne with stunning accuracy. With the conversation turning towards
then-president of the United States, Bill Clinton, Gibson suggested that
he was obviously groomed for the job early on in his career.
“Do you really believe that?”, asked the surprised interviewer (which
he shouldn’t be), to which Gibson replied:
“I really believe that. He was a
Rhodes scholar, right? Just like Bob Hawke. Do you know what a Rhodes
scholar is? Cecil Rhodes established the Rhodes scholarship for those
young men and women who want to strive for a new world order. Have you
heard that before? George Bush? CIA? Really, it’s Marxism, but it just
doesn’t call itself that. Karl had the right idea, but he was too
forward about saying what it was. Get power but don’t admit to it. Do it
by stealth. There’s a whole trend of Rhodes scholars who will be
politicians around the world.”
Flabbergasted by his words, the interviewer retreaded to the mantra
of the numb and the ignorant when confronted with a sudden outburst of
truth:
“This certainly sounds like a paranoid sense of world history. You
must be quite an assassination buff.”
Gibson: “Oh, f***. A lot of these guys pulled a boner.
There’s something to do with the
Federal Reserve that Lincoln did, Kennedy did and Reagan tried. I can’t
remember what it was, my dad told me about it. Everyone who did this
particular thing that would have fixed the economy got undone. Anyway,
I’ll end up dead if I keep talking s***.”
Not dead, thank God. Although the New World Order is pulling all the
stops to make sure his career will be.
Mel Gibson Biography
SOURCE:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Gibson
Mel Colm-Cille Gerard Gibson ,
AO
(born January 3, 1956) is an actor, film director, producer and
screenwriter. Born in
Peekskill, New York , Gibson moved with his parents to
Sydney ,
Australia
when he was 12
years old and later studied acting at the Australian
National Institute of Dramatic Art .
After appearing in the
Mad
Max
and
Lethal
Weapon
series, Gibson went on to direct and star in the
Academy Award -winning
Braveheart . In
2004, he directed and produced
The Passion of
the Christ , a controversial, yet successful, film portraying the last
hours in the life of
Jesus Christ . Outside his career, remarks by Gibson have generated
accusations of
homophobia ,
antisemitism ,
racism , and
misogyny ; he has previously
attributed the statements to his battle with
alcoholism .
Early life
Gibson was born in
Peekskill, New York , the sixth of 11 children, and the second son of
Hutton Gibson
and
Irish -born
Anne Patricia (née Reilly, died 1990). [2] [3]
His paternal grandmother was the Australian opera soprano,
Eva Mylott
(1875–1920). [4]
One of Gibson's younger brothers,
Donal ,
is also an actor. Gibson's first name comes from
Saint Mel , fifth-century Irish saint, and founder of Gibson's mother's
native
diocese ,
Ardagh , while his second name,
Colm-Cille , [5]
is also shared by an Irish saint [6]
and is the name of the parish in
County Longford
where
Gibson's mother was born and raised. Because of his mother, Gibson holds dual
Irish and American citizenship. [7]
Soon after being awarded
$ 145,000 in a work-related-injury lawsuit against
New York
Central Railroad
on February 14, 1968, Hutton Gibson relocated his family to
West Pymble , Sydney, Australia. [8]
Gibson was 12 years old at the time. The move to Hutton's mother's native
Australia was for economic reasons, and because Hutton thought the
Australian Defence Forces
would reject his oldest son for the
draft
during the
Vietnam
War . [9]
Gibson was educated by members of the
Congregation of Christian Brothers
at
St. Leo's Catholic College
in
Wahroonga , New South Wales, during his high school years. [10] [11]
Career
Gibson gained very favorable notices from film critics when he first entered
the cinematic scene, as well as comparisons to several classic movie stars. In
1982,
Vincent Canby
wrote that “Mr. Gibson recalls the young
Steve McQueen ... I
can't define "star quality," but whatever it is, Mr. Gibson has it.” [12]
Gibson has also been likened to “a combination
Clark Gable
and
Humphrey Bogart .” [13]
Gibson's roles in the "Mad Max" series of films,
Peter Weir 's
Gallipoli , and the "Lethal Weapon" series of films earned him the label
of "action hero". [14]
Later, Gibson expanded into a variety of acting projects including human dramas
such as
Hamlet , and
comedic roles such as those in
Maverick
and
What Women Want . He expanded beyond acting into directing and producing,
with:
The Man
Without a Face , in 1993;
Braveheart , in 1995;
The Passion
of the Christ , in 2004; and
Apocalypto , in 2006.
Jess Cagle of
Time
has compared Gibson to
Cary Grant ,
Sean Connery , and
Robert Redford . [14]
Connery once suggested Gibson should play the next
James Bond
to Connery's
M . Gibson turned down the role, reportedly because he feared being
typecast . [15]
Stage
Gibson studied at the
National Institute of Dramatic Art
(NIDA) in Sydney. The students at NIDA
were
classically
trained in the British-theater tradition rather than in
preparation for
screen
acting. [16]
As students, Gibson and actress
Judy Davis
played the
leads
in
Romeo and Juliet ,
and Gibson played the role of
Queen Titania
in an
experimental
production of
A Midsummer
Night's Dream . [17]
After graduation in 1977, [18]
Gibson immediately began work on the filming of
Mad Max , but continued to
work as a
stage
actor, and joined the
State Theatre Company of South Australia
in
Adelaide . Gibson’s
theatrical credits include the character
Estragon
(opposite
Geoffrey Rush ) in
Waiting for Godot ,
and the role of
Biff Loman
in a 1982 production of
Death of a Salesman
in Sydney. Gibson’s most recent theatrical performance, opposite
Sissy Spacek , was the
1993 production of
Love Letters
by
A.
R. Gurney , in
Telluride, Colorado . [19]
Australian
television and cinema
While a student at
NIDA , Gibson made his film debut in the 1977 film
Summer City , for
which he was paid $400. [20]
Gibson then played the title character in the film
Mad Max
(1979). He was
paid $15000 for this role. [20]
Shortly after making the film he did a season with the
South Australian Theatre Company . During this period he shared a $30 a week
apartment in
Adelaide
with his future wife Robyn. After
Mad Max
Gibson also played
a mentally slow youth in the film
Tim . [21]
During this period Gibson also appeared in Australian television series guest
roles. He appeared in serial
The Sullivans
as
naval lieutenant Ray Henderson, [22]
in
police procedural
Cop Shop , [21]
and in the pilot episode of prison serial
Punishment
which was produced in 1980, screened 1981. [23] [24]
Gibson joined the cast of the
World War II
action film
Attack Force Z ,
which was not released until 1982 when Gibson had become a bigger star. Director
Peter Weir
cast Gibson as
one of the leads in the critically acclaimed
World War I
drama
Gallipoli , which earned Gibson another Best Actor Award from the
Australian Film
Institute . [25]
The film
Gallipoli
also helped to earn Gibson the reputation of a serious,
versatile actor and gained him the Hollywood agent
Ed Limato . The sequel
Mad Max 2
was his first
hit in America (released as
The Road Warrior ). In 1982 Gibson again
attracted critical acclaim in
Peter Weir ’s romantic thriller
The Year
of Living Dangerously . Following a year hiatus from film acting after
the birth of his twin sons, Gibson took on the role of
Fletcher Christian
in
The Bounty
in
1984. Playing
Max
Rockatansky
for the third time in
Mad Max Beyond
Thunderdome , in 1985, earned Gibson his first million dollar salary. [26]
Hollywood
Early Hollywood years
Mel Gibson's first American film was
Mark Rydell ’s 1984 drama
The River , in which he and
Sissy Spacek
played
struggling
Tennessee
farmers. Gibson then starred in the gothic romance
Mrs. Soffel
for
Australian director
Gillian Armstrong . He and
Matthew Modine
played
condemned convict brothers opposite
Diane Keaton
as the
warden's wife who visits them to read the
Bible . In 1985, after working
on four films in a row, Gibson took almost two years off at his Australian
cattle station . [27]
He returned to play the role of
Martin Riggs
in
Lethal Weapon , a
film which helped to cement his status as a Hollywood "leading man". [28]
Gibson's next film was
Robert Towne ’s
Tequila Sunrise , followed by
Lethal Weapon 2 ,
in 1989. Gibson next starred in three films back-to-back:
Bird on a Wire ,
Air America , and
Hamlet ; all were released in 1990.
1990s
During the 1990s, Gibson alternated between commercial and personal projects.
His films in the first half of the decade were
Forever Young ,
Lethal Weapon 3 ,
Maverick , and
Braveheart . He then starred in
Ransom ,
Conspiracy Theory ,
Lethal Weapon 4 ,
and
Payback . Gibson also served as the speaking and singing voice of
John Smith
in
Disney ’s
Pocahontas .
After 2000
In 2000, Gibson acted in three films that each grossed over $100 million:
The Patriot ,
Chicken Run , and
What Women Want . [14]
In 2002, Gibson appeared in the
Vietnam War
drama
We Were Soldiers
and
M. Night Shyamalan ’s
Signs , which became the highest-grossing film of Gibson’s acting career. [29]
While promoting
Signs , Gibson said that he no longer wanted to be a movie star and would
only act in film again if the script were truly extraordinary. In 2010, Gibson
appeared in
Edge of Darkness , which marked his first starring role since 2002 [30]
and was an adaptation of the BBC miniseries,
Edge of Darkness . [31]
In 2010, following an outburst at his ex-girlfriend that was made public, Gibson
was dropped from the talent agency of
William Morris
Endeavor . [32]
Producer
Main article:
Icon
Productions
After his success in Hollywood with the
Lethal Weapon
series, Gibson began to move into producing and directing. With partner
Bruce Davey , Gibson
formed
Icon Productions
in 1989 in order to make
Hamlet . [33]
In addition to producing or co-producing many of Gibson's own star vehicles,
Icon has turned out many other small films, ranging from
Immortal Beloved
to
An Ideal Husband . Gibson has taken supporting roles in some of these
films, such as
The Million
Dollar Hotel
and
The Singing Detective . Gibson has also produced a number of projects for
television, including a biopic on
The Three Stooges
and the 2008
PBS
documentary
Carrier . Icon has grown from being just a production company to also be
an international distribution company and film exhibitor in Australia and New
Zealand. [34]
Director
Mel Gibson has credited his directors, particularly
George Miller ,
Peter Weir ,
and
Richard Donner ,
with teaching him the craft of filmmaking and influencing him as a director.
According to
Robert
Downey, Jr. , studio executives encouraged Gibson in 1989 to try directing,
an idea he rebuffed at the time. [35]
Gibson made his directorial debut in 1993 with
The Man Without a
Face , followed two years later by
Braveheart , which
earned Gibson the
Academy
Award for Best Director . Gibson had long planned to direct a remake of
Fahrenheit 451 , but in 1999 the project was indefinitely postponed
because of scheduling conflicts. [36]
Gibson was scheduled to direct
Robert Downey, Jr.
in a Los Angeles stage production of
Hamlet
in January 2001,
but Downey's drug relapse ended the project. [37]
In 2002, while promoting
We Were Soldiers
and
Signs
to the press, Gibson mentioned that he was planning to pare back
on acting and return to directing. [38]
In September 2002, Gibson announced that he would direct a film called
The Passion
in
Aramaic
and
Latin
with no
subtitles because he hoped to "transcend language barriers with filmic
storytelling." [39]
In 2004, he released the controversial film
The Passion of
the Christ , with subtitles, which he co-wrote, co-produced, and
directed. The film went on to become the highest grossing rated R film of all
time with $370,782,930 in U.S. box office sales. [40]
Gibson directed a few episodes of
Complete Savages
for the
ABC
network. In 2006, he directed the action-adventure film
Apocalypto , his second
film to feature sparse dialogue in a non-English language.
Honors
On July 25, 1997, Gibson was named an honorary
Officer of the Order of Australia
(AO), in recognition of his "service to
the Australian film industry". The award was honorary because substantive awards
are made only to Australian citizens. [41] [42]
In 1985, Gibson was named " The
Sexiest Man Alive " by
People , the first person to be named so. [43]
Gibson quietly declined the
Chevalier des Arts et Lettres
from the French government in 1995 as a
protest against France's resumption of nuclear testing in the Southwest Pacific. [44]
Time
magazine chose Mel Gibson and Michael Moore as
Men of the Year
in 2004, but Gibson turned down the photo session and
interview, and the cover went instead to
George W. Bush . [45]
Landmark films
Mad Max
series
Main article:
Mad Max
Gibson got his breakthrough role as the leather-clad post-apocalyptic
survivor in
George Miller 's
Mad Max .
The independently financed blockbuster helped to make him an international star
everywhere but in the United States, where the actors' Australian accents were
dubbed with American accents. [46]
The original film spawned two sequels:
Mad Max 2
(known in
North America as
The Road Warrior ), and
Mad Max 3
(known in North America as
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome ).
A fourth movie,
Mad Max 4: Fury Road , is in development, but both Gibson and
George Miller
have indicated that the starring role would go to a younger
actor. [47]
Gallipoli
Main article:
Gallipoli (1981)
Gibson played the role of the cynical Frank Dunne alongside co-star
Mark Lee
in the 1981
Peter
Weir
film.
Gallipoli
is about several young men from rural
Western Australia
who enlist in the
Australian Army
during the First World War. They are sent to
Turkey , where they take part
in the
Gallipoli
Campaign . During the course of the movie, the young men slowly lose their
innocence about the purpose of war. The climax of the movie occurs on the
ANZAC
battlefield at
Gallipoli
and depicts the brutal attack at
the Nek . According to Gibson, “ Gallipoli
was the birth of a nation. It was the shattering of a dream for Australia. They
had banded together to fight the Hun and died by the thousands in a dirty little
trench war." [48] [ verification

The critically acclaimed film helped to further launch
Gibson's career. [49]
He won the award for
Best Actor in a Leading Role
from the
Australian Film
Institute . [25]
The Year of
Living Dangerously
Main article:
The
Year of Living Dangerously
Gibson played a naïve but ambitious journalist opposite
Sigourney Weaver
and
Linda Hunt
in
Peter Weir ’s atmospheric
1982 film
The Year
of Living Dangerously , based on the novel of the same name by
Christopher Koch .
The movie was both a critical and commercial success, and the upcoming
Australian actor was heavily marketed by
MGM
studio. In his review of the film, Vincent Canby of the
New York Times
wrote, "If this film doesn't make an international star of
Mr. Gibson, then nothing will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the
screen presence." [50]
According to John Hiscock of
The Daily Telegraph ,
the film did, indeed, establish Gibson as an international talent. [51]
Gibson was initially reluctant to accept the role of Guy Hamilton. "I didn't
necessarily see my role as a great challenge. My character was, like the film
suggests, a puppet. And I went with that. It wasn't some star thing, even though
they advertised it that way." [52]
Gibson saw some similarities between himself and the character of Guy. "He's not
a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature and he has some rough edges and I
guess you could say the same for me." [13]
Gibson has cited this screen performance as his personal favorite. [ when? ]
The Bounty
Main article:
The Bounty
Gibson followed the footsteps of
Errol Flynn ,
Clark Gable , and
Marlon Brando
by
starring as
Fletcher
Christian
in a cinematic retelling of the
mutiny on the Bounty .
The resulting 1984 film
The
Bounty
is considered to be the most historically accurate version.
However, Gibson thinks that the film's revisionism did not go far enough. He
stated that his character should have been portrayed as more of a villain and
described
Anthony Hopkins 's
performance as
William
Bligh
as the best aspect of the film. [52]
Lethal Weapon
series
Main article:
Lethal
Weapon
Gibson moved into more mainstream commercial filmmaking with the popular
buddy cop
Lethal Weapon
series, which began with the 1987 original.
In the films he played
LAPD
Detective
Martin
Riggs , a recently widowed
Vietnam
veteran with a death wish and a penchant for violence and gunplay. In the films,
he is partnered with a reserved family man named
Roger Murtaugh
( Danny
Glover ). Following the success of
Lethal Weapon ,
director
Richard Donner
and principal cast revisited the characters in three sequels,
Lethal Weapon 2
(1989),
Lethal Weapon
3
(1993), and
Lethal Weapon 4
(1998). With its fourth installment, the
Lethal
Weapon
series embodied "the quintessence of the
buddy cop pic ". [53]
Hamlet
Main article:
Hamlet (1990 film)
Gibson made the unusual transition from the action to classical genres,
playing the melancholic Danish prince in
Franco Zeffirelli 's
Hamlet . Gibson was cast alongside such experienced
Shakespearean
actors as
Ian
Holm ,
Alan Bates , and
Paul Scofield . He
described working with his fellow cast members as similar to being "thrown into
the ring with
Mike Tyson ". [54]
Braveheart
Main article:
Braveheart
Mel Gibson directed, produced, and starred in
Braveheart , an epic
telling of the legend of Sir
William Wallace , a
13th century Scottish patriot. Gibson received two
Academy Awards ,
Best Director
and
Best Picture
for his second directorial effort. In winning the Academy Award
for Best Director, Gibson became only the sixth actor-turned-filmmaker to do so. [55]
Braveheart
influenced the Scottish nationalist movement and helped to revive the film genre
of the historical epic. The
Battle of
Stirling Bridge
sequence in
Braveheart
is
considered by critics to be one of the all-time best directed battle scenes. [56]
The Passion of
the Christ
Main article:
The Passion
of the Christ
Gibson directed, produced, co-wrote, and self-funded the 2004 film
The Passion of
the Christ ,
which chronicled the
passion
and death of Jesus Christ. The cast spoke the languages of
Aramaic ,
Latin , and
Hebrew . Although Gibson originally announced his intention to release the
film without subtitles; he relented on this point for theatrical exhibition. The
highly controversial film sparked divergent reviews, ranging from high praise to
criticism of the violence and charges of antisemitism. Gibson also sparked
controversy with his statements regarding
New York Times
writer
Frank Rich , "I want to
kill him. I want his intestines on a stick.... I want to kill his dog" in
response to Rich's suggestion that the film could fuel antisemitism. [57] [58]
The movie grossed
US$ 611,899,420 worldwide and $370,782,930 in the US alone, [59]
surpassing any motion picture starring Gibson. [60]
In US box offices, it became the eighth (at the time) highest-grossing film in
history [61]
and the highest-grossing
rated R
film of all time. [62]
The film was nominated for three
Academy Awards [63]
and won the
People's Choice Award
for Favorite Dramatic Motion Picture. [64]
Apocalypto
Main article:
Apocalypto
Gibson received further critical acclaim for his directing of the 2006
action-adventure film
Apocalypto . [65]
Gibson's fourth directorial effort is set in
Mesoamerica
during the
early 16th century against the turbulent
end times
of a
Maya civilization .
The sparse dialogue is spoken in the
Yucatec
Maya
language by a cast of
Native American
descent. [66] [67]
Future films
In March 2007, Gibson told a screening audience that he was preparing another
script with
Farhad Safinia
about the writing of the
Oxford English
Dictionary
(OED). [68]
Gibson's company has long owned the rights to
The Professor and the Madman , which tells the story of the creation of
the OED. [69]
Gibson has dismissed the rumors that he is considering directing a film about
Spanish explorer
Vasco Núñez de Balboa . [70] [71] [72]
Asked in September 2007 if he planned to return to acting and specifically to
action roles, Gibson said: "I think I’m too old for that, but you never know. I
just like telling stories. Entertainment is valid and I guess I’ll probably do
it again before it's over. You know, do something that people won’t get mad with
me for." [73]
In 2005, the film
Sam and George
was announced as the seventh
collaboration between director
Richard Donner
and
Gibson. In February 2009, Donner said that this
Paramount
project was “dead,” [74]
but that he and Gibson were planning another film based on an original script by
Brian Helgeland
for
production in fall 2009. [75]
It was reported, in 2009, that Gibson would star in
The Beaver , a film directed by former
Maverick
co-star,
Jodie Foster . [76]
He has also expressed an intention to direct a movie set during the
Viking Age , starring
Leonardo DiCaprio .
The as-yet untitled film, like
The Passion of the Christ
and
Apocalypto , will feature dialogue in period languages. [77]
However, some sources have speculated that DiCaprio might opt out of the
project. [78]
In June 2010, Gibson was in
Brownsville, Texas ,
filming scenes for another movie, tentatively titled
How I Spent My Summer
Vacation , about a career criminal put in a tough prison in Mexico. [79]
In October 2010, it was reported that Gibson would have a small role in
The Hangover: Part
II , [80]
but he was removed from the film after the cast and crew objected to his
involvement. [81]

(July

Family
Gibson met Robyn Denise Moore in the late 1970s soon after filming
Mad Max
when they were
both tenants at a house in
Adelaide . At the time, Robyn was a dental nurse and Mel was an unknown actor
working for the
South Australian Theatre Company . [82]
On June 7, 1980, they were married in a Catholic church in
Forestville,
New South Wales
and she became known as Robyn Gibson. [83]
The couple have one daughter, six sons, and two grandchildren. [84]
After 26 years of marriage, the couple separated in August 2006. [85]
Nearly three years after the separation began, Robyn filed for divorce on April
13, 2009, citing irreconcilable differences. In a joint statement, the Gibsons
declared, "Throughout our marriage and separation we have always strived to
maintain the privacy and integrity of our family and will continue to do so." [5]
The divorce filing followed the March 2009 release of photographs appearing to
show him on a beach embracing another woman. [86]
On April 28, 2009, Gibson made a red carpet appearance with
Oksana Grigorieva ,
a
Russian
pianist
and an artist on
Gibson's record label. Grigorieva has a son (born 1997) with actor
Timothy Dalton . [87]
Grigorieva gave birth to Gibson's daughter Lucia on October 30, 2009. [88] [89]
In April 2010, it was made public that Gibson and Grigorieva had split. [90]
On June 21, 2010, Grigorieva filed a restraining order against Gibson to keep
him away from her and their child. The restraining order was modified the next
day regarding Gibson's contact with their child. [91]
Gibson obtained a restraining order against Grigorieva on June 25, 2010. [91] [92]
In response to claims by Grigorieva that an incident of domestic violence
occurred in January 2010, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department launched a
domestic violence investigation in July 2010. [93] [94]
Investments
Gibson is a property investor, with multiple properties in
Malibu , California, several locations in
Costa Rica , a private
island in
Fiji
and properties in
Australia. [95] [96]
In December 2004, Gibson sold his 300-acre (1.2 km 2 ) Australian farm
in the
Kiewa Valley
for $6 million. [97]
Also in December 2004, Gibson purchased
Mago Island
in Fiji from
Tokyu Corporation
of Japan for $15 million. Descendants of the original native inhabitants of
Mago, who were displaced in the 1860s, have protested the purchase. Gibson
stated it was his intention to retain the pristine environment of the
undeveloped island. [98]
In early 2005, he sold his 45,000-acre (180 km 2 )
Montana
ranch to a neighbor. [99]
In April 2007 he purchased a 400-acre (1.6 km 2 ) ranch in
Costa Rica
for $26
million, and in July 2007 he sold his 76-acre (310,000 m 2 ) Tudor
estate in
Connecticut
(which he purchased in 1994 for $9 million) for $40 million to an unnamed buyer. [100]
Also that month, he sold a
Malibu
property for $30 million that he had purchased for $24 million two
years before. [101]
In 2008, he purchased the
Malibu
home of
David
Duchovny
and
Téa Leoni . [102]
Religious and
political views
Faith
Gibson was raised a
Traditionalist
Catholic . [9]
When asked about the Catholic doctrine of " Extra
Ecclesiam nulla salus ", Gibson replied, "There is no salvation for those
outside the Church ... I believe it. Put it this way. My wife is a saint. She's
a much better person than I am. Honestly. She's... Episcopalian, Church of
England. She prays, she believes in God, she knows Jesus, she believes in that
stuff. And it's just not fair if she doesn't make it, she's better than I am.
But that is a pronouncement from the chair. I go with it." [57] [103]
When he was asked whether
John 14:6
is an intolerant position, he said that "through the
merits
of Jesus' sacrifice... even people who don't know Jesus are able to
be saved, but
through
him." [104]
Acquaintance Father
William
Fulco
has said that Gibson denies neither the
Pope
nor
Vatican II . [105]
Gibson told
Diane Sawyer
that he believes non-Catholics and non-Christians can go to heaven. [106] [107]
Gibson's traditionalist Catholic beliefs have been the target of criticism,
especially during the controversy over his film
The Passion of the Christ .
Gibson stated in the Diane Sawyer interview that he feels that his "human rights
were violated" by the often vitriolic attacks on his person, his family, and his
religious beliefs which were sparked by
The Passion . [106]
Politics
Gibson has been described as “ultraconservative”. [108]
Gibson complimented filmmaker
Michael Moore
and his
documentary
Fahrenheit
9/11
when he and Moore were recognized at the 2005
People's Choice
Awards . [109]
Gibson's
Icon
Productions
originally agreed to finance Moore's film, but later sold the
rights to
Miramax Films .
Moore said that his agent
Ari
Emanuel
claimed that "top Republicans" called Mel Gibson to tell him, "don’t
expect to get more invitations to the White House". [110]
Icon's spokesman dismissed this story, saying "We never run from a controversy.
You'd have to be out of your mind to think that of the company that just put out
The Passion
of the Christ ." [111]
In a July 1995 interview with
Playboy
magazine, Gibson
said President
Bill Clinton
was a "low-level opportunist" and someone was "telling him what to do". He said
that the
Rhodes
Scholarship
was established for young men and women who want to strive for a
" new
world order " and this was a campaign for Marxism. [112]
Gibson later backed away from such conspiracy theories saying, "It was like:
'Hey, tell us a conspiracy'... so I laid out this thing, and suddenly, it was
like I was talking the gospel truth, espousing all this political shit like I
believed in it." [113]
In the same 1995
Playboy
interview, Gibson argued that men and women are
unequal as a reason against women priests. [112] [114] [115]
In 2004, he publicly spoke out against taxpayer-funded
embryonic
stem-cell research
that involves the cloning and destruction of human
embryos. [116]
In March 2005, he condemned the outcome of the
Terri Schiavo case ,
referring to Schiavo's death as "state-sanctioned murder". [117]
Gibson questioned the
Iraq
War
in March 2004. [118]
In 2006, Gibson said that the "fearmongering" depicted in his film
Apocalypto
"reminds me a little of President Bush and his guys." [108]
Allegations
Homophobia
Main article:
Braveheart#Accusations of anti-gay depictions
The
Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation
(GLAAD) accused Gibson of
homophobia after a December 1991 interview in the
Spanish
newspaper
El País
in which he
made derogatory comments about
homosexuals . [115] [119]
Gibson later defended his comments [119]
and rejected calls to apologise. [112]
However, Gibson joined GLAAD in hosting 10
lesbian
and
gay
filmmakers for an on-location
seminar on the set of the movie
Conspiracy Theory
in January 1997. [120]
In 1999 when asked about the comments to
El País , Gibson said, "I
shouldn't have said it, but I was tickling a bit of
vodka
during that interview,
and the quote came back to bite me on the ass." [113]
Sexism and
domestic violence
In July 2010, it was alleged that Gibson had been recorded during a phone
call with Oksana Grigorieva suggesting that if she got " raped
by a pack of
niggers ," she would be to blame. [121] [122] [123] [124]
Gibson was barred from coming near Grigorieva or her daughter due to a
domestic violence -related
restraining order . [121]
The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has launched a domestic violence
investigation against Gibson. [94]
Gibson's estranged wife, Robyn Gibson, has filed a court statement declaring
that she never experienced any abuse from Gibson, [125]
while
forensic
experts have questioned the validity of some of the tapes. [126]
In March 2011, Mel Gibson agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor battery
charge. [127]
Racism
On July 8, 2010, Gibson was alleged to have made a racial slur against
Latinos
using the term " wetbacks "
as he suggested turning in one of his employees to immigration authorities. [128]
On July 9, 2010, some audio recordings alleged to be of Gibson were posted on
the internet. [128]
The same day Gibson was dropped by his agency, William Morris Endeavor. [128]
The July 2010 reports of voice-mail recordings also included alleged racist
remarks offending
African-Americans , with Gibson using the word " niggers ". [121]
Civil rights
activists commented that Gibson had shown patterns of racism,
sexism and anti-Semitism and called for a boycott of Gibson's movies. [129]
In December 2010,
Winona
Ryder
claimed in an interview with
GQ
magazine that at a party in 1995, Gibson made "a really horrible gay
joke", and then attacked her as "an oven-dodger" — a comment which at the time
she did not understand. [130]
Anti-semitism in
The Passion of the Christ
Main article:
The Passion of the Christ#Allegations_of_anti-Semitism
Gibson's 2004 film
The Passion of the Christ
sparked a fierce debate
over alleged anti-semitic imagery and overtones. Gibson denied that the film was
anti-semitic, but critics remained divided. Some agreed that the film was
consistent with the
Gospels
and traditional Catholic teachings, while others argued that it
reflected a selective reading of the Gospels. [131]
Alcohol abuse
Gibson has said that he started drinking at the age of thirteen. [132]
In a 2002 interview about his time at
NIDA , Gibson said, "I had really good highs but some very low lows. I found
out recently I'm
manic depressive ." [133]
Gibson was banned from driving in Ontario for three months in 1984, after
rear-ending a car in Toronto while under the influence of alcohol. [134]
He retreated to his Australian farm for over a year to recover, but he continued
to struggle with drinking. Despite this problem, Gibson gained a reputation in
Hollywood for professionalism and punctuality such that
Lethal Weapon 2
director
Richard Donner
was shocked when Gibson confided that he was drinking five pints of beer for
breakfast. [106]
Reflecting in 2003 and 2004, Gibson said that despair in his mid-30s led him to
contemplate suicide, and he meditated on Christ's Passion to heal his wounds. [103] [106] [135]
He took more time off acting in 1991 and sought professional help. [136]
That year, Gibson's attorneys were unsuccessful at blocking the
Sunday Mirror
from publishing what Gibson shared at
AA
meetings. [137] [ clarification
needed ]
In 1992, Gibson provided financial support to Hollywood's
Recovery Center, saying, "Alcoholism is something that runs in my family. It's
something that's close to me. People do come back from it, and it's a miracle." [138]
DUI
incident with antisemitic remarks
Main article:
Mel Gibson DUI incident
On July 28, 2006, Gibson was arrested for
driving under
the influence
(DUI) while speeding in his vehicle with an open container of
alcohol. A leaked report revealed that during Gibson's July 28, 2006 arrest for
driving under the influence he made anti-semitic remarks to arresting officer
James Mee, who is Jewish, saying "Fucking Jews...the Jews are responsible for
all the wars in the world." [139] [140]
Gibson issued two apologies for the incident through his publicist, [141] [142]
and in a later interview with Diane Sawyer, he affirmed the accuracy of the
quotations. [143]
He admitted to making anti-semitic remarks during his arrest and apologized for
his "despicable" behavior, saying the comments were "blurted out in a moment of
insanity" [144]
and asked to meet with Jewish leaders to help him "discern the appropriate path
for healing." [145]
After Gibson's arrest, his publicist said he had entered a recovery program to
battle alcoholism. On August 17, 2006, Gibson pleaded no contest to a
misdemeanor drunken-driving charge and was sentenced to three years on
probation. [144]
He was ordered to attend self-help meetings five times a week for four and a
half months and three times a week for the remainder of the first year of his
probation. He was also ordered to attend a First Offenders Program, was fined
$1,300, and his license was restricted for 90 days. [144]
At a May 2007 progress hearing, Gibson was praised for his compliance with
the terms of his probation and his extensive participation in a self-help
program beyond what was required. [146]
Prankster
Gibson has a reputation for practical jokes, puns,
Stooge -inspired physical comedy, and doing outrageous things to shock
people. As a director he sometimes breaks the tension on set by having his
actors perform serious scenes wearing a red clown nose. [147]
Helena Bonham Carter ,
who appeared alongside him in
Hamlet , said of him, "He has a very basic sense of humor. It's a bit
lavatorial and not very sophisticated." [148]
During the filming of
Hamlet , Gibson would relieve pressure on the set by
mooning
the cast and crew,
directly following a serious scene. [149]
In addition to inserting several homages to the
Three Stooges
in his
Lethal Weapon
movies, Gibson produced a 2000 television movie about the comedy group which
starred
Michael Chiklis
as
Curly Howard . As a
gag [ citation
needed ] , Gibson inserted a single frame of himself smoking a
cigarette into the 2005 teaser trailer of
Apocalypto . [150]
Philanthropy
Gibson at the Christmas party for charity Mending Kids in 2007. His
former wife Robyn is president of the charity.
Gibson and his former wife have contributed a substantial amount of money to
various charities, one of which is Healing the Children. According to Cris
Embleton, one of the founders, the Gibsons gave millions to provide lifesaving
medical treatment to needy children worldwide. [151] [152]
They also supported the restoration of
Renaissance artwork [153]
and gave millions of dollars to NIDA. [154]
Gibson donated $500,000 to the
El
Mirador Basin
Project to protect the last tract of virgin rain forest in
Central America and to fund archeological excavations in the "cradle of Mayan
civilization." [155]
In July 2007, Gibson again visited Central America to make arrangements for
donations to the indigenous population. Gibson met with
Costa Rican
President
Óscar Arias
to
discuss how to "channel the funds." [156]
During the same month, Gibson pledged to give financial assistance to a
Malaysian company named Green Rubber Global for a tire recycling factory located
in
Gallup, New Mexico . [157]
While on a business trip to Singapore in September 2007, Gibson donated to a
local charity for children with chronic and terminal illnesses. [158]

"Mel Gibson, Circa 1992, "Refuses to Apologize to Gays"."
San
Francisco Bay Times . August 17, 2006. Quote: Asked what he thought
of gay people, he said, "They take it up the ass." Gibson then proceeded
to point at his posterior and said: "This is only for taking a shit."
When reminded that he had worked closely with gay people at drama
school, Gibson said, "They were good people, kind, I like them. But
their thing is not my thing." When the interviewer asked if Gibson was
afraid that people would think he is gay because he's an actor, Gibson
replied, "Do I sound like a homosexual? Do I talk like them? Do I move
like them? What happens is when you're an actor, they stick that label
on you."
