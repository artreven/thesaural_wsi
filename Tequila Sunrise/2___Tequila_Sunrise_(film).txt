ANDY TAYLOR
Andy Taylor
(born 16 February 1961) is an
English
guitarist ,
singer , and
songwriter , best known as a member of
Duran Duran
and
The Power Station . He has also performed as a solo artist, and served as a
record producer
for
C.C.Catch
and several other artists.
He was born and raised in
Cullercoats ,
Tyne and Wear , North East England, and attended
Marden High School . He began playing guitar at the age of eleven, and was soon playing with local bands, even producing one at the age of sixteen. He dropped out of school early to tour England and Europe with several different bands, playing working men's clubs and air force bases.
Duran Duran and Power Station
Taylor joined Duran Duran in 1980 (easily the most experienced musician in the band), and enjoyed their rise to fame over the next five years. He married Tracey Wilson, one of Duran Duran's hairstylists, in 1982. The couple have four children. Taylor invested his royalties in real estate, and once owned a wine bar in
Whitley Bay
named "Rio" after one of Duran Duran's biggest hit singles and albums.
In the mid eighties Taylor grew dissatisfied with the band's keyboard-heavy
synth pop , however, and longed to stretch out his rock muscles. During a hiatus in Duran's schedule, he joined forces with bassist
John Taylor ,
Chic
drummer
Tony Thompson , and singer
Robert Palmer
to create the band
The Power Station , which had three hit singles and played the
Live Aid
concert in 1985. The band was a distinct break from the
New Romantic
Duran Duran material as they pursued a hard-rock music style.
Taylor would later rejoin Power Station bandmates Palmer and Thompson for Palmer's first solo album since the band's formation. The resulting album,
Riptide
proved to be a massive success for Palmer.
After The Power Station, Taylor allowed Duran Duran to believe he would be returning to record a new album, even as he was signing contracts for a solo career in
Los Angeles . Another Capitol Records group,
Missing Persons , was disbanding at the same time, and Andy hired
Terry Bozzio
and
Patrick O'Hearn
to work with him. This caused ex-Missing Persons guitarist
Warren Cuccurullo
to approach Duran Duran to fill Andy's position -- a vacancy no one in Duran Duran knew existed. Eventually Duran Duran sued Taylor to force him in to the studio to complete the album
Notorious , but he ended up playing on only a few tracks before departing the band completely. He later countersued to claim some of the royalties from that album.
Solo career
In the meantime, Andy Taylor hooked up with ex- Sex Pistols
guitarist
Steve Jones
and recorded the hit single "Take It Easy" (US #24), which was used as the theme song to the movie
American Anthem . Ex-Missing Persons members
Terry Bozzio
and
Patrick O'Hearn
lent drums and bass, respectively, to the song and video. Two other songs by Taylor/Jones also appeared on the album: "Wings of Love" and the instrumental "Angel Eyes". Andy Taylor also contributed to the
Miami Vice II
soundtrack with the song "When The Rain Comes Down" (US #73). This was followed by his first solo album,
Thunder
(1987). O'Hearn again played bass for him on the album and during the following tour.
Taylor also contributed a cover of "Dead on the Money" to the
Tequila Sunrise
soundtrack in 1988. Taylor's former band Duran Duran would also allow one of their own songs, " Do You Believe In Shame? " to be included on the album. Also in 1988, Andy helped produce Rod Stewart's album "Out of Order" along with Chic members Bernard Edwards and Tony Thompson.
A second solo album, this one consisting of entirely
cover versions , entitled
Dangerous , was released in 1990.
Taylor played as a
backing musician
for several other stars, including
Belinda Carlisle
(on her single "Mad About You"),
Robert Palmer ,
Rod Stewart ,
C.C.Catch
and
Thunder . He then moved on to producing full time, working with several moderately successful bands throughout the 1990s.
His most recent venture is the album "Burger Kingdom" which was recorded at his Ibiza studio in April 2008.
His new band consists of the following members:
Andy Taylor - Guitar & Vocal
Liam Keenan - Vocals & Piano
Joe Breban - Drums
Miky Dunn
- Bass
Reunions
Taylor participated in the 1996 reunion of The Power Station, and in 2001 reunited with the other original members of Duran Duran to record their first new music together since 1985. Their ensuing album,
Astronaut , featured a blend of Taylor's heavy guitar with the synth hooks of the classic Duran Duran sound.
In 2006, Taylor again parted ways with
Duran Duran , leaving the band a second time, in the middle of the recording of
Reportage , which was scrapped by the band after his departure. More recently, Taylor strongly hinted in his blogs that Duran Duran's management company, Magus Entertainment, were partly responsible for his departure.
This was confirmed on the 4th of May 2008 when (following legal action) The Sunday Times(UK) printed the following retraction -
"Andy Taylor
An article about Duran Duran (Wild boys always shine, Culture, November 4, 2007), referring to Andy Taylor's departure, said he had failed to turn up for a recording session in New York and had sent a "blunt message . . . that he was leaving the band, with immediate effect". It was suggested that his departure was "still unexplained". Andy Taylor's departure from the band is the subject of continuing legal proceedings, but we wish to make clear that he was unable to get a US working visa to attend the New York recording session because of administrative failures by the band's management. His departure was not unexplained and he did not leave the band — the Duran Duran partnership was dissolved by the other members. We apologise and are happy to correct the record."

Taylor also wrote in his autobiography that in addition to the problems recording
Reportage , old conflicts between Nick Rhodes and Simon LeBon resurfaced. He also suggests that he was suffering from clinical depression during that period, following the death of his father.
Andy Taylor Studios Ibiza
Work on Andy Taylor Studios Ibiza (ATSI) was completed in 2006, a state of the art recording facility in
Ibiza . In 2007 Taylor created three MySpace profiles and an official website to showcase the new music he has recorded with singer
Liam Keenan . Tracks from artists which Taylor has produced are also featured, including
Hungover Stuntmen ,
Sonny J Mason ,
Juke
and
Veil Cassini
RockAffairs
Founded in November 2007 and launched in April 2008, Taylor provided the seed money and helped co-found RockAffairs.com, a website developed to allow unsigned artists to sell MP3s, sell merchandise, promote their band and keep 100% of the profit. It also pioneers a new Profit Share Scheme where 100% of income from listener signups is distributed amongst bands who sign up for the profit share scheme.
In June 2008, Taylor handed control of the company over to Sarah Eaglesfield, former webmistress at duranduran.com.
"Wild Boy: My Life In Duran Duran"
On September 9th, 2008, an autobiography by Andy Taylor was released. It covers a backstage look of Duran Duran's rise, an album by album look at how the band became synonymous with early MTV, the drug and alcohol habits of the band, and delves into Taylor's other works, both solo and with other artists, such as his bandmates in The Power Station, Steve Jones and even Rod Stewart. Above all else, it is Taylor's own accounts of his life, from the strong family ties raised in him by his father and extended family to the experiences of starting a family of his own with his wife Tracey.
Personal life
Andy Taylor married his long-time girlfriend, Tracey Wilson, in 1982. They have four children, Andrew James, born August 20, 1984; Georgina, born August 12, 1987; Bethany, born in September 1991; and Isabelle, born in May 1996.
