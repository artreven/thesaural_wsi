Josh & Alyssa Wedding ‚ÄúSave the Date‚Äù Postcard

Case studies
My fianc√©e Alyssa and I are not typical when it comes to our wedding planning. For one thing, we‚Äôre getting married at an unconventional venue, the
Los Angeles Natural History Museum . Moreover, we both work in design, and there‚Äôs no chance in heck that we‚Äôd buy any prepackaged save-the-dates or invitations. No sir. So we‚Äôve spent the better part of the year planning out how our wedding will look, from the d√©cor to the communications, and the first component of this gigantic undertaking is the ‚ÄúSave the Date‚Äù postcard that you see before you.

We want our wedding to feel like a party. Not just any party, mind you; more like a 1960s-concert-in-the-park-meets-prehistoric-hipster-safari. Or something like that. We‚Äôve been scouting inspiration from far and wide, and one of the first ideas that hit us was to create a ‚Äúgig poster‚Äù or a vintage-style handbill to inform our potential guests of the basic logistics in advance of the invitation. I‚Äôve designed a whole bunch of save-the-date postcards for Gallatin at NYU (as you can see on the
portfolio ), but this was obviously a lot more personal. We decided it would be an adventure to silkscreen the invitations ourselves using the ‚Äúsplit fountain‚Äù technique. It was a popular method of decoration for old concert or boxing posters, but it was usually used in the background to create a bright, colorful gradient on which black type would be set and printed on a letterpress. To stick with the theme, I used a combination of different type and lettering styles, some of which mimic the rough letterpress style of printers like
Hatch Show Print
in Nashville and
Colby Poster Printing Co.
here in Los Angeles. Other lettering comes from
House‚Äôs Photo-Lettering
site, such as the ‚ÄúSave the Date‚Äù script at the top. We referenced old show prints as well as movie posters (for the ‚ÄúDino Vision‚Äù logo, a pretty blatant rip of the
Cinerama
logo and the
Sinclair
dinosaur mark. For the central silhouette illustration, we combined vector traces of two photographs taken by our good friend
Sakura Koontz .
The process was remarkably smooth. We‚Äôd both done some screenprinting on t-shirts before, but neither of us had any hands-on experience with serigraphy on paper. The stock we chose is
French Paper‚Äôs Mod-Tone in gray , which comes with a pre-printed pattern. We designed the card to be printed without bleed, 2-up on an 8.5‚Ä≥ by 11‚Ä≥ letter-sized page, allowing us to make a very simple cut and end up with a finished product. (We printed the back side on the cheap using inkjet). Using a Photoshop mockup of the design, we determined that Pantone Orange and Rubine Red would make a nice, yummy ‚Äú Tequila Sunrise ‚Äù gradient. Our comp wasn‚Äôt far off the mark, but the real-life result was
far
better than the digital version. Before we knew it, we‚Äôd printed up about 150 of them. The right side of the screen had some imperfections in the emulsion which led to some interesting artifacts, while the left side was nearly perfect. I think the variation between different prints is one of the beautiful and lively aspects of hand-printed serigraphs. So even though we sacrifice a bit of legibility, I think we‚Äôve really hit the mark with our attempt at creating a vintage, imperfect look.
Tune in

now to see what we do with

These are beautiful and hilarious ‚Äî I love the idea of doing even the printing by hand.
And OMG, that gradient has, like, NO banding! What is it, 128-bit color? üòõ
