Sauza Silver Tequila
Filed Under:
Food and Drink Share: Facebook 2 Twitter 0 Google+ 0 LinkedIn 0 Pinterest 7 I don’t like tequila; the smell of it turns my stomach.
But I’m always willing to try something new so when one of Sauza’s lovely PR mavens sent me the Valentine’s Day chocolate margarita
recipe , I asked if they might be able to send me a sample of the Sauza Silver.
The Sauza Silver tequila isn’t overpowering. It has a faint tequila taste to it but more than anything, it tastes and smells sweet…almost fruity. Even straight, the tequila didn’t have a ton of bite that demanded to be washed down and away by a chaser.
I kept my sampling simple by mixing the Sauza Silver with orange juice to make a poor man’s
Tequila Sunrise . Yeah, that was tasty.
If I had the ingredients, I would have made the
Strawberry Sauza Rita . Maybe you can make it and let me know how it is?
Strawberry Sauza Rita
Ingredients:
1 Can of Frozen Limeade
1 Can of Champagne
2/3 Can of Sauza ® Silver Tequila
1/3 Can of DeKuyper ® Strawberry Liqueur
1 Can of Water
Preparation:
Pour limeade into pitcher with ice. Fill limeade can with champagne and pour into pitcher. Then fill limeade can 2/3 with Sauza Silver Tequila and 1/3 with DeKuyper Strawberry and pour in. Finally add a can of water, stir and serve over ice.
Note: Use the can of the limeade to measure the other ingredients.
