Baha Taco - Rye
One of the places recommended to me by a Rye local on starting my new job was Baha Taco.
"Is it OK for kids?" I asked..."Yep, absolutely," was the answer.
So off we tootled, no bookings, no problems.
As we have smalls we dine at the astonishingly early hour of 6. And we get in, we get out. I'd like to say 'no mess, no fuss' but that's a complete lie.  On this occasion we left a trail of nachos crumbs outlining a highchair.  Which didn't seem to phase Baha Taco one bit...bonus points.
Good things: decent menu, interesting drinks, quick service (a must have for dining with the smalls). Baha Taco also have a couple of massive tables if you were having a group dinner AND a LIVE MUSIC stage.
real deal Mexican soft drinks...pretty darn tasty
We think we might go back for a 'date night' and some live music....have you seen anyone play at Baha Taco?

Frankston Savers
I've decided to take matters into my own hands and give Frankston a bit of love.  Lots of Mount Martha love...notsomuch Frankston....poor Frankston....
Today I'm 'bigging up' Frankston
Savers . Now...I reckon this would be one of the major drawcards for Frankston.  Everyone
knows
the hipsters have found Brunswick Savers but Frankston involves a daytrip so there is a lot more 'gold' for the discerning local.
I'd say my best finds have been books and glassware although I would emphasise the Frankston Savers pricing regime is totally bonkers.  Having said that, all these glasses were under $2 each but I'm sure you'd find a box of them for a fiver at your local church trash 'n' treasure.
Today is hot and that calls for drinks recipes also:
Lillet
& Soda
(so you can pretend you are in the French Riviera when you are actually in the Frang).
One third Lillet to two parts soda.  Hells, you can also have it neat over ice but I'm promoting responsible drinking.  You can get fancy pants and put flowers in your icecubes if you want to.  See below for a serving suggestion (naked man swizzle stick completely optional). Orange wheels are cool too.  You can also use Lillet to make a James Bond style martini called a
Vesper . Which sounds very sexy and sophistimicated.
You can get Lillet from the bottle-o in Mount Eliza (Camel? Majestic Cellars? Can't remember). I think it's about $36 a bottle.
Clearly any glass with a ship in full sail requires a rum based drink.  I've lifted this recipe from
The Cocktail
by Jane Rocca and illustrated by Kat MacLeod.  If you don't have it, you need it. This drink is beneficial in staving off scurvy (it's all that fruit juice....right?)
Rum Runner
60ml Havana Club rum
80ml pineapple juice
50ml passionfruit juice
a wheel of lime and wedge of pineapple to garnish
Shake it up, shake it up, shake it up and then strain it into your oo aar sailor glass, garnish with fruit salad, recline on banana lounge.
